      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5885">The '''absence of good''' ({{lang-la|privatio boni}}) is a [[theology|theological]] [[doctrine]] that evil, unlike good, is insubstantial, so that thinking of it as an entity is misleading. Instead, evil is rather the absence or lack ("[[privation]]") of good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=A Summa of the Summa|year=1990|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0898703174|editor=Peter Kreeft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Menssen|first=Sandra|title=The Agnostic Inquirer|year=2007|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Pub.|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0802803946|author2=Thomas D Sullivan|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teichman|first=Jenny|page=45|title=Philosophy : A Beginners Guide|year=1999|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|isbn=063121321X|author2=Katherine C Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically attributed to [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], who wrote:
{{quote|And in the universe, even that which is called evil, when it is regulated and put in its own place, only enhances our admiration of the good; for we enjoy and value the good more when we compare it with the evil. For the Almighty God, who, as even the heathen acknowledge, has supreme power over all things, being Himself supremely good, would never permit the existence of anything evil among His works, if He were not so omnipotent and good that He can bring good even out of evil. For what is that which we call evil but the absence of good? In the bodies of animals, disease and wounds mean nothing but the absence of health; for when a cure is effected, that does not mean that the evils which were present—namely, the diseases and wounds—go away from the body and dwell elsewhere: they altogether cease to exist; for the wound or disease is not a substance, but a defect in the fleshly substance,—the flesh itself being a substance, and therefore something good, of which those evils—that is, privations of the good which we call health—are accidents. Just in the same way, what are called vices in the soul are nothing but privations of natural good. And when they are cured, they are not transferred elsewhere: when they cease to exist in the healthy soul, they cannot exist anywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustine|title=Enchridion|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf103.iv.ii.xiii.html|chapter=What is Called Evil in the Universe is But the Absence of Good.|accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

See also:  "For evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name “evil.”" (In: [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_I/Volume_II/City_of_God/Book_XI/Chapter_9 The City of God, XI, chapter 9])

Perceptions are based on contrast, so that [[light]] and dark, good and evil, are imperceptible without each other; in this context, these sets of opposites show a certain [[symmetry]], but a basic study of optics teaches us that light has a physical presence of its own, whereas darkness does not: no "anti-[[lamp (fixture)|lamp]]" or "[[flashlight|flashdark]]" can be constructed which casts a beam of darkness onto a surface that is otherwise well-lit. Instead, darkness appears only when sources of light are extinguished or obscured and ends when an object absorbs a disproportionate amount of the light that strikes it. This is illustrated by Lao Tzu in the Tao Te Ching quite well:

{{quote|When people see some things as beautiful, other things become ugly. When people see some things as good, other things become bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lao Tzu|title=Chapter 2|url= http://taotechingme.com/chapter-02-being-and-non-being|chapter=Tao Te Ching|accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The relationship between light and darkness is often used to frame a metaphorical understanding of good and evil. The metaphor can be used to answer{{fact|date=May 2012}} &lt;!-- It seems that under Wikipedia principles such support-needed tag can't be deleted unless one deletes the related clause, and such broader deletion would be fine too, because no one has been able and willing to support the tagged proposition, which apparently was tagged half a decade ago.  --&gt; the [[problem of evil]]: If evil, like darkness, does not truly exist, but is only a name we give to our perception of ''privatio boni'', widespread observation of evil does not preclude the possibility of a benevolent, omniscient, and omnipresent God.

If the [[metaphor]] can be extended, and good and evil share the same asymmetry as light and darkness, evil can have no source, cannot be projected, and, of itself, can offer no resistance to any source of good, no matter how weak or distant. Then, goodness cannot be actively opposed, and power becomes a consequence of benevolence. However, evil is the default state of the universe, and good exists only through constant effort; any lapse or redirection of good will apparently create evil out of nothing.

This doctrine is also supported by the [[Bahá’í Faith]]. [[‘Abdu’l-Bahá]] stated to a French Baha’I woman:
{{quote|…it is possible that one thing in relation to another may be evil, and at the same time within the limits of its proper being it may not be evil. Then it is proved that there is no evil in existence; all that God created He created good. This evil is nothingness; so death is the absence of life. When man no longer receives life, he dies. Darkness is the absence of light: when there is no light, there is darkness. Light is an existing thing, but darkness is nonexistent. Wealth is an existing thing, but poverty is nonexisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=’Abdu’l-Bahá|title=Some Answered Questions|url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-75.html|chapter=The Nonexistence of Evil.|accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Adrsta''''' ({{lang-sa|अदृष्ट}}, Adr̥ṣṭa) is a concept in [[Indian philosophy]] which means that which is "unobserved, not seen, invisible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=adRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes adRSTa] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''adrsta'' is discussed in the ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'', the main text of the [[Vaisheshika]] Hindu school of philosophy, as part of its philosophical discussion on the nature of the universe. After explaining the atomistic cosmology that this school theorizes as the constituents of universe, it focuses on explaining phenomena such as motion and change. These occurrences are attributed to manifestations of ''adrsta'', or invisible forces and fields as causative reasons behind change. Vaiśeṣika scholars explain ''Adr̥ṣṭa'' as what intermediates between cause and effect but is not seen.&lt;ref&gt;JD Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723936}}, pages 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285905/Indian-philosophy/61603/The-Vaisesika-sutras?anchor=ref314663 "Indian Philosophy :: The "Vaisesika-sutras" ] Britannica Online Encyclopedia." Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Web. 24 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vaisheshika school also uses Adrsta concept in its formulation of the [[Karma]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1990), Tradition and Reflection: Explorations in Indian Thought, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791403624}}, page 311-315&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13821">In most [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''attorney general''' or '''attorney-general''' (sometimes abbreviated '''AG''') is the main legal advisor to the [[government]]. The plural is '''attorneys general''' (traditional) or '''attorney generals'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/attorney-general Collins English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=attorney%20general American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attorney%20general Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, attorneys general also have executive responsibility for [[law enforcement]], prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally. In practice, the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions, and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction, often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder's prior legal experience.

Where the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general (as is the case, for example, with the [[United States Attorney General]] or the [[Attorney-General for Australia]], and the respective [[State attorney general|attorneys general]] of the states in each country), the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]] in some other countries.

The term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general [[power of attorney]] to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could, in the past, be referred to as such, even if only for a particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions, the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have similar offices, which may be variously called "[[public prosecutor general (disambiguation)|public prosecutor general]]", "'''[[wikt:procurator|procurator]]s'''", "'''[[Advocate General|advocates general]]'''", "'''public attorneys'''", and other titles. Many of these offices also use "attorney general" or "attorney-general" as the English translation of the title, although because of different historical provenance, the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions.

==Etymology==
In regard to the [[etymology]] of the phrase ''Attorney General'', [[Steven Pinker]] writes that the earliest citation in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] is from 1292: "Tous attorneyz general purrount lever fins et cirrographer" (All general attorneys may levy fines and make legal documents).&lt;ref name="SP-ZWords"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker |first1=Steven |title=Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language |date=1999 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-465-07269-0 |pages=25, 28 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=HeA4DgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Steven+Pinker+Words+and+rules+:+the+ingredients+of+language&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_pKis8e7TAhXkJZoKHQ98BnkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=attorneyz%20general&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was borrowed from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] when England was ruled by [[Normans]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in the 11th-century. As a variety of French, which was spoken in the law courts, schools, universities and in sections of the gentry and the bourgeoisie, the term relating to government got introduced into English. The phrase ''attorney general'' is composed of a noun followed by the [[postpositive adjective]] ''general'' and as other [[English plurals#French compounds|French compounds]] its plural form also appears as ''"attorneys generals"''.&lt;ref name="Haaretz-attorneys-general"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Attorneys Generals Protest Trump's Ban: Liberty Is Bedrock of Our Country|url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.768331|publisher=Haaretz.com|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-attorneys-generals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Attorneys Generals at Work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/19/us/politics/1-Former-Attorneys-Generals-at-Work.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to ''[[major general]]s,'' a term that also originates from French ("[[:fr:major-général|major-général]]") and also has a postpositive adjective, it also appears as ''"attorney generals"''.

In the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] is a member of the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and, as head of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], is the top law enforcement officer and lawyer for the government. The Attorney General may need to be distinguished from the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]], a high Justice Department official with the responsibility of representing the government before the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. In cases of exceptional importance, however, the Attorney General may choose personally to represent the government to the Supreme Court.

The individual [[U.S. state]]s and territories, as well as the federal district of [[Washington, D.C.]] also have [[State Attorney General|attorneys general]] with similar responsibilities.  The majority of state attorneys general are chosen by popular election, as opposed to the U.S. Attorney General, who is a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate.

In nearly all United States jurisdictions the attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer of that jurisdiction, and as such attorney general may also be considered a police rank.  The proper form of addressing a person holding the office is addressed Mister or Madam Attorney General, or just as Attorney General. The plural is "Attorneys General" or "Attorneys-General".

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there are two types of attorneys-general, that are only historically related.

The first type of attorney-general ("advocaat-generaal" in Dutch) is the public prosecutor in criminal cases at appellate courts.

The second type of attorney-general ("procureur-generaal", while their replacements are called "advocaat-generaal") is an independent advisor to the Supreme Court. These people give an opinion on cases (called "conclusies") in any field of law (not just criminal law), supported by a scientific staff. The Supreme Court may either follow or reject the opinion of the attorney-general (which is published together with the eventual decision). In a way, an attorney-general acts as yet another judge, but in the Dutch system that does not allow dissenting opinions to be published, it is the only way to reflect different perceptions on a case. The Procureur-Generaal also prosecutes members of parliament in the case of misfeance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001830/2017-01-01#Hoofdstuk3_Artikel111|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie - BWBR0001830|website=wetten.overheid.nl|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''Basic goodness''' is a term coined by Tibetan spiritual teacher [[Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] and is a core concept in his [[terma (religion)|terma]]. It is used both to discuss the experience of reality and also basic human [[virtue]].

In his 1980 Seminary he associates this term with both absolute [[bodhicitta]] and specifically the Tibetan term kun.gzhi.ngang.lugs.kyi.dge.ba which comes from the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] tradition and refers to the natural virtues of the kunshi or [[alaya]]. Specifically he described three virtues: ''unborn'' meaning non-manufactured; ''nondwelling'' meaning that it cannot be pinned down, and ''free from pigeonholing'' meaning that it is beyond conceptual reference points.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1980) Mayahana Seminary Transcript, pgs 91-94&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1981 Seminary he described it as also referring to personal wholesomeness and dedication to others.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1981) Mayahana Seminary Transcript, pg 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Melvin McLeod explains the term with ''basic'' indicating the primordial, self-existing nature and ''goodness'' indicating a faultless aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Mindful politics: a Buddhist guide to making the world a better place By Melvin McLeod; pp92-93&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller associated the term with [[Buddha-nature]].&lt;ref&gt;The holistic curriculum By John P. Miller; p29&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa Rinpoche's son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, expressed the relationship between basic goodness and enlightened society in these words: "In essence, the emphasis of the Buddhist path is to help us attain enlightenment, and the emphasis of the Shambhala path is to help us create and maintain a good society. When we put these two together, we have the Shambhalian Buddhist view of enlightened society. Thus the two paths work in tandem, not in competition."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51886">'''Belief revision''' is the process of changing beliefs to take into account a new piece of information. The [[formal logic|logical]] formalization of belief revision is researched in [[philosophy]], in [[databases]], and in artificial intelligence for the design of [[intelligent agent|rational agent]]s.

What makes belief revision non-trivial is that several different ways for performing this operation may be possible. For example, if the current knowledge includes the three facts "&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true", "&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is true" and "if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are true then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is true", the introduction of the new information "&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is false" can be done preserving consistency only by removing at least one of the three facts. In this case, there are at least three different ways for performing revision. In general, there may be several different ways for changing knowledge..

==Revision and update==
Two kinds of changes are usually distinguished:

; update : the new information is about the situation at present, while the old beliefs refer to the past; update is the operation of changing the old beliefs to take into account the change;

; revision : both the old beliefs and the new information refer to the same situation; an inconsistency between the new and old information is explained by the possibility of old information being less reliable than the new one; revision is the process of inserting the new information into the set of old beliefs without generating an inconsistency.

The main assumption of belief revision is that of minimal change: the knowledge before and after the change should be as similar as possible. In the case of update, this principle formalizes the assumption of inertia. In the case of revision, this principle enforces as much information as possible to be preserved by the change.

===Example===
The following classical example shows that the operations to perform in the two settings of update and revision are not the same. The example is based on two different interpretations of the set of beliefs &lt;math&gt;\{a \vee b\}&lt;/math&gt; and the new piece of information &lt;math&gt;\neg a&lt;/math&gt;:

; update : in this scenario, two satellites, Unit A and Unit B, orbit around Mars; the satellites are programmed to land while transmitting their status to Earth; Earth has received a transmission from one of the satellites, communicating that it is still in orbit; however, due to interference, it is not known which satellite sent the signal; subsequently, Earth receives the communication that Unit A has landed; this scenario can be modeled in the following way; two [[propositional variable]]s &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; indicate that Unit A and Unit B, respectively, are still in orbit; the initial set of beliefs is &lt;math&gt;\{a \vee b\}&lt;/math&gt; (either one of the two satellites is still in orbit) and the new piece of information is &lt;math&gt;\neg a&lt;/math&gt; (Unit A has landed, and is therefore not in orbit); the only rational result of the update is &lt;math&gt;\neg a&lt;/math&gt;; since the initial information that one of the two satellites had not landed yet was possibly coming from the Unit A, the position of the Unit B is not known;

; revision : the play "Six Characters in Search of an Author" will be performed in one of the two local theatres; this information can be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{a \vee b\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the play will be performed at the first or at the second theatre, respectively; a further information that "Jesus Christ Superstar" will be performed at the first theatre indicates that &lt;math&gt;\neg a&lt;/math&gt; holds; in this case, the obvious conclusion is that "Six Characters in Search of an Author" will be performed at the second but not the first theatre, which is represented in logic by &lt;math&gt;\neg a \wedge b&lt;/math&gt;.

This example shows that revising the belief &lt;math&gt;a \vee b&lt;/math&gt; with the new information &lt;math&gt;\neg a&lt;/math&gt; produces two different results &lt;math&gt;\neg a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg a \wedge b&lt;/math&gt; depending on whether the setting is that of update or revision.

==Contraction, expansion, revision, consolidation, and merging==
In the setting in which all beliefs refer to the same situation, a distinction between various operations that can be performed is made:

; contraction : removal of a belief;

; expansion : addition of a belief without checking consistency;

; revision : addition of a belief while maintaining consistency;

; extraction : extracting a consistent set of beliefs and/or epistemic entrenchment ordering;

; consolidation : restoring consistency of a set of beliefs;

; merging : fusion of two or more sets of beliefs while maintaining consistency.

Revision and merging differ in that the first operation is done when the new belief to incorporate is considered more reliable than the old ones; therefore, consistency is maintained by removing some of the old beliefs. Merging is a more general operation, in that the priority among the belief sets may or may not be the same.

Revision can be performed by first incorporating the new fact and then restoring consistency via consolidation. This is actually a form of merging rather than revision, as the new information is not always treated as more reliable than the old knowledge.

==The AGM postulates==
The AGM postulates (named after the names of their proponents, [[Carlos Alchourrón|Alchourrón]], [[Peter Gärdenfors|Gärdenfors]], and [[David Makinson|Makinson]]) are properties that an operator that performs revision should satisfy in order for that operator to be considered rational. The considered setting is that of revision, that is, different pieces of information referring to the same situation. Three operations are considered: expansion (addition of a belief without a consistency check), revision (addition of a belief while maintaining consistency), and contraction (removal of a belief).

The first six postulates are called "the basic AGM postulates". In the settings considered by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson, the current set of beliefs is represented by a [[Deductive closure|deductively closed]] set of logical formulae &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; called belief base, the new piece of information is a logical formula &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and revision is performed by a binary operator &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; that takes as its operands the current beliefs and the new information and produces as a result a belief base representing the result of the revision. The &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; operator denoted expansion: &lt;math&gt;K+P&lt;/math&gt; is the deductive closure of &lt;math&gt;K \cup \{P\}&lt;/math&gt;. The AGM postulates for revision are:

# Closure: &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; is a belief base (i.e., a deductively closed set of formulae);
# Success: &lt;math&gt;P \in K*P&lt;/math&gt;
# Inclusion: &lt;math&gt;K*P \subseteq K+P&lt;/math&gt;
# Vacuity: &lt;math&gt;\text{If }(\neg P) \not \in K,\text{ then }K*P=K+P&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; is [[inconsistent]] only if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is inconsistent or &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is inconsistent
# Extensionality: &lt;math&gt;\text{If }P\text{ and }Q\text{ are logically equivalent, then }K*P=K*Q&lt;/math&gt; (see [[logical equivalence]])
# &lt;math&gt;K*(P \wedge Q) \subseteq (K*P)+Q&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\text{If }(\neg Q) \not\in K*P\text{ then }(K*P)+Q \subseteq K*(P \wedge Q)&lt;/math&gt;

A revision operator that satisfies all eight postulates is the full meet revision, in which &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;K+P&lt;/math&gt; if consistent, and to the deductive closure of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. While satisfying all AGM postulates, this revision operator has been considered to be too conservative, in that no information from the old knowledge base is maintained if the revising formula is inconsistent with it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Conditions equivalent to the AGM postulates==
The AGM postulates are equivalent to several different conditions on the revision operator; in particular, they are equivalent to the revision operator being definable in terms of structures known as selection functions, epistemic entrenchments, systems of spheres, and preference relations. The latter are [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], and [[total relation]]s over the set of models.

Each revision operator &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the AGM postulates is associated to a set of preference relations &lt;math&gt;\leq_K&lt;/math&gt;, one for each possible belief base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, such that the models of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are exactly the minimal of all models according to &lt;math&gt;\leq_K&lt;/math&gt;. The revision operator and its associated family of orderings are related by the fact that &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; is the set of formulae whose set of models contains all the minimal models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; according to &lt;math&gt;\leq_K&lt;/math&gt;. This condition is equivalent to the set of models of &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; being exactly the set of the minimal models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; according to the ordering &lt;math&gt;\leq_K&lt;/math&gt;.

A preference ordering &lt;math&gt;\leq_K&lt;/math&gt; represents an order of implausibility among all situations, including those that are conceivable but yet currently considered false. The minimal models according to such an ordering are exactly the models of the knowledge base, which are the models that are currently considered the most likely. All other models are greater than these ones, and are indeed considered less plausible. In general, &lt;math&gt;I &lt;_K J&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the situation represented by the model &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is believed to be more plausible than the situation represented by &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, revising by a formula having &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; as models should select only &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; to be a model of the revised knowledge base, as this model represent the most likely scenario among those supported by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Contraction==
Contraction is the operation of removing a belief &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; from a knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;; the result of this operation is denoted by &lt;math&gt;K-P&lt;/math&gt;. The operators of revision and contractions are related by the Levi and Harper identities:

: &lt;math&gt;K*P=(K-\neg P)+P&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;K-P=K \cap (K*\neg P)&lt;/math&gt;

Eight postulates have been defined for contraction. Whenever a revision operator satisfies the eight postulates for revision, its corresponding contraction operator satisfies the eight postulates for contraction, and vice versa. If a contraction operator satisfies at least the first six postulates for contraction, translating it into a revision operator and then back into a contraction operator using the two identities above leads to the original contraction operator. The same holds starting from a revision operator.

One of the postulates for contraction has been longly discussed: the recovery postulate:

: &lt;math&gt;K=(K-P)+P&lt;/math&gt;

According to this postulate, the removal of a belief &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; followed by the reintroduction of the same belief in the belief base should lead to the original belief base. There are some examples showing that such behavior is not always reasonable: in particular, the contraction by a general condition such as &lt;math&gt;a \vee b&lt;/math&gt; leads to the removal of more specific conditions such as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from the belief base; it is then unclear why the reintroduction of &lt;math&gt;a \vee b&lt;/math&gt; should also lead to the reintroduction of the more specific condition &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if George was previously believed to have German citizenship, he was also believed to be European. Contracting this latter belief amounts to ceasing to believe that George is European; therefore, that George has German citizenship is also retracted from the belief base. If George is later discovered to have Austrian citizenship, then the fact that he is European is also reintroduced. According to the recovery postulate, however, the belief that he also has German citizenship should also be reintroduced.

The correspondence between revision and contraction induced by the Levi and Harper identities is such that a contraction not satisfying the recovery postulate is translated into a revision satisfying all eight postulates, and that a revision satisfying all eight postulates is translated into a contraction satisfying all eight postulates, including recovery. As a result, if recovery is excluded from consideration, a number of contraction operators are translated into a single revision operator, which can be then translated back into exactly one contraction operator. This operator is the only one of the initial group of contraction operators that satisfies recovery; among this group, it is the operator that preserves as much information as possible.

==The Ramsey test&lt;!--[[Ramsey test]], [[Ramsey Test]], [[Ramsey's test]], [[Ramsey's Test]] redirect here--&gt;==
The evaluation of a [[counterfactual conditional]] &lt;math&gt;a &gt; b&lt;/math&gt; can be done, according to the '''Ramsey test'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (named for [[Frank P. Ramsey]]), to the hypothetical addition of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the set of current beliefs followed by a check for the truth of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of beliefs currently held, the Ramsey test is formalized by the following correspondence:

: &lt;math&gt;a &gt; b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;b \in K * a&lt;/math&gt;

If the considered language of the formulae representing beliefs is propositional, the Ramsey test gives a consistent definition for counterfactual conditionals in terms of a belief revision operator. However, if the language of formulae representing beliefs itself includes the counterfactual conditional connective &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, the Ramsey test leads to the Gardenfors triviality result: there is no non-trivial revision operator that satisfies both the AGM postulates for revision and the condition of the Ramsey test. This result holds in the assumption that counterfactual formulae like &lt;math&gt;a&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be present in belief bases and revising formulae. Several solutions to this problem have been proposed.

==Non-monotonic inference relation==
Given a fixed knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and a revision operator &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, one can define a non-monotonic inference relation using the following definition: &lt;math&gt;P \vdash Q&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;K*P \models Q&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a formula &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; [[logical consequence|entails]] another formula &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; if the addition of the first formula to the current knowledge base leads to the derivation of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. This inference relation is non-monotonic.

The AGM postulates can be translated into a set of postulates for this inference relation. Each of these postulates is entailed by some previously considered set of postulates for non-monotonic inference relations. Vice versa, conditions that have been considered for non-monotonic inference relations can be translated into postulates for a revision operator. All these postulates are entailed by the AGM postulates.

==Foundational revision==
In the AGM framework, a belief set is represented by a deductively closed set of [[propositional formula]]e. While such sets are infinite, they can always be finitely representable. However, working with deductively closed sets of formulae leads to the implicit assumption that equivalent belief bases should be considered equal when revising. This is called the ''principle of irrelevance of syntax''.

This principle has been and is currently debated: while &lt;math&gt;\{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{a \wedge b\}&lt;/math&gt; are two equivalent sets, revising by &lt;math&gt;\neg a&lt;/math&gt; should produce different results. In the first case, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are two separate beliefs; therefore, revising by &lt;math&gt;\neg a&lt;/math&gt; should not produce any effect on &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and the result of revision is &lt;math&gt;\{\neg a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;. In the second case, &lt;math&gt;a \wedge b&lt;/math&gt; is taken a single belief. The fact that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is false contradicts this belief, which should therefore be removed from the belief base. The result of revision is therefore &lt;math&gt;\{\neg a\}&lt;/math&gt; in this case.

The problem of using deductively closed knowledge bases is that no distinction is made between pieces of knowledge that are known by themselves and pieces of knowledge that are merely consequences of them. This distinction is instead done by the ''foundational'' approach to belief revision, which is related to [[foundationalism]] in philosophy. According to this approach, retracting a non-derived piece of knowledge should lead to retracting all its consequences that are not otherwise supported (by other non-derived pieces of knowledge).  This approach can be realized by using knowledge bases that are not deductively closed and assuming that all formulae in the knowledge base represent self-standing beliefs, that is, they are not derived beliefs. In order to distinguish the foundational approach to belief revision to that based on deductively closed knowledge bases, the latter is called the ''coherentist'' approach. This name has been chosen because the coherentist approach aims at restoring the coherence
(consistency) among ''all'' beliefs, both self-standing and derived ones. This approach is related to [[coherentism]] in philosophy.

Foundationalist revision operators working on non-deductively closed belief bases typically select some subsets of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that are consistent with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, combined them in some way, and then conjoined them with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. The following are two non-deductively closed base revision operators.

; WIDTIO : (When in Doubt, Throw it Out) the maximal subsets of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that are consistent with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are intersected, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is added to the resulting set; in other words, the result of revision is composed by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and of all formulae of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that are in all maximal subsets of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that are consistent with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;;

;[[Mary-Anne Williams|Williams]] : solved an open problem by developing a new representation for finite bases that allowed for AGM revision and contraction operations to be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=758987&amp;CFID=831191299&amp;CFTOKEN=25549413|title=On the Logic of Theory Base Change Proceeding JELIA '94 Proceedings of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence Pages 86-105|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ACM Digital Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This representation was translated to a computational model and an anytime algorithm for belief revision was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/97-1/Papers/013.pdf|title=Anytime Belief Revision IJCAI'97 Proceedings of the 15th international joint conference on Artificial intelligence - Volume 1 Pages 74-79|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ijcai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Ginsberg-Fagin-Ullman-Vardi : the maximal subsets of &lt;math&gt;K \cup \{P\}&lt;/math&gt; that are consistent and contain &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are combined by disjunction;

; Nebel : similar to the above, but a priority among formulae can be given, so that formulae with higher priority are less likely to being retracted than formulae with lower priority.

A different realization of the foundational approach to belief revision is based on explicitly declaring the dependences among beliefs. In the [[truth maintenance system]]s, dependence links among beliefs can be specified. In other worlds, one can explicitly declare that a given fact is believed because of one or more other facts; such a dependency is called a ''justification''. Beliefs not having any justifications play the role of non-derived beliefs in the non-deductively closed knowledge base approach.

==Model-based revision and update==
A number of proposals for revision and update based on the set of models of the involved formulae were developed independently of the AGM framework. The principle behind this approach is that a knowledge base is equivalent to a set of ''possible worlds'', that is, to a set of scenarios that are considered possible according to that knowledge base. Revision can therefore be performed on the sets of possible worlds rather than on the corresponding knowledge bases.

The revision and update operators based on models are usually identified by the name of their authors: [[Marianne Winslett|Winslett]], Forbus, Satoh, Dalal, Hegner, and Weber. According to the  first four of these proposal, the result of revising/updating a formula &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; by another formula &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by the set of models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; that are the closest to the models of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Different notions of closeness can be defined, leading to the difference among these proposals.

; Peppas and [[Mary-Anne Williams|Williams]] : provided the formal relationship between revision and update. They introduced the Winslett Identity in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1040308831 
 |title=Constructive Modelings for Theory Change Notre Dame J. Formal Logic Volume 36, Number 1 (1995), 120-133. |publisher= Notre Dame J. Formal Logic |accessdate=November 18, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Dalal : the models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; having a minimal [[Hamming distance]] to models of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are selected to be the models that result from the change;

; Satoh : similar to Dalal, but distance between two models is defined as the set of literals that are given different values by them; similarity between models is defined as set containment of these differences;

; Winslett : for each model of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, the closest models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are selected; comparison is done using set containment of the difference;

; Borgida : equal to Winslett's if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are inconsistent; otherwise, the result of revision is &lt;math&gt;K \wedge P&lt;/math&gt;;

; [[Ken Forbus|Forbus]] : similar to Winslett, but the Hamming distance is used.

The revision operator defined by Hegner makes &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; not to affect  the value of the variables that are mentioned in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. What results from this operation is a formula &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; that is consistent with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and can therefore be conjoined with it. The revision operator by Weber is similar, but the literals that are removed from &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are not all literals of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, but only the literals that are evaluated differently by a pair of closest models of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; according to the Satoh measure of closeness.

==Iterated revision==
The AGM postulates are equivalent to a preference ordering (an ordering over models) to be associated to every knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. However, they do not relate the orderings corresponding to two non-equivalent knowledge bases. In particular, the orderings associated to a knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and its revised version &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; can be completely different. This is a problem for performing a second revision, as the ordering associated with &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; is necessary to calculate &lt;math&gt;K*P*Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Establishing a relation between the ordering associated with &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt; has been however recognized not to be the right solution to this problem. Indeed, the preference relation should depend on the previous history of revisions, rather than on the resulting knowledge base only. More generally, a preference relation gives more information about the state of mind of an agent than a simple knowledge base. Indeed, two states of mind might represent the same piece of knowledge &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; while at the same time being different in the way a new piece of knowledge would be incorporated. For example, two people might have the same idea as to where to go on holiday, but yet they differ on how they would change this idea if they win a million-dollar lottery. Since the basic condition of the preference ordering is that their minimal models are exactly the models of their associated knowledge base, a knowledge base can be considered implicitly represented by a preference ordering (but not vice versa).

Given that a preference ordering allows deriving its associated knowledge base but also allows performing a single step of revision, studies on iterated revision have been concentrated on how a preference ordering should be changed in response of a revision. While single-step revision is about how a knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has to be changed into a new knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt;, iterated revision is about how a preference ordering (representing both the current knowledge and how much situations believed to be false are considered possible) should be turned into a new preference relation when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is learned. A single step of iterated revision produces a new ordering that allows for further revisions.

Two kinds of preference ordering are usually considered: numerical and non-numerical. In the first case, the level of plausibility of a model is  representing by a non-negative integer number; the lower the rank, the more plausible the situation corresponding to the model. Non-numerical preference orderings correspond to the preference relations used in the AGM framework: a possibly total ordering over models. The non-numerical preference relation were initially considered unsuitable for iterated revision because of the impossibility of reverting a revision by a number of other revisions, which is instead possible in the numerical case.

Darwiche and [[Judea Pearl|Pearl]]&lt;ref name="darwiche-pearl"&gt;Darwiche, A. and Pearl, J. (1997) On the logic of iterated belief revision.  ''Artificial Intelligence'' '''89'''(1-2): 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the following postulates for iterated revision.

# if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \models \mu&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(\psi * \mu) * \alpha \equiv \psi * \alpha&lt;/math&gt;;
# if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \models \neg \mu&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(\psi * \mu) * \alpha \equiv \psi * \alpha&lt;/math&gt;;
# if &lt;math&gt;\psi * \alpha \models \mu&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(\psi * \mu) * \alpha \models \mu&lt;/math&gt;;
# if &lt;math&gt;\psi * \alpha \not\models \neg \mu&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(\psi * \mu) * \alpha \not\models \neg \mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Specific iterated revision operators have been proposed by Spohn, Boutilier, [[Mary-Anne Williams|Williams]], Lehmann, and others. [[Mary-Anne Williams|Williams]] also provided a general iterated revision operator.

; Spohn rejected revision : this non-numerical proposal has been first considered by Spohn, who rejected it based on the fact that revisions can change some orderings in such a way the original ordering cannot be restored with a sequence of other revisions; this operator change a preference ordering in view of new information &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by making all models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; being preferred over all other models; the original preference ordering is maintained when comparing two models that are both models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or both non-models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;;

; Natural revision : while revising a preference ordering by a formula &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, all minimal models (according to the preference ordering) of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are made more preferred by all other ones; the original ordering of models is preserved when comparing two models that are not minimal models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; this operator changes the ordering among models minimally while preserving the property that the models of the knowledge base after revising by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are the minimal models of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; according to the preference ordering;

; Transmutations : [[Mary-Anne Williams|Williams]] provided the first generalization of Belief Revision iteration using transmutations. She illustrated transmutations using two forms of revision, conditionalization and adjustment, which work on numerical preference orderings; revision requires not only a formula but also a number or ranking of an existing belief indicating its degree of plausibility; while the preference ordering is still inverted (the lower a model, the most plausible it is) the degree of plausibility of a revising formula is direct (the higher the degree, the most believed the formula is);

; Ranked revision : a ranked model, which is an assignment of non-negative integers to models, has to be specified at the beginning; this rank is similar to a preference ordering, but is not changed by revision; what is changed by a sequence of revisions are a current set of models (representing the current knowledge base) and a number called the rank of the sequence; since this number can only monotonically non-decrease, some sequences of revision lead to situations in which every further revision is performed as a full meet revision.

==Merging==
The assumption implicit in the revision operator is that the new piece of information &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is always to be considered more reliable than the old knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. This is formalized by the second of the AGM postulates: &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is always believed after revising &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. More generally, one can consider the process of merging several pieces of information (rather than just two) that might or might not have the same reliability. Revision becomes the particular instance of this process when a less reliable piece of information &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is merged with a more reliable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

While the input to the revision process is a pair of formulae &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the input to merging is a [[multiset]] of formulae &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, etc. The use of multisets is necessary as two sources to the merging process might be identical.

When merging a number of knowledge bases with the same degree of plausibility, a distinction is made between arbitration and majority. This distinction depends on the assumption that is made about the information and how it has to be put together.

; arbitration : the result of arbitrating two knowledge bases &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; entails &lt;math&gt;K \vee T&lt;/math&gt;; this condition formalizes the assumption of maintaining as much as the old information as possible, as it is equivalent to imposing that every formula entailed by both knowledge bases is also entailed by the result of their arbitration; in a possible world view, the "real" world is assumed one of the worlds considered possible according to at least one of the two knowledge bases;

; majority : the result of merging a knowledge base &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with other knowledge bases can be forced to entail &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; by adding a sufficient number of other knowledge bases equivalent to &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;; this condition corresponds to a kind of vote-by-majority: a sufficiently large number of knowledge bases can always overcome the "opinion" of any other fixed set of knowledge bases.

The above is the original definition of arbitration. According to a newer definition, an arbitration operator is a merging operator that is insensitive to the number of equivalent knowledge bases to merge. This definition makes arbitration the exact opposite of majority.

Postulates for both arbitration and merging have been proposed. An example of an arbitration operator satisfying all postulates is the classical disjunction. An example of a majority operator satisfying all postulates is that selecting all models that have a minimal total Hamming distance to models of the knowledge bases to merge.

A merging operator can be expressed as a family of orderings over models, one for each possible multiset of knowledge bases to merge: the models of the result of merging a multiset of knowledge bases are the minimal models of the ordering associated to the multiset. A merging operator defined in this way satisfies the postulates for merging if and only if the family of orderings meets a given set of conditions. For the old definition of arbitration, the orderings are not on models but on pairs (or, in general, tuples) of models.

==Social choice theory==
Many revision proposals involve orderings over models representing the relative plausibility of the possible alternatives. The problem of merging amounts to combine a set of orderings into a single one expressing the combined  plausibility of the alternatives. This is similar with what is done in [[social choice theory]], which is the study of how the preferences of a group of agents can be combined in a rational way. Belief revision and social choice theory are similar in that they combine a set of orderings into one. They differ on how these orderings are interpreted: preferences in social choice theory; plausibility in belief revision. Another difference is that the alternatives are explicitly enumerated in social choice theory, while they are the propositional models over a given alphabet in belief revision.

==Complexity==
The problem about belief revision that is the most studied from the point of view of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] is that of query answering in the propositional case. This is the problem of establishing whether a formula follows from the result of a revision, that is, &lt;math&gt;K*P \models Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositional formulae. More generally, query answering is the problem of telling whether a formula is entailed by the result of a belief revision, which could be update, merging, revision, iterated revision, etc. Another problem that has received some attention is that of model checking, that is, checking whether a model satisfies the result of a belief revision. A related question is whether such result can be represented in space polynomial in that of its arguments.

Since a deductively closed knowledge base is infinite, complexity studies on belief revision operators working on deductively closed knowledge bases are done in the assumption that such deductively closed knowledge base are given in the form of an equivalent finite knowledge base.

A distinction is made among belief revision operators and belief revision schemes. While the former are simple mathematical operators mapping a pair of formulae into another formula, the latter depend on further information such as a preference relation. For example, the Dalal revision is an operator because, once two formulae &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are given, no other information is needed to compute &lt;math&gt;K*P&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, revision based on a preference relation is a revision scheme, because &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; do not allow determining the result of revision if the family of preference orderings between models is not given. The complexity for revision schemes is determined in the assumption that the extra information needed to compute revision is given in some compact form. For example, a preference relation can be represented by a sequence of formulae whose models are increasingly preferred. Explicitly storing the relation as a set of pairs of models is instead not a compact representation of preference because the space required is exponential in the number of propositional letters.

The complexity of query answering and model checking in the propositional case is in the second level of the [[polynomial hierarchy]] for most belief revision operators and schemas. Most revision operators suffer from the problem of representational blow up: the result of revising two formulae is not necessarily representable in space polynomial in that of the two original formulae. In other words, revision may exponentially increase the size of the knowledge base.

==Relevance==
New breakthrough results that demonstrate how relevance can be employed in Belief Revision have been achieved. [[Mary-Anne Williams]], Peppas, Foo and Chopra reported the results in the Artificial Intelligence Journal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370215001228?via%3Dihub|title= Relevance in Belief Revision |publisher= Science Direct |accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernardus Maria Ignatius "Bernard" Delfgaauw''' (24 November 1912 in [[Amsterdam]] – 20 August 1993 in [[Haren (Groningen)|Haren]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]].

He studied [[Dutch language]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], and [[Hebrew language]] at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam|University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="kb"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://poortman.kb.nl/long2.php?TABEL=T_NAAM&amp;ID=262
  | accessdate = 2007-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 he earned his [[doctoral degree]] in philosophy.&lt;ref name="kb"/&gt;

In 1961 he became a [[professor]] in philosophy at the [[University of Groningen]].&lt;ref name="kb"/&gt;

Delfgaauw was a prolific writer; subjects included existentialism, young [[Young Marx|Marx]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], mysticism, evolution, and he developed a philosophy of grammar and of social relations. He also wrote a bestselling concise history of philosophy that was in continuous reprint and got translated into several languages. 

During the [[Vietnam War]] it was legally proscribed in the [[Netherlands]] to say that [[Lyndon B. Johnson|president Johnson]] was a killer. In 1967 Bernard Delfgaauw said at a symposium: "Measured by criteria used in Nuremberg and Tokyo, Johnson, his staff members, and generals are war criminals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After that, the Dutch student protesters wantonly changed their slogan from "Johnson Killer" to "Johnson Miller".

'''Charles François d'Abra de Raconis''' (1580–1646) was a [[France|French]] bishop and theologian.

==Life==
Born at Château de Raconis in 1580 of a [[Calvinistic]] family, he died in 1646. In 1592, his family was converted to the [[Catholic]] faith. He taught philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Collège du Plessis]] in 1609, theology at the [[Collège de Navarre]] in 1615, and three years later was appointed court preacher and royal almoner. At this epoch he took part in religious polemics and wrote works of controversy, anti-Calvinist and anti-Jansenist pamphlets. In 1637, he was appointed [[Bishop of Lavaur]], but was not consecrated until 1639. In 1643 he was back in Paris, and controversies with the [[Jansenists]] engaged him until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography|editor=Michael Walsh|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826452639| pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He is the author of original treatises of metaphysics, which [[Descartes]] would later read. His ''Summa totius philosophiae'' was published in 1617 and later developed in the ''Metaphysica seu prima ac suprema scientia'' (Paris, 1624).

==Controversy==
[[Saint Vincent de Paul]] spurred him on and encouraged him. Two years before his death he published his "Examen et jugement du livre de la fréquente communion fait contre la fréquente communion et publié sous le nom du sieur Arnauld" (Paris, 1644). The following year he published a rejoinder to the reply to this. [[Antoine Arnauld]] affected great contempt for him, and declared that his works were "despised by all respectable persons". Raconis also wrote against the heresy of "two heads of the Church Saints Peter and Paul," formulated by [[Martin de Barcos]]. The bishop's "Primauté et Souveraineté singulière de Saint Pierre" (1645) roused the wrath of his opponents.

Towards 1645, the report was circulated in Paris that he had written to the Pope, denouncing the dangerous teachings in the "Fréquente Communion", and telling the Pope that some French bishops tolerated and approved of these impieties. The [[Bishop of Grasse]] informed a general assembly of the clergy of this fact. This aroused their animosity, all the more since some of them had recommended Arnauld's work. They entered a complaint with the [[Nuncio]], and then compelled Raconis to say whether he had written the Setter or not. Although he denied having done so, they drew up a common protestation against the accusations of which they were the objects and sent it to [[Innocent X]].

'''Colin Murray Turbayne''' (7 February 1916 – 16 May 2006) was an [[Australia]]n philosopher, who spent most of his academic career at the [[University of Rochester]], where he first had a position in 1957 and became [[professor emeritus]] in 1981. His doctorate was from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. During World War II he had worked for Australian Intelligence, in the Pacific War theatre.

He was an authority on [[George Berkeley]] and was the first commentator to recognize the central importance of metaphor in the philosophy of Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Jeffrie G. "Berkeley and the Metaphor of Mental Substance." ''[[Ratio (journal)|Ratio]]'' 7 (1965):171, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his book ''The Myth of Metaphor'', published in 1962. In this book, Professor Turbayne argued that metaphor would necessarily occur in any language that could ever claim to embody richness and depth of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Jeffrie G. "Berkeley and the Metaphor of Mental Substance." ''[[Ratio (journal)|Ratio]]'' 7 (1965):176.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s Colin M. Turbayne and his wife established an International Berkeley Essay Prize competition in cooperation with the Philosophy Department at the University of Rochester&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rochester.edu/college/PHL/prize.html Colin and Ailsa Turbayne International Berkeley Essay Prize Competition].&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws outlined Mill's view of the [[epistemological]] components of [[emergentism]], a school of philosophical laws that posited a decidedly opportunistic approach to the classic dilemma of [[causation nullification]]. 

Mill was determined to prove that the intrinsic properties of all things relied on three primary tenets, which he called the Composition of Causes. These were:

1. The Cause of Inherent Efficiency, a methodological understanding of deterministic forces engaged in the perpetual axes of the soul, as it pertained to its own self-awareness.

2. The so-called Sixth Cause, a conceptual notion embodied by the system of inter-related segments of social and elemental vitra. This was a hotly debated matter in early 17th-century philosophical circles, especially in the halls of the Reichtaven in [[Meins]], where the spirit of Geudl still lingered.

3. The Cause of Multitude, an evolutionary step taken from Hemmlich's Plurality of a Dysfunctional Enterprise, detailing the necessary linkage between both sets of perception-based self-awareness.

Furthermore, the Composition of Causes elevated Mill's standing in [[ontological]] circles, lauded by his contemporaries for applying a conceptual vision of an often-argued discipline.

'''David Walter Hamlyn''' (1 October 1924 &amp;ndash; 15 July 2012)&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who 1974'', London : A. &amp; C. Black, 1974, p. 1399; http://www.bpa.ac.uk/news&lt;/ref&gt; was Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck College, London (1964&amp;ndash;1988), and editor of ''Mind'' (1972&amp;ndash;1984). His major interests were in [[Aristotle]] (whose ''de Anima'', II and III and parts of I, he translated with a commentary, 1968) and in [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], both of whom influenced Hamlyn's approach to questions in [[epistemology]] and philosophy of psychology. His central thesis, developed in ''Experience and the Growth of Understanding'' (1978), ''Perception, Learning and the Self'' (1983), and ''In and Out of the Black Box'' (1990), was that in order to be a knower a being must be active and seek to regulate its beliefs in accord with a norm of truth: this requires membership of a community, interaction with which involves emotional responses. In short, knowers are social, affective agents. The other main area of Hamlyn's writing was the history of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hal05|Haldane 2005]]. p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1637">The '''divine spark''' is the idea, most common to [[Gnosticism]] but also present in other Western mystical traditions, that each human being contains within himself a portion of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In these theologies, the purpose of life is to enable the Divine Spark to be released from its captivity in matter and reestablish its connection with or simply return to [[God]] who is perceived as being the source of the Divine Light. In the [[Gnostic]] [[Christian]] tradition, [[Christ]] is seen as a wholly divine being which has taken human form in order to lead humanity back to the Light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Emanationism''' is an idea in the [[cosmology]] or [[cosmogony]] of certain [[religion|religious]] or [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems. Emanation, from the Latin ''emanare'' meaning "to flow from" or "to pour forth or out of", is the mode by which all things are derived from the first reality, or [[first principle|principle]]. All things are derived from the first reality or perfect God by steps of degradation to lesser degrees of the first reality or God, and at every step the emanating beings are less pure, less perfect, less divine. Emanationism is a transcendent principle from which everything is derived, and is opposed to both [[creationism]] (wherein the universe is created by a sentient God who is separate from creation) and [[materialism]] (which posits no underlying subjective and/or [[Ontology|ontological]] nature behind phenomena being immanent).

==Origins==
Emanationism is a cosmological theory which asserts that all things "flow" from an underlying principle or reality, usually called the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] or [[Deity|Godhead]]. Any teachings which involve emanation are usually in opposition to [[creation ex nihilo]] as emanation advocates that everything has always existed and has not been "created" from nothing.

Kleinham (2007) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Underlying the worldview of traditional cosmology is the idea that the universe is an emanation of a unitary divine principle. Although this idea has been blended with the revealed creationist doctrines of the major monotheistic religions, orthodox theologians have generally regarded it with suspicion. They have relegated it to the shadowy spheres of mysticism, pantheism, and the occult, which have always been at odds with orthodoxy. The traditional view is summed in the doctrine of emanation formulated by Plotinus.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kleinman, ''Four Faces of the Universe: An Integrated View of the Cosmos'', 2007, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The primary classical exponent of emanationism was the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Plotinus]], wherein his work, the ''[[Enneads]]'', all things phenomenal and otherwise were an emanation ({{lang-el|ἀπορροή}} ''aporrhoe'' (Ennead ΙΙ.3.2) or ἀπόρροια ''aporrhoia'' (II.3.11)) from [[Henology|the One]] (ἕν, ''hen''). In 5.1.6, emanationism is compared to a diffusion from the One, of which there are three primary [[hypostases]], the One, the [[Nous|Intellect]] (νοῦς, ''nous''), and the [[Soul]] (ψυχή, ''psyche''). 

Another advocate of emanationism was [[Michael Servetus]], who was burned at the stake for his [[nontrinitarian]] cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Friedman, ''Michael Servetus: a case study in total heresy'', 1978, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occultism==
Emanationism is a common teaching found in [[occult]] and [[esoteric]] writings. According to Owen (2005):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Theosophy draws on Neoplatonic emanationism, in particular the concept of separation from and return to the Absolute, and reworks the Eastern concepts of karma and reincarnation to provide an evolutionary theory of both humankind and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, A., ''The place of enchantment: British occultism and the culture of the modern'' 2005, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] teaches that human beings and all organisms including animals and all matter "flow" from a pure spiritual formation in the absolute to a material one over time to become materialised but later will return to the absolute after the cosmic cycle of life.

As Morgan summarises: "The Secret Doctrine laid out an emanationist view of the development of the physical universe, a process of ebb and flow in which spirit gradually unfolded itself in matter, attaining consciousness, and returning to spirit in a higher and more realised form."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, S., ''Women, gender and religious cultures in Britain, 1800-1940'', 2010 p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; According to the emanationist cosmology of [[Madame Blavatsky]] all [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]] emerge from divine unity at the beginning of a cosmic cycle and return to this source at its close.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Shook, Richard T. Hull, The dictionary of modern American philosophers: A-C, Volume 1, 2005, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Blavatsky in her book ''The Key to Theosophy'' (1889) wrote that: "We believe in a universal divine principle, the root of all, from which all proceeds, and within which all shall be at the end of the great cycle of being."&lt;ref&gt;Joy Dixon, ''Divine feminine: theosophy and feminism in England'', 2001, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samael Aun Weor]] had taught emanationism from his studies with the [[Kabbalah]] and [[Gnosticism]]. He mapped out a complex [[esoteric cosmology]] with matter flowing from different [[planes of existence]] all existing in the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]. As Dawson (2007) comments: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As with esoteric thought in general, Weor holds that the universe originated in the ordering activity of the absolute upon chaotic primordial matter, giving rise to (emanating) the subsequent planes of the created order (Pleroma).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dawson, ''New era, new religions: religious transformation in contemporary Brazil'', 2007, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8157">'''Fitch's paradox of knowability''' is one of the fundamental puzzles of [[epistemic logic]]. It provides a challenge to the ''knowability thesis'', which states that every truth is, in principle, knowable. The [[paradox]] is that this assumption implies the ''omniscience principle'', which asserts that every truth is known. Essentially, Fitch's paradox asserts that the existence of an unknown truth is unknowable. So if all truths were knowable, it would follow that all truths are in fact known.

The paradox is of concern for [[verificationist]] or [[anti-realist]] accounts of truth, for which the ''knowability thesis'' is very plausible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MLLETO|title=Epistemic theories of truth: The justifiability paradox investigated|date=1996|last=Müller|first=Vincent C. W|author2=Stein, Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the omniscience principle is very implausible.

The paradox appeared as a minor [[theorem]] in a 1963 paper by [[Frederic Brenton Fitch|Frederic Fitch]], "A Logical Analysis of Some Value Concepts". Other than the knowability thesis, his proof makes only modest assumptions on the [[modal operator|modal]] nature of [[knowledge]] and of [[subjunctive possibility|possibility]]. He also generalised the proof to different modalities. It resurfaced in 1979 when [[W. D. Hart]] wrote that Fitch's proof was an "unjustly neglected logical gem".

== Proof ==
Suppose ''p'' is a sentence that is an ''unknown truth''; that is, the sentence ''p'' is true, but it is not ''known'' that ''p'' is true.  In such a case, the sentence "the sentence ''p'' is an unknown truth" is true; and, if all truths are knowable, it should be possible to know that "''p'' is an unknown truth". But this isn't possible, because as soon as we know "''p'' is an unknown truth", we know that ''p'' is true, rendering ''p'' no longer an ''unknown'' truth, so the statement "''p'' is an unknown truth" becomes a falsity.  Hence, the statement "''p'' is an unknown truth" cannot be both known and true at the same time.  Therefore, if all truths are knowable, the set of "all truths" must not include any of the form "''something'' is an unknown truth"; thus there must be no unknown truths, and thus all truths must be known.

This can be formalised with [[modal logic]]. '''K''' and '''L''' will stand for ''known'' and ''possible'', respectively. Thus '''LK''' means ''possibly known'', in other words, ''knowable''. The modality rules used are:

{|
|- 
|(A)
| '''K'''''p'' → ''p'' || – knowledge [[material conditional|implies]] truth.
|-
|(B)|| '''K'''(''p'' &amp; ''q'') → ('''K'''''p'' &amp; '''K'''''q'') || – knowing a [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] implies knowing each conjunct.
|-
|(C)|| ''p'' → '''LK'''''p'' || – all truths are knowable.
|-
|(D)|| from ¬''p'', deduce ¬'''L'''''p'' || – if ''p'' can be proven false without assumptions, then ''p'' is impossible (which is similar to the [[rule of necessitation]]: if ''p'' can be proven true without assumptions, then ''p'' is [[logical truth|necessarily true]]).
|}

The proof proceeds:

{|
|- 
|1. Suppose '''K'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') 
|- 
|2. '''K'''''p'' &amp; '''K'''¬'''K'''''p'' || from line 1 by rule (B)
|-
|3. '''K'''''p'' || from line 2 by [[conjunction elimination]]
|-
|4. '''K'''¬'''K'''''p'' || from line 2 by conjunction elimination
|-
|5. ¬'''K'''''p'' || from line 4 by rule (A)
|- 
|6. ¬'''K'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from lines 3 and 5 by [[reductio ad absurdum]], discharging assumption 1
|- 
|7. ¬'''LK'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from line 6 by rule (D)
|- 
|8. Suppose ''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'' 
|- 
|9. '''LK'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from line 8 by rule (C)
|- 
|10. ¬(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from lines 7 and 9 by reductio ad absurdum, discharging assumption 8.
|-
|11. ''p'' → '''K'''''p'' || from line 10 by a classical [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]
|}

The last line states that if ''p'' is true then it is known. Since nothing else about ''p'' was assumed, it means that every truth is known.

=== Generalisations ===
The proof uses minimal assumptions about the nature of '''K''' and '''L''', so other modalities can be substituted for "known". Joe Salerno gives the example of "caused by God": rule (C) becomes that every true fact ''could have been'' caused by God, and the conclusion is that every true fact ''was'' caused by God. Rule (A) can also be weakened to include modalities that don't imply truth. For instance instead of "known" we could have the [[doxastic logic|doxastic]] modality "believed by a rational person" (represented by '''B'''). Rule (A) is replaced with:

{|
|- 
|(E)
| '''B'''''p'' → '''BB'''''p'' || – rational belief is transparent; if ''p'' is rationally believed, then it is rationally believed that ''p'' is rationally believed.
|-
|(F)|| ¬('''B'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬''p'') || – rational beliefs are consistent
|}

This time the proof proceeds:

{|
|- 
|1. Suppose '''B'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''B'''''p'') 
|- 
|2. '''B'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'' || from line 1 by rule (B)
|-
|3. '''B'''''p'' || from line 2 by conjunction elimination
|-
|4. '''BB'''''p'' || from line 3 by rule (E)
|-
|5. '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'' || from line 2 by conjunction elimination
|-
|6. '''BB'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'' || from lines 4 and 5 by [[conjunction introduction]]
|-
|7. ¬('''BB'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'') || by rule (F)
|-
|8. ¬'''B'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''B'''''p'') || from lines 6 and 7 by [[reductio ad absurdum]], discharging assumption 1
|}

The last line matches line 6 in the previous proof, and the remainder goes as before. So if any true sentence could possibly be believed by a rational person, then that sentence is believed by one or more rational persons.

Some anti-realists advocate the use of [[intuitionistic logic]]; however, except for the very last line, which moves from ''there are no unknown truths'' to ''all truths are known'', the proof is, in fact, intuitionistically valid.

== The knowability thesis ==
Rule (C) is generally held to be at fault rather than any of the other logical principles employed. It may be contended that this rule does not faithfully translate the idea that all truths are knowable, and that rule (C) should not apply unrestrictedly. Kvanvig contends that this represents an illicit substitution into a modal context.

[[Gödel's Theorem]] proves that in any recursively axiomatized system sufficient to derive mathematics (e.g. Peano Arithmetic), there are statements which are undecidable. In that context, it is difficult to state that "all truths are knowable" since some potential truths are uncertain.

However, jettisoning the knowability thesis does not necessarily solve the paradox, since one can substitute a weaker version of the knowability thesis called (C').
{|
| (C')|| ∃''x''((''x'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''x'') &amp; '''LK'''''x'') &amp; '''LK'''((''x'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''x'') &amp; '''LK'''''x'') || – There is an unknown, but knowable truth, and it is knowable that there is an unknown, but knowable truth.
|}
The same argument shows that (C') results in contradiction, indicating that all knowable truths are known; conversely, it states that if a truth is unknown, then it is unknowable.

'''Gala Galaction''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈgala galaktiˈon}}; the [[pen name]] of '''Grigore''' or '''Grigorie Pișculescu''' {{IPA-ro|ɡriˈɡor(i)e piʃkuˈlesku|}}; April 16, 1879&amp;mdash;March 8, 1961) was a Romanian [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] clergyman and [[Christian theology|theologian]], writer, journalist, [[left-wing]] activist, as well as a political figure of the [[Communist Romania|People's Republic of Romania]]. Contrary to the spirit of the time, he was a promoter of tolerance towards the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish minority]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in the village of [[Didești]], [[Teleorman County]], the son of a wealthy peasant and a priest's daughter. His father had traveled throughout the [[Balkans]] on business, and had settled down as an [[Leasehold estate|estate lessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.275&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his primary studies in his native village and in [[Roșiorii de Vede]] (1888–1890), he went on to study at the [[Saint Sava National College]] in [[Bucharest]] (1890–1898), and, after a period of studying philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest]], took a degree in Theology at [[Chernivtsi University|Czernowitz University]]. During the period, Galaction began to take an interest in literature, and was briefly influenced by the ideas of [[Sâr Péladan]], a French [[occult]]ist and poet.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted in 1900 with the [[novella]] ''[[Moara lui Călifar]]'' ("Călifar's Mill"), a sinister story on the subject of demonic temptation; nevertheless, his growing interest in Orthodoxy led him to abandon literature for the following ten years &amp;mdash; his 1914 volume of collected stories, comprising ''[[La Vulturi!]]'' (one of his most famous pieces of writing), was awarded the [[Romanian Academy]] prize.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.281-282&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 1900s activism===
Having spent his early years a disciple of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosopher [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]],&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; he was partisan of [[Poporanism]] and, like his close friend [[N. D. Cocea]], [[socialism]]&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.245; Vianu, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; - tendencies which established him as a leading figure on the left wing of the Romanian political spectrum. According to Vianu's later assessment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The attraction towards socialism during Galaction's youth was always confessed and never was disavowed, although the religious outlook on life, formulated through the influence of his family and his immediate environment, led him to see socialists as [[fellow traveller]]s rather than comrades in battle."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.278-279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Noted for his criticism of the violent repression of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|Romanian Peasants' Revolt]] in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.292&lt;/ref&gt; he soon became an active journalist. With the help of [[Tudor Arghezi]], he edited ''Cronica'' and ''Spicul'', which appeared during [[World War I]] (between 1915 and 1918). Like his friend Arghezi and others, he displayed his sympathy for the [[Central Powers]], and remained in Bucharest under [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|German occupation]], collaborating with the new authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Galaction welcomed the new political mood established by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] (and first manifested in Romania by the activities of the [[Socialist Party of Romania|Socialist Party]] and the [[Strike action|strikes]] of 1918–1919):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We were given to witness with our own eyes how the old worlds are crumbling and how the new ones are born. And it seems to me that the spectacle is at its most interesting as seen from out little Romanian island. [...] The power of the many, let loose all around us, is rising, is fretting, is roaring and is looking for a new balance. Let us not delude ourselves by thinking we could ever see it return to its previous mould. It would be absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Galaction, in Vianu, p.288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At around the same time, he became an enthusiastic advocate of the [[Labor movement in Romania|labor movement]]. A public meeting of factory workers left a lasting impression on him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Out of the smoldering and mud-covered suburbs, out of the humid and suffocating basements, out of the thousands of only too small cells, where the [[Proletariat|proletarian]] bee distills the honey of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] drones, out of all places high and low, the working people had come in black flocks in order to increase, standing shoulder to shoulder, the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] of socialist demands."&lt;ref&gt;Galaction, in Vianu, p.289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon after the war, Galaction befriended [[Nicolae Tonitza]], a painter and illustrator of socialist newspapers who produced the cover of Galaction's collection of essays (''O lume nouă'') and painted his portrait under the title "The Man of a New World".&lt;ref name="Zambaccian"&gt;Zambaccian&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir of the period, the art collector [[Krikor Zambaccian]] described the latter as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"that hallucinatory portrait [...]. On a background of intense blue is profiled the [[Magi|mage]]-like figure of the writer Galaction; on the most distant plane emerge the silhouettes of industries and rise up the chimneys of factories."&lt;ref name="Zambaccian"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interwar===
In 1922, he was [[Anointing|anointed]] priest, and in 1926 he became professor of Theology and [[New Testament]] Studies at the [[Chişinău]] University Theology School. He was [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the School between 1928 and 1930.

Together with priest Vasile Radu, he worked on a new translation of the ''[[Bible]]'' into [[Romanian language|modern Romanian]], a work published in 1938, meant as a newer and more accurate version to replace the traditional ''[[Cantacuzino Bible]]''. The literary critic [[Tudor Vianu]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] the new translation, accomplished through the means created by newer literary evolution and with the talent of a [[Modernist literature|modern poet]], presents a major [[Philology|philological]] and artistic interest."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.282-283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[interwar period]], Galaction was also the author of several studies, articles and commentaries on the ''New Testament'', as well as completing a celebrated translation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matei-Chesnoiu, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed regularly to ''[[Viața Românească]]'' and ''[[Adevărul]]'', as well as to ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', but was on exceptionally bad terms with the latter's founder, [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref name="Tănase"&gt;Tănase&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, he was the subject of a denunciation for "[[Communism|communist]] activities" and alleged links with the [[Comintern]], which he dismissed as [[slander]].&lt;ref name="Tănase"/&gt; Nevertheless, in 1938–1940, Galaction, like other figures on the Poporanist and socialist Left (among them [[Armand Călinescu]], [[Petre Andrei]], [[Mihai Ralea]], [[Ioan Flueraș]], and [[Mihail Ghelmegeanu]]), was attracted into collaboration with the [[Fascism|fascist]]-inspired [[Corporatism|corporatist]] regime created, as a means to combat the influence of the pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Iron Guard]], around [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] and the [[National Renaissance Front]].&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.264&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the outbreak of the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|September Campaign]] and [[World War II]], he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The war has begun. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] the monster or the [[demigod]], the lever of destiny or the Devil's puppet, has again lifted the banner of death amid the borders of peoples. Is he the forerunner and the prophet of better times, or the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] of downfalls and irremediable disasters? Are the Germans fighting for a better future, or for the [[narthex]] of [[Barbarian|barbarity]] and for the death of Europe? This is yet another pathetic scrutiny! [[Christendom|Christian peoples]] turn their backs on [[Calvary|The Calvary]], disavow the laws of their upbringing and mock the [[Sermon on the Mount|Nine Joys]]! The [[Nazism and religion|De-Christianized]] Germans and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Second Polish Republic|Poles]] are equally vainglorious and lacking in Christian spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Galaction, in Dolghin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1940s===
The fall of Carol's rule and the establishment of the Iron Guard's [[National Legionary State]] saw Galaction's retreat from public life, prolonged after the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Legionnaires' Rebellion]] and the onset of [[Ion Antonescu]]'s dictatorship. In 1944, as the [[Romania during World War II#The royal coup|August 23 coup]] overthrew Antonescu, taking Romania out of the [[Axis Powers|Axis camp]] and opening the country to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence, Galaction expressed his enthusiasm:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The long-awaited hour has arrived during a night when our hearts were being estinguished with fear and our houses were falling apart... It has arrived after traveling a long way, passing among ruins, tombs, and smoke-covered towers... It is here!... Become an epoch, become a century, you long-awaited hour!"&lt;ref&gt;Galaction, in Vianu, p.293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon after, Galaction began collaborating with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and its various organizations. In 1947, he replaced the purged [[Nichifor Crainic]] as a member of the [[Romanian Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu; Popescu Gogan&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected vice-president of the [[Romanian Writers' Union|Writers' Union]] in the same year; Galaction was himself purged from the Academy later in the same year, and readmitted as an honorary member in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu Gogan&lt;/ref&gt; Many times decorated, he was also elected to the [[Parliament of Romania]] (1946–1948), and to its successor, the [[Great National Assembly]] (a legislative body of little actual relevance; 1948–1952).

===Final years===
One of the last causes he was involved in was the [[peace movement]] (in the context of the [[Cold War]]), with the intention of helping in the creation of a "supreme [[areopagus]] of peace".&lt;ref&gt;Galaction, in Vianu, p.294&lt;/ref&gt; He was bedridden for the final years of his life, due to a [[stroke]]; this probably accounted for the scarcity in criticism aimed at him during the [[Zhdanov Doctrine|Zhdanovist campaign]] in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.374-375&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Diary'' was only published, selectively, two decades after his death, under the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime. The newer edition contains the [[Censorship|censored]] discourse of an embittered Galaction, who had become heavily critical of [[Stalinism]], while reviewing his own beliefs in an "[[New Testament|Evangelical]] and cloud-like" socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Galaction, in Mihăilescu&lt;/ref&gt;

Galaction was also noted for the support he gave to [[Constantin Galeriu]], who later became a celebrated priest and theologian. Galeriu, who had been one of Galaction's favourite students, was rescued by the latter in 1952, after he was arrested and imprisoned at the [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]] (Galaction successfully called on [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Petru Groza]] to intervene in his favor).&lt;ref&gt;"Făcătorul de pace"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Galaction had four daughters, one of whom, Maria or Mărioara, was married to Șerban Țuculescu, the brother of painter [[Ion Țuculescu]] in 1936;&lt;ref&gt;Ivaniuc &amp; Velescu; Tănase&lt;/ref&gt; one was the actress Elena Galaction Stănciulescu and the other two, Magdalena and Lucreția, married Italian citizens &amp;mdash; the husband of Luki Galaction (Galaction Passarelli or Galaction Sciarra), who was a painter and a writer, was [[Domenico Sciarra]], a prominent figure of the [[Italian fascism|Fascist regime]] (whom Gala Galaction was visiting in [[Rome]] at the time of his denunciation).&lt;ref name="Tănase"/&gt;

A friend of Communist politician [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]], Galaction helped his Jewish wife Herta Schwamen avoid [[Anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] measures enforced in 1938 by the [[National Christian Party]] government, [[Baptism|baptizing]] her Romanian Orthodox (she consequently took the Christian name Elena).&lt;ref&gt;Antoniu &amp; Târziu&lt;/ref&gt;

Galaction was a lifelong friend of the journalist [[Vasile Demetrius]], whom he first collaborated with during the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;Zalis, p.VI-VII&lt;/ref&gt; He was also close to Vasile's daughter, the novelist and actress [[Lucia Demetrius]], who expressed her gratitude for the moral support he gave her family after Vasile Demetrius died.&lt;ref&gt;Zalis, p.VII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Jewish community ==
Galaction published articles in several Romanian-Jewish periodicals, such as ''Mântuirea'' (1919–1922), ''Lumea Evree'' (1919–1920), ''Știri din Lumea Evreiască'' (1924–1925) and ''Adam'' (1929–1939).&lt;ref&gt;Cernătescu&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions were later collected in the volume ''Sionismul la Prieteni'' ("[[Zionism]] among Friends"), published in 1919. Alongside his praise for [[Theodor Herzl]], whom he considered "the greatest [[Israelite]] in the modern world",&lt;ref name="Galaction, in Cernătescu"&gt;Galaction, in Cernătescu&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever reads and loves the Bible cannot hate [[Land of Israel|Israel]]."&lt;ref name="Galaction, in Cernătescu"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1930, he was a [[Pilgrimage|pilgrim]] to [[Jerusalem]], visiting the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] together with his lifelong friend and brother-in-law of his daughter, the painter Ion Ţuculescu,&lt;ref&gt;Ivaniuc &amp; Velescu&lt;/ref&gt; and both their families. Reviewing his travel memoir ''În pământul făgăduinței'' ("In the [[Promised land|Promised Land]]"), [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], a fellow writer at ''[[Viața Românească]]'', thought that Galaction's attitude was linked to both his own theological outlook on tolerance and the branch of Christianity he represented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[A] tolerant character is, after all, what sets Orthodoxy apart. Father Galaction turns this into his point of honor. On the same ship as him there were many Jewish immigrants, setting for Palestine. «Brave soldiers of such a passionate and sacrifice-eager ideal!» exclaims Father Galaction. That is, indeed, an exclamation that goes beyond faith (or, in any case, stems from plaits of the soul other than faith)."&lt;ref&gt;Philippide, p.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In late 1947, Galaction welcomed the more decisive steps taken towards the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|creation of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, in remembrance of his role, a square in [[Jerusalem]] bears his name.

{{nihongo|'''Gangō-ji'''|元興寺}} is an ancient [[Buddhist]] [[temple]], that was once one of the  powerful [[Nanto Shichi Daiji|Seven Great Temples]], in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]].

==History==
The original foundation of the temple was by [[Soga no Umako]] in [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], as [[Asuka-dera]]. The temple was moved to Nara in 718, following the capital relocation to [[Heijō Palace|Heijō-kyō]].
 
Gangō-ji initially held as many as seven halls and pagodas in its precincts, which occupied a wide area within what is now [[Naramachi]], the preserved district of modern Nara city. The original architecture was however, lost over time and notably in fires during the 15th through 19th centuries ([[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] and [[Edo period]]s respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Pamphlet printed by 元興寺文化財研究所 (''Gangō-ji bunkazai kenkyūsho'')[http://www.gangoji.or.jp/], distributed on site for visitors&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[Image:Gangoji09nt3200.jpg|thumb|right|Gangō-ji Gokurakubo zenshitsu]]
[[Image:Gango-ji pagoda.jpg|thumb|upright|Gangō-ji miniature pagoda]] The best preserved part of the temple is known as '''Gangō-ji Gokurakubō''' (元興寺極楽坊) and belongs to the Shingon-risshū school. This site is a part of a group of temples, shrines and other places in Nara that [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] has designated as [[World Heritage Site]] "[[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara]]", and holds three [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasures]]:

* the [[Hondō]] (本堂, the main hall), or the Gokurakubō (極楽坊), which is one of the few well-preserved structure of the temple,
* the [[Zen]] room
* the miniature (5.5 meters tall) five-story pagoda

Most of the destroyed complex ground has been altered and melded with parts of Naramachi over the course of time. Another small part of the temple remains today as the other Gangō-ji, of a [[Kegon]] school but with few remainders in terms of architecture.

== Gangō-ji in the Man'yōshū ==
{{relevance}}
The ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' includes a poem attributed to a monk of Gango-ji.  This poet laments that, having attained enlightenment, his greater understanding remains unnoticed by others in the streets of Nara.  His poem may perhaps bemoan his undervalued condition—and yet, in a modest way, his words transport contemporary readers momentarily back to share his quiet, 8th century perspective:

:::A White gem unknown of men --
:::  Be it so if no one knows!
:::Since I myself know its worth
:::Although no other --
:::Be it so if no one knows!
::::  -- A monk of the Gango-ji Temple&lt;ref&gt;Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai. (1969). ''The Manyōshū,'' p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was popularly known as '''Chalky Duggan''' - after a featherweight boxer who fought in 1919, when Duggan was 7 years old, under the name "Chalky Duggan" and who, like Duggan, came from [[Runanga, New Zealand|Runanga]]&lt;ref name="Dominion"&gt;Tim Donoghue, "Priest vigorously defended religious ideals with letter writing", ''The Dominion Post'', 5 January 2013, pg. B6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in Runanga and was educated by the [[Marist Brothers#Oceania|Marist Brothers]] in [[Greymouth]] and by the [[Sisters of Mercy]] in [[Reefton]]. He received his secondary education from the Marist fathers at [[St Bede's College, Christchurch]], of which he was dux two years in a row. Duggan then went to [[Marist Seminary|Greenmeadows Seminary]] in [[Hawkes Bay]] in [[Hawke's Bay]], where he was professed as a member of the Marist order on 4 February 1931, the day after the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Dominion"/&gt;

==Training==
In 1933 Duggan was sent to Rome to continue his theological studies.  He was an [[List of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|alumnus]] of the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas (''the Angelicum'')]] of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. He was ordained a Catholic priest in Rome on 7 March 1936, the [[feast day]] of [[St Thomas Aquinas]]. In 1937, he completed his theology studies. His doctoral thesis was on ''The Church in the Writing of St John Fisher''.&lt;ref name="Dominion"/&gt;

==Academic career and contribution==
In 1938 Duggan returned to New Zealand and joined the seminary staff at Mount St Mary's, Greenmeadows to teach philosophy to aspirant Marists. His lifelong philosophic position was his dedication to [[Thomistic|Thomistic philosophy]] which he stated was, "the one philosophy that can integrate the wisdom of the past with the facts of modern science". He published several books and also worked in various colleges and parishes throughout New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

He achieved public fame through his books and, especially after his retirement from teaching and from priestly ministry, for his numerous letters to the editor in newspaper and journal columns to defend the traditional position of the Catholic Church in relation to many issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Long-serving priest dies at 100|newspaper=Stuff news|date=17 December 2012|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8089905/Long-serving-priest-dies-at-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Wellington journalist one described Duggan as "chief among the divine publicists".&lt;ref name="Dominion"/&gt;

'''Good Garage Scheme''' is a series of same name [[automobile repair shop]] monitoring schemes in the United Kingdom (UK), claiming to improve industry repair standards for the benefit of consumers.  The service is not run by an independent organisation, but by a company manufacturing lubricants and other automotive products, and any garage wanting to be member is required to recommend and sell the products from this company.  The scheme provides some benefits to customers for example accountability and feedback, however the motivation and impartialness of the website has been called into question causing some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=2790144|title=Good Garage Scheme – Beware – MoneySavingExpert.com Forums|website=forums.moneysavingexpert.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Trade]] Secretary [[Stephen Byers]] raised the idea for a government "good garage" scheme in December 2000. After Good Garage Scheme (government) was released in 2002, the [[Automotive industry in the United Kingdom|motor industry]] sought to develop its own good garage scheme in May 2003 as a way of self-regulating its garage members. By 2006, the motor industry had not implemented its Good Garage Scheme (industry). At about that same time, [[Coventry, England|Coventry]], England based [[Forte Lubricants]], a manufacturer of petrol and diesel-operated engine additives typically used in garages, maintained a website that supported Forte Lubricants' own association of vehicle workshops/garages, where each member garage agreed to comply with some of the good garage scheme material published by the [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Department of Trade and Industry]]. The resulting Good Garage Scheme (Forte), an online [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulatory body]] operated by Forte Lubricants for independent workshops and [[Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change|Minister for Transport]] Centres throughout the United Kingdom, has grown from about 800 member garages in 2006 to about 3,000 member garages in 2010.

==History==

===Good Garage Scheme (government) and Good Garage Scheme (industry)===
In December 2000, [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Trade]] Secretary [[Stephen Byers]], a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[North Tyneside (UK Parliament constituency)|North Tyneside]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]], raised the idea of "good garage" schemes for garages along the same lines as the [[Star (classification)#Hotel classifications in Britain|AA star ratings for hotels]] or [[Michelin Guide#Michelin stars and other ratings|Michelin stars for restaurants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caig|first=Jon|title=Garage cowboys face spot checks by 'spies' in major crackdown in car repair rip-offs |newspaper=[[Express on Sunday]]|date=3 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2001, the UK government released details of a 'good garage' scheme proposal to address sub-standard servicing operations in the consumer market.&lt;ref name="sparks"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK: Government sparks garage scheme row. Does Government garage scheme go far enough?|newspaper=[[The Gale Group|Fleet News]]|date=27 September 2001|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in a 2001 [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) task force report entitled ''&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10068/541120 Jacking Up Standards],&lt;/span&gt;'' the Good Garage Scheme (government) provided that the government would assist fleet managers to identify garages that offer a better quality service, and would more particularly address received complaints.&lt;ref name="sparks"/&gt; Detractors to the proposals indicated that it duplicated work already done by the [[Retail Motor Industry Federation]] (RMI) and, per the [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]], the proposal did not go far enough and needed a compulsory licensing programme for servicing operations.&lt;ref name="sparks"/&gt; In response, the Department of Trade and Industry made efforts to include [[kitemark]]s for respected mechanics, but by the summer of 2002 admitted that including that UK product and service quality certification mark was difficult to organise with the kitemark [[United Kingdom trade mark law|trademark]] owner, [[BSI Group|The British Standards Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New drive to target car servicing rip-off|first=Fletcher|last=Victoria|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=16 July 2002|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2002, RMI announced that it had its own Good Garage scheme to allow the garage industry itself to establish a mark of quality to boost consumer confidence and provide a controlled framework for garages to operate within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Improving Garage Standards|newspaper=[[Wells Journal]]|date=6 August 2002|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BSI Group Chiswick London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Standards Institute]] Group head office building in [[Chiswick]], London]]
In September 2002, DTI Consumer Minister [[Melanie Johnson]] released Good Garage Scheme (government), a Government-backed voluntary code having minimum standards "backed by regular undercover checks to ensure garages meet the standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Mark|title=Shocking cost of car repair cheats|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=16 September 2002|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme, summarised in a "''Be Garage Wise''" guide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consumer Motor Industry|newspaper=[[PA News]]|date=17 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; had no funding and [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] expected the funding to come from the [[Automotive industry in the United Kingdom|motor industry]] itself "as the price it has to pay to put its own house in order."&lt;ref name="Blowing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Repair rules to stop you blowing a gasket|first=Ray|last=Massey|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=14 September 2002|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, the government did not invite trade associations such as RMI, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and the [[Scottish Motor Trade Association]] to the DTI Good Garage scheme announcement meeting; each association previously had refused to submit garages within their organisations to a system of independent inspection.&lt;ref name="Blowing"/&gt; About a week after DTI's Good Garage scheme announcement, trade associations announced that they would develop their own Good Garage scheme to be maintained by a [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulatory body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garage Service Shame|newspaper=[[Nottingham Evening Post]]|date=25 September 2002|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, motor industry representatives and representatives from the Office of Fair Trading signed an agreement to create an industry run Good Garage Scheme (industry) that would set standards for local garages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Motor Mail: Industry announces consumer watchdog to set standards for local garages|first=David|last=Jones|newspaper=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=16 May 2003|department=Features|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2006, the motor industry had not yet implemented its promised Good Garage Scheme (industry).&lt;ref name="Nothings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Good for Nothings|first=Quentin|last=Willson|authorlink=Quentin Willson|newspaper=[[Sunday Mirror]]|date=5 February 2006|department=Features|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[British Standards Institute]], who had been trying to expand their [[kitemark]] quality of assurance to include British motor mechanics, had received fewer than 100 applications and only issued three license to Britain's 25,000 motor workshops.&lt;ref name="Nothings"/&gt; Although these efforts were not succeeding, an Internet website www.goodgaragescheme.co.uk, run by Forte Lubricants, was bringing in good garage scheme members as part of an internet-based association of vehicle workshops/garages.&lt;ref name="Putting"&gt;{{cite news|title=Good garages putting you back in driving seat|first=Hayley|last=Harp|newspaper=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=7 May 2007|department=News – Business:Transport|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good Garage Scheme (Forte)===
[[Forte Lubricants]] (Forte or Forté) is a manufacturer of petrol and diesel-operated engine additives, including products such as engine oil fortifiers, engine oil system protectors, cooling system flushes, brake cleaners, air conditioner treatment, cooling system conditioners, as well as other products typically use by garages.&lt;ref name="reported"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forte Lubricants (I) Pvt Ltd is reported to have an about 40% share of the gasoline additives market in India|newspaper=[[Gale (publisher)|Capital Market]]|date=27 July 1997|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forteuk.co.uk/product.php?id=40/Air_Conditioner_Treatment |title=Forté Lubricants products |publisher=[[Forté Lubricants]] |year=2010 |access-date=9 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314005001/http://www.forteuk.co.uk/product.php?id=40%2FAir_Conditioner_Treatment |archive-date=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forte Lubricants is a division of [[Illinois Tool Works|Illinois Tool Works Ltd]] and operates throughout the United Kingdom with a regional network of 100+ sales agents in 11 regions and works with around 9,000+ garages, workshops and franchised dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bridge PR: Forté Bolsters Regional Management Team|first=Business|last=Editors|newspaper=[[Business Wire]]|date=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Forte Lubricants had an about 40% share of the gasoline additives market in [[India]].&lt;ref name="reported"/&gt;

On 23 September 2002, seven days after DTI Consumer Minister [[Melanie Johnson]] released the government Good Garage scheme, Forte Lubricants registered goodgaragescheme.com as a [[domain name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whois.net/whois/goodgaragescheme.com|title=Whois goodgaragescheme.com Lookup|publisher=[[Whois]]|access-date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, just after motor industry representatives and representatives from the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) signed an agreement to create an industry run Good Garage Scheme, the Office of Fair Trading issued a car service checklist that recommended to garages what should be included in a service and enabled consumers to compare what different garages offer as part of a car service.&lt;ref name="Stops"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forte Lubricants Stops Misuse of OFT Name|newspaper=[[PA News]]|date=9 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forte Lubricants then began using the Office of Fair Trading's car service checklist in its promotional material.&lt;ref name="Sorted"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sorted and the City: Slippery customer|first=Andrew|last=Penman|authorlink=Andrew Penman (journalist)|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=11 June 2003|department=Business|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Fair Trading felt that Forte Lubricants' usage of the checklist as well as usage of the OFT's name and logo in its marketing material lead to consumers to believe that the OFT recommended the use of a fuel system cleaner and an engine oil flush, neither of which were addressed by the Office of Fair Trading.&lt;ref name="Sorted"/&gt; In general, the OFT does not approve any products or recommend what products should be used by garages when providing a car service.&lt;ref name="Stops"/&gt; In response to a request by the Office of Fair Trading, Forte Lubricants agreed in June 2003 to stop using the OFT's name and logo in Forte's marketing material as legal action was threatened against Forte.&lt;ref name="Stops"/&gt;

Under the Good Garage Scheme (Forte) publicised in November 2006, Forte Lubricant inspectors would observe each garage applicant to see if they had the proper equipment and that customers were made aware beforehand of likely costs and time and were consulted before any changes were made.&lt;ref name="Repair"/&gt; Once becoming a member of Good Garage Scheme (Forte), a garage was required to comply with a 50-point checklist approved by the Office of Fair Trading as part of an industry standard servicing programme.&lt;ref name="Repair"/&gt; In addition, there was to be "notices in reception areas informing customers of their rights – for instance, they must be shown the replaced part should they ask to see it, and there should be a guarantee leaflet should anything go wrong. Moreover, a complaints procedure should also be in place."&lt;ref name="Repair"/&gt; As noted by Forte Lubricants marketing manager Rachel Greasby "Garages in the Good Garage Scheme have a good reputation and are properly vetted by us."&lt;ref name="Helping"&gt;{{cite news|title=Helping to find reliable garages|first=D.|last=Waite|newspaper=[[Hull Daily Mail]]|date=23 February 2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Good Garage Scheme (Forte) had 1,200 members.&lt;ref name="Helping"/&gt; By May 2007, more than 1,500 garages were involved with Good Garage Scheme (Forte).&lt;ref name="Putting"/&gt; In June 2007, when English actor and comedian [[Ricky Tomlinson]]'s [[Liverpool]]-based Royle Motors garage joined Good Garage Scheme (Forte), the online Forte association had more than 1,700 members.&lt;ref name="Royle"/&gt; "We've joined the Good Garage Scheme because we think it's important to raise the reputation of garages like ours and show we adhere to strict customer service guidelines," actor Tomlinson said at the time his garage became a member.&lt;ref name="Royle"/&gt;

In March 2009, the Good Garage Scheme (Forte) launched a 21-point "Spring Check" for vehicle components such as engine oil, coolant system, brakes, tyres, windscreens, wipers, and lights.&lt;ref name="Beware"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beware: Road salt can be corrosive|newspaper=[[Nottingham Evening Post]]|date=13 March 2009|department=Features-Motoring:Garages|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Dugmore, Technical Manager at Forte,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bridge PR: Forté to Launch New Workshop Consumables Range|newspaper=[[Business Wire]]|date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted, "The Spring Check will enable our membership to give motorists expert advice on the condition of their vehicles and rectify any problems."&lt;ref name="Beware"/&gt; By this time, membership at Good Garage Scheme (Forte) had risen to 2600 member garages and Good Garage Scheme (Forte) registered a new website, ggsbenefits.co.uk, to serve its member garages.&lt;ref name="Beware"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webwhois.nic.uk/cgi-bin/whois.cgi?query=ggsbenefits.co.uk&amp;WHOIS+Submit.x=37&amp;WHOIS+Submit.y=10 |title=WHOIS ggsbenefits.co.uk Query |publisher=[[Whois]] |access-date=9 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2009, Good Garage Scheme (Forte) urged its members to ensure that their vehicle air conditioning system was properly maintained "to avoid a potential major health hazard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keep air-con in good condition|newspaper=[[Nottingham Evening Post]]|date=19 June 2009|department=Features:Nostalgia:Local people|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the website of Good Garage Scheme (Forte) was attracting more than 12,000 new visitors a month, each staying on the site for nearly five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Richard |last=Aucock |title=Good Garages' good web |date=21 July 2009 |journal=Car Dealer Magazine |url=http://www.cardealermagazine.co.uk/publish/good-garages-get-good-website/16081 |access-date=9 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302144654/http://www.cardealermagazine.co.uk/publish/good-garages-get-good-website/16081 |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Good Garage Scheme (Forte) launched an improved version of its goodgaragescheme.com website to better enable motorists to find one of its now 2,734 member garages and to handle the 20,000 customer feedback forms received every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Good to go|newspaper=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garage vows high standard|newspaper=[[Northcliffe Newspapers Group|EE (UK)]]|date=29 July 2009|department=Business:Others:General|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2010, Good Garage Scheme (Forte) had 2,811 member garages.&lt;ref name="Ledbury"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ledbury garage joins standards scheme|newspaper=[[Malvern Gazette]]|date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reported to have been launched in 2006, Good Garage Scheme (Forte) had expanded its consumer protection structure to include a five-star rating system based on a strict Code of Conduct and a 50-point Industry Standard Service.&lt;ref name="Ledbury"/&gt;

'''Govinda Chandra Dev''' (1 February 1907 – 26 March 1971), known as '''Dr. G. C. Dev''', was a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Dhaka]]. He was assassinated at the onset of [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971 by the [[Pakistan Army]].

==Early life and education==
Dev was born in the village of Lauta of the Panchakhanda Pargana (currently [[Beanibazar Upazila]]) of [[Sylhet District]], [[East Bengal]] (now Bangladesh) on 1 February 1907.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Pradip Kumar |year=2012 |chapter=Dev, Govinda Chandra |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dev,_Govinda_Chandra |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestors were high-caste Brahmins who settled in Sylhet from [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name=bp/&gt; After his father's death at an early age, Dev was raised by the local Christian missionaries. Dev passed the Entrance Examination in first division from Biani Bazar High English School in 1925. In 1927, he passed the Intermediate Examination from [[Surendranath College|Ripon College]], [[Kolkata]]. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree with honors from [[Sanskrit College]] in 1929. In 1931, he received his Master of Arts in Philosophy from the [[University of Calcutta]]. He graduated [[summa cum laude]] in both Bachelors and Masters. His Doctoral thesis was titled ''Reason, intuition and reality'', and for this, he received a PhD degree from Calcutta University in 1944. The thesis dissertation was later published as a book titled ''Idealism and Progress''.&lt;ref name=bp /&gt;

==Career==
Dev started his career as a lecturer in Ripon College in Kolkata. As the college was transferred from Calcutta to [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] (now in Bangladesh) during [[World War II]], he moved as well. In 1945, the college re-located to Kolkata, but Dev decided to stay back in Dinajpur as the founding principal of the new branch of Surendranath College (now [[Dinajpur Government College]]). Later, in July 1953, he joined the Department of Philosophy at [[Dhaka University]]. He also served as the house tutor of Dhaka hall (present [[Shahidullah Hall]]) in 1957 before being appointed as the provost of [[Jagannath Hall]] in the same year. Dev was appointed as the chairman of the department of philosophy in 1963. On 1 July 1967, Dev became a full professor. In the late 1960s he taught in [[Wilkes University|Wilkes-Barre College]] in [[Pennsylvania]], USA as a visiting professor. His admirers in the college founded ''The Govinda Dev Foundation for World Brotherhood'' for the propagation of Dev's humanist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jahed/gc_dev.htm|title=On Martyred Intellectual Prof. G.C. Dev: A Philosopher of, by and for the Commoners!|author=Jahed Ahmed |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dev was elected the general secretary of Pakistan Philosophical Congress in the 1960s and held the post till his death in 1971. He also set up a ''Philosophy House'' in Dhaka University to promote and practice his life-oriented and humanist philosophy, which became a center for intellectual and cultural activities in the university.

A lifelong bachelor, Dev donated the bulk of his belongings to the university in his lifetime. The donation facilitated the establishment of ''Center for Philosophical Studies (DCPS)'' at Dhaka University in 1980.

==Assassination==
[[File:University Building No. 34, Secretariat Road, Dhaka 3.jpg|thumb|This monument to the intellectuals killed by the Pakistani soldiers in the area of the [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Central Shahid Minar]] on the night of 25–26 March 1971, lists Dev's name.]]
Dev was assassinated along with the husband of his adopted daughter by [[Pakistan army]] personnel involved in [[1971 Dhaka University massacre]] on the black night of 25 March. At that time, Dev was residing in a university quarter near Jagannath Hall with his adopted daughter Rokeya Sultana and her husband Mohammad Ali. At around 11 p.m., the residents of the house were awakened by the sound of gunfire as the army raided the campus. As Rokeya remarked later, bullets were hitting the house like a hailstorm. The family took shelter in a small room and kept awake the whole night. In the morning of 26 a group of soldiers came to the door. They started banging on the door as they shouted in [[Urdu]], "You son of an infidel, open the door." As Dev proceeded to open the door, the door collapsed on him. Upon entering the house, one of the soldiers hit on his head with his rifle and another one shot him on the chest. Dev feebly asked, "What do you want here, son?" In response, the soldiers shot a few more rounds at him. Two bullets hit him in the head and the other bullets hit him in the chest. Dev died immediately. The soldiers beat Rokeya mercilessly and killed her husband. They also plunged a bayonet into the professor's lifeless body. They later took the dead bodies to the grounds of Jagannath hall where the bodies of the other victims of the massacre were dumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://muktadhara.net/intel.html |title=Profiles of pro Bangladesh Intelligentsia of 1971: Dr GC Deb ( Philosophy Dept, Dhaka University) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031628/http://muktadhara.net/intel.html |archivedate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
Dev wrote over a hundred articles in English and Bangla in national and international journals. He also published seven books in his lifetime –
* ''Idealism and Progress'' (1952)
* ''Idealism: A New Defence and A New Application'' (1958)
* ''Amar Jibandarshan (The Philosophy of My Life)'' (1960)
* ''Aspiration of the Common Man'' (1963)
* ''The Philosophy of Vivekananda and the Future of Man'' (1963)
* ''Tattvavidya-sara'' (1966)
* ''Buddha: the Humanist'' (1969).

Two other books ''Parables of the East'' (1984) and ''My American Experience'' (1993) were published posthumously.&lt;ref name=bp /&gt;

The '''"Hutu Ten Commandments"''' (also '''"Ten Commandments of the Bahutu"''') was a document published in the December 1990 edition of ''[[Kangura]]'', an anti-[[Tutsi]], [[Hutu Power]] [[Kinyarwanda]]-language newspaper in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]]. The Hutu Ten Commandments are often cited as a prime example of anti-Tutsi [[propaganda]] that was promoted by extremists in Rwanda following the 1990 invasion by the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] and prior to the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref name = berry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Power (2002).

'''The Hutu Ten Commandments'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Every Hutu should know that a Tutsi woman, whoever she is, works for the interest of her Tutsi ethnic group. As a result, we shall consider a traitor any Hutu who
:*marries a Tutsi woman
:*employs a Tutsi woman as concubine
:*employs a Tutsi woman as a secretary or takes her under protection.
2. Every Hutu should know that our Hutu daughters are more suitable and conscientious in their role as woman, wife and mother of the family. Are they not beautiful, good secretaries and more honest?&lt;br /&gt;
3. Hutu women, be vigilant and try to bring your husbands, brothers and sons back to reason.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Every Hutu should know that every Tutsi is dishonest in business. His only aim is the supremacy of his ethnic group. As a result, any Hutu who does the following is a traitor:
:*makes a partnership with Tutsi in business
:*invests his money or the government's money in a Tutsi enterprise
:*lends or borrows money from a Tutsi
:*gives favours to Tutsi in business (obtaining import licenses, bank loans, construction sites, public markets, etc.).
5. All strategic positions, political, administrative, economic, military and security should be entrusted only to Hutu.&lt;br /&gt;
6. The education sector (school pupils, students, teachers) must be majority Hutu.&lt;br /&gt;
7. The Rwandan Armed Forces should be exclusively Hutu. The experience of the October 1990 war has taught us a lesson. No member of the military shall marry a Tutsi.&lt;br /&gt;
8. The Hutu should stop having mercy on the Tutsi.&lt;br /&gt;
9. The Hutu, wherever they are, must have unity and solidarity and be concerned with the fate of their Hutu brothers.
:*The Hutu inside and outside Rwanda must constantly look for friends and allies for the Hutu cause, starting with their Hutu brothers.
:*They must constantly counteract Tutsi propaganda.
:*The Hutu must be firm and vigilant against their common Tutsi enemy.
10. The [[Rwandan Revolution|Social Revolution of 1959]], the [[Rwandan monarchy referendum, 1961|Referendum of 1961]], and the Hutu Ideology, must be taught to every Hutu at every level. Every Hutu must spread this ideology widely. Any Hutu who persecutes his brother Hutu for having read, spread, and taught this ideology is a traitor.&lt;ref name = berry&gt;John A. Berry and Carol Pott Berry (eds.) (1999). ''Genocide in Rwanda: A Collective Memory'' (Washington, D.C.: Howard University Press) pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15477">Many early [[Islamic]] [[philosophers]] and [[logician]]s discussed the [[liar paradox]]. Their work on the subject began in the 10th century and continued to [[Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī]] and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] of the middle 13th century&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp97&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp123&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Liar paradox has been well known in [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Latin]] traditions, the works of Arabic scholars have only recently been translated into [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp97/&gt;

Each group of early Islamic philosophers discussed different problems presented by the paradox. They pioneered unique solutions that were not influenced by [[Western philosophy|Western]] ideas.

== Athīr and the Liar paradox ==
Athīr al-Dīn Mufaḍḍal (b. ʿUmar Abharī, d. 663/1264) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[philosopher]], [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]] from the city of [[Abhar]] in [[Persia]]. There is some speculation that his works on the Liar paradox could have been known to Western logicians, and in particular to [[Thomas Bradwardine]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp113&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He analyzed the Liar sentence as follows:

{{quotation|One of the difficult [[fallacies]] is the conjunction of the two [[contradiction|contradictories]] (Jamʿal-naqīḍyan) when someone says, “All that I say at this moment is false”. This sentence (qawl) is either true or false. If it is true, then it must be true and false. And if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is necessarily true and false.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt;}}

In other words, Athīr says that if the Liar sentence is false, which means that the Liar falsely declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is true; and, if the Liar sentence is true, which means that the Liar truthfully declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is false. In any case, the Liar sentence is both true and false at the same time, which is a [[paradox]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athīr offers the following solution for the paradox:

{{quotation|To solve the paradox we say: we should not concede that if it is false then one of his sentences (kalām) is true. For its being true is taken to be the [[De Morgan's laws#Negation of a conjunction|conjunction]] of its being true and being false. Therefore its being false necessitates the non-conjunction of its being true and being false. And the non-conjunction of its being true and being false does not necessitate
its being true.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt;}}

According to the traditional idealization&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{Citation

*Other examples of a counter-instance include: it is false to say that all birds could fly because there are some that could not, like for example [[penguin]]s.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;
*Other examples of an empty subject term include: it is false to say that all [[Magic carpet|flying carpets]] have four corners, and not only because some carpets are round or have three corners, but rather because there are no flying carpets at all.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;

The Liar sentence, however, has neither an empty subject nor counter-instance. This fact creates obstacles for Athīr's view, who must show what is unique about the Liar sentence, and how the Liar sentence still could be only true or false in view of the "true" and "false" conditions set up in the universal proposition's description. Athīr tries to solve the paradox by applying to it the laws of negation of a conjunction and negation of a disjunction.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;

Ahmed Alwishah, who has a Ph.D. in Islamic [[Philosophy]] and David Sanson, who has a Ph.D. in Philosophy explain that Athīr actually claims that:

(1) "It is not the case that, if the Liar Sentence is not both true and false, then it is true."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alwishah and Sanson continue:
"The general principle behind (1) is clear enough: the negation of a conjunction does not [[Logical consequence|entail]] the negation of a conjunct; so from not both true and false you cannot infer not false and so true. Abharī appears to be saying that the Liar rests on an elementary scope fallacy! But, of course, Abharī is not entitled to (1). In some cases, the negation of a conjunction does entail the negation of a conjunct: 'not both P and P' for example, entails 'not P'. As a general rule, the negation of a conjunction entails the negation of each conjunct whenever the conjuncts are logically equivalent, i.e., whenever the one follows from the other and vice verse. So Abharī is entitled to (1) only if he is entitled to assume that ‘The Liar Sentence is true’ and ‘The Liar Sentence is false’ are not logically equivalent."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110/&gt;

The Liar sentence is a universal proposition (The Liar says '''All''' I say ...), so "if it is (non&amp;ndash;[[vacuously]]) false it must have a counter&amp;ndash;instance".&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110/&gt; But in this case scenario, when the only thing that the liar is saying is the single sentence declaring that what he is saying at the moment is false, the only available counter&amp;ndash;instance is the Liar sentence itself. When staging the paradox Abharī said: "if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] and false"&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt; So the explanation provided by Abharī himself demonstrates that both "'The Liar Sentence is false' and 'The Liar Sentence is true' are [[logically equivalent]]. If they are logically equivalent, then, contrary to (1), the negation of the conjunction does entail the negation of each conjunct. Abharī’s 'solution; therefore fails."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp111&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nasir al-Din al-Tusi on the Liar paradox==
[[File:Nasir al-Din Tusi.jpg|[[Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]] commemorated on an Iranian stamp on the 700th anniversary of his death|250px|thumb]]

Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī was a [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|title=Tusi, Nasir al-Din al-|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073899|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[polymath]]&lt;ref name=Nasrp199&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prolific writer: an [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[biologist]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|chemist]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[Islamic physics|physicist]], [[Islamic science|scientist]], [[Kalam|theologian]] and [[Grand Ayatollah|Marja Taqleed]]. He adhered to the [[Ismaili]], and subsequently [[Twelver Shi`ism|Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shī‘ah]] [[Islam]]ic belief systems.&lt;ref name="Ṭūsīp2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ṭūsī|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later [[Persian people|Persian]] scholars.

Ṭūsī's work on the paradox begins with a discussion of the paradox and the solution offered by Abharī, with which Ṭūsī disagrees. As Alwishah and Sanson point out "Ṭūsī argues that whatever fancy thing (conjunction, conditional) Abharī wants to identify as the truth condition for the Liar Sentence, it will not matter, because pace Abharī, we can generate the paradox without inferring, from the negation of a complex truth condition, the negation of one of its parts. We can argue directly that its being false entails the negation of its being false, and so entails its being true."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp114&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ṭūsī then prepares a stage for his own solution of the Liar paradox, writing that:
{{quotation|If a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything, then it is possible that it itself can declare-something-about another declarative sentence.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not see a reason that could prevent a declarative sentence to declare something about another declarative sentence.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt;

With an example of two declarative sentences, (D1) "It is false" and (D2) "Zayd is sitting", Ṭūsī explains how one declarative sentence (D1) can declare another declarative sentence (D2) to be false: "It is false that Zayd is sitting".&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt; There is no paradox in the above two declarative sentences because they have different subjects. To generate a paradox a declarative sentence must declare something about itself. If (D1) falsely declares itself to be not (D1) then this false declaration referencing to itself as being "false" creates a paradox.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt;

Ṭūsī writes: {{Quotation|Moreover, if the first declarative sentence declares itself to be false, then [both] its being true, insofar as it is a declarative sentence, and its being false, insofar as it is that-about-which-something-is-declared, are concomitant. Thus, the following paradox can be generated: The first declarative sentence, which is a declaration (khabar) about itself, namely that it is false, is either false or true. If it is true, then it must be false, because it declares itself to be false. If it is false, then it must be true, because if it is said falsely, then it will become true, which is absurd.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The above conclusions are very important to the history of Liar Paradox. Alwishah and Sanson point out: "It is hard to overemphasize how remarkable this passage is. The contemporary reader will be familiar with the idea that the Liar Paradox is a paradox of selfreference. But Ṭūsī is, as far as we know, the first person to express this idea. This passage has no precedent in any tradition. Ṭūsī has performed three remarkable feats in short order. First, his Liar Sentence is singular: its subject is itself, and it declares itself to be false. Gone, then, is the choice between universal or particular Liar Sentence, and the associated problem of adding further assumptions to generate a genuine paradox. Second, he has characterized the paradox as one of [[List of paradoxes#Self-reference|self-reference]]. Third, he has identified a key assumption that might be responsible for generating the entire problem: the assumption that a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116/&gt;

Recognizing that, if a [[declarative sentence]] that [[Self-reference|declares itself]] being false, is false, this does not necessitate it being true. Ṭūsī says that it would be absurd to say that this declarative sentence is true only because it is not false.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116/&gt; Ṭūsī writes:{{Quotation|. . . its being false, insofar as it is a declarative sentence, does not necessitate its being true. Instead, its being false necessitates the denial of its being false, insofar as it is that-about-which-something-is-declared, and [necessitates] its being false, insofar as it is a declarative sentence. Hence, we should not concede that, in this way, the denial of its being false necessitates its being true.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp117&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ṭūsī then interprets the definitions of "true" and "false", in an attempt to prove that those definitions should not be taken into consideration when dealing with a declarative sentence that declares itself, as its own subject, to be false.

Al-Baghdādī's definition of "truth" and "falsity" says that: ''"truth is an agreement with the subject, and falsity is the opposite of that"''. Ṭūsī argues that this definition cannot be applied to a declarative sentence that declares its own subject to be false because then there are at least two opposite parts that are in disagreement with each other. The same subject cannot be in disagreement with itself. Therefore a self&amp;ndash;referenced declarative sentence that declares itself to be false is neither false nor true, and truth/falsity definitions are not applicable to those sentences.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp121&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|the result of a judgment that applies truth and falsity to something to which they in no way apply, and to apply them in any way is the misuse of a predicate.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp121/&gt;}}

Ṭūsī stopped short from offering a solution for the Liar sentences discussed by Āmidī "All that I say at this moment is false". This sentence presents a different case scenario because it can be interpreted as declaring something about itself, and something about another sentence. The solution for this paradox is absent from Ṭūsī's papers.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp122&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malik Ayaz's chaste love of Mahmud inspired poems and stories, {{sfn|Neill|2008|p=308}}{{sfn|Ritter|2003|p=309-310}} while local Muslim historians and [[Sufi]]s commemorate Malik Ayaz due to his unwavering [[feudalistic]] loyalty to Mahmud Ghaznavi.

==Early life and feudal career==
In 1021, the Sultan raised Ayaz to [[kingship]], awarding him the throne of [[Lahore]], which the Sultan had taken after a long siege and a fierce battle in which the city was torched and depopulated. As the first Muslim governor of Lahore, he rebuilt and repopulated the city. He also added many important features, such as a masonry fort, which he built in the period of 1037-1040 on the ruins of the previous one, demolished in the fighting, and city gates (as recorded by Munshi Sujan Rae Bhandari, author of the ''Khulasatut Tawarikh'' (1596 C.E.). The present Lahore Fort is built in the same location. Under his rule of the city became a cultural and academic center, renowned for poetry.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The tomb of Malik Ayaz can still be seen in the Rang Mahal commercial area of Lahore. The tomb and the garden was destroyed by the Sikhs during their [[Sikh period in Lahore|rule of Lahore]] and the tomb was rebuilt after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]].

==Malik Ayaz in Sufism==
[[Amjad Farid Sabri]] the slain [[Qawwal]] of [[Pakistan]] performed a song dedicated to Malik Ayaz, which praises the man for his [[feudal]]istic loyalty to [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], the song also mentions [[Ajmer Sharif Dargah]] and how it attracts female devotees with the same devotion.

[[File:The Yuza-no-ki.jpg|thumb|A teaching material in [[Ashikaga Gakko]] (Japan) to teach students the importance of moderation. The cup is inclined when it's empty. When you pour water into it, it goes upright. If you pour more water, it becomes inclined again.]]

'''Moderation''' is the process of eliminating or lessening extremes.  It is used to ensure [[Assimilation (sociology)|normality]] throughout the medium on which it is being conducted.  Common uses of moderation include:
*Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the marking of [[Test (student assessment)|student assessments]].
*A [[Forum moderator|moderator]] may remove unsuitable contributions from the [[website]], [[Internet forum|forum]] or [[IRC channel]] they represent in accordance with their [[moderation system]].
*A more proactive nuance is found in the [[Methodist]] church's use of the term for the heads of its conferences.
*A [[neutron moderator]] is used to slow down [[neutron]]s in a [[nuclear reactor]].
*A way of life emphasizing perfect amounts of everything, not indulging in too much of one thing, hence moderation.

== History ==

=== Ancient Greece ===

Moderation is also a principle of life. In ancient Greece, the temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]] bore the inscription ''Meden Agan'' ({{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}}) - 'Nothing in excess'. Doing something "in moderation" means not doing it excessively. For instance, someone who moderates their food consumption tries to eat all food groups, but limits their intake of those that may cause deleterious effects to harmless levels.

According to the [[history of science and technology|historian]] and [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]] [[Steven Shapin]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]], ''Never Pure: Historical Studies of Science as if It Was Produced by People with Bodies, Situated in Time, Space, Culture, and Society, and Struggling for Credibility and Authority'', second edition, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2010, 568 pages, page 245 ({{ISBN|978-0801894213}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Block quote|From the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]] through the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] and [[Galen|Galenic]] corpus, and in the writings of such [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers as [[Epictetus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], health was seen to flow from observing ''moderation'' – in exercise, in study, and in diet.}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Venne Merrymaking peasants.jpg|thumb|''Everything in moderation'', illustration of a [[proverb]] by [[Adriaen van de Venne]], 1650s, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]
Similarly, in [[Christianity]], ''moderationism'' is the position that drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s temperately is permissible, though [[drunkenness]] is forbidden (see [[Christianity and alcohol]]).

In the [[Book of Wisdom]] moderation is listed among the greatest virtues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/8#7|title=scripture|website=www.usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taoism ===

Moderation is considered a key part of one's personal development in Chinese [[Taoist]] philosophy and religion and is one of the three jewels of Taoist thought. There is nothing that cannot be moderated including one's actions, one's desires and even one's thoughts. It is believed that by doing so one achieves a more natural state, faces less resistance in life and recognises one's limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoism.net/articles/mason/ethics.htm#Moderation|title=Taoist Ethics|website=www.taoism.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken to the extreme, moderation is complex and can be difficult to not only accept, but also understand and implement. It can also be recursive in that one should moderate how much one moderates (i.e. to not be too worried about moderating everything or not to try too hard in finding a middle ground)

Moderation as a principle of Taoist philosophy turns up in all three of its main texts. 

=== Others ===

Moderation is a characteristic of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national psyche, more specifically described by the Swedish synonym [[Lagom]]. 

[[Islamic Modernism|Moderate Muslims]] adhere to the concept of contextual relativism as a way to grasp meaning from the [[Quran]].

In an [[internet forum]] a moderator is one who enforces the rules.

'''Mother Heroine''' ({{lang-ru|Мать-героиня}}, ''Mat'-geroinya'') was an honorary [[title]] in the [[Soviet Union]] awarded for bearing and raising a large family.  The state's intent was not only to honor such large families but also to increase financial assistance for pregnant women, mothers of large families, and single mothers, and to promote an increased level of health in mother and child.&lt;ref name="sovietdecree1944"&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union of  July 8, 1944 | publisher = Legal Library of the Soviet Union | date= 1944-07-08 | url = http://www.libussr.ru/doc_ussr/ussr_4500.htm | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was established in 1944 and continued to exist until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

==Award history==
[[File:Awards of the USSR-1945. CPA 986-2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|USSR 1945 stamp]]
The honorary title "Mother Heroine" was established on July 8, 1944 by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.&lt;ref name="sovietdecree1944"/&gt;  Its statute, including multiple increases in available state pensions for these families or single mothers, was amended 15 times from its original establishment until the last amendment contained in Decree number 20 of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of May 7, 1986.

==Award statute==
The honorary title "Mother Heroine" was awarded to mothers bearing and raising 10 or more children. The title was accompanied by the bestowal of the Order "Mother Heroine" and a certificate conferred by the Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].  It was awarded upon the first birthday of the last child, provided that nine other children (natural or adopted) remained alive. Children who had perished under heroic, military or other respectable circumstances, including [[occupational disease]]s, were also counted. The award was created simultaneously with the [[Order of Maternal Glory]] (Russian: ''Орден "Материнская слава"'') and the [[Maternity Medal]] (Russian: ''Медаль материнства''), intended for women with five to nine children.&lt;ref name="sovietdecree1944"/&gt;

They were also entitled to a number of privileges in terms of [[retirement]] pension, the payment of public utility charges, and the supply of food and other goods.&lt;ref name="sovietdecree1944"/&gt;

Approximately 430,000 women were awarded this title during its existence.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

If worn with honorary titles of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.&lt;ref name="decree1099"&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of September 7, 2010 No 1099 | publisher = Russian Gazette | date = 2010-09-07 | url = http://www.rg.ru/2010/09/15/nagrady-dok.html | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award description==
The honorary title "Mother Heroine" entitled the recipient to wear the Order "Mother Heroine", which was a gold star with silver straight rays between the arms forming an inverted pentagon; it was suspended by a silver-plated ring through the suspension loop to a metallic, red-enameled scroll-shaped mount bearing the gilt relief inscription, "MOTHER HEROINE" ({{lang-ru|МАТЬ-ГЕРОИНЯ}}).&lt;ref name="sovietdecree1944"/&gt;

==Post-Soviet awards==
Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the award was abolished in most post-Soviet republics.
* In the [[Russian Federation]] it was abolished in 1991 but replaced in 2008 with the [[Order of Parental Glory]].
* In [[Tajikistan]] it was withdrawn in 1996 to discourage large families.
* In [[Ukraine]] it was canceled upon independence but restored in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TXNBsRCBiLkC&amp;pg=PT220&amp;dq=Mother+Heroine+Ukraine&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FDAeUuimE5Tn7Abxs4CwBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mother%20Heroine&amp;f=false Gender, Politics and Society in Ukraine], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2012, {{ISBN|1442640642}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Kazakhstan]], mothers of 10 or more children have since 1995 been awarded the '''Altyn Alka''' (Алтын алка, "Golden pendant") and mothers of eight or nine children have received the '''Kumis Alka''' (Кумiс алка, "Silver pendant").

[[File:MDragomanov.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque dedicated to Drahomanov in Sofia]]
'''Mykhailo Petrovych Drahomanov''' ({{lang-uk |Михайло Петрович Драгоманов}}; September 18, 1841 in [[Hadiach]] &amp;ndash; July 2, 1895 in [[Sofia]]) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[political theorist]], [[economist]], [[historian]], [[philosopher]], [[ethnographer]] and public figure in [[Kyiv]].

==Biography==
Born to a noble family of Petro Yakymovych Drahomanov who was of a Cossack descent, Mykhailo Drahomanov started his education at home, then studied at the Hadiach school, [[Poltava]] senior school and [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]]. He was also an uncle of Ukrainian poet Larysa Kosach ([[Lesya Ukrainka]]) and brother - Olha Drahomanova-Kosach ([[Olena Pchilka]]). Drahomanov's uncle, Yakiv Drahomanov, was a member of the Decembrist movement and political prisoner for participating in the secret Society of United Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CD%5CR%5CDrahomanovYakiv.htm Yakiv Drahomanov] at the [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; His wife was the famous actress [[Ludmila Dragomanova]]. The couple had one daughter, [[Lidia Shishmanova]].&lt;ref name="Спасов"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Спасов|first1=Спас|title=Ancient Bulgarian legends - Lydia Shishmanova|url=http://bulgarkamagazine.com/%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%88%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA/|website=Българка|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the transfer of [[Taras Shevchenko]]'s remains from [[Saint Petersburg]] to [[Taras Hill]], Drahomanov gave a speech over his tomb when it stopped in [[Kyiv]].

Drahomanov lectured at Kyiv University from 1870 to 1875, but because of the repressions against the Ukrainian movement peaking up in 1876 with [[Ems Ukaz]] was forced to leave the [[Russian Empire]] and emigrated to [[Geneva]]. In emigration he continued his political, scholarly and publishing activities. In 1885–95, he was a professor at the [[University of Sofia]] to his son-in-law [[Ivan Shishmanov]]. Drahomanov wrote the first systematic political program for the Ukrainian national movement. He himself defined his political convictions as "ethical socialism," and was deeply impressed by socialist literature as a teenager.

==Hromada and Socialism==
{{more|Hromada (secret society)}}
[[File:Hromada (Geneva) vol 5 no 1.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Drahomanov was one of leaders of Kyiv hromada (later known as the Old Hromada), while continuing to pursue his academic career.&lt;ref name=enc_ukr&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\D\R\DrahomanovMykhailo.htm Mykhailo Drahomanov] at the [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; Being a member of the Russian Geographic society, he established contacts with Ukrainians of Austria (in Galicia).&lt;ref name=enc_ukr/&gt; Under his influence, the Academic Circle in Lemberg ([[Lviv]]) adopted the Ukrainian democratic platform.&lt;ref name=enc_ukr/&gt; As a victim of anti-Ukrainian repressive measures by the Russian government, in 1875 Drahomanov was fired from the Kyiv University.&lt;ref name=enc_ukr/&gt;

In 1876 Drahomanov became a spokesman of Hromada abroad ([[Western Europe]]) while settling in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=enc_ukr/&gt; Between 1878-1882 he published a Ukrainian political magazine ''Hromada'' and number of Russophone pamphlets.&lt;ref name=enc_ukr/&gt; Drahomanov also created a Ukrainian socialist organization the Geneva Circle.&lt;ref name=enc_ukr/&gt; In 1886 his political stance became not aligned with the political views of Hromada, which resulted in a rift between then, and the society in Ukraine losing its financial support.&lt;ref name=enc_ukr/&gt;

==Legacy==
The lasting legacy of Drahomanov can be discerned in the whole Ukrainian tradition of leftist political parties and political activism. He personally influenced a handful of younger Ukrainian intellectuals in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Habsburg Galicia]] in the late 1870s, first of all [[Ivan Franko]] and [[Mykhailo Pavlyk]], both of whom accepted his ideas although reworked them later according to their own mould. In 1890 these intellectuals founded the first Ukrainian political party - [[Ukrainian Radical Party|Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party]]. The program-maximum of this party was socialist and therefore the party can be seen as one of the first socialist parties in Eastern Europe.

Drahomanov tried to popularize an orthographic reform, called the ''[[Drahomanivka]]'' after him.

In 1991, the "Kyivan State Pedagogical University Named After Mykhaylo Drahomanov" in Kyiv was founded on the basis of the former "Kyivan State Pedagogical University Named After [[Maxim Gorky]]". In 1997, the university was granted "National University"-status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npu.edu.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=139&amp;Itemid=134 |title=Історична довідка |publisher=Npu.edu.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolay Konstantinovich Mikhaylovsky''' ({{Lang-ru|Никола́й Константи́нович Михайло́вский}}) ({{OldStyleDate|27 November|1842|15 November}}, [[Meshchovsk]]–{{OldStyleDate|10 February|1904|28 January}}, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[Russia]]n literary critic, sociologist, writer on public affairs, and one of the theoreticians of the [[Narodniki]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isras.ru/files/File/Istoriya_i_sovremen/2010_2/Grinin.pdf Гринин Л.

== Biography ==
The school of thinkers he belonged to become famous in Russia in the 1870s and 1880s as exponents of political and economic reforms. He was a contributor to ''[[Otechestvennye Zapiski]]'' (from 1869 until it was suppressed in 1884. He became coeditor of ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'' in 1873, and from 1890 until his death in 1904 he was coeditor of ''Russkoye Bogatstvo'' ("Russian Treasure") with [[Vladimir Korolenko]]. His collected writings were published in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Americana|wstitle=Mikhailovski, Nikolai Konstantinovitch|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought ==

===Social philosophy===
In his works, Mikhaylovsky developed the idea of the relationship between the [[hero]] and the masses ([[crowd]]). Contrary to the ideas popular among revolutionary-minded people of the late 19th-early 20th centuries that an [[individual]] having strong character or talent is able to fulfil incredible things and even change of the course of [[history]], in the articles "Heroes and Crowd" (1882) and others, Mikhaylovsky presents a new theory and shows that an individual does not necessarily mean an outstanding individual, but any individual who by chance finds himself within certain circumstances in the lead or just ahead of the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhaylovsky, N. K. 1998. ''Heroes and Crowd: Collected Works in Sociology''. 2 vols. St. Petersburg: Aleteya. In Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; Mikhaylovsky emphasizes that at definite moments an individual can give substantial strength to a crowd (through his emotional and actions), and so the whole event can acquire a special power. Thus, the role of an individual depends on its psychological influence is reinforced by mass perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010. "The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration." ''Social Evolution &amp; History'', Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95–136)[http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikhaylovsky was one of the radical thinkers who were 'acutely conscious of their wealth and privilege', as the psychological inspiration of the revolution was guilt, writing: 'We have come to realise that our awareness of the universal truth could only have been reached at the cost of the age-old suffering of the people. We are the people's debtors and this debt weighs down on our conscience.'&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando: ''A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891–1924''. The Bodley Head, London (2014). p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikhaylovsky regarded the historical process as a progression of social environment differentiation, eventually leading to the emergence of individuality. The struggle for individuality was seen as a matter of environment adapting to personality, in contrast to the Darwinist notion of struggle for existence, in which an individual adapts to the environment. Criticizing Darwinists for the transference of biological laws onto societal development, Mikhailovsky thought it necessary to expand Darwinism with 1) [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]’s law, in compliance with which organisms develop from the simple to the complex, and 2) the solidarity principle, at the base of which lies simple cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Efremenko D., Evseeva Y. "Studies of Social Solidarity in Russia: Tradition and Modern Trends," ''American Sociologist'', v. 43, 2012, no. 4, pp. 349-365.&lt;/ref&gt; Mikhaylovsky saw the utmost criterion of social progress in obtaining the ideal of a perfect, harmoniously developed person. If simple cooperation is a social union of equals with similar interests and functions and "solidarity" as the main attribute of the society in question, in the case of complex cooperation there exists a highly developed division of labor whose major attribute is the "struggle" of interrelated groups. In his view, a society might reach an advanced stage of development and yet belong to the lower type of organization, as, for instance, was the case with European capitalism based on division of labor and complex cooperation. Hence Mikhaylovsky concluded that peasant Russia lagged behind the capitalist West according to the stage of development, but surpassed it if judged by the type of organization. Furthermore, like the majority of nineteenth-century Russian thinkers, he attached particular significance to the ''[[obshchina]]'' (traditional peasant community), a unique trait distinguishing Russia from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minuvshee.ru/page.php?id=26 Минувшее.

{{Nihongo|'''Ninomiya Sontoku'''|二宮 尊徳||extra=September 4, 1787 &amp;ndash; November 17, 1856}}, born '''Ninomiya Kinjirō''' (二宮 金次郎), was a prominent 19th-century Japanese agricultural leader, [[philosopher]], [[moral philosopher|moralist]] and [[economist]].

==Life==
Ninomiya Sontoku was born to a poor peasant family with a name of Kinjiro in Kayama (栢山), [[Ashigarakami District, Kanagawa|Ashigarakami]]-[[Districts of Japan|gun]], [[Sagami province]]. His father died when he was 14 and his mother died two years later. He was then placed in his uncle's household.

While working in his uncle's land, Sontoku studied on his own. He later obtained abandoned land on his own and transformed it into agricultural land, eventually restoring his household on his own at the age of 20. He achieved considerable wealth as a landlord while in his 20s. He was then recruited to run a small feudal district which was facing considerable financial difficulty. He achieved this by reviving local economy, particularly through agricultural development. The daimyō, hearing of his achievement, eventually recruited Sontoku to run [[Odawara Domain]] then [[Sagami Province]].

It is said that during his administration a famine struck Odawara. Sontoku proposed opening up the public granaries to feed the starving populace. He was opposed by his fellow bureaucrats who reminded him that permission had to be granted by the shōgun for commoners to have access to the rice stores. In that case, Sontoku replied, no one, including the bureaucrats, could eat the public rice before getting the shōgun's approval. They quickly changed their minds and decided that, since it was an emergency, the people should be fed immediately. He was eventually entrusted with one of the shogunate's estate, which was a great honour for someone of his low origin.

His philosophy and methodology became a standard format in feudal land, developmental and economic management. The name "Sontoku" was given to him for his accomplishments. After his death, the emperor awarded him with ''Jyu Yoni'', Lower Fourth Honour under the ''[[ritsuryō]]'' rank system.

==Philosophy==
Though he did not leave written philosophical work, his ideas were later transcribed by his disciples: Tomita Takayoshi, Fukuzumi Masae and Saitō Takayuki. Ninomiya combined three strands of traditional teachings — [[Buddhism]], [[Shinto|Shintōism]] and [[Confucianism]] — and transformed them into practical ethical principles that matured out of his experiences. He saw agriculture as the highest form of humanity because it was the cultivation of resources given by the [[Kami]].

==Economics==
Ninomiya Sontoku emphasized the importance of [[compound interest]] which was not well understood among [[samurai]] and [[peasants]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He calculated the maturity of each interest rate for 100 years to show its significance by using the Japanese abacus ([[soroban]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kouta Kodama edt., ''Ninomiya Sontoku ''; Chuokoronshinsha, 1984, p.42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

He viewed agricultural village life as communal, where surpluses from one year were invested to develop further land or saved for worse years, and shared by members of the community. He was aware that developed land had a lower tax base than established agricultural land, and he was adept at financial management which he applied to his estate. He encouraged migrants from other estates and rewarded them if they successfully established an agricultural household.

He started his own financial institutions called ''gojoukou'' (五常講, ごじょうこう), which appear to be forerunners of [[credit union]]s. Each member of the village union could borrow interest-free funds for 100 days, while the entire membership shared the cost in case of default. The combination of land development, immigration, and communal finance all managed under the diligent use of abacuses was a success and became the standard methodology of economic development in feudal Japan.

==Popular culture==
It is not uncommon to see statues of Ninomiya in or in front of Japanese schools, especially elementary schools. Typically they show him as a boy reading a book while walking and carrying firewood on his back. These statues depict popular stories that said Ninomiya was reading and studying every moment he could.

There is a reference to him in the novel ''[[Obasan]]'' by [[Joy Kogawa]]. The father often tells the story of Ninomiya Sontoku to his children, relating how 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Up early to the mountains for wood before the rooster calls 'ko-ke-kok-ko!' He studies and works every day to feed his baby brother and his mother. That is how he becomes the great teacher, Ninomiya Sontaku of [[Odawara]], Japan."&lt;ref&gt;''Obasan'', [[Joy Kogawa]], 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==War loot==
In October 1994, [[Rollins College]], a small private liberal arts college in [[Winter Park, Florida]], [[United States]] made international headlines when the government of [[Japan]], per a request from [[Okinawa Prefecture]], asked for the return of a statue that was taken as [[war loot]]. It was taken by Clinton C. Nichols, a lieutenant commander in the [[United States Navy]] and Rollins graduate, after the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. Nichols presented the statue of Ninomiya Sontoku in 1946 to then Rollins President [[Hamilton Holt]] who promised to keep it in the main lobby of the college's Warren Administration Building forever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/arts/okinawa-seeks-return-of-statue.html 'Okinawa Seeks Return of Statue'] from ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 24, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the college rejected the offer made by Okinawan officials, who suggested that a replica of the statue would be presented to the school if the original was returned. However, after consulting with the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and the college's board of trustees, then Rollins President Rita Bornstein accepted the offer. The statue was returned to Okinawa in 1995 in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/05/arts/college-is-returning-statue-to-okinawa.html 'College Is Returning Statue to Okinawa'] from ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 5, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing the college with a replica of the original statue, the government of Okinawa and Rollins signed an "agreement of cooperation" that pledges to develop cooperative projects between the college and Shogaku Junior and Senior High School — where the original statue has been placed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/27/us/new-twist-in-cultural-saga.html 'New Twist in Cultural Saga'] from ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oscar Becker.jpg|thumb|right|Oscar Becker]]
'''Oscar Becker''' (5 September 1889 – 13 November 1964) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]], [[logician]], [[mathematician]], and [[historian]] of [[mathematics]].

==Early life==

Becker was born in [[Leipzig]], where he studied mathematics. His dissertation under [[Otto Hölder]] and [[Karl Rohn]] (1914) was ''On the Decomposition of Polygons in non-intersecting triangles on the Basis of the Axioms of Connection and Order.''

He served in [[World War I]] and returned to study philosophy with [[Edmund Husserl]], writing his ''[[Habilitationsschrift]]'' on ''Investigations of the Phenomenological Foundations of Geometry and their Physical Applications'', (1923). Becker was Husserl's assistant, informally, and then official editor of the ''Yearbook for Phenomenological Research''.

==Work in phenomenology and mathematical philosophy==

He published ''Mathematical Existence'' his ''magnum opus'', in the ''Yearbook'' in 1927. A famous work that also appeared in the ''Yearbook'' that year was [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]''. Becker frequently attended Heidegger's [[seminar]]s during those years.

Becker utilized not only [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserlian phenomenology]] but, much more controversially, Heideggerian [[hermeneutics]], discussing [[arithmetic]]al [[counting]] as "being toward death". His work was criticized both by [[neo-Kantian]]s and by more mainstream, rationalist logicians, to whom Becker feistily replied. This work has not had great influence on later debates in the [[foundations of mathematics]], despite its many interesting analyses of the topic of its title.

Becker debated with [[David Hilbert]] and [[Paul Bernays]] over the role of the potential infinite in Hilbert's formalist [[metamathematics]]. Becker argued that Hilbert could not stick with [[finitism]], but had to assume the potential infinite. Clearly enough, Hilbert and Bernays do implicitly accept the potential infinite, but they claim that each induction in their proofs is finite. Becker was correct that [[complete induction]] was needed for assertions of consistency in the form of [[universally quantified]] sentences, as opposed to claiming that a predicate holds for each individual natural number.

==Intuitionistic and modal logic==

Becker made a start toward the formalization of [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]'s [[intuitionistic logic]]. He developed a semantics of intuitionistic logic based on Husserl's phenomenology, and this semantics was used by [[Arend Heyting]] in his own formalization. Becker struggled, somewhat unsuccessfully, with the formulation of the rejection of [[excluded middle]] appropriate for intuitionistic logic. Becker failed in the end to correctly distinguish classical and [[intuitionistic negation]], but he made a start. In an appendix to his book on [[mathematical existence]], Becker set the problem of finding a formal calculus for intuitionistic logic. In a series of works in the early 1950s he surveyed modal, intuitionistic, probabilistic, and other philosophical logics. He died, aged 75, in [[Bonn]].

Becker made contributions to [[modal logic]] (the logic of necessity and [[Logical possibility|possibility]]) and ''[[Becker’s postulate]]'', the claim that modal status is necessary (for instance that the possibility of ''P'' implies the necessity of the possibility of ''P'', and also the [[iteration of necessity]]) is named for him. Becker's Postulate later played a role in the formalization given, by [[Charles Hartshorne]], the American [[process theologian]], of the [[Ontological Proof]] of God's existence, stimulated by conversations with the [[logical positivist]] and opponent of the alleged proof, [[Rudolf Carnap]].

==History of mathematics==

Becker also made important contributions to the history and interpretation of [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematics]]. Becker, as did several others, emphasized the "crisis" in Greek mathematics occasioned by the discovery of [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurability]] of the side of the [[pentagon]] (or in the later, simpler proofs, the triangle) by [[Hippasus of Metapontum]], and the threat of (literally) [[irrational number|"irrational" number]]s. To German theorists of the "crisis", the Pythagorean diagonal of the square was similar in its impact to [[Cantor's diagonalization method]] of generating higher order infinities, and [[Gödel's diagonalization method]] in [[Gödel]]'s proof of [[incompleteness of formalized arithmetic]]. Becker, like several earlier historians, suggests that the avoidance of arithmetic statement of geometrical magnitude in [[Euclid]] is avoided for [[ratio]]s and proportions, as a consequence of recoil from the shock of incommensurability. Becker also showed that all the theorems of Euclidean proportion theory could be proved using an earlier alternative to the [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] technique which Becker found stated in ''[[Aristotle's Topics]]'', and which Becker attributes to [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]]. Becker also showed how a constructive logic that denied unrestricted excluded middle could be used to reconstruct most of Euclid's proofs.

More recent revisionist commentators such as [[Wilbur Knorr]] and [[David Fowler (historian)|David Fowler]] have accused historians of early Greek mathematics writing in the early twentieth century, such as Becker, of reading the crisis of their own times illegitimately into the early Greek period. (This “crisis” may include both the crisis of twentieth century set theory and foundations of mathematics, and the general crisis of World War I, the overthrow of the Kaiser, communist uprisings, and the Weimar Republic.)

==Later thought==

At the end of his life Becker re-emphasized the distinction between intuition of the formal and [[Platonic realm]] as opposed to the concrete existential realm, moved to the terminology, at least, of [[divination]]. In his ''Dasein und Dawesen'' Becker advocated what he called a "mantic" divination. Hermeneutics of the Heideggerian sort is applicable to individual lived existence, but "mantic" decipherment is necessary not only in mathematics, but in [[aesthetics]], and the investigation of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. These realms deal with the eternal and structural, such as the symmetries of nature, and are properly investigated by a mantic phenomenology, not an hermeneutic one. (Becker's emphasis on the timelessness and formal nature of the unconscious has some parallels with the account of [[Jacques Lacan]].)

==Contacts and correspondence==

Becker carried on an extensive correspondence with some of the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of the day. These included [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann]], [[Adolf Fraenkel]] (later Abraham), [[Arend Heyting]], [[David Hilbert]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Hermann Weyl]], and [[Ernst Zermelo]] among mathematicians, as well as [[Hans Reichenbach]] and [[Felix Kaufmann]] among philosophers. The letters that Becker received from these major figures of twentieth century mathematics and leading logical positivist philosophers, as well as Becker’s own copies of his letters to them, were destroyed during World War II.

Becker's correspondence with Weyl has been reconstructed (see bibliography), as Weyl's copies of Becker’s letters to him are preserved, and Becker often extensively quotes or paraphrases Weyl’s own letters. Perhaps the same can be done with some other parts of this valuable but lost correspondence. Weyl entered into correspondence with Becker with high hopes and expectations, given their mutual admiration for Husserl’s phenomenology and Husserl’s great admiration for the work of Becker. However, Weyl, whose sympathies were with constructivism and intuitionism, lost patience when he argued with Becker about a purported intuition of the infinite defended by Becker. Weyl concluded, sourly, that Becker would discredit phenomenological approaches to mathematics if he persisted in this position.

==Nazism and neglect==

It is possible that regard for Becker's earlier work suffered from his later [[Nazi]] allegiances, leading to lack of reference or published commentary by émigré logicians and mathematicians who had fled Hitlerism. His lecture on "The Vacuity of Art and the Daring of the Artist," presents a "Nordic Metaphysics" in fairly standard Nazi style.

According to Oskar Becker the "''rhythm of Nietzsche's [[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]] was identical to the [[Will to power]] and physically in the sense of youth identical to the marching rhythm of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Löwith]]: Mein Leben in Deutschland vor und nach 1933: Ein Bericht, Verlag J.B. Metzler, 2007, {{ISBN|3476021815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two able philosophers who were students of Becker, [[Juergen Habermas]] and [[Hans Sluga]], later grappled with the issue of the influence of Nazism on German academia. The application of Heidegger's ideas to theoretical science (let alone mathematics) has only recently become widespread, particularly in the [[English-speaking world]]. Furthermore Becker's polemical replies probably alienated his critics still further.

'''''Port-Royal Logic''''', or ''Logique de Port-Royal'', is the common name of ''La logique, ou l'art de penser'', an important textbook on logic first published anonymously in 1662 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]], two prominent members of the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] movement, centered on [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]]. [[Blaise Pascal]] likely contributed considerable portions of the text. Its linguistic companion piece is the ''[[Port Royal Grammar]]'' (1660) by Arnauld and Lancelot.

Written in French, it became quite popular and was in use up to the twentieth century, introducing the reader to logic, and exhibiting strong Cartesian elements in its metaphysics and [[epistemology]] (Arnauld having been one of the main philosophers whose objections were published, with replies, in [[Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'').  The ''Port-Royal Logic'' is sometimes cited as a paradigmatic example of traditional [[term logic]].

The philosopher [[Louis Marin (philosopher)|Louis Marin]] particularly studied it in the 20th century (''La Critique du discours'', Éditions de Minuit, 1975), while [[Michel Foucault]] considered it, in ''[[The Order of Things]]'', one of the bases of the classical ''[[épistémè]]''.

Among the contributions of the ''Port-Royal Logic'' is the introduction of a distinction between comprehension and [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], which would later become a more refined distinction between [[intension]] and [[Extension (predicate logic)|extension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kneale|first=William and Martha|title=The Development of Logic|year=1966|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|pages=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roughly speaking: a definition with more qualifications or features (the intension) denotes a class with fewer members (the extension), and vice versa.
The main idea traces back through the [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] to [[Aristotle]]'s ideas about [[Genus (philosophy)|''genus'']] and ''species'',&lt;ref&gt;Joseph C. Frisch, ''Extension and Comprehension in Logic'', Philosophical Library, New York, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; and is fundamental in the philosophy of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russel, ''A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz'', Routlege, London, 1900, 1992.  {{ISBN|0-415-08296-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, it has been related to mathematical [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] in [[Formal concept analysis|Formal Concept Analysis]], and independently formalized similarly by [[Julius Anatolyevich Schrader|Yu. Schreider]]'s group in [[Moscow, Russia|Moscow]],&lt;ref&gt;http://alexei.nfshost.com/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Barwise]] &amp; Jerry Seligman in ''Information Flow'',&lt;ref&gt;Jon Barwise and Jerry Seligman, ''Information Flow: The Logic of Distributed Systems'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-521-58386-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

'''Protestant scholasticism''' was [[academic theology]] practiced by [[Protestant]] theologians using the [[scholastic method]] during the era of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Lutheran orthodoxy]] in the 16th to 18th centuries.{{sfn|"Protestant Orthodoxy"|2006}} Protestant scholasticism developed out of the need to clearly define and defend church doctrine against the [[Catholic Church]] and other Protestant churches. It refers to both [[Lutheran scholasticism]] and [[Reformed scholasticism]]. [[Anglicanism]] never developed a scholastic theology; however, Anglican writers in the 1600s studied [[Church Fathers|early Christian writings]] to prove that Anglicanism had faithfully followed the teachings and practices of the [[early Church]].{{sfn|Campbell|1996|pp=126–127}}

Protestant scholasticism "became the dominant organizational approach to teaching theology in the academies" before its influence began to wane in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Klauber|1998|p=129}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5035">'''Psychochemical warfare''' involves the use of [[psychopharmacological]] agents ([[Psychoactive drug|mind-altering drugs or chemicals]]) with the intention of incapacitating an adversary through the temporary induction of [[hallucination]]s or [[delirium]].&lt;ref name=mid-spectrum&gt;Dando M, Furmanski M 2006. Mid-spectrum incapacitant programs. In: Wheelis M et al. (eds). ''Deadly cultures: biological weapons since 1945''. Cambridge, US: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MotherJones /&gt; These agents have generally been considered [[chemical weapons]] and, more narrowly, constitute a specific type of [[incapacitating agent]]. Although never developed into an effective weapons system, psychochemical warfare theory and research -- along with overlapping [[mind control]] drug research --  was secretly pursued in the mid-20th century by the [[US military]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in the context of the [[Cold War]]. These research programs were ended when they came to light and generated controversy in the 1970s. The degree to which the [[Soviet Union]] developed or deployed similar agents during the same period remains largely unknown.

==History==
===Ancient psycho-chemical use===
The use of chemicals to induce altered states of mind dates back to antiquity and includes the use of plants such as thornapple (''[[Datura stramonium]]'') that contain combinations of [[anticholinergic alkaloid]]s. In 184 B.C., [[Hannibal]]'s army used [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] plants to induce disorientation. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Use by indigenous peoples===
Records indicate that in 1611, in the British [[Jamestown Colony]] of Virginia, an unidentified, but toxic and hallucinogenic, drug derived from local plants was deployed with some success against the white settlers by [[Chief Powhatan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Price|Price, David A.]] (2003), ''Love and Hate in Jamestown: John Smith, Pocahontas, and the Heart of a New Nation'', New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], pg 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, members of a French railway surveying expedition crossing [[Tuareg]] territory in North Africa ate dried dates that tribesmen had apparently deliberately contaminated with Egyptian henbane (''[[Hyoscyamus|Hyoscyamus muticus]]'', or ''H. falezlez''), to devastating effect.&lt;ref name="DKetchum2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James S.

=== Modern military research ===
In the 1950s, the CIA investigated [[LSD|LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide)]] as part of its [[Project MKUltra]]. In the same period, the [[US Army]] undertook the secret [[Edgewood Arsenal human experiments]] which grew out of the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons|U.S. chemical warfare program]] and involved studies of several hundred volunteer test subjects. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was also investigating the possible use of LSD and the chemical BZ ([[3-quinuclidinyl benzilate]]) as nonlethal battlefield drug-weapons.&lt;ref name=mid-spectrum/&gt; The United States eventually weaponized BZ for delivery in the [[M43 BZ cluster bomb]] until stocks were destroyed in 1989. Both the US and Britain concluded that the desired effects of drug weapons were unpredictable under battlefield conditions and gave up experimentation. 

Reports of drug weapons associated with the [[Soviet bloc]] have been considered unreliable given the apparent absence of documentation in state archives.&lt;ref name=Douglass&gt;Douglass JD 1999 ''Red cocaine – the drugging of America and the west''. London and New York: Edward Harle Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian researcher Lajos Rosza wrote that records of [[Hungary]]'s State Defense Council meetings from 1962 to 1978 suggest that the Warsaw Pact forum had considered a psychochemical agent such as [[methylamphetamine]] as a possible weapon.&lt;ref name=MotherJones&gt;{{cite book|title=Mad, Mad War|magazine=Mother Jones|last=Lee|first=Martin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=seYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=May 1982|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rozsa&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu//list/subst.pdf Rózsa L 2009 A psychochemical weapon considered by the Warsaw Pact: a research note.

Q was conceived as the most likely explanation behind the common material (mostly sayings) found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] but not in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]].]]

The '''Q source''' (also '''Q document''', '''Q Gospel''', or '''Q''' from {{lang-de|Quelle}}, meaning "source") is a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] written collection of primarily [[Jesus]]' sayings (''[[logia]]''). Q is part of the common material found in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] but not in the [[Gospel of Mark]]. According to this hypothesis, this material was drawn from the early Church's [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Horsley, Richard A., ''Whoever Hears You Hears Me: Prophets, Performance and Tradition in Q'', Horsley, Richard A. and Draper, Jonathan A. (eds.), Trinity Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-272-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n66bw8rUz5QC&amp;pg=PA150 "Recent Studies of Oral-Derived Literature and Q"], pp. 150–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James D.

Along with [[Marcan priority]], Q was hypothesized by 1900, and is one of the foundations of most modern gospel scholarship.&lt;ref name="5GIntro"&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W.

== History ==
{{Main|Synoptic Gospels}}

For centuries, biblical scholars followed the [[Augustinian hypothesis]]: that the [[Gospel of Matthew]] was the first to be written, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] used Matthew in the writing of his, and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] followed both Matthew and Mark in his (the [[Gospel of John]] is quite different from the other three, which because of their similarity are called the [[Synoptic Gospels]]). Nineteenth-century New Testament scholars who rejected Matthew's priority in favor of [[Markan priority]] speculated that Matthew's and Luke's authors drew the material they have in common with the Gospel of Mark from Mark's Gospel. But Matthew and Luke also share large sections of text not found in Mark. They suggested that neither Gospel drew upon the other, but upon a ''second'' common source, termed Q.&lt;ref&gt;This hypothetical lost text—also called the '''Q Gospel''', the '''Sayings Gospel Q''', the '''Secret of Q''', the '''Synoptic Sayings Source''', the '''Q Manuscript''', and (in the 19th century) '''The [[Logia]]'''—is said to have comprised a collection of [[Jesus]]' sayings. Acceptance of the theories of the existence of "Q" and [[Markan priority|the priority of Mark]] are the two key elements in the "[[two-source hypothesis]]". (See also the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]] and [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|Streeter]].)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. R. W. Wood, New Bible Dictionary (InterVarsity Press, 1996), 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Marsh]], an Englishman, is seen by some as the first person to hypothesize the existence of a "narrative" source and a "sayings" source, although he included in the latter parables unique to Matthew and unique to Luke.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Farmer, ''The Synoptic Problem'', 1964, Macmillan, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1801 work, ''A dissertation on the Origin and Composition of our Three First Canonical Gospels'',  he used the Hebrew letter [[Aleph]] (א) to denote the narrative source and the letter [[Bet (letter)|beth]] (ב) to denote the sayings source.&lt;ref&gt;Hultgren, Stephen (2002). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cmljv-87baAC&amp;pg=PA5 Narrative Elements in the Double Tradition]''. Walter de Gruyter. pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next person to advance the "sayings" hypothesis was the German [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in 1832. Schleiermacher interpreted an enigmatic statement by the early Christian writer [[Papias of Hierapolis]], c. AD 95–109 ("Matthew compiled the oracles ([[logia]]) of the Lord in a [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] manner of speech, and everyone translated them as well he could")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/26/26-2/26-2-pp181-191_JETS.pdf | title=The Date of Papias: A Reassessment | last=Yarbrough | first=Robert W. | journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society |date=Jun 1983 | volume=26 | issue=2 | pages=181–191 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence of a separate source. Rather than the traditional interpretation—that Papias was referring to the writing of Matthew in Hebrew—Schleiermacher proposed that Papias was actually referring to a sayings collection of the apostle Matthew that was later used, together with narrative elements, by another "Matthew" and by the other [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]].&lt;ref&gt;Hultgren, Stephen (2002). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cmljv-87baAC&amp;pg=PA9 Narrative Elements in the Double Tradition]''. Walter de Gruyter. pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838 another German, [[Christian Hermann Weisse]], took Schleiermacher's suggestion of a sayings source and combined it with the idea of Markan priority to formulate what is now called the Two-Source Hypothesis, in which both Matthew and Luke used Mark ''and'' the sayings source. [[Heinrich Julius Holtzmann]] endorsed this approach in an influential treatment of the synoptic problem in 1863, and the two-source hypothesis has dominated ever since.

At this time, the second source was usually called the ''[[Logia]]'', or ''Logienquelle'' (''logia''-source), because of Papias's statement, and Holtzmann gave it the symbol Lambda (Λ). But toward the end of the 19th century, doubts began to grow about the propriety of anchoring its existence to Papias's account. So a neutral symbol Q (which was devised by [[Johannes Weiss]] to denote ''Quelle'', meaning ''source'') was adopted to remain neutrally independently of the collection of sayings and its Papian connection.

This [[two-source hypothesis]] speculates that Matthew borrowed from both [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and Q. For most scholars, Q accounts for what Matthew and Luke share—sometimes in exactly the same words—but that are absent in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]. Examples are the Devil's three [[Temptation of Christ|temptations of Jesus]], the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer, and many individual sayings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]]'', Oxford University Press, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins'' (1924), [[Burnett Hillman Streeter]] argued that a third hypothetical source, referred to as ''M'', lies behind the material in Matthew that has no parallel in Mark or Luke, and that some material present only in Luke might have come from an also unknown ''L'' source.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, Burnett H. ''[http://www.katapi.org.uk/4Gospels/Contents.htm The Four Gospels. A Study of Origins Treating the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, &amp; Dates]''. London: Macmillan and Co., Ltd., 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Four-document hypothesis|hypothesis]] posits that underlying the Gospels of Matthew and Luke are at least four sources, namely the Gospel of Mark and three lost texts: Q, [[M-Source|M]], and [[L source|L]]. (M material is represented by green in the above chart, and L by blue.)

Throughout the remainder of the 20th century, there were various challenges and refinements of Streeter's hypothesis. For example, in his 1953 book ''The Gospel Before Mark'', [[Pierson Parker]] posited an early version of Matthew (Aramaic M or proto-Matthew) as the primary source.&lt;ref&gt;Pierson Parker. ''The Gospel Before Mark''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Parker argued that it was not possible to separate Streeter's "M" material from the material in Matthew parallel to Mark.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Farmer, ''The Synoptic Problem: a Critical Analysis'', Macmillan, 1981 p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qh7b4o6JQpIC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=Aramaic+matthew++%22The+special+sources+may+be+roughly+equated+with+Streeter's+M+and+L%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CAsNiP8nVQ&amp;sig=immjJFyZRoEjVtx73DWH0a5HYYk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AUZBSvO9LcLllAeclqn8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Everett Falconer Harrison, ''Introduction to the New Testament'', Wm. Eerdmans 1971] p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, more than a dozen reconstructions of Q were made. But these reconstructions differed so much from each other that not a single verse of Matthew was present in all of them. As a result, interest in Q subsided and it was neglected for many decades.

This state of affairs changed in the 1960s after translations of a newly discovered and analogous sayings collection, the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'', became available. [[James M. Robinson]] of the [[Jesus Seminar]] and [[Helmut Koester]] proposed that collections of sayings such as Q and Gospel of Thomas represented the earliest Christian materials at an early point in a trajectory that eventually resulted in the [[canonical gospel]]s.

This burst of interest after the ''Gospel of Thomas'''s discovery led to increasingly more sophisticated literary reconstructions of Q, and even to redactional speculation, notably in the work of [[John S. Kloppenborg]]. Kloppenborg, by analyzing certain literary and thematic phenomena, argued that Q was composed in three stages. In his view, the earliest stage was a collection of wisdom sayings involving such issues as poverty and discipleship. Then, he posits, this collection was expanded by including a layer of judgmental sayings directed against "this generation". The final stage included the Temptation of Jesus narrative.

Although Kloppenborg cautioned against assuming that Q's composition history is the same as the history of the Jesus tradition (''i.e.'', that the oldest layer of Q is necessarily the oldest and pure-layer Jesus tradition), some recent seekers of the [[Historical Jesus]], including members of the [[Jesus Seminar]], have done just that. Basing their reconstructions primarily on the ''Gospel of Thomas'' and the oldest layer of Q, they propose that Jesus functioned as a wisdom [[Wise old man|sage]], rather than a Jewish [[rabbi]], though not all members affirm the two-source hypothesis. Kloppenborg is now a fellow of the Jesus Seminar himself.

But scholars supporting the three-stage Q development hypothesis, such as [[Burton L. Mack]], argue that Q's unity comes not only from its being shared by Matthew and Luke, but also because, in the layers of Q as reconstructed, the later layers build upon and presuppose the earlier ones, whereas the reverse is not the case. So evidence that Q has been revised is not evidence for disunity in Q, since the hypothesised revisions depend upon asymmetric logical connections between what are posited to be the later and earlier layers.&lt;ref&gt;The Lost Gospel: The Book Q and Christian Origins'', Macmillan Co. (1993, paperback 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

Some biblical scholars believe that an unknown redactor composed a Greek-language proto-Gospel. It may have been circulating in written form about the time the Synoptic Gospels were composed (''i.e.'', between late 50s and mid 90s AD). The name Q was coined by the German theologian and biblical scholar [[Johannes Weiss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485332/Q |title=Britannica |publisher=Britannica |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synoptic Gospels and the nature of Q ===
{{Main|Synoptic Gospels}}

The relationship among the three synoptic gospels goes beyond mere similarity in viewpoint. The gospels often recount the same stories, usually in the same order, sometimes using the same words. Scholars note that the similarities between Mark, Matthew, and Luke are too great to be coincidental.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Honoré]], "A Statistical Study of the Synoptic Problem." Novum Testamentum Aug. 10-July (1968): 95–147. On page 96 Honoré compares the similarities between the three Gospels with the number of words in common.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford |location=New York |isbn=0-19-515462-2 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the two-source hypothesis is correct, then Q would probably have been a written document. If Q was a shared oral tradition, it is unlikely that it could account for the nearly identical word-for-word similarities between Matthew and Luke when quoting Q material. Similarly, it is possible to deduce that Q was written in Greek. If the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were referring to a document that had been written in some other language (Aramaic for example), it is highly unlikely that two independent translations would have exactly the same wording.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JvO4rj3NOoAC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22Q+source%22++%22two+from+oral+tradition%22+written&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Q%20source%22%20%22two%20from%20oral%20tradition%22%20written&amp;f=false Delbert Royce Burkett, ''Rethinking the Gospel Sources, Volume 2: The Unity and Plurality of Q'', Society of Biblical Lit, 2009] pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Q document must have been composed before Matthew and Luke. Some scholars even suggest that Q predated Mark. A date for the final Q document is often placed in the 40s or 50s of the first century, with some arguing its so-called sapiential layer (1Q, containing six wisdom speeches) was written as early as the 30s.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;[[James D G Dunn|Dunn, James D. G.]], Christianity in the Making Volume 1: Jesus Remembered. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2003. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

If Q existed it has since been lost. Some scholars believe it can be partially reconstructed by examining elements common to Matthew and Luke (but absent from Mark). This reconstructed Q does not describe the events of Jesus' life: Q does not mention Jesus' birth, his selection of the 12 disciples, his crucifixion, or the resurrection. Instead, it appears to be a collection of Jesus' sayings and quotations.

=== Case for ===

The case for Q's existence follows from the argument that neither Matthew nor Luke is directly dependent on the other in the ''double tradition'' (defined by New Testament scholars as material that Matthew and Luke share that does not appear in Mark). But the verbal agreement between Matthew and Luke is so close in some parts of the double tradition that the most reasonable explanation for this agreement is common dependence on a written source or sources. Even if Matthew and Luke are independent (see [[Markan priority]]), the Q hypothesis states that they used a common ''document''. Arguments for Q being a written document include:
* Sometimes the exactness in wording is striking, for example, {{bibleref2|Matthew|6:24}} = {{bibleref2|Luke|16:13}} (27 and 28 Greek words respectively); {{bibleref2|Matthew|7:7–8}} = {{bibleref2|Luke|11:9–10}} (24 Greek words each).
* There is sometimes commonality in order between the two, for example the [[Sermon on the Plain]] and [[Sermon on the Mount]].
* The presence of doublets, where Matthew and Luke sometimes each present two versions of a similar saying but in different context, only one of those versions appearing in Mark. Doublets may be considered a sign of two written sources, i.e., Mark and Q.
* Luke mentions that he knows of other written sources of Jesus' life, and that he has investigated in order to gather the most information.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 1:1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QtE1orv4Xg0C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Doublets+%22arguments+for+Q%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Doublets%20%22arguments%20for%20Q%22&amp;f=false Robert L. Thomas &amp; F. David Farnell, ''The Jesus crisis: the inroads of historical criticism into evangelical scholarship'', Kregel Publications, 1998] pp. 136–140&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that no Q manuscripts exist today does not necessarily argue against its existence. Many early Christian texts no longer exist, and we only know they did from their citation or mention in surviving texts. Once Q's text was incorporated into the body of Matthew and Luke, it was no longer necessary to preserve it, just as interest in copying Mark seems to have waned substantially once it was incorporated into Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;See Tuckett, C.M. "The Existence of Q." pp. 19–48 in The Gospel Behind the Gospels: Current Studies on Q. Edited by R. Piper. Leiden: Brill, 1995 (esp. p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of the International Q Project writes: "During the second century, when the canonizing process was taking place, scribes did not make new copies of Q, since the canonizing process involved choosing what should and what should  not be used in the church service. Hence they preferred to make copies of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, where the sayings of Jesus from Q were rephrased to avoid misunderstandings, and to fit their own situations and their understanding of what Jesus had really meant."&lt;ref name="homes.chass.utoronto.ca" /&gt;

=== Case against ===
While the two-source hypothesis remains the most popular explanation for the synoptic gospels' origins, the existence of the "minor agreements" has raised serious concerns. These minor agreements are those points where Matthew and Luke agree against or beyond Mark precisely within their Markan verses (for example, the mocking question at the beating of Jesus, "Who is it that struck you?" [{{bibleref|Luke|22:64}}//{{bibleref|Matthew|26:68}}], found in both Matthew and Luke but not in Mark, although it should be noted that this "minor agreement" falls outside the usually accepted range of Q.) The "minor agreements" call into question the proposition that Matthew and Luke knew Mark but not each other, e.g. Luke might have indeed been following Matthew, or at least a Matthew-like source. Peabody and McNicol argue that until a reasonable explanation is found the two-source hypothesis is not viable.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DYRVCkDsGQoC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Problems+with+the+consensus+supporting+the+two+document+hypothesis%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Problems%20with%20the%20consensus%20supporting%20the%20two%20document%20hypothesis%22&amp;f=false David Barrett Peabody &amp; Allan James McNicol, ''One Gospel from Two: Mark's Use of Matthew and Luke'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002] pp. 1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, how could a major and respected source, used in two [[canonical gospel]]s, disappear? If Q did exist, it would have been highly treasured in the early Church. It remains a mystery how such an important document, which was the foundation for two canonical Gospels, could be lost. An even greater mystery is why the extensive Church catalogs compiled by [[Eusebius]] and [[Ecumenical Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nicephorus]] would omit such an important work yet include such non-canonical accounts as the [[Gospel of Peter]] and the [[Gospel of Thomas]]. The existence of a treasured sayings document in circulation going unmentioned by early Church Fathers remains one of the great conundrums of modern [[Biblical studies|Biblical scholarship]].&lt;ref name="James R p. 228" /&gt; Pier Franco Beatrice argues that until these issues are resolved, Q will remain in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Pier Franco Beatrice, [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/not/2006/00000048/00000002/art00003 ''The Gospel according to the Hebrews in the Apostolic Fathers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024010210/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/not/2006/00000048/00000002/art00003 |date=October 24, 2012 }}, Novum Testamentum, 2006, vol. 48, no2, pp. 147–95 (ingentaconnect.com)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R.

This view has come to be known as the [[Farrer hypothesis]]. Their arguments include:
* Farrer, in his 1955 paper that first outlined this hypothesis, notes that when we find two documents that contain common material, identical in the words and phrases they use to describe some scenes, the simplest explanation is that one of the two used the other as a source, rather than both using a third document as a source.&lt;ref name="dispensing" /&gt;
* Goulder points to common Matthean phrases such as "brood of vipers", "make fruit", and "cast into the fire" that each appear in Luke only once, in a Q passage. Goulder's conclusion, based on writing styles, is that Matthew is the source for these "Q" sayings.&lt;ref name="juggernaut" /&gt;
* Goodacre notes that there is no extant copy of Q and that no early church writer makes an unambiguous reference to a document resembling the Q that modern scholars have reconstructed from the common material in Luke and Matthew.&lt;ref name="tenreasons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/ten.htm |title=Ten Reasons to Question Q |publisher=Markgoodacre.org |date=January 10, 2003 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While supporters say that the discovery of the [[Gospel of Thomas]] supports the concept of a "sayings gospel", Mark Goodacre points out that Q has a narrative structure as reconstructed and is not simply a list of sayings.&lt;ref name="tenreasons" /&gt;

Other scholars have brought other arguments against Q:
* There is a "''[[prima facie]]'' case" that two documents, both correcting Mark's language, adding birth narratives and a resurrection epilogue, and adding a large amount of "sayings material", are likely to resemble each other, rather than to have such similar scope by coincidence.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* Specifically, there are 347 instances (by Neirynck's count) where one or more words are added to the Markan text in both Matthew and Luke; these are called the "minor agreements" against Mark. Some 198 instances involve one word, 82 involve two words, 35 three, 16 four, and 16 instances involve five or more words in the extant texts of Matthew and Luke as compared to Markan passages.&lt;ref&gt;These statistics are taken from an analysis by Walter M. Shandruk of Frans Neirynck's ''The Minor Agreements of Matthew of Luke and Mark with a Cumulative List'', Leuven University Press, 1974.

[[File:Reciprocal altruism summary.svg|thumb|right|240px|Diagram showing reciprocal altruism]]
In [[evolutionary biology]], '''reciprocal altruism''' is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time. The concept was initially developed by [[Robert Trivers]] to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts. The concept is close to the strategy of "[[tit for tat]]" used in [[game theory]].

==Theory==
The concept of "reciprocal altruism", as introduced by Trivers, suggests that [[altruism]], defined as an act of helping another individual while incurring some cost for this act, could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the individual who was helped before may perform an altruistic act towards the individual who helped them initially.&lt;ref name="trivers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi = 10.1086/406755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept finds its roots in the work of [[W. D. Hamilton|W.D. Hamilton]], who developed mathematical models for predicting the likelihood of an altruistic act to be performed on behalf of one's kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|date=1964|title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior II|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=7|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting this into the form of a strategy in a repeated [[prisoner’s dilemma]] would mean to cooperate unconditionally in the first period and behave cooperatively (altruistically) as long as the other agent does as well.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt; If chances of meeting another reciprocal altruist are high enough, or if the game is repeated for a long enough amount of time, this form of altruism can evolve within a population.

This is close to the notion of "[[tit for tat]]" introduced by [[Anatol Rapoport]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (2006). The Selfish Gene (30th Anniversary ed.). United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-929114-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although there still seems a slight distinction in that "tit for tat" cooperates in the first period and from thereon always replicates an opponent’s previous action, whereas “reciprocal altruists” stop cooperation in the first instance of non-cooperation by an opponent and stay non-cooperative from thereon. This distinction leads to the fact that in contrast to reciprocal altruism, tit for tat may be able to restore cooperation under certain conditions despite cooperation having broken down.

Christopher Stephens shows a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions “… for an instance of reciprocal altruism:&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephens | first1 = C. | year = 1996 | title = Modelling Reciprocal Altruism | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 533–551 | doi = 10.1093/bjps/47.4.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the behaviour must reduce a donor's fitness relative to a selfish alternative;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to non-recipients;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# the performance of the behaviour must not depend on the receipt of an immediate benefit;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# conditions 1, 2, and 3 must apply to both individuals engaging in reciprocal helping.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

There are two additional conditions necessary "…for reciprocal altruism to evolve:"&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

* A mechanism for detecting 'cheaters' must exist.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
* A large (indefinite) number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

The first two conditions are necessary for altruism as such, while the third is distinguishing reciprocal altruism from simple mutualism and the fourth makes the interaction reciprocal.
Condition number five is required as otherwise non-altruists may always exploit altruistic behaviour without any consequences and therefore evolution of reciprocal altruism would not be possible. However, it is pointed out that this “conditioning device” does not need to be conscious. Condition number six is required to avoid cooperation breakdown through backwards induction&amp;mdash;a possibility suggested by game theoretical models.&lt;ref name="Stephens" /&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples could be understood as altruism. 
However, showing reciprocal altruism in an unambiguous way requires more evidence as will be shown later.

===Cleaner fish===
{{further|Cleaning symbiosis}}
[[File:Cleaner station komodo.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cleaning symbiosis]]: a small cleaner [[wrasse]] (''Labroides dimidiatus'') with [[Animal coloration|advertising coloration]] services a big eye squirrelfish (''[[Priacanthidae|Priacanthus hamrur]]'') in an apparent example of reciprocal altruism.]]

An example of reciprocal altruism is [[cleaning symbiosis]], such as between [[cleaner fish]] and their hosts, though cleaners include shrimps and birds, and clients include fish, turtles, octopuses and mammals.&lt;ref name=Grutter&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cleaning symbioses from the parasites' perspective | author=Grutter, Alexandra S. | journal=Parasitology | year=2002 | volume=124 | issue=7 | pages=S65–S81 | doi=10.1017/S0031182002001488}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Aside from the apparent [[symbiosis]] of the cleaner and the host during actual cleaning, which cannot be interpreted as altruism, the host displays additional behaviour that meets the criteria for altruism:

The host fish allows the cleaner fish free entrance and exit and does not eat the cleaner, even after the cleaning is done.&lt;ref name="Eibel-Eibesfeldt"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1955.tb01523.x | title = Über Symbiosen, Parasitismus und andere besondere zwischenartliche Beziehungen tropischer Meeresfische1 | year = 2010 | last1 = Eibi-Eibesfeldt | first1 = T | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidiger"&gt;Heidiger, H. 1968. Putzer-fische im aquarium. Natur und Museum, 98:89–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1958 | title = A review of the Labrid fish genus Labriodes with descriptions of two new species and notes on ecology | journal = Pacific Science | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 327–347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1962 | title = Fish service stations | journal = Sea Frontiers | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 40–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The host signals the cleaner it is about to depart the cleaner's locality, even when the cleaner is not in its body. The host sometimes chases off possible dangers to the cleaner.&lt;ref name="Randall2" /&gt;

The following evidence supports the hypothesis:

The cleaning by cleaners is essential for the host. In the absence of cleaners the hosts leave the locality or suffer from injuries inflicted by ecto-parasites.&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;Feder, H. M. 1996. "Cleaning symbioses in the marine environment". In S. M. Henry (ed.), ''Symbiosis'', Vol. 1, pp. 327–380. Academic Press, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; There is difficulty and danger in finding a cleaner. Hosts leave their element to get cleaned.&lt;ref name="Randall2" /&gt; Others wait no longer than 30 seconds before searching for cleaners elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Eibel-Eibesfeldt" /&gt;

A key requirement for the establishment of reciprocal altruism is that the same two individuals must interact repeatedly, as otherwise the best strategy for the host would be to eat the cleaner as soon as cleaning was complete. This constraint imposes both a spatial and a temporal condition on the cleaner and on its host. Both individuals must remain in the same physical location, and both must have a long enough lifespan, to enable multiple interactions. There is reliable evidence that individual cleaners and hosts do indeed interact repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Randall1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Limbaugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Limbaugh | first1 = C. | last2 = Pederson | first2 = H. | last3 = Chase | first3 = F. | year = 1961 | title = Shrimps that clean fishes | url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1961/00000011/00000001/art00011 | journal = Bull. Mar. Sci. Gulf Caribb. | volume = 11 | issue =1 | pages = 237–257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This example meets some, but not all, of the criteria described in Trivers’s model. In the cleaner-host system the benefit to the cleaner is always immediate. However, the evolution of reciprocal altruism is contingent on opportunities for future rewards through repeated interactions. In one study, nearby host fish observed "cheater" cleaners and subsequently avoided them.&lt;ref name="bshary"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bshary | first1 = R. | year = 2002 | title = Biting cleaner fish use altruism to deceive image-scoring client reef fish | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 269 | issue = 1505 | pages = 2087–2093 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2084| pmid = 12396482 | pmc = 1691138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, true reciprocity is difficult to demonstrate since failure means the death of the cleaner. However, if Randall’s claim that hosts sometimes chase off possible dangers to the cleaner is correct, an experiment might be constructed in which reciprocity could be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Randall1" /&gt;

===Warning calls in birds===
[[File:2012-06-09 16-04-22 Switzerland Kanton Graubünden Sagliaz cropped.JPG|thumb|Eurasian jay, ''[[Garrulus glandarius]]'', gives loud alarm calls from its tree perch when it sees a predator.]]
{{further|Signalling theory}}

Warning calls, although exposing a bird and putting it in danger, are frequently given by birds. An explanation in terms of altruistic behaviors given by Trivers:&lt;ref name="trivers"/&gt;

It has been shown that predators learn specific localities and specialize individually on prey types and hunting techniques.&lt;ref name="Murie"&gt;Murie, A. 1944. The Wolves of Mount McKinley. Fauna of National Parks, Faunal Series # 5; Wash., D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Southern"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Southern | first1 = H. N. | year = 1954 | title = Tawny owls and their prey | url = | journal = Ibis | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 384–410 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1954.tb02332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tinbergen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | year = 1968 | title = On war and peace in animals and man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 160 | issue = 3835| pages = 1411–1418 | doi = 10.1126/science.160.3835.1411 | pmid = 5690147 |bibcode = 1968Sci...160.1411T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = D. F. | year = 1963 | title = Similar polymorphismas in an insect and a land snail | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 198 | issue = 4876| pages = 201–203 | doi = 10.1038/198201b0 |bibcode = 1963Natur.198..201O }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is therefore disadvantageous for a bird to have a predator eat a conspecific, because the experienced predator may then be more likely to eat him. Alarming another bird by giving a warning call tends to prevent predators from specializing on the caller’s species and locality. In this way, birds in areas in which warning calls are given will be at a selective advantage relative to birds in areas free from warning calls.

Nevertheless, this presentation lacks important elements of reciprocity. It is very hard to detect and ostracize cheaters. There is no evidence that a bird refrains from giving calls when another bird is not reciprocating, nor evidence that individuals interact repeatedly. Given the aforementioned characteristics of bird calling, a continuous bird emigration and immigration environment (true of many avian species) is most likely to be partial to cheaters, since selection against the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is unlikely.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt;

Another explanation for warning calls is that these are not warning calls at all:
A bird, once it has detected a bird of prey, calls to signal to the bird of prey that it was detected, and that there is no use trying to attack the calling bird. Two facts support this hypothesis:

* The call frequencies match the hearing range of the predator bird.
* Calling birds are less attacked—predator birds attack calling birds less frequently than other birds.

===Nest protecting===

[[File:Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) attacking, Amsterdam island, Svalbard.jpg|thumb|[[Arctic tern]]s protect their offspring extremely aggressively by very quick drop-downs from a stationary flight over their enemies. Other birds often benefit from this behavior by breeding very close to the Arctic terns.]]
[[Red-winged blackbird]] males help defend neighbor's nests. There are many theories as to why males behave this way. One is that males only defend other nests which contain their extra-pair offspring. Extra-pair offspring is juveniles which may contain some of the male bird's DNA. Another is the tit-for-tat strategy of reciprocal altruism. A third theory is, males help only other closely related males. A study done by The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife provided evidence that males used a tit-for-tat strategy. The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife tested many different nests by placing stuffed crows by nests, and then observing behavior of neighboring males. The behaviors they looked for included the number of calls, dives, and strikes. After analyzing the results, there was not significance evidence for kin selection; the presence of extra-pair offspring did not affect the probability of help in nest defense. However, males reduced the amount of defense given to neighbors when neighbor males reduced defense for their nests. This demonstrates a tit-for-tat strategy, where animals help those who previously helped them. This strategy is one type of reciprocal altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Olendorf, Robert, Thomas Getty, and Kim Scribner. "Cooperative Nest Defence in Red–winged 
Blackbirds: Reciprocal Altruism, Kinship or By–product Mutualism?" Cooperative Nest Defence in Red–winged Blackbirds: Reciprocal Altruism, Kinship or By–product Mutualism?Royal Society Publishing, 22 Jan. 2004. Web. 14 Sept. 2014. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vampire bats===
[[Vampire bats]] also display reciprocal altruism, as described by Wilkinson.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1984 | title = Reciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 308 | issue = 5955| pages = 181–184 | doi=10.1038/308181a0 | bibcode=1984Natur.308..181W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1988 | title = Reciprocal Altruism in Bats and Other Mammals | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 9 | issue =2–4 | pages = 85–100 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90015-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bats feed each other by regurgitating blood. Since bats only feed on blood and will die after just 70 hours of not eating, this food sharing is a great benefit to the receiver and a great cost to the giver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Gerald|title=Food Sharing in Vampire Bats: Reciprocal Help Predicts Donations More than Relatedness or Harassment | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=January 2, 2013 |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3574350/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To qualify for reciprocal altruism, the benefit to the receiver would have to be larger than the cost to the donor. This seems to hold as these bats usually die if they do not find a blood meal two nights in a row. Also, the requirement that individuals who have behaved altruistically in the past are helped by others in the future is confirmed by the data.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson1" /&gt; However, the consistency of the reciprocal behaviour, namely that a previously non-altruistic bat is refused help when it requires it, has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the bats do not seem to qualify yet as an unequivocal example of reciprocal altruism.

===Primates===
Grooming in primates meets the conditions for reciprocal altruism according to some studies.  One of the studies in vervet monkeys shows that among unrelated individuals, grooming induce higher chance of attending to each other's calls for aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Grooming, alliances and reciprocal altruism in vervet monkeys|last = Seyfarth|first = Robert M|date = 1984|journal = Nature |volume=308 |issue = 5959|pages=541–543|doi = 10.1038/308541a0|pmid = 6709060|access-date = |first2 = Dorothy L|last2 = Cheney|bibcode = 1984Natur.308..541S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, vervet monkeys also display grooming behaviors within group members, displaying alliances.&lt;ref name="sibships"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = P.C. | year = 1987 | title = Sibships: Cooperation and Competition Among Immature Vervet Monkeys. | url = | journal = [[Primates (journal)|Primates]] | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1007/bf02382182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would demonstrate vervet monkey's grooming behavior as a part of kin selection since the activity is done between siblings in this study. Moreover, following the criteria by Stephen,&lt;ref name="Stephens" /&gt; if the study is to be an example of reciprocal altruism, it must prove the mechanism for detecting cheaters.

==Regulation by emotional disposition==
In comparison to that of other animals, the human altruistic system is a sensitive and unstable one.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt; Therefore, the tendency to give, to cheat, and the response to other’s acts of giving and cheating must be regulated by a complex psychology in each individual, social structures, and cultural traditions. Individuals differ in the degree of these tendencies and responses.
According to [[Trivers]], the following emotional dispositions and their evolution can be understood in terms of regulation of altruism.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt;

*Friendship and emotions of liking and disliking.
*Moralistic aggression. A protection mechanism from cheaters acts to regulate the advantage of cheaters in selection against altruists. The moralistic altruist may want to educate or even punish a cheater.
*Gratitude and sympathy. A fine regulation of altruism can be associated with gratitude and sympathy in terms of cost/benefit and the level in which the beneficiary will reciprocate.
*Guilt and reparative altruism. Prevents the cheater from cheating again. The cheater shows regret to avoid paying too dearly for past acts.
*Subtle cheating. A stable evolutionary equilibrium could include a low percentage of mimics in controversial support of adaptive sociopathy.
*Trust and suspicion. These are regulators for cheating and subtle cheating.
*Partnerships. Altruism to create friendships.

It is not known how individuals pick partners as there has been little research on choice. Modeling indicates that altruism about partner choices is unlikely to evolve, as costs and benefits between multiple individuals are variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schino | first1 = G. | last2 = Aureli | first2 = F. | year = 2010 | title = A few misunderstandings about reciprocal altruism | journal = Commun. Integr. Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| pages = 561–563 | doi = 10.4161/cib.3.6.12977 | pmid = 21331239 | pmc=3038063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the time or frequency of reciprocal actions contributes more to an individual's choice of partner than the reciprocal act itself.

'''Robert Lee Frost''' (March{{nbsp}}26, 1874{{snd}}January{{nbsp}}29, 1963) was an American poet. His work was initially published in England before it was published in America. Known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American [[colloquial speech]],&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica | title=Robert Frost | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9035504/Robert-Frost | edition=Online | year=2008 | publisher= | accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frost frequently wrote about settings from rural life in [[New England]] in the early twentieth century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes.

Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime, receiving four [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry]]. He became one of America's rare "public literary figures, almost an artistic institution."&lt;ref name="Stine 1983 110"&gt;Contemporary Literary Criticism. Ed. Jean C. Stine, Bridget Broderick, and Daniel G. Marowski. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale Research, 1983. p110&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1960 for his poetic works. On July 22, 1961, Frost was named [[poet laureate]] of [[Vermont]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:Jb modern frost 2 e.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Robert Frost, circa 1910]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Robert frost.png|left|thumb|Robert Frost, circa 1911]] --&gt;
Robert Frost was born in [[San Francisco, California]], to journalist William Prescott Frost, Jr., and Isabelle Moodie.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; His mother was a Scottish immigrant, and his father descended from Nicholas Frost of [[Tiverton, Devon]], England, who had sailed to [[New Hampshire]] in 1634 on the ''Wolfrana''.

Frost was a descendant of [[Samuel Appleton (born 1625)|Samuel Appleton]], one of the early settlers of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], and [[George Phillips (Watertown)|Rev. George Phillips]], one of the early settlers of [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Marsten. Royal Families - Americans of Royal and Noble Ancestry. Volume Three: Samuel Appleton and His Wife Judith Everard and Five Generations of Their Descendants. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost's father was a teacher and later an editor of the ''San Francisco Evening Bulletin'' (which later merged with ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]''), and an unsuccessful candidate for city tax collector. After his death on May 5, 1885, the family moved across the country to [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], under the patronage of (Robert's grandfather) William Frost, Sr., who was an overseer at a New England mill. Frost graduated from Lawrence High School in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ehrlich | first=Eugene  |author2=Carruth, Gorton  | title=The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States | volume=vol. 50 | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frost's mother joined the [[The New Church|Swedenborgian]] church and had him baptized in it, but he left it as an adult.

Although known for his later association with rural life, Frost grew up in the city, and he published his first poem in his high school's magazine. He attended [[Dartmouth College]] for two months, long enough to be accepted into the [[Theta Delta Chi]] fraternity. Frost returned home to teach and to work at various jobs, including helping his mother teach her class of unruly boys, delivering newspapers, and working in a factory maintaining [[Arc lamp#Carbon arc lamp|carbon arc lamps]]. He did not enjoy these jobs, feeling his true calling was poetry.

===Adult years===
[[File:Robert Frost NYWTS 5.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Robert Frost's 85th birthday in 1959]]
 
In 1894, he sold his first poem, "My Butterfly. An Elegy" (published in the November 8, 1894, edition of the ''New York Independent'') for $15 (${{Inflation|US|15|1894}} today). Proud of his accomplishment, he proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White, but she demurred, wanting to finish college (at [[St. Lawrence University]]) before they married. Frost then went on an excursion to the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] in [[Virginia]] and asked Elinor again upon his return. Having graduated, she agreed, and they were married at Lawrence, Massachusetts on December 19, 1895.

Frost attended [[Harvard University]] from 1897 to 1899, but he left voluntarily due to illness.&lt;ref name="TutenZubizarreta2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Lewis Tuten|author2=John Zubizarreta|title=The Robert Frost encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47NFEPDDBMgC&amp;pg=PA146|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29464-8|page=145|quote=Halfway through the spring semester of his second year, Dean Briggs released him from Harvard without prejudice, lamenting the loss of so good a student.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parini2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Parini|title=Robert Frost: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHWqRHJiAlwC&amp;pg=PA12-IA9|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8050-6341-7|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Meyers|title=Robert Frost: a biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMxkAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|quote=Frost remained at Harvard until March of his sophomore  year, when he decamped in the middle of a term&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death, Frost's grandfather purchased [[Robert Frost Farm (Derry, New Hampshire)|a farm]] for Robert and Elinor in [[Derry, New Hampshire]]; Frost worked the farm for nine years while writing early in the mornings and producing many of the poems that would later become famous. Ultimately his farming proved unsuccessful and he returned to the field of education as an English teacher at New Hampshire's [[Pinkerton Academy]] from 1906 to 1911, then at the New Hampshire Normal School (now [[Plymouth State University]]) in [[Plymouth, New Hampshire]].

In 1912, Frost sailed with his family to [[Great Britain]], settling first in [[Beaconsfield]], a small town outside London. His first book of poetry, ''A Boy's Will'', was published the next year. In England he made some important acquaintances, including [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]] (a member of the group known as the [[Dymock poets]] and Frost's inspiration for "[[The Road Not Taken]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DQMbBQAAQBAJ|publisher = Penguin|date = 2015-08-18|isbn = 9780698140899|language = en|first = David|last = Orr}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[T. E. Hulme]], and [[Ezra Pound]]. Although Pound would become the first American to write a favorable review of Frost's work, Frost later resented Pound's attempts to manipulate his American prosody. Frost met or befriended many contemporary poets in England, especially after his first two poetry volumes were published in London in 1913 (''A Boy's Will'') and 1914 (''North of Boston'').

[[File:Robertfrostfarm.JPG|thumb|The [[Robert Frost Farm (Derry, New Hampshire)|Robert Frost Farm]] in [[Derry, New Hampshire]], where he wrote many of his poems, including "Tree at My Window" and "Mending Wall."]]

In 1915, during World War I, Frost returned to America, where [[Henry Holt and Company|Holt's]] American edition of ''A Boy's Will'' had recently been published, and bought a farm in [[Franconia, New Hampshire]], where he launched a career of writing, teaching, and lecturing. This family homestead served as the Frosts' summer home until 1938. It is maintained today as [[The Frost Place]], a museum and poetry conference site. He was made an honorary member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] at Harvard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1926|title=PHI BETA KAPPA AUTHORS|jstor=42914052|journal=The Phi Beta Kappa Key|volume=6|issue=4|pages=237–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1916. During the years 1917–20, 1923–25, and, on a more informal basis, 1926–1938, Frost taught English at [[Amherst College]] in Massachusetts, notably encouraging his students to account for the myriad sounds and intonations of the spoken English language in their writing. He called his colloquial approach to language "the sound of sense."&lt;ref name="www.learner.org series57"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/resources/series57.html|title=Resource: Voices &amp; Visions|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, he won the first of four [[Pulitzer Prizes]] for the book ''New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace Notes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost|title=The 1924 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|last=|first=|date=|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would win additional Pulitzers for ''Collected Poems'' in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost-0|title=The 1931 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|last=|first=|date=|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Further Range'' in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost-1|title=The 1937 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|last=|first=|date=|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Witness Tree'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost-2|title=The 1943 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|last=|first=|date=|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For forty-two years&amp;nbsp;– from 1921 to 1962&amp;nbsp;– Frost spent almost every summer and fall teaching at the [[Bread Loaf School of English]] of [[Middlebury College]], at its mountain campus at [[Ripton, Vermont]]. He is credited as a major influence upon the development of the school and its writing programs. The college now owns and maintains his former Ripton farmstead, a [[National Historic Landmark]], near the Bread Loaf campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Bread Loaf School of English |url=http://www.middlebury.edu/blse/about/history |website=Middlebury Bread Loaf School of English |access-date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 Frost accepted a fellowship teaching post at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor]], where he resided until 1927 when he returned to teach at Amherst. While teaching at the University of Michigan, he was awarded a lifetime appointment at the University as a Fellow in Letters.&lt;ref name = Frost/&gt; The Robert Frost Ann Arbor home was purchased by [[The Henry Ford]] Museum in Dearborn, Michigan and relocated to the museum's Greenfield Village site for public tours. Throughout the 1920s, Frost also lived in his [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] home in Shaftsbury, VT. The home opened as the Robert Frost Stone House Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bennington.edu/robert-frost-stone-house-museum]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 and was given to [[Bennington College]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="stone_house"&gt;[http://www.bennington.edu/robert-frost-stone-house-museum Robert Frost Stone House Museum, Bennington College]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Frost began to spend winter months in Florida.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In March 1935, he gave a talk at the [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1940, he bought a {{convert|5|acre|adj=on}} plot in South Miami, Florida, naming it ''Pencil Pines''; he spent his winters there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Frost in Florida: a memoir|last=Muir|first=Helen|publisher=Valiant Press|year=1995|isbn=0-9633461-6-4|location=|pages=11, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoir about Frost's time in Florida, Helen Muir writes, "Frost had called his five acres ''Pencil Pines'' because he said he had never made a penny from anything that did not involve the use of a pencil."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His properties also included a [[Robert Frost House|house]] on Brewster Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

[[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s 1965 alumni directory indicates Frost received an honorary degree there. Although he never graduated from college, Frost received over 40 honorary degrees, including ones from [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] universities, and was the only person to receive two honorary degrees from [[Dartmouth College]]. During his lifetime, the Robert Frost Middle School in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], the Robert L. Frost School in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and the main library of [[Amherst College]] were named after him.

In 1960, Frost was awarded a United States [[Congressional Gold Medal]], ''"In recognition of his poetry, which has enriched the culture of the United States and the philosophy of the world,"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/goldmedal.aspx Office of the Clerk – U.S. House of Representatives, Congressional Gold Medal Recipients]&lt;/ref&gt; which was finally bestowed by President Kennedy in March 1962.&lt;ref name=Parini1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Parini |first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Parini |title=Robert Frost: A Life |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]] |pages=408, 424–425 |isbn=9780805063417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1962, he was awarded the [[Edward MacDowell Medal]] for outstanding contribution to the arts by the [[MacDowell Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macdowellcolony.org/events-MedalDay.html |title=The MacDowell Colony – Medal Day |accessdate=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost was 86 when he read at the [[inauguration of John F. Kennedy]] on January 20, 1961. Frost originally attempted to read his poem "Dedication", which was written for the occasion, but was unable to read it due to the brightness of the sunlight, so he recited his poem "[[The Gift Outright]]" from memory instead.&lt;ref&gt;"John F. Kennedy: A Man of This Century". ''CBS''. November 22, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the summer of 1962, Frost accompanied Interior Secretary [[Stewart Udall]] on a visit to the Soviet Union in hopes of meeting [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to lobby for peaceful relations between the two Cold War powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jfkthelastspeech.org/frost-the-poet-politician/|title=The Poet - Politician - JFK The Last Speech|work=JFK The Last Speech|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/25/specials/frost-last.html|title=Robert Frost's Last Adventure|last=Udall|first=Stewart L.|date=1972-06-11|website=archive.nytimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2008/0408/p13s01-bogn.html|title=When Robert Frost met Khrushchev|date=2008-04-08|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2018-10-25|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/listen-2|title=Remembering John F.

Frost died in Boston on January 29, 1963 of complications from prostate surgery. He was buried at the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington, Vermont. His [[epitaph]] quotes the last line from his poem, "The Lesson for Today" (1942): "I had a lover's quarrel with the world."

One of the original collections of Frost materials, to which he himself contributed, is found in the Special Collections department of the [[Jones Library]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. The collection consists of approximately twelve thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, correspondence and photographs, as well as audio and visual recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joneslibrary.org/specialcollections/collections/frost/frost_print.html#contact |title=Robert Frost Collection |publisher=Jones Library, Inc. website, Amherst, Massachusetts |accessdate=2009-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612052023/http://www.joneslibrary.org/specialcollections/collections/frost/frost_print.html#contact |archivedate=2009-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a small collection of his papers.

[[File:Robert Frost's Grave.JPG|thumb|The Frost family grave in Bennington Old Cemetery]]Robert Frost's personal life was plagued by grief and loss. In 1885 when he was 11, his father died of [[tuberculosis]], leaving the family with just eight dollars. Frost's mother died of [[cancer]] in 1900. In 1920, he had to commit his younger sister Jeanie to a mental hospital, where she died nine years later. Mental illness apparently ran in Frost's family, as both he and his mother suffered from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and his daughter Irma was committed to a mental hospital in 1947. Frost's wife, Elinor, also experienced bouts of depression.&lt;ref name = Frost/&gt;

Elinor and Robert Frost had six children: son Elliot (1896–1900, died of [[cholera]]); daughter Lesley Frost Ballantine (1899–1983); son Carol (1902–1940, committed suicide); daughter Irma (1903–1967); daughter Marjorie (1905–1934, died as a result of [[puerperal fever]] after childbirth); and daughter Elinor Bettina (died just three days after her birth in 1907). Only Lesley and Irma outlived their father. Frost's wife, who had heart problems throughout her life, developed [[breast cancer]] in 1937, and died of [[heart failure]] in 1938.&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frost |first=Robert |editor1-last=Poirier |editor1-first=Richard |editor2-last=Richardson |editor2-first=Mark |title=Collected Poems, Prose, &amp; Plays |series=The Library of America |volume=81 |location=New York |publisher=Library of America |year=1995 |isbn=1-883011-06-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style and critical response===
The poet/critic [[Randall Jarrell]] often praised Frost's poetry and wrote, "Robert Frost, along with [[Wallace Stevens|Stevens]] and [[T.S. Eliot|Eliot]], seems to me the greatest of the American poets of this century. Frost's virtues are extraordinary. No other living poet has written so well about the actions of ordinary men; his wonderful dramatic monologues or dramatic scenes come out of a knowledge of people that few poets have had, and they are written in a verse that uses, sometimes with absolute mastery, the rhythms of actual speech." He also praised "Frost's seriousness and honesty," stating that Frost was particularly skilled at representing a wide range of human experience in his poems.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall. "Fifty Years of American Poetry." ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarrell's notable and influential essays on Frost include the essays "Robert Frost's 'Home Burial' " (1962), which consisted of an extended close reading of that particular poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarrell |first=Randall |title=On 'Home Burial' |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/frost/burial.htm |year=1999 |orig-year=1962 |website=English Department at the University of Illinois |access-date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "To The Laodiceans" (1952) in which Jarrell defended Frost against critics who had accused Frost of being too "traditional" and out of touch with Modern or [[Modernist poetry]].[[File:RobertFrost.jpg|thumb|left|160px|U.S stamp, 1974]] In Frost's defense, Jarrell wrote "the regular ways of looking at Frost's poetry are grotesque simplifications, distortions, falsifications—coming to know his poetry well ought to be enough, in itself, to dispel any of them, and to make plain the necessity of finding some other way of talking about his work." And Jarrell's close readings of poems like "Neither Out Too Far Nor In Too Deep" led readers and critics to perceive more of the complexities in Frost's poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall. "To The Laodiceans." ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall. "Robert Frost's 'Home Burial.'" ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an introduction to Jarrell's book of essays, [[Brad Leithauser]] notes that, "the 'other' Frost that Jarrell discerned behind the genial, homespun New England rustic—the 'dark' Frost who was desperate, frightened, and brave—has become the Frost we've all learned to recognize, and the little-known poems Jarrell singled out as central to the Frost canon are now to be found in most anthologies." &lt;ref&gt;Leithauser, Brad. "Introduction." No Other Book: Selected Essays. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Nelson | first=Cary | title=Anthology of Modern American Poetry | page=84 | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-19-512270-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarrell lists a selection of the Frost poems he considers the most masterful, including "The Witch of Coös", "Home Burial", "A Servant to Servants", "Directive", "Neither Out Too Far Nor In Too Deep", "Provide, Provide", "[[Acquainted with the Night]]", "After Apple Picking", "Mending Wall", "The Most of It", "An Old Man's Winter Night", "To Earthward", "[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]", "Spring Pools", "The Lovely Shall Be Choosers", "Design", and "Desert Places".&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall.

And then come back to it and begin over. 
May no fate willfully misunderstand me 
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away 
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love: 
I don't know where it's likely to go better. 
I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree, 
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk 
Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, 
But dipped its top and set me down again. 
That would be good both going and coming back. 
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

In 2003, the critic Charles McGrath noted that critical views on Frost's poetry have changed over the years (as has his public image). In an article called "The Vicissitudes of Literary Reputation," McGrath wrote, "Robert Frost&amp;nbsp;... at the time of his death in 1963 was generally considered to be a New England folkie&amp;nbsp;... In 1977, the third volume of Lawrance Thompson's biography suggested that Frost was a much nastier piece of work than anyone had imagined; a few years later, thanks to the reappraisal of critics like William H. Pritchard and [[Harold Bloom]] and of younger poets like [[Joseph Brodsky]], he bounced back again, this time as a bleak and unforgiving modernist."&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Charles. "The Vicissitudes of Literary Reputation." ''The New York Times Magazine''. 15 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', editors [[Richard Ellmann]] and Robert O'Clair compared and contrasted Frost's unique style to the work of the poet [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]] since they both frequently used New England settings for their poems. However, they state that Frost's poetry was "less [consciously] literary" and that this was possibly due to the influence of English and Irish writers like [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[W.B. Yeats]]. They note that Frost's poems "show a successful striving for utter colloquialism" and always try to remain down to earth, while at the same time using traditional forms despite the trend of American poetry towards free verse which Frost famously said was "'like playing tennis without a net.'"&lt;ref name="Ellman 1988."&gt;Ellman, Richard and Robert O'Clair. ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', Second Edition. New York: Norton, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faggen|first1=Robert|title=Editor|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In providing an overview of Frost's style, the [[Poetry Foundation]] makes the same point, placing Frost's work "at the crossroads of nineteenth-century American poetry [with regard to his use of traditional forms] and modernism [with his use of idiomatic language and ordinary, every day subject matter]." They also note that Frost believed that "the self-imposed restrictions of meter in form" was more helpful than harmful because he could focus on the content of his poems instead of concerning himself with creating "innovative" new verse forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/robert-frost|title=Robert Frost|date=2018-03-21|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier 1963 study by the poet [[James Radcliffe Squires]] spoke to the distinction of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves.  "He has written at a time when the choice for the poet seemed to lie among the forms of despair: Science, solipsism, or the religion of the past century…Frost has refused all of these and in the refusal has long seemed less dramatically committed than others…But no, he must be seen as dramatically uncommitted to the single solution…Insofar as Frost allows to both fact and intuition a bright kingdom, he speaks for many of us.  Insofar as he speaks through an amalgam of senses and sure experience so that his poetry seems a nostalgic memory with overtones touching some conceivable future, he speaks better than most of us. That is to say, as a poet must."&lt;ref&gt;Squires, Radcliffe.  The Major Themes of Robert Frost, The University of Michigan Press, 1963.  pp. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classicist [[Helen H. Bacon]] has proposed that Frost's deep knowledge of Greek and Roman classics influenced much of his work.  Frost's education at Lawrence High School, Dartmouth, and Harvard "was based mainly on the classics." As examples, she links imagery and action in Frost's early poems Birches" (1915) and "Wild Grapes" (1920) with Euripedes' ''[[Bacchae]]''. She cites the certain motifs, including that of the tree bent down to earth, as evidence of his "very attentive reading of ''Bacchae'', almost certainly in Greek."  In a later poem, "One More Brevity" (1953), Bacon compares the poetic techniques used by Frost to those of Virgil in the ''[[Aeneid]]''.  She notes that "this sampling of the ways Frost drew on the literature and concepts of the Greek and Roman world at every stage of his life indicates how imbued with it he was."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Helen. "Frost and the Ancient Muses." The Cambridge Companion to Robert Frost. Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 75-99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
In ''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', the editors state that "Frost's best work explores fundamental questions of existence, depicting with chilling starkness the loneliness of the individual in an indifferent universe."&lt;ref name="Stine 1983 110 129"&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Ed. Jean C. Stine, Bridget Broderick, and Daniel G. Marowski. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale Research, 1983. p&amp;nbsp;110–129.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic T. K. Whipple focused on this bleakness in Frost's work, stating that "in much of his work, particularly in ''North of Boston'', his harshest book, he emphasizes the dark background of life in rural New England, with its degeneration often sinking into total madness." &lt;ref name="Stine 1983 110 129"/&gt;

In sharp contrast, the founding publisher and editor of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', [[Harriet Monroe]], emphasized the folksy New England persona and characters in Frost's work, writing that "perhaps no other poet in our history has put the best of the Yankee spirit into a book so completely."&lt;ref name="Stine 1983 110 129"/&gt; She notes his frequent use of rural settings and farm life, and she likes that in these poems, Frost is most interested in "showing the human reaction to nature's processes." She also notes that while Frost's narrative, character-based poems are often satirical, Frost always has a "sympathetic humor" towards his subjects.&lt;ref name="Stine 1983 110 129"/&gt;

==Poet laureate of Vermont==
In June 1922 the Vermont State League of Women's Clubs elected Frost as Poet laureate of Vermont. When a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' editorial strongly criticised the decision of the Women's Clubs, [[Sarah Cleghorn]] and other women wrote to the newspaper defending Frost.&lt;ref name="Frost2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Frost|title=The Collected Prose of Robert Frost|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3_GxPnBbI4C&amp;pg=PA289|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02463-2|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 1961, Frost was named [[Poet laureate]] of Vermont by the state legislature through Joint Resolution R-59 of the Acts of 1961, which also created the position.&lt;ref name="TutenZubizarreta2001p249"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Lewis Tuten|author2=John Zubizarreta|title=The Robert Frost Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjZuWeTJpAkC&amp;pg=PA15|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29464-8|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fagan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deirdre J.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Boscovich was born on 18 May 1711 in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa (Dubrovnik)]], [[Republic of Ragusa]], to [[Nikola Bošković]], a Ragusan merchant, and Paola Bettera (1674–1777), daughter of a local nobleman of Italian origin. He was baptised on 26 May 1711 by Marinus Carolis, ''curatus et sacristia''. The name Ruđer/Ruggiero may have been given to him because both his great-grandfather Agostino Bettera and his mother's brother were called Ruggiero, the godparent was his uncle Ruggiero Bettera. He was the seventh child of the family and the second youngest. His father was born in 1642, at [[Orahov Do]] near [[Ravno]], at the time part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (now [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]).&lt;ref name="Whyte-1961"&gt;[http://dpedtech.com/ROGERJOSEPHBOSCOVICH.doc '"Roger Joseph Boscovich'" SJ FRS, 1711–1787 ''Studies of his life and work on the 250th anniversary of his birth''], edited [[Lancelot Law Whyte|L L Whyte]], George Allen and Unwin, London, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was rich in trading experience and knowledge of that part of the Ottoman Empire, but Ruđer knew him only as a bedridden invalid with paralysed legs and he died when Ruđer was 10 years old. Boscovich's mother Paola, nicknamed "Pavica", was a member of a cultivated Italian merchant family established in Dubrovnik since the early 17th century, when her ancestor Pietro Bettera settled from [[Bergamo]] in northern Italy. She was a robust and active woman with a happy temperament who lived to 103.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

Paola Bettera left nothing in writing, but Boscovich's aunt, her sister, wrote poetry in Italian. Their sons, Ruđer's cousins and playmates, Antun Bošković and Franjo Bošković, grew up into good Latinists. His own brothers and sisters were all older than himself, except his sister [[Anica Bošković]] (1714–1804), two years his junior. His eldest sister Mare Bošković, nineteen years his senior, was the only member of the family to marry; his second sister Marija Bošković became a nun in the Ragusa Convent of St Catherine's. His eldest brother Božo Bošković (Boško, called ''Natale'' by Roger in private correspondence&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.edizionenazionaleboscovich.it/index.php/biblioteca-digitale/viewcategory/4-corrispondenza.html the two volumes] Edoardo Proverbio (cur.), ''Carteggio con Natale Boscovich'', Edizione Nazionale delle Opere e della Corrispondenza di Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich, Milan 2009 {{ISBN|978-8896700204}}&lt;/ref&gt;), thirteen years older, joined the service of the Ragusa Republic. His brother Bartolomej (Baro) Bošković, born in 1700 and educated at the Jesuit school in Dubrovnik, left home when Ruđer was 3 to become a scholar and a Jesuit priest in Rome. He also wrote good verse in both Latin and "Illyrian" (the Renaissance era name for Croatian), but eventually burnt some of his manuscripts out of a scrupulous modesty. His brother Ivan (Đivo) Bošković became a Dominican in a sixteenth-century monastery in Dubrovnik, whose church Ruđer knew as a child with its rich treasures and paintings by Titian and Vasari, still there today. His brother Petar (Pero) Bošković, six years his senior, became a poet like his grandfather. He too was schooled by the Jesuits, then served as an official of the Republic and made his reputation as a translator of Ovid, Corneille's Cid and of Molière. A volume of his religious verse, ''Hvale Duhovne'', was published in Venice in 1729.

At the age of 8 or 9, after acquiring the rudiments of reading and writing from the priest Nicola Nicchei of the [[Church of St. Nicholas (Croatia)|Church of St. Nicholas]], Ruđer was sent for schooling to the local [[Jesuit]] ''Collegium Regusinum''. During his early studies Roger Boscovich showed a distinct propensity for further intellectual development. He gained a reputation at school for having an easy memory and a quick, deep mind.

On 16 September 1725, Ruđer Bošković left Dubrovnik for Rome. He was in the care of two Jesuit priests who took him to the [[Society of Jesus]], famous for its education of youth and at that time having some 800 establishments and 200,000 pupils under its care throughout the world. We learn nothing from Bošković himself until the time he entered the novitiate in 1731, but it was the usual practice for novices to spend the first two years not in the [[Collegium Romanum]] but in [[Sant'Andrea delle Fratte]]. There, he studied [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college.&lt;ref name="Whyte-1961"/&gt;

He was especially appropriate for this post due to his acquaintance with recent advances in science, and his skill in a classical severity of demonstration, acquired by a thorough study of the works of the Greek geometers. Several years before this appointment he had made a name for himself with an elegant solution of the problem of finding the [[Sun]]'s equator and determining the period of its rotation by observation of the spots on its surface.

===Middle years===

Notwithstanding the arduous duties of his professorship, he found time for investigation in various fields of physical science, and he published a very large number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. Among the subjects were the [[transit of Mercury]], the [[Aurora Borealis]], the [[figure of the Earth]], the observation of the [[fixed stars]], the inequalities in terrestrial [[gravitation]], the application of [[mathematics]] to the theory of the [[telescope]], the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the [[cycloid]], the [[logistic curve]], the theory of [[comet]]s, the [[tide]]s, the law of [[Continuous function|continuity]]&lt;!-- may refer to something else? --&gt;, the [[double refraction]] [[micrometre]], and various problems of [[spherical trigonometry]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In 1742 he was consulted, with other men of science, by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], as to the best means of securing the stability of the dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]], Rome, in which a crack had been discovered. His suggestion of placing five concentric iron bands was adopted.
[[File:PjesmeBoscovic.jpg|thumb|left|200px|French translation of Bošković's ''De solis ac lunae defectibus''.]] In 1744 he was ordained to the Roman Catholic [[priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mathematics-in-europe.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=678&amp;lang=en|title=300th birthday of Ruđer Josip Bošković (Roger Joseph Boscovich)|publisher=Mathematics in Europe|author=Franka Miriam Brueckler|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1745 Bošković published ''De Viribus Vivis'' in which he tried to find a middle way between [[Isaac Newton]]'s gravitational theory and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s [[Monadology|metaphysical theory]] of [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monad]]-points. He developed a concept of "impenetrability" as a property of hard bodies which explained their behaviour in terms of [[force]] rather than [[matter]]. Stripping atoms of their matter, impenetrability is disassociated from hardness and then put in an arbitrary relationship to [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. Impenetrability has a [[Descartes|Cartesian]] sense that more than one point cannot occupy the same location at once.&lt;ref&gt;''The Conflict between Atomism and Conservation Theory 1644–1860'' by Wilson L. Scott, London and New York, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Bošković visited his hometown only once, in 1747, never to return. He agreed to take part in the Portuguese expedition for the survey of [[Brazil]] and the measurement of a degree of [[arc of the meridian]], but was persuaded by the Pope to stay in Italy and to undertake a similar task there with [[Christopher Maire]], an English [[Jesuit]] who measured an arc of two degrees between Rome and [[Rimini]]. The operation began at the end of 1750, and was completed in about two years. An account was published in 1755, under the name ''De Litteraria expeditione per pontificiam ditionem ad dimetiendos duos meridiani gradus a PP. Maire et Boscovicli.'' The value of this work was increased by a carefully prepared map of the [[Papal States|States of the Church]]. A French translation appeared in 1770 which incorporated, as an appendix, some material first published in 1760 outlining an objective procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters of the fitted model from a greater number of observations. An unconstrained variant of this fitting procedure is now known as the L1-norm or [[Least absolute deviations]] procedure and serves as a robust alternative to the familiar L2-norm or Least Squares procedure.

A dispute arose between [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]] the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and the [[Republic of Lucca]] with respect to the drainage of a lake. As agent of Lucca, Bošković was sent, in 1757, to [[Vienna]] and succeeded in bringing about a satisfactory arrangement in the matter.

The ordinate is force, with positive values being repulsive, and the abscissa is radial distance. Newton's gravitational attractive force is clearly seen at the far right of figure 1.]]
In [[Vienna]] in 1758, he published the first edition of his famous work, ''Philosophiæ naturalis theoria redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium'' (''Theory of Natural philosophy derived to the single Law of forces which exist in Nature''), containing his [[atomic theory]] and his theory of [[force]]s.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cohesion: A Scientific History of Intermolecular Forces|author=Rowlinson, J.S.|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139435888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Apyi_FXKnSkC|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was published in 1763 in [[Venice]] and a third again in Vienna in 1764. In 1922 it was published in London, and in 1966 in the United States. Another edition was published in [[Zagreb]] in 1974.

Another occasion to exercise his diplomatic ability soon arose. The British government suspected that warships had been fitted out in the port of Dubrovnik for the service of France, and that therefore the neutrality of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] had been violated. Bošković was selected to undertake an ambassadorship to London (1760), to vindicate the character of his native place and satisfy the government. This mission he discharged successfully – a credit to him and a delight to his countrymen. During his stay in England he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]].

In 1761 astronomers were preparing to observe the [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun. Under the influence of the Royal Society, Bošković decided to travel to [[Constantinople]]. He arrived late and then travelled to [[Poland]] via [[Bulgaria]] and [[Moldavia]] then proceeding to [[Saint Petersburg]] where he was elected as a member of [[Russian Academy of Science]]s. Ill health compelled him soon to return to Italy.

Bošković visited [[Ljubljana|Laibach]], the capital of [[Carniola]] (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), at least in 1757, 1758, and 1763, and made contact with the Jesuits and the Franciscan Friars in the town. The Jesuits incorporated his teachings into their lectures at the [[Laibach Jesuit College]]. His physics became the foundation of physical lectures as well in other parts of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], and influenced the thought of [[Carl Scherffer]], [[Gabriel Gruber]], and [[Jurij Vega]], the prominent physicists of the period. Both Vega and the Rationalist philosopher [[Franz Samuel Karpe]] educated their students in Vienna about the ideas of Bošković and in the spirit of his thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.delo.si/clanek/204444|title=Dobro vidne Boškovićeve sledi v Ljubljani|language=Slovenian|trans-title=Well-visible Traces of Bošković in Ljubljana|date=24 April 2012|first=Stanislav|last=Južnič|newspaper=Delo.si|issn=1854-6544|publisher=delo.si|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late years===
In 1764 he was called to serve as the chair of mathematics at the [[University of Pavia]], and for six years he held this post with the directorship of the [[observatory]] of [[Brera Astronomical Observatory|Brera]] in Milan, That is where [[Charles Burney]] met him; since Burney's Italian was not very good at that time, Boscovich obliged him speaking French.

He was invited by the [[Royal Society]] of London to undertake an expedition to California to observe the [[transit of Venus]] in 1769 again, but this was prevented by the recent decree of the Spanish government expelling Jesuits from its [[Dominion (Spain)|dominion]]s. Bošković had many enemies and he was driven to frequent changes of residence. About 1777 he returned to Milan, where he kept teaching and directing the Brera observatory.

Deprived of his post by the intrigues of his associates, he was about to retire to Dubrovnik when in 1773 the news of the suppression of his order in Italy reached him. Uncertainty led him to accept an invitation from the King of France to come to Paris where he was appointed director of [[optics]] for the navy, with a pension of 8,000 '' [[French livre|livres]]'' and a position was created for him.

He naturalised in France and stayed ten years, but his position became irksome, and at length intolerable. He, however, continued to work in the pursuit of science knowledge, and published many remarkable works. Among them was an elegant solution of the problem to determine the [[orbit]] of a [[comet]] from three observations, and works on [[micrometer (device)|micrometre]] and [[achromatic lens|achromatic]] telescopes.

In 1783 he returned to Italy and spent two years at [[Bassano del Grappa|Bassano]], occupying himself with the publication of his ''Opera pertinentia ad opticam et astronomiam, etc.'', published in 1785 in five volumes quarto.

After a visit of some months to the convent of [[Vallombrosa]], he went to Brera in 1786 and resumed his work. At that time his health was failing, his reputation was on the wane, his works did not sell, and he gradually fell prey to illness and disappointment. He died in Milan and was buried in the church of St. Maria Podone.

===Boscovich's demon===

In philosophy and physics, [[Laplace's demon]] is a [[thought experiment]] supporting the concept of [[determinism]].  It suggests that if someone (the Demon) knew the precise location and momentum of every particle in the universe, he could in principle calculate the history and future of every particle. For a long time it was believed that [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], an influential French scholar, was the first one to propose this type of determinism. Recently it has been shown that the first person who offered the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence was Boscovich, whose formulation of the principle of determinism in his 1758 ''Theoria philosophiae naturalis'' turns out not only to be temporally prior to Laplace's but also—being founded on fewer metaphysical principles and more rooted in and elaborated by physical assumptions—to be more precise, complete, and comprehensive than Laplace's somewhat parenthetical statement of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kožnjak Boris | year = 2015 | title = Who let the demon out? Laplace and Boscovich on determinism | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368115000370 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Science | volume = 51 | pages = 42–52 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2015.03.002| pmid = 26227230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Laplace's version of determinism is based on general terms, Boscovich's uses physical terms, like position, [[velocity]], direction and [[centre of mass]]. Boscovich also (correctly) suggests that the continuity of [[force]] is a necessary assumption for determinism, and he presented it in strict mathematical form. In short, Boskovich's determinism is more physical, while Laplace's determinism is more metaphysical, placing it in harmony with [[Leibniz]]'s metaphysics.

== Further works ==
In addition to the works already mentioned Bošković published course material he had prepared for his pupils in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1752)Elementorum matheseos ad usum studiosae juventutis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1754) Elementa universae matheseos&lt;/ref&gt; He also published accounts of his travels from [[Constantinople]] to [[Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1762) Giornale di un viaggio da Constantinopoli in Polonia dell'abate Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich, con una sua relazione delle rovine di Troia&lt;/ref&gt; in several expanded editions&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1784) Giornale di un viaggio da Constantinopoli in Polonia dell'abate Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich, con una sua relazione delle rovine di Troia&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into French.&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1772) Journal d'un voyage de Constantinopole en Pologne&lt;/ref&gt;

Bošković applied himself to practical engineering projects, including several discussions of architectural repair or stability, including repairs to St Peter's Dome,&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1742) Parere di tre Matematici sopra i danni che si sono trovati nella Cupola di S. Pietro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1743) Riflessioni de' Padri Tommaso Le Seur, Francesco Jacquier de el' Ordine de' Minimi, e Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich della Compagnia di Gesù Sopra alcune difficoltà spettanti i danni, e Risarcimenti della Cupola Di S. Pietro&lt;/ref&gt; the stability of the Duomo of Milan,&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1765) Sentimento sulla solidità della nuova Guglia del Duomo di Milano&lt;/ref&gt; repairs to the library of Cesarea di Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1763) Scrittura sulli danni osservati nell' edificio della Biblioteca Cesarea di Vienna, e loro riparazione&lt;/ref&gt; and a report on the damage to sectors of Rome in June 1749 due by a whirlwind.&lt;ref&gt;Bošković, Ruđer (1749) Sopra il Turbine che la notte tra gli XI e XII giugno del MDCCXLIX danneggio una gran parte di Roma&lt;/ref&gt;

Bošković was also consulted on civil works concerning ports and rivers: Ivica Martinovic&lt;ref name="hydraulics"&gt;Ivica Martinović (2000) "Ruđer Bošković's Expert Analyses in Hydraulic Engineering:An Unexamined Dimension of Bošković's Work" ''Jesuits among the Croats'' Pozaić, Valentin (ed). – Zagreb : Institute of philosophy and theology SJ and Croatian historical, 2000. 65–87.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown the extent to which Bošković applied himself to such works, and lists 13 major works:
 {{cquote|

For his contributions to astronomy, a lunar crater was named after him (see [[Boscovich (crater)|Boscovich crater]]).
[[File:Ruđer Josip Bošković.JPG|thumb|220px|Ruđer Bošković bust in front of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] building in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]]]

The largest Croatian institute of natural sciences and technology, based in [[Zagreb]], is called "[[Ruđer Bošković Institute]]". Bošković in 1782 was one of the founders of the [[Accademia nazionale delle scienze detta dei XL]] (''National Association of the Sciences''), with the name of "Società Italiana" (''Italian Association''): this learned society gathered forty members representing the most important Italian scientists of the period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiaxl.it/accademia/storia.html ''L'Accademia'', from the site of the Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL (in italian)].&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest astronomical society in the Balkans based in Serbia's capital [[Belgrade]] is called [[Astronomical Society Ruđer Bošković]].

In 1873, Nietzsche wrote a fragment called 'Time Atom Theory', which was a reworking of Boscovich's ''Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium''. In general, Boscovich's ideas were a large influence on Nietzsche's ideas of force and the will to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Keith Ansell|year=2000|title=Nietzsche's Brave New World of Force|journal=Pli: The Warwick Journal of Philosophy|volume=9|pages=6–35|access-date=2015-04-20|url=http://plijournal.com/files/ansell_pearson_1_pli_9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nietzsche, Epistemology, and Philosophy of Science: Nietzsche and the Sciences II|author1=Babich, B.|author2=Cohen, R.S.|date=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780792357438|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VT56Pflx5ksC|page=187|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Bošković was a Roman Catholic priest, and in expressing his religious views was straightforward. In his most famous book ''A Theory of Natural Philosophy'' (1758) he says: "Regarding the nature of the Divine Creator, my theory is extraordinarily illuminating, and the result from it is a necessity to recognize Him.&amp;nbsp;... Therefore vain dreams of those who believe that the world was created by accident, or that it could be built as a fatal necessity, or that it was there for eternity lining itself along his own necessary laws are completely eliminated."&lt;ref&gt;A Theory of Natural Philosophy, Zagreb, 1974., page 539&lt;/ref&gt;

Bošković also composed poetry with many religious and astronomical allusions. In his [[Marian devotion]], he wrote hexameter verses on the [[Virgin mary|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavle Knezović -Ruđer Bošković's songs on Virgin Mary, Obnovljeni život, Vol.50 No.5 Rujan 1995.http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/3574&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same [[St. Peter's Basilica|dome of St. Peter in Rome]], whose cupola he saved from ruin, he worked as a confessor employing the [[Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation|Sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation]].

== Competing claims for Bošković's nationality ==

The [[romantic nationalism|modern concept of nationality]], based on [[ethnic]] concepts as language, culture, religion, custom, etc., was developed only in the 19th century. For this reason the attribution of a definite "nationality" to personalities of the previous centuries, living in ethnically mixed regions, is often indeterminable; Bošković's legacy is consequently celebrated in [[Croatia]], Italy and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name="Whyte-1961"/&gt;

Croatian sources stress that he referred to his Croatian identity.&lt;ref name="Dadić"&gt;[http://dizbi.hazu.hr/?sitetext=107 Dadić, Žarko. ''Ruđer Bošković'' (Parallel text in Croatian and English).

Italian sources claim that Boscovich was remembered as an Italian. According to Italian sources, he was born in a city with mixed cultures, Croatian and Italian, and the higher social strata of Dubrovnik were under Italian influence (Roman-Dalmatian influence). His mother's family came from Italy, and his life and career had strong Italian influences. He moved to Italy at age 14, where he spent most of his life. In some encyclopaedias he is described as an Italian scientist. He used the Italian language in private, including in correspondence with his brother Baro,&lt;ref name="edizionenazionaleboscovich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edizionenazionaleboscovich.it/index.php/biblioteca-digitale/doc_download/12-corrispondenza-2.html |title=''Edizione Nazionale delle opere e della corrispondenza di Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich.

When [[d'Alembert]] in his ''Opuscule mathématiques (...)'' called him Italian,&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opuscules mathématiques ou Mémoires sur différens sujets de géométrie, de méchanique, etc|author=Alembert, J.L.R.|date=1761|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGYVAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bošković said that "the author (i.e., himself) is Dalmatian from Ragusa, and not Italian (...) but for the long time passed in Italy since its first youth, he can in some way be called Italian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boscovich|first=Ruggero Giuseppe|title=Voyage astronomique et geographique, dans l'État de l'Eglise|date=1770|location=Google books Italy|pages=449 (footnote)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxAOAAAAQAAJ|author2=Christopher Maire|language=French|quote=Nous observerons ici en premier lieu que norre Auteur est Dalmate et de Raguse, non-Italien... vu le long séjour qu'il a fait en Italie depuis sa premiere jeunesse, on peut in quelque sorte le dire Italien|publisher=N.M.

==Works==
Boscovich published eight scientific dissertations prior to his 1744 ordination as a priest and appointment as a professor and another 14 afterwards.

'''Ruben L.F. Habito''' (born c. 1947) is a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] former [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] turned master practicing in the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] lineage of Zen. In his early youth he was sent to Japan on missionary work where he began Zen practice under [[Yamada Koun|Yamada Koun-roshi]], a Zen master who taught many Christians students, which was unusual for the time. In 1988, Ruben received [[Dharma transmission]] from [[Yamada Koun]]. Ruben left the [[Jesuit order]] in 1989, and in 1991 founded the lay organization [[Maria Kannon Zen Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].  He has taught at [[Perkins School of Theology]], [[Southern Methodist University]] since 1989 where he continues to be a faculty member. He is married and has two sons.

'''Scott Milross Buchanan''' (March 17, 1895 – March 25, 1968) was an [[American philosopher]], educator, and foundation consultant. He is best known as the founder of the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], at [[Annapolis, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;The same program is used at St. John's College's second campus in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] which was founded in 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchanan's various projects and writings may be understood as an ambitious program of social and cultural reform based on the insight that many crucial problems arise from the uncritical use of [[symbol]]ism.  In this sense, his program was similar to and competed with a number of contemporary movements such as [[Alfred Korzybski|Alfred Korzybski's]] [[General Semantics]], [[Otto Neurath|Otto Neurath's]] "Unity of Science" project, the [[semiotics]] of [[Charles W. Morris|Charles Morris]] and the "orthological" projects of [[Charles Kay Ogden]].  Buchanan collaborated with the latter effort for a number of years.

Buchanan's own program, however, differed from these generally [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[positivism (philosophy)|positivist]], or [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] movements by stressing what he saw as the need for reforms in the mathematical symbolism employed in modern [[science]]. Buchanan's first book, published in 1927, stated that science is "the greatest body of uncriticized dogma we have today" and even likened science to the "Black Arts". For the rest of his career, Buchanan pondered ways to mitigate the variety of threats to humanity that he perceived in the unmanaged and unsupervised growth of modern science and technology.

==Life==
Buchanan was born in [[Sprague, Washington]] and was raised in [[Jeffersonville, Vermont]]. He received his undergraduate degree from [[Amherst College]] in 1916, majoring in Greek and mathematics. After serving in the Navy during the final year of [[World War I]], he studied philosophy at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes scholar]] between 1919 and 1921. He continued his studies in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] and received his doctorate in 1925.

During his undergraduate years, Buchanan became personally close to Amherst's president [[Alexander Meiklejohn]] and was strongly influenced by Meiklejohn's ideas about educational reform.  This continuing interest led Buchanan in 1925 to accept a position as Assistant Director of the [[People's Institute]], an affiliate of the [[Cooper Union]] in New York City that was dedicated to [[adult education]] and other forms of cultural enrichment for the city's workers and immigrants. It was there that Buchanan met [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Richard McKeon]], and the three of them conceived an ambitious program for reviving American education and democracy through mass training in the traditional [[liberal arts]] by means of the [[Socratic method]] and the [[Great Books]] curriculum.

Buchanan spent the next twenty years struggling to establish an institutional base for this radical vision. Buchanan's initial efforts at the [[People's Institute]] were followed by his establishment of the [[Great Books]] "Virginia Program" at the [[University of Virginia]], where Buchanan was a Professor of Philosophy between 1929 and 1936. He was then invited to the [[University of Chicago]] by its president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] in order to help form a "Committee on Liberal Arts" in association with Buchanan's former [[People's Institute]] associates [[Mortimer Adler|Adler]] and [[Richard McKeon|McKeon]]. However, this effort failed almost immediately due to philosophical differences and academic politics.

Fortunately, another opportunity quickly arose in the form of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], a venerable institution with a heritage that reaches back to the colonial period, but which by 1936 had nevertheless lost its accreditation and was in desperate need of reorganization. In 1937, the trustees invited Buchanan and his associate [[Stringfellow Barr]] to make a fresh start. With Barr as president and Buchanan as dean, the two men reorganized the school that year around the [[Great Books]] "New Program".  This radical new curriculum quickly achieved national fame and survives today. It is the achievement for which Buchanan is primarily remembered.

Buchanan left St. John's College in 1947 after a successful but disillusioning legal struggle with the U.S. Navy, which had been trying to seize the St. John's campus as part of a plan to enlarge the nearby [[United States Naval Academy]]. After spending the next two years directing [[Liberal Arts, Inc.]], a failed venture to create a Great Books-based college in Massachusetts, Buchanan's democratic vision for the revival of the [[liberal arts]] turned from the academic to the political arena.  Except for a brief period in 1956 and 1957, when he was a visiting lecturer at [[Princeton University]] and also served as chairman of the Religion and Philosophy Departments at [[Fisk University]], he held no more positions in academic institutions. In 1948 Buchanan worked actively in the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] presidential campaign of [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], and for several years afterwards was consultant, trustee, and secretary of the [[Foundation for World Government]]. In 1957 Buchanan accepted an invitation by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] to become a senior fellow at [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]], a liberal political think tank in [[Santa Barbara, California]].  Buchanan remained at the Center for the rest of his career, and one of the projects to which he contributed was the Center's efforts to publicize the work of [[Jacques Ellul]] in the English-speaking world.

Buchanan died in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in 1968. He was survived by his widow, the former Miriam Damon Thomas, and their son Douglas.

==Work==
Buchanan's first book was ''Possibility'', published in 1927 as part of C. K. Ogden's ''[[The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method]]''.  This work was published simultaneously in the same series with [[Mortimer Adler]]'s own first book ''Dialectic'', and each book refers to the other.  [[John Dewey]] praised ''Possibility'' as a "significant intellectual achievement".

His second book, ''Poetry and Mathematics'', was published in 1929 by The John Day Company. Developed from materials for Buchanan's lectures at the [[People's Institute]], this book was recognized by [[Richard McKeon]], who had studied medieval philosophy under [[Étienne Gilson]], as a rediscovery of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]]. This insight of McKeon's, wrote Buchanan in 1961, is what led to the "radical reform of teaching and learning in a small province of the modern academy" for which Buchanan is remembered today. The American philosopher [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]] praised ''Poetry and Mathematics'' as "an admirable piece of work."

''Symbolic Distance in Relation to Analogy and Fiction'', Buchanan's third book, appeared in London in 1932 as part of Ogden's "Psyche Miniatures" series.  Part of it had been published earlier in ''Psyche'', the journal of Ogden's [[Orthological Institute]].  Although Buchanan later claimed that this work was inspired by a year's study of the English logician [[Boole|George Boole]], it does not mention Boole.  Rather, ''Symbolic Distance'' was obviously written in collaboration with Ogden's investigation of the linguistic theories of [[Jeremy Bentham]], and Ogden cites ''Symbolic Distance'' in his own book ''Bentham's Theory of Fictions''.  This is the first of Buchanan's books to mention the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]].

Buchanan's fourth book, ''The Doctrine of Signatures: A Defence of Theory in Medicine'' appeared in New York, in 1938, also (like ''Possibility'') as part of Ogden's ''International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method''. A portion of the first chapter had appeared earlier in the 1934 issue of ''Psyche'', under the title "Introduction to Medieval Orthology".

''Truth in the Sciences'' was completed by Buchanan in 1950 under contract to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' for a project that never materialized. The manuscript was published posthumously in book form by the [[University of Virginia]] in 1972.

Buchanan's final book, ''Essay in Politics'', was published in 1953 by the Philosophical Library in New York. Stemming from his involvement with the 1948 [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace]] campaign and later with the [[Foundation for World Government]], Buchanan reflects on the problems of political representation and democracy that are posed by technology and industrialization.  Buchanan continued to work on these ideas during his years at the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]].

'''''The Ethics of Ambiguity''''' (French title: ''Pour une morale de l'ambiguïté'') is [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s second major non-fiction work. &lt;!--Any particular relevance?: It is nearly twice as long as her first, ''[[Pyrrhus and Cineas]]''.--&gt; It was prompted by a lecture she gave in 1945,{{which|date=May 2014}} after which she claimed that it was impossible to base an [[Ethics|ethical system]] on her partner [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s major philosophical work ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (French title: ''L'Être et le néant'').{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The following year, over a six-month period, she took on the challenge, publishing the resulting text first as installments in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' and then, in November 1947, as a book.

== Contents ==

''The Ethics of Ambiguity'' consists of three parts and a short conclusion.&lt;ref name="dBV"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Beauvoir |first= Simone |others= Translated from the French by Bernard Frechtman  |title= ''The Ethics of Ambiguity'' |publisher= Citadel Press, A division of Lyle Stuart Inc. |year= 1948  |isbn= 0-8065-0160-X |authorlink = Simone_de_Beauvoir |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/ambiguity/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part I ===

'''"Ambiguity and Freedom,"''' lays out the philosophical underpinnings of de Beauvoir's stance on ethics.  She asserts that "man" (meaning human beings generally) is fundamentally free, a freedom that comes from his "nothingness," which is an essential aspect of his ability to be self-aware, to be conscious of himself: "... the nothingness which is at the heart of man is also the consciousness that he has of himself."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt; But man is also a thing, a "facticity," an object for others.&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  The ambiguity is that each of us is both subject and object, freedom and facticity.  As free, we have the ability to take note of ourselves and choose what to do.  As factic, we are constrained by physical limits, social barriers and the expectations and political power of others.

De Beauvoir rejects any notion of an absolute goodness or moral imperative that exists on its own.  "...there exists no absolute value before the passion of man, outside of it, in relation to which one might distinguish the useless from the useful."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  Values come only from our choices.&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;

Human freedom can be only in concrete projects, not in the abstract.  Freedom "requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;

The types of particular content that are suitable are discussed in Part III.

=== Part II ===

'''Part II, "Personal Freedom and Others,"''' examines a number of different ways that people try to deny their freedom, as freedom can be uncomfortable and disquieting.  The freedom to choose entails the freedom to try to avoid one's freedom.  Before we can even do that, however, we start as children, who take the values of the adults around them as ready-made things.  She calls this the attitude of "seriousness," in which the child "escapes the anguish of freedom" by thinking of values as existing objectively, outside himself, rather than as an expression of his freedom.&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  Once past childhood, one can be a ''sub-man'' who avoids all questions of freedom and assumes himself not free.  The next rung up the hierarchy is the ''serious man'' who "gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned," in effect reverting to a kind of childhood.&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  Both the sub-man and the serious man refuse to recognize that they are free, in the sense of being able to choose their own values.

Several other types recognize their freedom, but misuse it.  The ''nihilist'', having failed at life, decides not to try anything at all.  "Conscious of being unable to be anything, man then decides to be nothing. ... Nihilism is disappointed seriousness which has turned back upon itself."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  The ''adventurer'' is one who engages vigorously in various life projects, but without caring for the goal.  The adventurer "does not attach himself to the end at which he aims; only to his conquest. He likes action for its own sake."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  And he tramples on others in the process: "[T]he adventurer shares the nihilist’s contempt for men."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  Finally the ''passionate man'' cares enthusiastically about his goal, but shares a similar contempt for others: "Not intending his freedom for men, the passionate man does not recognize them as freedoms either. He will not hesitate to treat them as things."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;

And finally there is ''genuine freedom'', which takes the excitement of the adventurer and the passion of the passionate man and includes with them a concern for other people, other freedoms, as well.  "Passion is converted to genuine freedom only if one destines his existence to other existences ...."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  "To will oneself free is also to will others free."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;

=== Part III ===

'''Part III, "The Positive Aspect of Ambiguity,"''' examines the intricacies and nuances of genuinely free action in the world.  It includes five sections.

:'''Part III, section 1, "The Aesthetic Attitude,"''' criticizes the attitude of detached contemplation as being unworkable.

:'''Part III, section 2, "Freedom and Liberation,"''' explores the evils of oppression and offers a number of trenchant observations about the relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed.  The oppressor recognizes the interdependence of people, but treats those of the oppressed class as things, not as free human existents in their own right.  To prevent them from rebelling, the oppressor tries to mystify them into thinking that the oppressive situation is just natural.  But it is not, and "the oppressed can fulfill his freedom as a man only in revolt ...."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;

:'''Part III, section 3, "The Antinomies of Action,"''' examines the need for violence and its consequent moral quandaries.  "In order for a liberating action to be a thoroughly moral action, it would have to be achieved through a conversion of the oppressors: there would then be a reconciliation of all freedoms. But no one any longer dares to abandon himself today to these utopian reveries."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  Under what circumstances, then, is violence justified?  Under what circumstances may the oppressed treat the oppressors as less than fully human in order to secure their own liberation?  De Beauvoir considers in some detail the nuances and difficulties of such considerations.

:'''Part III, section 4, "The Present and the Future,"''' treats the relationship of action in the present to achieve an uncertain goal in the future.  The determinism suggested by the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx is considered and criticized.

:'''Part III, section 5, "Ambiguity,"''' returns to the originating theme of the work, that each of us is both radically free, able to transcend himself or herself, and factical, constrained by that which just is what it is.  How does one remain true to one's freedom while allowing others their own freedom, even if they make mistakes?  Are we justified in telling the truth when another person finds the truth unbearable?  We have to act in particular situations, "inventing an original solution" each time, but remembering that "man is man only through situations whose particularity is precisely a universal fact."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;

The brief '''Conclusion''' sums up de Beauvoir's view of human freedom: "... we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite."&lt;ref name="dBV" /&gt;  She ends with a call for us to realize and act on this fundamental truth of our existence.

'''''The Law of Peoples''''' is [[American philosophy|American philosopher]] [[John Rawls]]' work on [[international relations]]. First published in 1993 as a short article (1993: ''Critical Inquiry'', no.20), in 1999 it was expanded and joined with another essay, "The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" (1997: ''University of Chicago Law Review'', vol.64, no.3) to form a full-length book. It is an attempt to show "how the content of a Law of Peoples might be developed out of a [[Liberalism|liberal]] idea of justice similar to, but more general than, the idea I call [[justice as fairness]]" (L.P. p.&amp;nbsp;3).
[[Image:The Law of Peoples.jpg|thumb|200px]]

== The Society of Peoples ==

By 'peoples', Rawls means "the actors in the Society of Peoples, just as citizens are the actors in domestic society" (L.P. p.&amp;nbsp;23).  Peoples share three features: a common system of [[government]]; what [[John Stuart Mill]] called 'common sympathies' (XVI of Mill's Considerations, 1862); and a [[morality|moral]] nature.  Although the Law of Peoples is supposed to be part of liberal foreign policy, the peoples Rawls talks about are not necessarily liberal.  'Decent hierarchical peoples' also feature as parties to the Law of Peoples, though burdened states, outlaw states and benevolent absolutisms do not.  The inclusion of 'decent hierarchical peoples' is demanded by the notion of toleration: a notion Rawls sees as integral to liberalism.  In part, the Law of Peoples is an attempt to show how far international toleration by liberal societies can reasonably be expected to extend.

By 'Law of Peoples', Rawls means "a particular political conception of right and [[justice]] that applies to the principles and norms of international law and practice" (L.P. p.&amp;nbsp;3).  This political conception of justice is arrived at through the device of the '[[original position]]' – a hypothetical arrangement whereby representatives of each of the peoples get together with the aim of determining principles that will govern the terms of their association.  The principles yielded by this process make up the content of the Law of Peoples.  The eight principles are:

#"Peoples (as organized by their government) are free and independent, and their freedom and independence is to be respected by other peoples."
#"Peoples are equal and parties to their own agreements."
#"Peoples have the right of self-defense but no right to war."
#"Peoples are to observe a duty of non-intervention."
#"Peoples are to observe treaties and undertakings."
#"Peoples are to observe certain specified restrictions on the conduct of war (assumed to be in self-defense)."
#"Peoples are to honor human rights."{{ref|1993list}}
#"Peoples have a duty to assist other peoples living under unfavorable conditions that prevent their having a just or decent political and social regime."{{ref|eight}}

==Ideal ''vs'' Non-Ideal Theory==
The content-giving part of Rawls' thesis belongs to Ideal Theory, it is an attempt to define how different peoples who are just, or at least decent, should behave with respect to one another. Rawls refers to this ideal conception as a "realistic utopia": realistic because it could and may exist; utopian because it "joins reasonableness and justice with conditions enabling citizens to realize their fundamental interests" (L.P. p.&amp;nbsp;7).  This is a continuation of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]’s idea that any attempt to discover sure principles of government must take "men as they are and laws as they might be" (''[[The Social Contract]]''; opening passage).  Thus, the Law of Peoples is realistically utopian: it is an attempt to show "how reasonable citizens and peoples might live peacefully in a just world" (L.P., Preface, p.vi).

It is typical of Rawls' approach that he focuses on ideal theory and does not discuss to any great extent non-ideal theory, which involves considering the proper response to injustice. However, in dealing with international relations the questions arising from the highly nonideal conditions of the real world with its great injustices and widespread social evils cannot be put aside. Thus Rawls considers how a "well ordered" people (liberal or decent) should behave towards out-law or burdened societies that cannot be considered decent.

'''The Process''' is an art and philosophy collective formed in the early 1990s. The idea was initially birthed at the same time as, and with a subset of the same people from, the studio work for the [[Skinny Puppy]] album ''[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]'', though the direct interrelation ends there. Some of the early contributors included [[Nivek Ogre]], [[Genesis P Orridge|Genesis P-Orridge]], [[William Morrison (director)|William Morrison]], and [[Loki der Quaeler]]. Members are known as Processians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltschmerz.org/process.org/Transmedia/Definitional.html Definitional] process.org&lt;/ref&gt; or Processors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltschmerz.org/process.org/Processors/index.html Processors index] process.org&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Process logo &amp;mdash; formed by the overlapping of 4 P's &amp;mdash; the name, along with some philosophies, other symbols and texts were taken from [[Process Church|The Process Church of the Final Judgement]] (Process Church); ideas that were initially introduced to the early members of The Process collective by Genesis.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Aside from the facet of their structure aimed at supporting a [[micronation]] status, the general organizational structure of the [[Neue Slowenische Kunst|NSK]] played a contributing role in the aim of the original, largely unrealized, structure of The Process.

==The 1990s==
One of the initial ideas pursued by the collective was concerned with the idea of geographically distributed collaboration. The notion which often came up in early conversations was one of "well, there's this newly available medium: the internet; it really seems like it could be used to better facilitate musicians, graphic artists, and philosophers collaborating on works", Loki Der Quaeler (personal reflection 2007).

Information about The Process was initially communicated across [[Usenet]] by its founding members, who encouraged people to upload their various media files for collaboration via anonymous [[FTP]].  "We worked out a doctrine and put something up and from all of that, something was woken. Something rose up and came back to meet the call," Ogre (''Paradigm Magazine'', 1998). Later, a mailing list was also created, but without direct participation by Ogre or Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Ogre or Genesis P'Orridge participate on the email list?" The Process List FAQ, circa 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Philip H., [http://users.bestweb.net/~kali93/oct98/ogre.htm Interview with Ogre], Paradigm Shift, October 1998, Vol. 1, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Process provided one of the earliest international collaboration efforts by artists and philosophers who were largely unknown to each other prior to their usage of the Internet. This effort has largely gone undocumented by contemporary media theorists and Internet sociologists despite the fact that many of their assertions played out in the course of the experiment.

Several gatherings of participants took place in 1997 and 1998 at primarily East Coast locations. During the last years of the decade, community activity dwindled and the website was eventually retired. Creative spin offs and independent projects were launched around roughly the same time frame drawing many participants in new directions and away from the collective. In this same period, a number of original members of the Process Church contacted some of the early contributors of the collective and the Process Church members were subsequently provided with their own web space on the Process server from March 1997 until May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;according to the web archive of Process.org @ [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.process.org WayBackMachine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Genesis brought with h/er to The Process a philosophy and documents that had similarities to [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth|Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY)]] a collective that he had previously co-founded in the early 1980s. S/he was accused by Temple ov Psychick Youth North America (TOPYNA) of plagiarizing and re-branding a TOPY document for use in The Process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.pagan/msg/bc79775b043ee4b2?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain An Official Reply from TOPYNA], October 10, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis also founded congruently with The Process an organization with an acronym similar to the one used by TOPY called [[Thee Outer Process International| Thee Outer Process International (TOPI)]].&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Philip H., [http://members.aol.com/discord23/gen.htm Interview with Genesis P-Orridge], Paradigm Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 2000==
In 2000, Genesis premiered a short film entitled ''The Process is the Product''. It was prepared from multimedia material created by Process Media Labs during the early years of The Process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/tatracars/process1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:39:18 'The Process is the Product' Page] (unofficial)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Technics==
The Process ftp was initially located at the address ftp.netcom.com directory pub/puppy. The group was then afforded its own server space and listproc at [[University of Southern California|USC]], by [[Robert Engen]], with the address process.usc.edu. Starting in 1995, internet efforts not involving the listproc were based from its own domain: process.org.

The original process.org server was a [[NeXTstation]] which sat in a closet in [[Vancouver]], B.C; the location and internet connection were provided by [[Jean-Yves Thériault|Blacky]]. Since 2000, the server has been on anonymous hardware in a [[Colocation centre|colocation center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9967">'''''Theophysics''''' is a term, a portmanteau of [[theology]] and [[physics]], used occasionally in [[philosophy]] for an approach to [[cosmology]] that attempts to reconcile [[physical cosmology]] and [[religious cosmology]]. It is related to the term [[physicotheology]], the difference between them being that the aim of physicotheology is to derive theology from physics, whereas that of theophysics is to unify physics and theology.

==Usage==
{{ill|Paul Richard Blum|de}} (2002) uses the term in a critique of physicotheology, i.e. the view that arguments for the [[existence of God]] can be derived from the existence of the physical world (e.g. the "[[argument from design]]").  Theophysics would be the opposite approach, i.e. an approach to the material world informed by the knowledge that it is created by God.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Richard Blum, "Divine project: from physical-theology to theophysics", ''Philosophisches Jahrbuch'' {{ISSN|0031-8183}}, 2002, Vol. 109, No. 2, pp. 271-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard H. Popkin]] (1990) applies the term to the "spiritual physics" of [[Cambridge Platonist]] [[Henry More]] and his pupil and collaborator Lady [[Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway|Anne Conway]],&lt;ref name=Popkinp105&gt;Richard H. Popkin, "The Spiritualistic Cosmologies of Henry More and Anne Conway", in {{ill|Sarah Hutton|de}} (ed.), ''Henry More (1614–1687): Tercentenary Studies''. Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1990, p. 105. {{ISBN|0-7923-0095-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; who enthusiastically accepted the new science, but rejected the various forms of materialist mechanism proposed by [[Descartes]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Spinoza]] to buttress it,&lt;ref name=Popkinp98&gt;Popkin, "Cosmologies", p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; as these, More and Conway argued, were incapable of explaining productive causality.&lt;ref name=Popkinp111&gt;Popkin, "Cosmologies", p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, More and Conway offered what Popkin calls "a genuine important alternative to modern mechanistic thought",&lt;ref name=Popkinp98/&gt; "a thoroughly scientific view with a metaphysics of spirits to make everything operate". Materialist mechanism triumphed, however, and today their spiritual cosmology, as Popkin notes, "looks very odd indeed".&lt;ref name=Popkinp111/&gt;

The term has been applied by some philosophers to the system of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. William Denovan (1889) wrote in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'': "The highest stage of his revelation might be denominated ''Theophysics'', or the science of Divine purpose in creation."&lt;ref&gt;William Denovan, [http://www.newtheism.com/papers/W.Denovan/a_swedenborgian_view.htm "A Swedenborgian View of the Problem of Philosophy"], ''Mind'', Vol. 14, No. 54 (April 1889), pp. 216–229.&lt;/ref&gt; R. M. Wenley (1910) referred to Swedenborg as "the Swedish theophysicist".&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Wenley, ''Kant and His Philosophical Revolution''. Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, 1910, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Laberge (1972) observes that [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s famous critique of physicotheology in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781; second edition 1787) has tended to obscure the fact that in his early work, ''General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens'' (1755), Kant defended a physicotheology that at the time was startlingly original, but that succeeded only to the extent that it concealed what Laberge terms a theophysics ("ce que nous appellerons une ''théophysique''").&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Laberge, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/phlou_00353841_1972_num_70_8_5698 "La physicothéologie de l'''Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels'' (1755)"], ''[[Revue Philosophique de Louvain]]'', 1972, Vol. 70, No. 8, pp. 541–572.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophysics is a fundamental concept in the thought of [[Raimon Panikkar]], who wrote in ''Ontonomía de la ciencia'' (1961) that he was looking for "a theological vision of Science that is not a [[Metaphysics]], but a Theophysics.... It is not a matter of a Physics 'of God', but rather of the 'God of the Physical'; of God the creator of the world... not the world as autonomous being, independent and disconnected from God, but rather ontonomicly linked to Him". As a vision of "Science as theology", it became central to Panikkar's "cosmotheandric" view of reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raimon-panikkar.org/english/gloss-theophysics.html "Theophysics"], raimon-panikkar.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank J. Tipler]]'s [[Omega Point]] theory (1994), which identifies concepts from [[physical cosmology]] with theistic concepts, is sometimes referred to by the term,&lt;ref name=theophysics&gt;[http://theophysics.chimehost.net/ Theophysics: God Is the Ultimate Physicist]&lt;/ref&gt; although not by Tipler himself. Tipler was an atheist when he wrote ''[[The Anthropic Cosmological Principle]]'' (1986, co-authored with [[John D. Barrow]], whose many popular books seldom mention theology) and ''[[The Physics of Immortality (book)|The Physics of Immortality]]'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Tipler, ''The Physics of Immortality'', Chapter XII.&lt;/ref&gt; but a Christian when he wrote ''The Physics of Christianity'' (2007). In 1989, [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], a [[liberal theologian]] in the continental [[Protestant]] tradition, welcomed Tipler's work on cosmology as raising "the prospect of a rapprochement between physics and theology in the area of [[eschatology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfhart Pannenberg, "Theological Appropriation of Scientific Understandings: Response to Hefner, Wicker, Eaves, and Tipler", ''Zygon'', Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent essays, while not concurring with all the details of Tipler's discussion, Pannenberg has defended the theology of the Omega Point.&lt;ref name=theophysics/&gt;

The term is also occasionally used as a [[nonce word]] in parodies or humorous contexts, as by [[Aldous Huxley]] in ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''[http://centretruths.co.uk/fahdtu/ANTIC%20HAY.htm Antic Hay]'', Chapter I, third paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thinking and Destiny'' by [[Harold W. Percival]] on "The law of thought". Its basic premise is that thinking creates karma or destiny. The book shows how to perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts.

==Ideas==
The book is based on what Percival called “The law of thought.” It was produced over a period of 34 years and has 14 chapters, each with sections. Percival also provides succinct definitions of many words, from Accident and Alcoholism to Wrong, as they are used in his book. In ''Thinking and Destiny'' he offers a complete cosmology of the universe, with ideas such as the universe having nature and intelligent sides. Percival defines the nature side of the universe, in part, as an unintelligent mechanism through which units that are conscious only as their functions become self-conscious intelligences by means of what he termed “The Eternal Order of Progression.”

===The Law of Thought===
In ''Thinking and Destiny'', Percival explains how all of life’s lessons are the result of our own thinking and can be used to learn what to do and what not to do, and that we can perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts. Thinking without creating thoughts is said to be the way to stop creating [[karma]] or destiny. Thinking is shown to be the cause and solution to reincarnation, otherwise known as the wheel of birth, life and death. Percival leaves it to the reader to choose what to do with the often startling information provided and assures that the lessons will be learned eventually.

===Conscious of Consciousness===
In his Foreword to the book, the author explained that his experiences of being “conscious of Consciousness” allowed him to focus the Conscious Light within on subjects to see their essence. He further stated that the book was dictated because it was difficult to do this kind of thinking and write at the same time. While the contents of ''Thinking and Destiny'' are from no other book or body of authority, he indicated that the authority for the truth in the book is in the reader who can judge the statements by the truth that is in him or her. To be able to think in this concentrated way and to be “conscious of Consciousness” are shown to be potentially within the grasp of all humans.

===The Great Way===
In a postscript to ''Thinking and Destiny'' it is stated that the most one person can do for another is to tell him or her that there is the Great Way, as shown in the book. The Great Way is how and where the human body is transformed into an immortal body. The author offers specific information for the few who really want it, and shows why each person must do the work in life, not after death. The individual will embrace the ideas or put them off, but death remains the cost of life until conscious immortality is attained. The truth is faced as a matter of honesty and courage.

===The Word Foundation===
In 1950 Harold W. Percival established [[The Word Foundation]], Inc., a non-profit organization, to keep ''Thinking and Destiny'' and all of his other works in print and to share with the people of the world what he called “the royal good news” about the doer said to be indwelling in every human body. Three of his other books expanded on themes from ''Thinking and Destiny''. They are: ''Man and Woman and Child, Democracy Is Self-Government, and Masonry and Its Symbols.''

==Editions==
''Thinking and Destiny'', by [[Harold W. Percival]], was originally published by The Word Publishing Company, New York in 1946 and is now in its fourteenth printing. Its subtitle is: “With a Brief Account of the Descent of Man into this Human World, and, How He Will Return to the Eternal Order of Progression.” To support the text, Percival included sections for Symbols, Illustrations and Charts and Definitions of Terms and Phrases as they are used in the book.

==Influence==
Percival’s works were noted as a major influence upon [[Richard Matheson]], the famous author and screenwriter. He said that his book The Path was based largely on ''Thinking and Destiny''.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Richard. The Path: Metaphysics for the 90’s. (1998) The Word Foundation, Inc. {{ISBN|091165013X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self'', 1999, by Owen Slight, the author states that [[Harold W. Percival]]’s ''Thinking and Destiny'', like the [[Bhagavad Gita]], reveals relevant, instructive and long lasting lessons regarding the higher self and the human plight—long lost lessons of everlasting truth contained both in the Sanskrit ''Bhagavad Gita'' and ''Thinking and Destiny''. Both books contain complete systems of knowledge. The plight of [[Arjuna]] is shown by Percival to be our own.&lt;ref&gt;Slight, Owen, The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self, Owen Slight Publisher, 1999 {{ISBN|064635602X}}, 9780646356020&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Libya (1977-2011).svg|thumb|300px|The [[Flag of Libya#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|flag]] of the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] (1977–2011).]]
The '''Third International Theory''', also known as the '''Third Universal Theory''' ({{lang-ar|نظرية عالمية ثالثة}}), was the style of government proposed by Col. [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in the early 1970s, on which his government, the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]], was officially based. It was partly inspired by [[Islamic socialism]], [[Arab nationalism]], [[African nationalism]] and partly by the principles of [[direct democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmlibya.org/English/RCM%20(1).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-alter.org/vijesti/svijet/libijska-dzamahirija-zmedju-proslosti-i-sadasnjosti-1-dio]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has similarities with the system of Yugoslav municipal [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] in [[Titoism|Titoist]] [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and the Yugoslav [[Third Way]] during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s as developed by [[Edvard Kardelj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmlibya.org/English/RCM%20(1).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-alter.org/vijesti/svijet/libijska-dzamahirija-zmedju-proslosti-i-sadasnjosti-1-dio]&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by Gaddafi as an alternative to [[capitalism]] and [[communism]] for [[Third World]] countries, based on the stated belief that both of these ideologies had been proven invalid.

The Higher Council for National Guidance was created to disseminate and implement this theory, and it found partial realization in Libya. By 2011 the fall and death of Gaddafi had seen his system dis-established and replaced by the [[National Transitional Council]].

== Background ==
{{Main |The Green Book (Libya)}}
[[File:Muammar al-Gaddafi at the AU summit.jpg|thumb|right|Muammar Gaddafi, author of the Third International Theory, here in 2009.]]
Key provisions of the Third International Theory are outlined in [[The Green Book (Libya)|''The Green Book'']] (published from 1976–1979). It is a system of views which criticizes European-style democracy and Soviet Marxism in detail.

===Intellectual and political context===
{{further|History of Libya under Gaddafi}}
In the 1960s and 70s, in the countries of the Arab-Muslim East, various theories of "national brands of socialism", named "Islamic socialism", became widespread. This socialism was based on the principles of nationalism, religion and equality, and its ideas inspired a number of revolutions, popular uprisings and coups in the Arab world. Similarly, in Libya, on 1 September 1969 a group of Libyan army officers belonging to the Movement of Free Officers, Unionists, and Socialists overthrew the monarchy and proclaimed the Libyan Arab Republic. The supreme power was temporarily relegated to the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), headed by 27-year-old Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;ref Name="ReferenceA"&gt;Borisov SP Muammar Gaddafi on the road to socialism / / ''Pravda''. - March 27, 2002. - № 23, pp. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] orientation of the Libyan revolution manifested itself clearly in the first months of the new regime. On 7 October 1969 at the 24th Session of [[UN General Assembly]], the Permanent Representative of Libya announced its intention to eliminate all foreign bases on Libyan land.

Following this, the Libyan leadership informed the ambassadors of the United States and Britain that it was terminating the respective agreements. Almost at the same time an offensive began against the position of foreign capital in the economy.

The first results and the nearest tasks of the Libyan revolution were fixed in a public statement on 11 December 1969, a Provisional Constitutional Declaration. Islam was declared the official [[state religion]]. It was proclaimed that one of the main goals of the revolution was the building of a form of socialism based on "religion, morality and patriotism". Gaddafi and his companions intended to achieve this through "social justice, high levels of production, the elimination of all forms of exploitation and the equitable distribution of national wealth".

The Revolutionary Command Council was to function as the centre of the political organization of society, with the right to appoint cabinet ministers, to declare war and enter into contracts, to issue decrees with the force of law, and to handle key aspects of internal affairs and foreign policy. Chairman of the IBS, Gaddafi was appointed head of the Libyan Arab Republic.&lt;ref Name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1973, Gaddafi organized the Arab Socialist Union, which became the sole legal political organization in the country. In 1977 the [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]], representing numerous national committees, adopted a decree (the "Sabha Declaration") on the establishment of a "regime of people's power" (the so-called 'direct popular democracy') in Libya, and the country was renamed the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The Revolutionary Command Council was also renamed and transformed into the General Secretariat of the Congress. In practice, the Arab Socialist Union then merged with the apparatus of the General People's Congress. The people elected into the General Secretariat of the General People's Congress were Gaddafi (General Secretary) and four of his closest associates — Major [[Abdessalam Jalloud]], and generals Abu-Bakr Younis Jabr, Mustafa al-Harrubi and Huveyldi al-Hmeydi.

Two years later, the five leaders resigned from public office, yielding them to professional managers. From then until his death, Gaddafi officially held the title of the Leader of the Libyan Revolution and the group of the five leaders is named "the Revolutionary Leadership". Furthermore, a hierarchy of Revolutionary Committees was established with the purpose of implementing the policies of the Revolutionary Leadership within the system of the People's Congresses.

== Doctrine ==
The official ideological doctrine is the Third International Theory, described in Gaddafi's "Green Book" (1976–1979). Copies of the "Green Book" were always on sale in Libyan bookstores in many languages prior to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kudelev V. V. "The situation in Libya", ''Journal of the Russia in Global Affairs''. - 2007. - № 1, pp. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a collection of quotes of the Libyan leader, divided into three parts and covering the following vital aspects of existence:
# Solving the problem of Democracy (People Power);
# Solving the problem of the economy (Socialism);
# The public aspect of the "Third International Theory."

=== "People Power" ===
The first part of the "Green Book" is "Solving the problem of democracy: The Authority of the People". This political aspect of the Third International Theory, published in January 1976, rejects traditional forms of democracy such as parliament, political parties, referendums, and outlines the basic principles of direct popular democracy based on the people's congresses and people's committees. The book argues that representative democracy is in fact nothing but a kind of dictatorship.

According to the "Green Book", the winner in the struggle for power is always an instrument of government - an individual, party, class; and the loser is always the people, and thus, it is not true democracy. The political struggle often leads to the rise to power of an instrument of government which represents a minority, and that through legal democratic means. Thus, all existing political regimes falsify genuine democracy and are dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Muammar Gaddafi. ''The Green Book: Translated from Arabic'' by Kovalev N.G. - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentarism, according to Gaddafi, is a perverse solution to the problem of democracy. A Parliament can not speak on behalf of the people, because democracy means the rule of the people, not of those who act on its behalf. Methods of electing the parliament can not be considered democratic, because the masses become completely disconnected from the Members of Parliament. The MPs monopolize the power of the masses and the right to decide their business for them. Parliament, in fact, represents not the people, but the party that won the elections. In fact, the people are used by the political forces in the struggle for power. The system of elected parliaments is a demagogic system because votes can be bought and manipulated, that is, parliamentary representation is a fraud. In general, the theory of representative government is, Gaddafi argues, an outdated practice that was invented by philosophers and thinkers at the time when the common folk were ordered about like livestock by their rulers.

The party, according to the "Green Book", is a modern tool of dictatorial rule - it is the power of a part over the whole. Parties are established by groups of people to act in their interests, or to impose their views on the public and to establish their ideology on it. The number of parties in a system does not alter the substance of the matter. Moreover, the more numerous the parties are, the more intensive is the power struggle between them, which in turn undermines the programmes geared to benefit the entire society. The interests of society and of its development are sacrificed for the sake of the partisan struggle for power.

In addition, parties may be corrupt and can be bribed from the outside and inside. The 'opposition' is not an organ of control over the activities of the people of the ruling party, it only waits for the right moment to take the place of the ruling party at the trough of power. Control is in the hands of the party in power (through Parliament), and power in the hands of the party in control.

Gaddafi compares party and clan. In his view, in the struggle for power, the party is no different from a power struggle between tribes and clans. Both types of struggle are portrayed as having a negative and disintegrating effect on society.

Referendum is also described as a falsification of democracy. Voters can say only "yes" or "no." The theory states that everyone should be able to justify their desire and the cause of their approval or disapproval. Therefore, to be completely democratic, it is necessary to create such an instrument of government, which would be identical to the entire nation as a whole, rather than to a representative body acting on its behalf.

==== People's congresses ====
Gaddafi offers to create a special hierarchical structure of people's congresses and committees, resulting in a system where "management becomes popular, control becomes popular, and the old definition of democracy as 'control of people over the government' is replaced by its new definition as 'the people's control over itself'."

"The only means of people's democracy are the people's congresses. Any other system of government is undemocratic. All existing world systems of government are undemocratic, if they do not adhere to this method of governance. People's congresses are the ultimate goal of the movement of peoples on the path to democracy. People's congresses and people's committees represent the end result of the peoples' struggle for democracy. "

In the proposed Jamahiriya, the entire population is divided into People's Congresses, which elect the People's Committees, which in turn form the second round of the People's Congresses, which elect the State Committees, which fulfil the function of state administration. Issues considered at the People's Congresses are finally formulated each year at the General People's Congress. Accordingly, the outcomes and decisions of the General Congress are brought to the lower levels in the reverse order.

At the General People's Congress, which gathers together the governing bodies of the people's congresses, the people's committees, the trade unions and the professional associations, the most important public issues are discussed and the definitive legislative decisions are made.

In the first part of the "Green Book" Gaddafi also lays out his views on [[freedom of speech]]. According to him, "a human being, as an individual, should have the freedom of expression, and even if mad, s/he should have the right to freely express his/her madness." Man, as a legal entity, is also free to express themselves as such. In the first case the man represents only himself, in the second—only a group of individuals forming a legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;Muammar Gaddafi. ''The Green Book: Translated'' from Arabic by Kovalev NG - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

"Society is composed of many individuals and entities. Therefore, if an individual is insane, that does not mean that the rest of society are mad, too. Press is a method of expression of society, not a single person or entity. A newspaper, if owned by an individual, expresses only the views of its owner. The assertion that it represents public opinion is untenable and has no basis, because in reality it expresses the views of an individual, and from the point of view of genuine democracy it is unacceptable that an individual should own the print media and other types of media that provide the public with information. "

=== Socialism ===
The second part of the "Green Book"—"The solution of the economic problem (Socialism)"—sets out the economic aspect of the Third International Theory (published on 2 February 1978).

This part criticizes wage labor, comparing it with slavery, and proclaims the right of an employee to any product produced by them. A person must work in accordance with their powers and must also be able to satisfy their needs, and all surplus should be directed to the accumulation of social wealth. The accumulation of surplus by one person reduces [the possibility of satisfaction of] the needs of another person, and is therefore unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Muammar Gaddafi. ''The Green Book: Per. Arabic'' for Kovalev NG - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1977, Gaddafi put forward as the basis of economic life the principle of "self-government in the economy". In line with this principle, it was envisaged that enterprises should be transferred to the collective management of those who work there. The slogan "Partners, not employees" was given theoretical justification in the second part of the Green Book, and in November of the same year this idea began to be implemented in some industrial enterprises.

During the development of his economic ideas, Gaddafi put forward another slogan: "Real Estate—property of its inhabitant." That is, a person living in a house was an owner, not a tenant. In May 1978 a law was passed, whereby renting residential premises was prohibited, and tenants became owners of their rental apartments and houses.

With the slogan "Partners, not employees", workers and employees under the leadership of the People's Committees took over businesses and institutions in not only production but also trade, as well as the various services of service. Former owners got compensation and the opportunity to participate in the management of these enterprises, but in "equal partnership with the producers." This campaign was described as a "people's capture" and was a form of elimination of private ownership of business by upper and middle classes.

The functioning of the political system of the "Jamahiriya" in the field and especially in production was hampered both by the opposition of the upper classes and by the insufficient preparations for the activities conducted and the inability of the new management staff to manage the economy. This led to discontent and unrest among the population against the political and economic innovations of the Libyan leadership. Some of the Muslim clergy accused Gaddafi of "deviation from the Koran."

In response, authorities made serious efforts at limiting the influence of the clergy. Gaddafi made a televised public examination of members of the pro-opposition clergy on the subject the Koran. According to Gaddafi, he proved that they were unable to answer his questions, and he subsequently used that as a reason to deprive some of them of the right to conduct religious services.&lt;ref Name="ReferenceB"&gt;Strokan SN Libya defends its principles / / ''Kommersant''. - 2005. - № 243 / P (№ 3327), pp. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The final result of the economic reforms in the Jamahiriya was meant to be "the achievement of a new socialist society", a stage at which profit and money disappear from society and it becomes fully productive, and production fully meets the material needs of all members of society. At this stage, profits and money were meant to disappear by themselves.

Thanks to successful oil exploration starting in 1961, Libya has become a prosperous state with the highest per capita income in Africa. In 1970, oil prices on world markets increased considerably, leading to the accumulation of substantial funds in Libya, as a supplier of oil to western countries. Government revenues from oil exports were to be used to finance urban development and the creation of a modern system of social welfare.

At the same time, to improve Libya's international prestige, huge sums were spent on creating a well-equipped modern army. In the Middle East and North Africa, Libya served as a carrier of ideas of Arab nationalism and as an uncompromising enemy of Israel and the United States. The sharp drop in oil prices in mid-1980s and the UN sanctions for harbouring Palestinian separatists (in 1992) led to a significant weakening of Libya. On 12 September 2003 UN Security Council lifted the sanctions imposed in 1992.

=== Public aspect of the theory ===
The third part—the "Public aspect of the Third International Theory" was published on 1 June 1979. This addressed many aspects of life, including women, the education system, sports, and merging the world's languages. In this part a global vision of proper co-existence is presented. The fundamental principles come down to this: every nation should have its own religion, and should recognize the importance of a continuous social chain ("the family—the tribe—the nation—the world," "from the small to the great").

According to the "Green Book": "if the national spirit is stronger than the religious spirit, the struggle between different nations, which used to be united in one religion, is amplified, and each of those nations achieves independence, returning to the social structure that is characteristic of it." "A tribe is the same as a family, but one that has increased due to the increased growth of offspring, that is, the tribe is a big family. The Nation is a tribe, but a tribe that has grown as a result of increased offspring, i.e., a nation is a large tribe. The World is a nation but a nation divided into many nations as a result of population growth, i.e., the world is a great nation."&lt;ref&gt;Muammar Gaddafi. ''The Green Book: Translation from Arabic'' by Kovalev N.G. - Moscow: Infra, 2003, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

"The tribe is the natural social protection of the individual, ensuring his social needs." In Libya, according to accepted social tradition, the tribe collectively provides redemption of its members by collectively paying ransom for them, paying their fines, avenging them and collectively defending them.

A special place in the Green Book is reserved for women, their physical build and social role in society:
* First – "A woman is a human, just like a man is";
* Second – a woman is an individual of the female sex, whereas a man is an individual of the male sex. In view of this, a woman "has a regular disease in the form of [[menstruation|monthly bleeding]], but if this does not happen, then she has become pregnant."
* Third – the tendency to deny a woman her natural role of mother and replace her with nurseries is the beginning of a denial of humane, human society and of its transformation into a biological society, living an artificial life (as a result of this, in Libya, there are no kindergartens, and a woman, once she has given birth to a child, never goes to work again).
* Fourth – males in the world of plants and animals are by nature strong and rough, whereas women in the world of plants and animals in the world and the world's peoples are by nature beautiful and tender.

Accordingly, Gaddafi concluded that "human rights are for everyone—men and women, but the responsibilities are not equal."

Gaddafi also mentions the black race in his work: "The world will be ruled by the [[black people]]." In his opinion, this event will be the inevitable outcome of demographic and social patterns. That may be why, in recent decades, Libya has associated itself more with the African continent than the Arab world, trying to take a leading position there.

The issue of language is also addressed: "People will remain underdeveloped, until there is a common language." However, this question can be resolved only through a merging of languages in a series of stages, over several generations, provided that over time these generations lose their inherited traits: "the sensory perceptions, tastes and temperament of their fathers and grandfathers."

The Green Book also has an original take on sports and spectacles:
* "Sport can only be individual, like a prayer";
* "Mass sport is a social need of the human beings, so it is unacceptable from either a sporting or a democratic point of view to 'subcontract' sport to others [professionals]";
* "Collective sport is the business of the masses";
* "Stadiums exist in order to restrict the masses from using sports fields";
* "[[Boxing]] and various kinds of [[wrestling]] suggest that humanity has not completely rid itself of the vestiges of barbarism."

This approach to sport led to most of Libya's stadiums being open only during military parades, and any kind of wrestling being strictly prohibited.&lt;ref Name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==== Relationship with Islam ====
In the absence of specific prescriptions for the transformation of society in the so-called "Islamic socialism", Gaddafi constantly made revisions to this theory. Before the "Green Book", Islam was considered one of the ideological sources of official ideology, but the third part of this book, which appeared in the summer of 1979, did not assess its truthfulness on the basis of the precepts of Islam.

On the contrary, "the truth" of Islamic provisions themselves was evaluated in terms of their compatibility with the theory. It was declared that the driving force of history was national and social struggle. At the same time, as Gaddafi specified, "if we were to restrict ourselves to the support of Muslims only, that would be an example of bigotry and selfishness: True Islam is the one that defends the weak, even if they are not Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;Kudelev V.V. "The situation in Libya", ''Journal of the Russia in Global Affairs''. - 2007. - № 1, pp. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent explanations and comments on the "Green Book", many of its provisions underwent significant revisions while still remaining the basic catechism of ideology in Libya.

== Implementation in Libya ==
The theory was partially implemented in [[Libya]]. In March 1977, the "Declaration of Sabha" was declared, and the republic was transformed into a [[Jamahiriya]] (the [[Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]]). Those forms of private ownership which were deemed exploitative were abolished (whereas private family businesses in the service sector were preserved).

With the advent of globalization and the information revolution [[Gaddafi]] slightly modified his theory by introducing a thesis about the era of large spaces in which the nation-state is becoming inviable.
{{anchor|Jamahiriya}}
The word "Jamahiriya" ({{lang-ar|[[:wikt:جماهيرية|جماهيرية]]}} ''{{transl|ar|jamāhīriyyah}}'', approximately "[state] of the masses") is an Arabic [[neologism]]. It is the feminine ''nisba'' adjective formed from the term "Jamahir" (masses). It echoes the Arabic term for "Republic", "Jumhuriyah" (formally the feminine nisba adjective from ''Jumhur'' "people") .

Gaddafi's "Jamahiriya" form of government was supposed to be different from both the monarchy and the republic, hence the name of "Third" International Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kiselev SA Muammar Gaddafi - the theorist of the Third International Theory / / Vedomosti. - 2003. - № 10. with. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and government of Libya under Gaddafi===
{{main|Politics of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi}}
Under Gaddafi, Libya was governed by a military regime professing the idea of Arab nationalism, socialism, and Islam. The highest state authority was the General People's Congress (GPC), consisting of representatives of People's Committees. In practice, the GPC had the functions of a parliament. Its members were elected at local and regional levels, although part of them were assigned by Gaddafi personally. Gaddafi also appointed his ministers from among the members of the GPC. While Gaddafi himself did not hold any official posts, he remained the leading political figure in Libya.

Islam is the [[state religion]] of Libya, but the influence of the Muslim clergy is limited. [[Direct democracy]] has been declared in the country and oil revenues make it possible to maintain a high standard of living for the Libyan population. The presence of foreign capital is reduced, the enterprises in the sphere of large and medium industry are owned by the state.

The basis of justice is the [[Quran]]. Judicial proceedings are conducted by a hierarchical system of courts. Small lawsuits are considered in the Magistrates' Courts. Next come the Courts of the First Stage, the Appellate Courts and the Supreme Court.

The official main principle of government in Libya was: "Power, wealth and weapons - in the hands of the people."&lt;ref&gt;Strokan S.N. Libya defends its principles / / Kommersant. - 2005. - № 243 / P (№ 3327), pp. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modification of the theory in Libya===
The transformation of Libyan society into Jamahiriya was accompanied by many zigzags and went more slowly than Gaddafi intended. The system that he created may have aroused the Libyan people to political activism, but, as he had to admit, "popular participation in government was not complete".&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Bogdanov. Scandal at the top: Muammar Gaddafi has caused the League of Arab States to break apart / / ''Rossiyskaya Gazeta''. - May 24, 2004 - (Central edition) N3483, with. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, at the session of the General People's Congress held in the town of [[Sirte]] on 18 November 1992, it was decided to set up a new political structure: this was to initiate the country's transition to the supreme level of democracy - "a Model Jamahiriya". It was about creating, instead of the primary public meetings (People's Congresses), 1500 communes, which are self-guided mini-states within a state, each with full authority within its district, including the allocation of budgetary funds.&lt;ref&gt;Efremov VS. The sensational offer of the Libyan leader / / Newspaper " St. Petersburg Gazette. - April 7, 2001. - № 63 (2453), pp. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to reorganize the former political system, as explained by Gaddafi, was primarily due to the fact that it had "failed to ensure genuine democracy because of the complexity of the structure, which created a gap between the masses and the leadership, and was characterized by excessive centralization."

As a whole, after 1992, the Jamahiriya pursued a policy of building an "Islamic socialist society" dominated by the slogan "Power, wealth and weapons - in the hands of the people!".
