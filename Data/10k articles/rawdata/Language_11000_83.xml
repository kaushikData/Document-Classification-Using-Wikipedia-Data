A [[witness]] called on behalf of an adverse party is usually an [[adverse witness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Black's Law Dictionary}}, ''Adverse Witness'' 53-54 (6th Ed. 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the [[Direct examination|examination]] of an adverse party's witness may include [[leading question]]s and follows the rules of [[cross examination]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kenneth E.

'''Aporia''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἀπορία|ᾰ̓πορῐ́ᾱ]]|aporíā|impasse, difficulty in passage, lack of resources, puzzlement}}) denotes in [[philosophy]] a philosophical puzzle or state of puzzlement and in [[rhetoric]] a rhetorically useful expression of doubt.

==Definitions==
Definitions of the term ''aporia'' have varied throughout history. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' includes two forms of the word: the adjective "aporetic", which it defines as "to be at a loss", "impassable", and "inclined to doubt, or to raise objections"; and the noun form "aporia", which it defines as the "state of the aporetic" and "a perplexity or difficulty". The dictionary entry also includes two early textual uses, which both refer to the term's rhetorical (rather than philosophical) usage.

In [[George Puttenham]]'s ''The Arte of English Poesie'' (1589), aporia is "the Doubtful, [so] called...because often we will seem to caste perils, and make doubts of things when by a plaine manner of speech we might affirm or deny [them]". In a reference from 1657, J. Smith's ''Mystical Rhetoric,'' the term becomes "a figure whereby the speaker sheweth that he doubteth, either where to begin for the multitude of matters, or what to do or say in some strange or ambiguous thing" (OED). [[Herbert Weir Smyth]]'s ''Greek Grammar'' (1956) also focuses on the rhetorical usage by defining aporia as "an artifice by which a speaker feigns doubts as to where he shall begin or end or what he shall do or say" (674).

More modern sources, perhaps because they come after the advent of [[post-structuralism]], have chosen to omit the rhetorical usage of the term. In [[William Harmon]]'s ''A Handbook to Literature,'' for example, aporia is identified as "a difficulty, impasse, or point of doubt and indecision", while also noting that critics such as [[Jacques Derrida]] have employed the term to "indicate a point of undecidability, which locates the site at which the text most obviously undermines its own rhetorical structure, dismantles, or deconstructs itself" (39). Julian Wolfreys, in his essay "Trauma, Testimony, and Criticism", characterizes trauma as aporia, a wound with unending trail. Valiur Rahaman, in his book  ''Interpretations: Essays in Literary Theory '' (2011), explained aporia as a creative force in both the artist and their art; it is, for the artist, an edgeless edge of the text or a work of art.

==Etymology==
The separation of aporia into its two morphemes ''a''- and ''poros'' ('without' and 'passage') reveals the word's rich [[etymological]] background as well as its connection to Platonic [[mythology]]. [[Sarah Kofman]] asserts that these two components are crucial to a fuller understanding of the word, which has been historically translated and understood somewhat reductively: "translators, who usually escape their perplexity by translating ''poros'' as 'expediency' and ''aporia'' as 'difficulty'...leave the reader in the dark as to all the semantic richness of ''poros'' and ''aporia'' and give no hint as to their links with other words belonging to the same 'family{{'"}} (9). Such links inevitably demonstrate that the terms are part of a "tradition" that [[Plato]] borrows from, a tradition which "breaks with a philosophical conception of translation, and with the logic of identity that it implies" (10). To demonstrate such a break, Kofman reviews multiple instances of the term throughout Plato's work. Her discussion of the myth of [[Porus (mythology)|Poros]], [[Penia]], and [[Eros]] in Plato's [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']] especially reveals the concept's untranslatability. Penia, the "child of poverty", decides to forcefully impregnate herself with the inebriated Poros, the personification of plenty, who is always in opposition with aporia and thus defining aporia. The result of this union is Eros, who inherits the disparate characteristics of his parents (25). The perplexing aspect of the myth is revealed as one realizes that Penia is acting out of resourcefulness, a quality normally attributed to Poros, and Poros' inaction reveals his own passivity, a poverty of agency or porous. Such a relationship intensely affects not only the context of aporia but its meaning as well: 

{{quote|Penia is no more the opposite of Poros than is the aporia; the true, philosophical aporia, or Penia, is always fertile; in her all opposites are placed under erasure; she is neither masculine nor feminine, neither rich nor poor…neither resourceful nor without resources. This is why Aporia, which breaks with the logic of identity, and which pertains to the logic of the intermediary, is an untranslatable term. (27) }}

Ultimately, aporia cannot be separated from this etymological and cultural history. Such history provides insight into aporia's perplexing semantic qualities as well as into the [[historical context]] in which the word functions as an indicator of the limits of language in constructing knowledge.

==Philosophy==&lt;!--This section is linked from 'Deconstruction'--&gt;
In philosophy, an aporia is a philosophical puzzle or a seemingly insoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of equally plausible yet inconsistent premises (i.e. a [[paradox]]). It can also denote the state of being perplexed, or at a loss, at such a puzzle or impasse. The notion of an aporia is principally found in [[Greek philosophy]], but it also plays a role in post-structuralist philosophy, as in the writings of Jacques Derrida and [[Luce Irigaray]], and it has also served as an instrument of investigation in [[analytic philosophy]].

Plato's early dialogues are often called his 'aporetic' (Greek: ἀπορητικός) dialogues because they typically end in aporia. In such a dialogue, [[Socrates]] questions his [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] about the nature or definition of a concept, for example virtue or courage. Socrates then, through [[Method of Elenchus|elenctic]] testing, shows his interlocutor that his answer is unsatisfactory. After a number of such failed attempts, the interlocutor admits he is in aporia about the examined concept, concluding that he does not know what it is. In Plato's ''[[Meno]]'' (84a-c), Socrates describes the purgative effect of reducing someone to aporia: it shows someone who merely thought he knew something that he does not in fact know it and instills in him a desire to investigate it.

In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', aporia plays a role in his method of inquiry. In contrast to a [[rationalist]] inquiry that begins from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles, or an [[empiricist]] inquiry that begins from a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', he begins the ''Metaphysics'' by surveying the various ''aporiai'' that exist, drawing in particular on what puzzled his predecessors: "with a view to the science we are seeking [i.e., [[metaphysics]]], it is necessary that we should first review the things about which we need, from the outset, to be puzzled" (995a24). Book Beta of the ''Metaphysics'' is a list of the ''aporiai'' that preoccupy the rest of the work.

In [[Pyrrhonism]] aporia is intentionally induced as a means of producing [[ataraxia]].

Contemporary academic studies of the term further characterize its usage in philosophical discourses. In "Aporetics: Rational Deliberation in the Face of Inconsistency" (2009), [[Nicholas Rescher]] is concerned with the methods in which an aporia, or "apory", is intellectually processed and resolved. In the Preface, Rescher identifies the work as an attempt to "synthesize and systematize an aporetic procedure for dealing with information overload (of 'cognitive dissonance', as it is sometimes called)" (ix). The text is also useful in that it provides a more precise (although specialized) definition of the concept: "any cognitive situation in which the threat of inconsistency confronts us" (1). Rescher further introduces his specific study of the apory by qualifying the term as "a group of individually plausible but collectively incompatible theses", a designation he illustrates with the following syllogism or "cluster of contentions":

{{quote|1. What the sight of our eyes tells us is to be believed. 
2. Sight tells us the stick is bent. 

3. What the touch of our hand tells us is to be believed. 

4. Touch tells us the stick is straight. (2) }}

The aporia, or "apory" of this syllogism lies in the fact that, while each of these assertions is individually conceivable, together they are inconsistent or impossible (i.e. they constitute a [[paradox]]). Rescher's study is indicative of the continuing presence of scholarly examinations of the concept of aporia and, furthermore, of the continuing attempts of scholars to translate the word, to describe its modern meaning.

==Rhetoric==
Aporia is also a [[rhetorical device]] whereby the speaker expresses a [[doubt]]&amp;mdash;often feigned&amp;mdash;about his position or [[rhetorical question|asks the audience rhetorically]] how he or she should proceed. One aim of aporia may be to [[discredit]] the speaker's opponent. Aporia is also called ''dubitatio''. For example:

{{quote|I am at no loss for information about you and your family; but I am at a loss where to begin. Shall I relate how your father Tromes was a slave in the house of Elpias, who kept an elementary school near the Temple of Theseus, and how he wore shackles on his legs and a timber collar round his neck? Or how your mother practised daylight nuptials in an outhouse next door to Heros the bone-setter, and so brought you up to act in [[tableaux vivants]] and to excel in minor parts on the stage?|[[Demosthenes]] ''[[On the Crown|On The Crown]]'', 129}}

The '''calling party''' (in some contexts called the "A-Number") is a person who (or device that) initiates a [[telephone call]]. The person who, or device that, receives a telephone call is the [[called party]].

In some countries, it is common [[etiquette]] for a call originator to identify himself first instead of the receiver, when the connection is established.  

[[Modem]]s and [[fax machine]]s use different tones when originating or answering a connection, which may be a source of problems for the user.

'''Chatino''' is a group of [[indigenous languages of Mesoamerica|indigenous Mesoamerican]] languages.  These languages are a branch of the [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotecan]] family within the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] [[language family]]. They are natively spoken by 45,000 [[Chatino people]],{{#tag:ref|[[INALI]] (2012) [http://site.inali.gob.mx/pdf/libro_lenguas_indigenas_nacionales_en_riesgo_de_desaparicion.pdf ''México: Lenguas indígenas nacionales]''|name=INALI}} 
whose communities are located in the southern portion of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]].

The Chatinos have close cultural and linguistic ties with the [[Zapotec people]], whose [[Zapotec language|languages]] form the other branch of the Zapotecan language family. Chatinos call their language C''haqF TnyaJ'', which means "difficult word." It is recognized as a national language in Mexico.

==Varieties==
The Chatino languages are a group of three languages. Zenzontepec Chatino spoken in about 10 communities in the district of Sola de Vega, Tataltepec Chatino, spoken in Tataltepec the Valdez and a group of language called the Eastern Chatino language spoken in about 15-17 communities. Egland &amp; Bartholomew (1983) conducted [[mutual intelligibility]] tests in which they concluded that four varieties of Chatino could be considered separate languages in regards to mutual intelligibility, with 80% intelligibility being needed for varieties to be considered part of the same language. (The same count resulted from a looser 70% criterion.) These were Tataltepec, Zacatepec, Panixtlahuaca, and the Highlands dialects, with Zenzontepec not tested but based on other studies believed to be completely unintelligible with the rest of Chatino. The Highlands dialects fall into three groups, largely foreshadowing the divisions in ''Ethnologue''.

Campbell (2013), in a study based on shared innovations rather than mutual intelligibility, first divides Chatino into two groups—Zenzontepec and Coastal Chatino.  He then divides Coastal Chatino into Tataltepec and Eastern Chatino.  His Eastern Chatino contains all other varieties and he finds no evidence for subgrouping or further division based on shared innovations.  This division mirrors the divisions reported by Boas (1913), based on speaker comments, that Chatino comprised three "dialects" with limited mutual intelligibility. Sullivant (2015) finds that Teojomulco is the most divergent variety.

==Phonology and orthography==

Yaitepec Chatino has the following phonemic consonants (Pride 1965):

{| class="IPA wikitable" border="1"
| p, b		
| t, d		
| k, ɡ		
| ʔ
|-
| w		
| s, ʃ		
|
| h
|-
|m
|n
|
|
|-
|
|l, r, j
|
|}

There are five oral vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}, and four nasal vowels, {{IPA|/ĩ ẽ õ ũ/}}.

Rasch (2002) reports ten distinct tones for Yaitepec Chatino.  The level tones are high /1/, mid /2/, low-mid /3/, and low /4/.  There are also two rising tones (/21/ and /32/) and three falling tones (/12/, /23/, /34/) as well as a more limited falling tone /24/, found in a few lexical items and in a few Completive forms of verbs.

There are a variety of practical orthographies for Chatino, most influenced by Spanish orthography.  In the examples below, {{angbr|x}} represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{angbr|ch}} = {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} is spelled {{angbr|c}} before back vowels and {{angbr|qu}} before front vowels.

==Morphology==

===Transitive-Intransitive alternations===

Chatino languages have some regular alternations between transitive and intransitive verbs.  In general this change is shown by altering the first consonant of the root, as in the following examples from Tataltepec Chatino:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! gloss
!transitive	
! intransitive
|-
|'change'  	
|ntsa'a 		
|ncha'a
|-
|'finish
| ntyee		
| ndyee
|-
|'put out'
|nxubi'		
|ndyubi'
|-
|'scare'		
| nchcutsi	
| ntyutsi
|-
|'melt'		
| nxalá		
|ndyalá
|-
|'throw'		
|nchcuaa		
|ndyalu
|-
|'bury'		
|nxatsi		
|ndyatsi
|-
|'frighten'	
|ntyutsi		
|nchcutsi
|-
|'move'		
|nchquiña	
|nguiña
|-
|'roast'		
|nchqui'i	
|ngui'i
|}
===Causative alternations===

There is also a morphological causative in Chatino, expressed by the causative prefix /x-/, /xa-/, /y/, or by the palatalization of the first consonant.  The choice of prefix appears to be partially determined by the first consonant of the verb, though there are some irregular cases.
	The prefix /x/ occurs before some roots that start with one of the following consonants: /c, qu, ty/ or with the vowels /u,a/, e.g.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|catá chcu	
|'bathe (reflexive)'	
|xcatá ji'i	
|'bathe (transitive)'
|-
|quityi		
|'dry (reflexive)'		
|xquityi ji'i	
|'dry (tr)'
|-
|ndyu'u		
|'is alive'		
|nxtyu'u ji'i	
|'waken'
|-
|ndyubi'		
|'is put out'		
|nxubi'		
|'put out'
|-
|tyatsi'		
|'is buried'		
|xatsi'		
|'bury'
|}
The prefix /xa/ is put before certain roots that begin with /t/, e.g.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|nduu			
|'is stopping'	
|nxatuu		
|'to stop something'
|}
Palatalization occurs in some roots that begin with /t/, e.g.

taa			'will give'		tyaa			'will pay'

(Pride 1970: 95-96)

The alternations seen here are similar to the [[Zapotec language#Causative morphology|causative alternation]] seen in the related [[Zapotec language]]s.

===Aspect===

Aspect:

Pride (1965) reports eight aspects in Yaitepec Chatino.

'''potential''' 'The majority of the verbs have no potential prefix, and its absence indicates this aspect.'

'''habitual''' 	This is indicated by the prefixes /n-, nd-, l-/ and /n-/ with palatalization of the first consonant of the root, e.g.:

''nsta''		'puts it in'		
''nsta chcubi loo mesa''	'puts the box on the table'

''ndu'ni cu'na''	'graze'
''Ndu'ni ngu' cu'na quichi re''	'The people of this town graze'&lt;br /&gt;
''ntya''	'sow'
''Ntya ngu' quichi re quiña'''	'The people of this town sow chile.'

'''continuative'''	Roots that take /n-/ or /nd-/ in the habitual have the same in the continuative plus palatalization; roots that have /n-/ plus palatalization in the habitual have /ndya-/, e.g.
''Nxtya chcubi loo mesa''	'is putting the box on the table'

''Ndyu'ni ngu' cu'na quichi re''	'The people of this town are grazing.'

''Ndyata ngu' quichi re quiña'''	'The people of this town are sowing chile.'

'''completive'''	This is indicated with the prefix /ngu-/, and verbs that start with /cu-, cui-, qui-/ change to /ngu-/ and /ngüi-/ in the completive:

''sta''	'will put it'
''Ngu-sta chcubi loo mesa''	'Someone put the box on the table'

''culu'u''	'will teach it'
''Ngulu'u mstru ji'i'' 	'The teacher taught it.'

'''imperative'''	This aspect is indicated by palatalization in the first consonant of the potential form of the verb.  If the potential is already a palatalized consonant, the imperative is the same, e.g.:

''sati'''	'will slacken'		''xati' ji'i''	'let it loose!'
''xi'yu''	'will cut'		''xi'yu ji'i''	'cut it!'

'''perfective''' 	This aspect is indicated by the particle /cua/, which is written as a separate word in Pride (1965).

''tyee''		'will end'		''cua tyee ti''	'is ended'
''cua ndya ngu'''	'is gone'

'''passive potential'''	/tya-/

''Tyaala ton'ni'i''	'The door will be opened.'

'''passive completive	'''/ndya-/

''Ndyaala ton'ni'i''	'The door is open.'

===Syntax===

Chatino languages usually have VSO as their predominant order, as in the following example:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|N-da     
|nu 
|xni'
|ndaha
|ska
|ha      
|xtlya  
|?i
|nu 
|'o.
|-
|con-give 
|the
|dog 
|lazy 
|one
|tortilla
|Spanish
|to
|the
|coyote
|}
'The lazy dog gave a sweetbread to the coyote.'

== Use and media==
Chatino-language programming is carried by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]]'s radio station [[XEJAM]], based in [[Santiago Jamiltepec]], [[Oaxaca]].

In 2012, the [[Natividad Medical Center]] of [[Salinas, California]] had trained medical interpreters bilingual in Chatino as well as in Spanish;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Melissa Flores| title = Salinas hospital to train indigenous-language interpreters| work = HealthyCal.org| accessdate = 2012-08-05| date = 2012-01-23| url = http://www.healthycal.org/archives/7042| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120129042131/http://www.healthycal.org/archives/7042#| archive-date = 2012-01-29| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2014, Natividad Medical Foundation launched Indigenous Interpreting+, "a community and medical interpreting business specializing in indigenous languages from Mexico and Central and South America," including Chatino, [[Mixtec language|Mixtec]], [[Trique language|Trique]], and [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Natividad Medical Foundation Announces Indigenous Interpreting+ Community and Medical Interpreting Business| work = Market Wired| accessdate = 2014-03-13| date = 2014-03-07| url = http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/natividad-medical-foundation-announces-indigenous-interpreting-community-medical-interpreting-1886553.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Almanzan| first = Krista| title = Indigenous Interpreting Program Aims to be Far Reaching| work = 90.3 KAZU| accessdate = 2014-04-06| date = 2014-03-27| url = http://kazu.org/post/indigenous-interpreting-program-aims-be-far-reaching}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8735">In the course of learning a [[second language]], learners will frequently encounter [[communication]] problems caused by a lack of [[language|linguistic resources]]. '''Communication strategies''' are strategies that learners use to overcome these problems in order to convey their intended [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|Schmidt|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies used may include [[paraphrasing]], substitution, coining new words, switching to the first language, and asking for clarification.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|1997|pp=60–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010"&gt;{{harvnb|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies, with the exception of switching languages, are also used by native speakers.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;

The term ''communication strategy'' was introduced by Selinker in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Selinker|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first systematic analysis of communication strategies was made by Varadi in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Although it was written in 1973, it was published as {{harvnb|Varadi|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis2008pp501-502"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|2008|pp=501–502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were various other studies in the 1970s, but the real boom in communication strategy scholarship came in the 1980s. This decade saw a flurry of papers describing and analyzing communication strategies, and saw Ellen Bialystok link communication strategies to her general theory of second-language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008pp501-502" /&gt; There was more activity in the 1990s with a collection of papers by Kasper and Kellerman&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasper|Kellerman|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a review article by Dörnyei and Scott,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dörnyei|Scott|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but there has been relatively little research on the subject since then.&lt;ref name="Ellis2008pp501-502" /&gt;

== Communication strategies ==
No comprehensive list of strategies has been agreed on by researchers in [[second-language acquisition]],&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010" /&gt; but some commonly used strategies have been observed:

; Circumlocution
: This refers to learners using different words or phrases to express their intended meaning. For example, if learners do not know the word ''grandfather'' they may paraphrase it by saying "my father's father".

; Semantic avoidance
: Learners may avoid a problematic word by using a different one, for example substituting the irregular verb ''make'' with the regular verb ''ask''. The regularity of "ask" makes it easier to use correctly.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;

; Word coinage
: This refers to learners creating new words or phrases for words that they do not know. For example, a learner might refer to an art gallery as a "picture place".&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;

; Language switch
: Learners may insert a word from their first language into a sentence, and hope that their interlocutor will understand.&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarone1981/&gt;

; Asking for clarification
: The strategy of asking an interlocutor for the correct word or other help is a communication strategy.&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010" /&gt;

; Non-verbal strategies
: This can refer to strategies such as the use of gesture and mime to augment or replace verbal communication.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarone1981&gt;{{harvnb|Tarone|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Avoidance
: Avoidance, which takes multiple forms, has been identified as a communication strategy. Learners of a second language may learn to avoid talking about topics for which they lack the necessary vocabulary or other language skills in the second language. Also, language learners sometimes start to try to talk about a topic, but abandon the effort in mid-utterance after discovering that they lack the language resources needed to complete their message.&lt;ref name=Tarone1981/&gt;

== Research ==
Research in communication strategies reached its peak in the 1980s, and has since fallen out of favor as a research topic in [[second-language acquisition]]. Some researchers who have studied communication strategies and their effect on language acquisition include [[Elaine Tarone]], Claus Faerch, Gabriele Kasper, and [[Ellen Bialystok]].&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010" /&gt;

Kasper and Faerch proposed a model of speech production that involved a planning phase and a production phase. Communication strategies were seen as belonging to the planning phase; their use became necessary if the learner experienced a problem with the initial plan that they made. In addition to the strategies outlined above Kasper and Faerch also pointed to the possibility of using a reductive strategy such as switching to a completely different topic.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;

Researchers have identified three components of communication strategies: problematicity, meaning that the person recognizes a communication problem; consciousness, meaning that the person is conscious of the problem and is consciously employing a strategy to resolve it; and intentionality, which implies that the person is able to choose between options for overcoming a communication problem. However, Bialystok and other researchers have pointed out that communication strategies may be employed by language learners when there has been no breakdown in communications (no problematicity) and that language learners typically use the same small set of strategies routinely, rather than intentionally and consciously choosing to employ a communications strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=286–287}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some learners' [[interlanguage]]s are characterized by communication strategies,&lt;ref name="Schmidt2010" /&gt; and [[Larry Selinker]] has noted that they are one of the processes that leads to learner errors.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; Based on this observation, [[Rod Ellis]] suggests that the communication strategies that learners use may be characteristic of the stage of development which they have reached.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;

== History ==
In socialist Yugoslavia, the official policy insisted on one unitary language with two regional normative varieties—Eastern (used in Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina by all ethnicities, either with the Ekavian or the Ijekavian accent) and Western (used in Croatia by all ethnicities, the Ijekavian accent only). However, due to discontent in Croatian intellectual circles, beginning in the late 1960s Croatian cultural workers started to refer to the language exclusively as 'the Croatian literary language', or sometimes 'the Croatian or Serbian language' (these two names were also prescribed in the Croatian constitution of 1974), as was common before Yugoslavia. The language was regarded as one common language with different variants and dialects. The unity of the language was emphasized, making the differences not an indicator of linguistic divisions, but rather factors enriching the 'common language' diversity. In addition, Yugoslavia had two other official languages on the federal level, Slovenian and Macedonian, reflecting Yugoslavia's acceptance of diversity with regards to language use. No attempts were made to assimilate those languages into the Serbo-Croatian language.

With the breakup of the Federation, in search of additional indicators of independent and separate national identities, language became a political instrument in virtually all of the new republics. With a boom of neologisms in Croatia, an additional emphasis on Turkisms in the Muslim parts of Bosnia and a privileged position of the Cyrillic script in Serb-inhabited parts of the new states, every state and entity showed a 'nationalization' of the language. The language in Bosnia started developing independently after [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared independence in 1992. The [[Controversy over ethnic and linguistic identity in Montenegro|independent development of the language in Montenegro]] became a topic among some Montenegrin academics in the 1990s.

Serbian and Bosnian language standards tend to be inclusive, i.e. to accept a wider range of idioms and to use loanwords (German and Turkish), whereas the Croatian [[language policy]] is more purist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Purismo e censura linguistica in Croazia oggi |trans-title=Purism and censorship of language in Croatia nowadays |journal=Studi Slavistici |volume=5 |pages=281–297 |year=2008 |url=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/ss/article/view/2943/8774 |language=Italian |issn=1824-761X |oclc=835514860 |id={{ZDB|2182164-1}} |archivedate=8 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69lPKIqUk?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/427285.PURISMO_E_CENSURA_LINGUI.PDF |accessdate=9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and prefers neologisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Symanzik |editor1-first=Bernhard |title=Studia Philologica Slavica: Festschrift für Gerhard Birkfellner zum 65.

These approaches are, again, due to the different cultural, historical and political development of the three variants and the societies they are found in.

==Writing==
[[File:BiH - Jezicki sastav po opstinama 2013 2.gif|thumb|300px|Linguistic structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina by municipalities 2013]]

===Script===
Though all of the language variants could theoretically use either, the [[Writing system|scripts]] differ:
* Bosnian and Montenegrin officially use both the Latin and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] scripts, but the Latin is in widespread use.
* Croatian exclusively uses the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]].
* Serbian uses both the Cyrillic and Latin scripts. Cyrillic is the official script of the administration in [[Serbia]] and [[Republika Srpska]], but the Latin script is most widely used in media and especially on the Internet.

===Phonemes===
All standard languages have the same set of 30 regular [[phoneme]]s, so the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian Latin and Serbian Cyrillic alphabets map one to one with one another and with the phoneme inventory.

Some linguists analyze the [[yat]] reflexes {{angbr|je}} and {{angbr|ije}}, commonly realized as {{IPA|[ie]}} in Croatian and Bosnian dialects, as a separate phoneme – "jat diphthong" – or even two phonemes, one short and one long. There are even several proposals by Croatian linguists for an orthography reform concerning these two diphthongs, but they have not been seriously considered for implementation.

The ongoing standardization of [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] has introduced two new letters, {{angbr|Ś}} and {{angbr|Ź}}, for the sounds {{IPA|[ɕ]}} and {{IPA|[ʑ]}} respectively. These are optional spellings of the digraphs {{angbr|sj}} and {{angbr|zj}}. Critics note that {{IPA|[ɕ]}} and {{IPA|[ʑ]}} are merely [[allophone]]s of {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}} in Herzegovinian dialects such as Montenegrin, so the new letters are not required for an adequate orthography.

Most dialects of Serbia originally lack the phoneme {{IPA|/x/}}, instead having {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, or nothing (silence). {{IPA|/x/}} was introduced with language unification, and the Serbian standard allows for some [[doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] such as ''snaja''–''snaha'' and ''hajde''–''ajde''. However, in other words, especially those of foreign origin, {{angbr|h}} is mandatory.

In some regions of Croatia and Bosnia, sounds for letters {{angbr|č}} (realized as {{IPA|[tʃ]}} in most other dialects) and {{angbr|ć}} {{IPA|[tɕ]}} [[merger (phonology)|merged]] or nearly merged, usually into {{IPA|[tʃ]}}. The same happened with their voiced counterparts, i.e. {{angbr|dž}} and {{angbr|đ}} merged into {{IPA|[dʒ]}}. As result, speakers of those dialects often have difficulties distinguishing these sounds.

===Orthography===
The Serbian variety usually phonetically [[Orthographic transcription|transcribes]] foreign names and words (although both transcription and transliteration are allowed), whereas the Croatian standard usually transliterates. Bosnian also usually follows the Serbian model.

Also, when the subject of the future tense is omitted, producing a reversal of the infinitive and auxiliary "ću", only the final "i" of the infinitive is orthographically elided in Croatian and Bosnian, whereas in Serbian the two have merged into a single word:

* "Uradit ću to." (Croatian/Bosnian)
* "Uradiću to." (Serbian/Montenegrin)

==Grammar==

===Accentuation===
In general, the [[Shtokavian dialect]]s that represent the foundation of the four standard languages have four [[pitch accent]]s on stressed syllables: falling tone on a short vowel, written e.g. {{angbr|ı̏}} in dictionaries; rising tone on a short vowel, written e.g. {{angbr|ì}}; falling tone on a long vowel, written e.g. {{angbr|î}}; and rising tone on a long vowel, written e.g. {{angbr|í}}. In addition, the following unstressed vowel may be either short, {{angbr|i}}, or long, {{angbr|ī}}. In [[declension]] and [[verb conjugation]], accent shifts, both by type and position, are very frequent.

The distinction between four accents and preservation of post accent lengths is common in vernaculars of western Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in parts of Serbia, as well as in parts of Croatia with strong Serb immigration. In addition, a distinct characteristics of some vernaculars is stress shift to [[proclitic]]s, e.g. phrase ''u Bosni'' (''in Bosnia'') will be pronounced {{IPA|/ǔ bosni/}} instead of {{IPA|/u bôsni/}} as in northern parts of Serbia.

The northern vernaculars in Serbia also preserve the four-accent system, but the unstressed lengths have been shortened or disappeared in some positions. However, the shortening of post-accent lengths is in progress in all Shtokavian vernaculars, even in those most conservative in Montenegro. Stress shift to enclitics is, however, in northern Serbia rare and mostly limited to negative verb constructs (''ne znam'' = ''I don't know'' &gt; {{IPA|/nê znaːm/}}).

The situation in Croatia, is however, different. A large proportion of speakers of Croatian, especially those coming from [[Zagreb]], do not distinguish between rising and falling accents.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[http://seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=1 A Handbook of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian, Wayles Brown and Theresa Alt, SEELRC 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smiljanic"&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0505b&amp;L=linguist&amp;P=734 Lexical, Pragmatic, and Positional Effects on Prosody in Two Dialects of Croatian and Serbian, Rajka Smiljanic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818003705/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0505b&amp;L=linguist&amp;P=734 |date=2007-08-18 }}, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-97117-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered to be a feature of the Zagreb dialect, which has strong Kajkavian influence, rather than Standard Croatian.&lt;ref name="Smiljanic"/&gt;

Regardless of vernacular differences, all three standard languages exclusively promote the Neo-Shtokavian four-accentual system. Both dialects that are considered to be the basis of Standard Serbian (Eastern Herzegovinian and Šumadija-Vojvodina dialects) have four accents.

===Morphology===
There are three principal "pronunciations" (''izgovori''/изговори) of the [[Shtokavian dialect|Štokavian dialect]] that differ in their reflexes of the proto-Slavic vowel [[Yat|jat]] vowel. Illustrated by the [[Common Slavic]] word for "child", ''d'''ě'''tę'', they are:

*d'''i'''te in the Ikavian pronunciation
*d'''ije'''te in the Ijekavian pronunciation
*d'''e'''te in the Ekavian pronunciation

The Serbian language recognizes Ekavian and Ijekavian as equally valid pronunciations, whereas Croatian and Bosnian accept only the Ijekavian pronunciation. In Bosnia and Herzegovina (regardless of the official language) and in Montenegro, the Ijekavian pronunciation is used almost exclusively.

Ikavian pronunciation is nonstandard, and is limited to dialectal use in Dalmatia, Lika, Istria, central Bosnia (area between [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] and [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]]), Western Herzegovina, [[Bosanska Krajina]], Slavonia and northern Bačka ([[Vojvodina]]). So, for example:

{|class = "wikitable"
! [[English language|English]] || Ekavian || Ijekavian || Ikavian
|-

|-

|-
| colspan="4" | '''But:'''
|- valign="top"
| small arrow || colspan="2" | str'''e'''lica || str'''i'''lica
|}

A few Croatian linguists have tried to explain the following differences in morphological structure for some words, with the introduction of a new vowel, "jat diphthong". This is not the opinion of most linguists.

Sometimes this leads to confusion: Serbian pot'''i'''cati (to stem from) is in Croatian and Bosnian "to encourage". Croatian and Bosnian "to stem from" is pot'''je'''cati, whereas Serbian for "encourage" is po'''dsti'''cati.

{|class = "wikitable"

|-
| to influence   || ut'''je'''cati || ut'''je'''cati&lt;br&gt;ut'''i'''cati || ut'''i'''cati
|}

Standard Bosnian allows both variants, and ambiguities are resolved by preferring the Croatian variant; this is a general practice for Serbian–Croatian ambiguities.

The phoneme /x/ (written as ''h'') has been volatile in eastern South Slavic dialects. In Serbian and some Croatian dialects (including some of those in Slavonia), it has been replaced with /j/, /v/, or elided, and subsequent standardization sanctioned those forms:

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Bosnian and Croatian || Serbian
|-
| ear || uho || uvo&lt;br&gt;uho
|-
| fly || muha || muva
|-

|-
| rust || rđa&lt;br&gt;hrđa || rđa
|-
| to wrestle || rvati&lt;br&gt;hrvati || rvati
|}

However, /x/ and /ɛf/ have been kept in many words as a distinct feature of Bosnian speech and language tradition, particularly under influence of Turkish and Arabic, and even [[epenthesis|introduced]] in some places where it etymologically did not exist. Those forms are now also accepted in standard Bosnian:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3jlAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=h+u+bosanskom&amp;dq=h+u+bosanskom |title=Bosanski Jezik U 100 Pitanja i 100 Odgovora |last=Jahić |first=Dževad |pages=220–221 |language=Serbo-Croatian|isbn=9789958220630 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/137146762/Glas-H-u-Bosanskom-Jeziku |title=Glas H u bosanskom jeziku |author=Jahić, Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internationalisms===

Also many [[internationalism (linguistics)|internationalism]]s and transliterations are different:

(cf. [[German language|German]] ''organisieren'', '' konstruieren'', ''analysieren'')

Historically, modern-age internationalisms entered Bosnian and Croatian mostly through German and Italian, whereas they entered Serbian through French and Russian, so different localization patterns were established based on those languages. Also, Greek borrowings came to Serbian directly, but through Latin into Croatian:

Most of terms for [[chemical element]]s are different: for international names, Bosnian and Croatian use ''-ij'' where Serbian has ''-ijum'' (''uranij''–''uranijum''). In some native names, Croatian have ''-ik'' where Serbian has -(o)nik (''kisik''–''kiseonik'' 'oxygen', ''vodik''–''vodonik'' 'hydrogen') and Bosnian accepts all variants. Yet others are totally different (''dušik''–''azot'' 'nitrogen', ''kositar''–''kalaj'' 'tin'). Some element names are the same: ''srebro'' (silver), ''zlato'' (gold), ''bakar'' (copper).

Some other imported words differ by [[grammatical gender]], feminine words having an ''-a'' suffix and masculine words having a zero-suffix:

===Pronouns===
In Serbian and Bosnian, the [[pronoun]] ''what'' is ''što'' when used as a [[relative pronoun|relative]], but ''šta'' when used as an [[interrogative pronoun|interrogative]]; the latter applies also to relative sentences with interrogative meaning. Croatian uses ''što'' in all contexts (but in colloquial speech, "šta" is often used).

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Croatian || Bosnian and Serbian
|-
| What did he say? || '''Što''' je rekao? || '''Šta''' je rekao?
|-
| Ask him what he said. || Pitaj ga '''što''' je rekao. || Pitaj ga '''šta''' je rekao.
|-
| What he said was a lie. || colspan="2" | To '''što''' je rekao je laž.
|}

This is applicable only to the [[nominative case|nominative]] and the [[accusative case|accusative]] – in all other cases, the standards have the same forms: ''čega'', ''čemu'' etc. for ''što''.

In Croatian, the pronoun ''who'' has the form ''tko'', whereas in Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin it has ''ko'', but again, in colloquial speech, the initial "t" is usually omitted. The declension is the same: ''kome'', ''koga'', etc. In addition, Croatian uses ''komu'' as an alternative form in the [[dative case]].

Usage of locative pronouns ''gd(j)e'', ''kuda'', and ''kamo'' differs between Serbian and Croatian (the latter not being used in Serbian):

|-

|}

===Syntax===

====Infinitive versus subjunctive====

With modal verbs such as ''ht(j)eti'' (want) or ''moći'' (can), the [[infinitive]] is [[Prescription and description|prescribed]] in Croatian, whereas the construction ''da'' (that/to) + present tense is preferred in Serbian. This [[subjunctive]] of sorts is possibly an influence of the [[Balkan sprachbund]]. Again, both alternatives are present and allowed in Bosnian (the first one is preferred in orthography, the latter is more common in colloquial language).

&lt;!-- The difference between the reflections of yat is explained above, so here I chose an example that is the same in everything but the syntax. /Duja --&gt;
The sentence "I want to do that" could be translated with any of
* ''Hoću to da uradim.''
* ''Hoću to učiniti.''

This difference partly extends to the future tense, which in Serbo-Croatian is formed in a similar manner to English, using (elided) present of verb "ht(j)eti" → "hoću"/"hoćeš"/ ... &gt; "ću"/"ćeš"/ ... as auxiliary verb. Here, the infinitive is formally required in both variants:

* ''Ja ću to uraditi.'' (I shall do that.)

However, when ''da''+present is used instead, it can additionally express the subject's will or intention to perform the action:

* ''Ja ću to da uradim.'' (I '''will''' do that.)

This form is more frequently used in Serbia and Bosnia. The nuances in meaning between the two constructs can be slight or even lost (especially in Serbian dialects), in similar manner as the ''shall/will'' distinction varies across English dialects. Overuse of ''da''+present is regarded as Germanism in Serbian linguistic circles, and it can occasionally lead to awkward sentences.

However, Croatians seldom naturally use ''da''+present form. Instead, a different form can be used to express will:

* ''Ja hoću to uraditi.'' (I want to do that.)
(The sentence would sound more Croatian, but keep the same meaning, if it stated: "Želim to učiniti.", as "uraditi" is uncommon in Croatian).

====Interrogative constructs====

In interrogative and relative constructs, standard Croatian prescribes using the interrogative participle ''li'' after the verb, whereas standard Serbian also allows forms with ''da li''. (A similar situation exists in French, where a question can be formed either by inversion or using ''est-ce que'', and can be stretched in English with modal verbs):

* ''Možeš li?'' (Can you?) (Croatian)
* Both ''Možeš li?'' and ''Da li možeš?'' (Can you, Do you can?) are common in Serbian.

In addition, non-standard ''je li'' ("Is it?"), usually elided to ''je l' '', is vernacular for forming all kinds of questions, e.g. ''Je l' možeš?''. In standard language, it is used only in questions involving auxiliary verb ''je'' (="is"):

* ''Je li moguće?'' (Is it possible?) (Croatian)
* Both ''Je li moguće?'' and ''Da li je moguće?'' are common in Serbian.

In summary, the English sentence "I want to know whether I'll start working" would ''typically'' read:

* ''Želim da znam hoću li početi da radim.'' (spoken Serbian)
* ''Želim znati hoću li početi raditi.'' (spoken Croatian)

although many in-between combinations could be met in vernacular speech, depending on speaker's dialect, idiolect, or even mood.

The Croatian avoidance of ''da li'' is largely an expression of [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivism]]. In everyday speech in Croatia, ''da li'' is used, in fact, extensively, but avoided in written language.

====Trebati====
In formal Croatian, verb ''trebati'' (''need'' or ''should'') is [[transitive verb|transitive]], as in English.&lt;ref name=hjp_trebati&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hjp.srce.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=f19kXhJ9&amp;keyword=trebati |title=Trebati |publisher=Hrvatski jezični portal |language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbian and Bosnian, it is [[impersonal verb|impersonal]], like the French ''il faut'', or the English construct ''is necessary (to)''; the grammatical subject is either omitted (''it''), or presents the '''object''' of needing; the person that needs something is an indirect grammatical object, in the [[dative case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://www.rastko.rs/filologija/odbor/odluka012.html#_Toc33157657 |title=Kartoteka jezičkih nedoumica |publisher=Odbor za standardizaciju srpskog jezika |chapter=VI.Sintaksa §4 |language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter usage is, however, also encountered in Croatian, especially in spoken form.&lt;ref name=hjp_trebati/&gt;):

==Vocabulary==

===Examples===
{{See also|Croatian linguistic purism}}
The greatest differences between the standards is in [[vocabulary]]. However, most words are well understood, and even occasionally used, in the other standards. In most cases, common usage favors one variant and the other(s) are regarded as "imported", archaic, dialectal, or simply more rarely used. The preference for certain words depends on the speaker's geographic origin rather than ethnicity; for example, Serbs from Bosnia use "mrkva" and "hlače" rather than "šargarepa" and "pantalone".

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Bosniak linguists claim that word "nogomet" is used in Bosnian (same as in Croatian); still, the form "fudbal" is in majority use among Bosniaks (see [[FK Sarajevo]], [[FK Mladost Doboj Kakanj]] and [[FK Velež]]).

Note that there are only a few differences that can cause confusion, for example the verb "ličiti" means "to look like" in Serbian and Bosnian, but in Croatian it is "sličiti"; "ličiti" means "to paint (a house)". However, "ličiti" is often used Croatian in the meaning of "to look like".

The word "bilo" means "white" in the Ikavian accent, "pulse" in official Croatian, and "was" in all official languages, although it is not so confusing when pronounced because of different [[Serbo-Croatian language#Stress|accentuation]] (''bîlo'' or ''bílo'' = white, ''bı̏lo'' = pulse, ''bílo'' = was).

In Serbian and Bosnian, the word ''izvanredan'' (extraordinary) has only the positive meaning (excellent), ''vanredan'' being used for "unusual" or "out of order"; however, only ''izvanredan'' is used in Croatian in both contexts.

Also note that in most cases Bosnian officially allows almost all of the listed variants in the name of "language richness", and ambiguities are resolved by preferring the Croatian variant. Bosnian vocabulary writers based their decisions on usage of certain words in literary works by Bosnian authors.

====Names of the months====

The months have Slavic-derived names in Croatian, wheres Serbian and Bosnian have almost the same set of international Latin-derived names as English. The Slavic-derived names may also be used in Bosnian{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, but the international names are preferred.

|}
The international names of the months are well understood in Croatia and are used in several fixed expressions such as ''Prvi Maj'' (May 1), ''Prvi April'' (April Fools' Day) or ''Oktobarska revolucija'' (October Revolution).

In spoken Croatian and in western Bosnia it is common to refer to a month by its number. Therefore, many speakers refer to the month of May as ''peti mjesec'' ("the fifth month"). Saying ''sedmi peti'' (''seventh of fifth'') would be the equivalent of May 7.

==Miscellaneous==

* Pronunciation and vocabulary differs among dialects spoken '''within''' Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia themselves. Each larger region has its own pronunciation and it is reasonably easy to guess where a speaker is from by their accent and/or vocabulary. [[Colloquial]] vocabulary can be particularly different from the official standards.
:This is one of the arguments for claiming it is all one and the same language: there are more differences ''within'' the territories of the official languages themselves than there are ''between'' the standards (all three of which are based on the same Neo-Štokavian dialect). This is not surprising, of course, for if the lines between the varieties were drawn not politically but linguistically, then there would be no borders at all. As [[Pavle Ivić]] explains, the continuous migration of Slavic populations during the five hundred years of Turkish rule has scattered the local dialects all around.
* When Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs talk amongst each other, the other speakers usually understand them completely, save for the odd word, and quite often, they will know what that means (much as with British and American English speakers). Nevertheless, when communicating with each other, there is a habit to use terms that are familiar to everyone, with the intent to avoid not being understood and/or confusion. For example, to avoid confusion with the names of the months, they can be referred to as the "first month", "second month" and so on, or the Latin-derived names can be used if "first month" itself is ambiguous, which makes it perfectly understandable for everyone. In Serbia, the names of the months are the international ones so again they are understandable for anyone who knows English or another Western European language.
* Even during the time of Yugoslavia it was common for publishers to do some adaptations to "Eastern" or "Western" standard. Especially translations were and are changed by the lectors. It is to be considered that Croatian and Serbian standards have completely different scientific terminology{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. [[Carl Jung|Jung's]] masterpiece "[[Psychology and Alchemy]]" was translated into Croatian in 1986, and adapted in the late 1990s into Serbian. [[Ivo Andrić]] had some problems in Croatia with publishers who changed his infinitive constructions and other expressions. Eventually, he managed to forbid that kind of intervention. In Montenegro, the publisher CID switched from the Ekavian to the Ijekavian accent after Montenegro's independence.

According to [[John Henry Merryman]], "The '''Decisory [[Oath]]''' worked in the following way: Party A could put Party B on his oath as to a fact at issue that was within Party B's [[knowledge]]. If Party B refused to swear, the fact was taken as conclusively proved against him. If Party B swore, the fact was taken as conclusively proved in his favor."&lt;ref&gt;John Henry Merryman, ''The Civil Law Tradition'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1969): 126, as cited in [[Immanuel Kant]], ''The Metaphysics of Morals,'' ed. Mary Gregor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996): 83n25 (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Gregor explains that this procedure was "designed to protect the [[judge]] from threats from the wealthy and the powerful."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, ''loc. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct negative evidence''' is a term used in the study of the acquisition of language. It describes the attempts of competent speakers of a language to guide the grammatical use of novice speakers, such as children.

== Definition ==

Negative evidence in language acquisition consists of evidence that demonstrates which grammatical constructions in a language are ungrammatical.&lt;ref&gt;Lust, Barbara C. (2006-09-21). Child Language: Acquisition and Growth. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9781139459273}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Saxton (1997) asserts that negative evidence supplies the " correct adult model" for novice speakers to avoid future grammatical mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, M. (1997). The contrast theory of negative input. Journal of Child Language 24, 139–161.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative evidence corrections, in whatever form they appear, necessarily follow immediately after an incorrect, often ungrammatical, utterance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Birjandi, Parviz (July 2012). "Negative Evidence in Iranian Children: How do Iranian Parents Correct Their Children's Errors?" (PDF). Journal of Language Teaching and Research. 3: 700–706 – via JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that although parent often ''understand'' their children, and these production mistakes aren't usually egregious enough for the parent to not be able to correct it, negative evidence deals with the conventional standards of grammar in a language and the correct model of grammar structures, not communicative ones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Why the child holded the baby rabbits: a case study in language acquisition In Language: An invitation to cognitive science, Vol. 1 (1995), 107-133 by S. Pinker edited by L. R. Gleitman, M. Liberman&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct negative evidence differs from indirect negative evidence in that it is explicitly presented to a language learner (for example, a child might be corrected by a parent) whereas indirect negative evidence is inferred from the absence of ungrammatical utterances in a given language. Though it is generally agreed that there is positive evidence (i.e. evidence that demonstrates grammatical linguistic constructions) in the language input, there is a dearth of direct negative evidence in the general language learner input since most native or veteran speakers produce grammatical as opposed to ungrammatical speech.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Marcus, G. F. (January 1993). "Negative evidence in language acquisition". Cognition. 46 (1): 53–85. ISSN 0010-0277. &lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 8432090&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== "No Negative Evidence" Problem ==

One of the difficulties surrounding language acquisition is that the language input is not rich enough for children to develop a correct grammar, otherwise referred to as the argument of the [[poverty of the stimulus]]. This is a commonly held position by nativists, who believe that there are innate mechanisms which facilitate language learning. The central idea of the poverty of the stimulus argument is that children could have multiple hypotheses about aspects of their grammar which are distinguishable only by direct negative evidence (or by hearing ungrammatical sentences and recognizing those sentences as ungrammatical). Supporters of the poverty of the stimulus argument then assert that because the negative evidence that is needed to learn language by the input alone does not exist, children cannot learn certain aspects of grammar from the input alone, and there must be some aspects of grammar which involve innate mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lasnik, Howard; Lidz, Jeffrey L. (2016-12-22). [http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199573776-e-10 ''The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus'']. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1093%2Foxfordhb%2F9780199573776.013.10 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.013.10].&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that there is "no negative evidence" in the input is held by a number of researchers in the field of language acquisition who assert that if children are to learn language, then they must be able to learn language by solely examining the positive evidence that they do receive from the input since there is not enough negative evidence to be useful for language learning.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C. L. (1979). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4178133 "Syntactic Theory and the Projection Problem"]. ''Linguistic Inquiry''. '''10''' (4): 533–581. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.2307%2F4178133 10.2307/4178133].&lt;/ref&gt; Some propose that direct negative evidence would be necessary for children to develop a fully formed grammar, so it has also often been argued that children cannot learn a language by only receiving positive evidence, and that therefore there must be innate constraints on their biology which would allow them to learn language.

== Examples of Direct Negative Evidence ==

Implicit negative evidence is a type of corrective feedback in which parental responses to a child's incorrect statements is indicative of the utterance's ungrammaticality. It is argued that there is a shortage of ''explicit'' direct negative evidence in the general input of learners.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, others have conducted studies that demonstrate that there is suitable ''implicit'' direct negative evidence present in parental responses to their children.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Chouinard, Michelle M.; Clark, Eve V. (2003/08). "Adult reformulations of child errors as negative evidence". Journal of Child Language. 30 (3): 637–669. doi:10.1017/s0305000903005701. ISSN 1469-7602.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of studies regarding this type of evidence in which researchers have demonstrated that parents do respond differently when children utter grammatical or ungrammatical utterances.&lt;ref&gt;Penner, Sharon (April 1987). "Parental Responses to Grammatical and Ungrammatical Child Utterances". Child Development. 58, Issue 2: 376–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Saxton, Matthew. "Negative evidence and negative feedback: immediate effects on the grammaticality of child speech". First Language. 20 (60): 221–252. doi:10.1177/014272370002006001.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of applications of implicit direct negative evidence which parents utilize in responses to ungrammatical - not necessarily incorrect or unintelligible - utterances.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Brown, R., and C. Hanlon, (1970). Derivational complexity and order of acquisition in child speech. In J. R. Hayes, ed., ''Cognition and the development of human language.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Parents intend to correct their children with these corrective techniques. Recasts are one such kind of evidence, in which a parent "expands, deletes, permutes, or otherwise changes [a child's utterance] while maintaining significant overlap in meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Bohannon, John Neil, III; Neil, John; Bohannon, III; Padgett, Robert J.; Nelson, Keith E.; Mark, Melvin. "Useful evidence on negative evidence". Developmental Psychology. 32 (3): 551–555. doi:10.1037/0012-1649.32.3.551&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes parents recast children's sentences after children produce ungrammatical utterances, and some believe that children use this evidence to correct mistakes in their grammar, even though recasts can also occur after children construct grammatical utterances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One theory for why the children even react to the negative feed back is that they trust the grammar judgements of adults - given adults are older and more experienced with language, their word choice must be credible and that intended meaning children want to convey has to follow the language constraints imposed by those adults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Experiments have been conducted which have demonstrated that children improve in grammatical forms when parents provide them with any type of immediate implicit direct negative evidence, including recasts, which supports some scholars' claims that direct negative evidence does have an assocaible presence in learner's grammar.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Similar studies have been conducted demonstrating that when parents recast children's morphological errors, children sometimes attempt to correct their initial errors.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Michael J. "Negative evidence and grammatical morpheme acquisition". Developmental Psychology. 28 (1): 90–98. doi:10.1037/0012-1649.28.1.90.&lt;/ref&gt; Such conclusions have received some as many such studies do not specify which types of utterances qualify as recasts and why children only pay attention to certain kinds of recasts and not others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Chouinard conducted a follow up study in which she examined how children respond to parental reformulation (a type of negative evidence in which parents correct an ungrammatical utterance of a child), and she found that children are highly attentive to parental responses and that children respond to this kind of implicit correction in predictable ways.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is argued that parents frequently reformulate children's ungrammatical utterances,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; usually in an effort to clarify the child's meaning, though not all of the reformulations are intended to ''correct'' children's speech errors, such as cases where parents expand a child's utterance to seek additional information . Reformulations are in direct contrast to the child-utterance, which contained an error. The correction takes place in the same location as the error, thus providing the child with evidence for ''where'' they made an error.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  It is the presence of the reformulations as well as the high percentage of correct parental speech that allows children to learn.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C.E.; Ferguson, C. A., eds. (1977). Talking to Children: language input and acquisition. Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to directly respond to these reformulations by either affirming the reformulation or disagreeing with their parent if the parent misunderstood the child's intended meaning. As Levine's study demonstrates that children attend to even parental responses which are non-corrective, other researchers have also conducted studies that demonstrate that children do not need feedback which corrects grammatical errors in order to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Bohannon, John N.; MacWhinney, Brian; Snow, Catherine. "No negative evidence revisited: Beyond learnability or who has to prove what to whom". Developmental Psychology. 26 (2): 221–226. doi:10.1037/0012-1649.26.2.221&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments Against Implicit Direct Negative Evidence ===

Though there have been a number of studies that support the hypothesis that children can use the implicit negative evidence that exists in the input, there have also been studies which stand in stark contrast to this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rhode, Douglas L.T.; Plaut, David C. (Spring 1999). "Language acquisition in the absence of explicit negative evidence: how important is starting small?" (PDF). Cognition. 72: 67–109 – via Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguists, such as Gary Marcus, argue that the implicit negative evidence in the input is insufficient for children to learn the correct grammar of their language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Marcus and others, such as Hendriks&lt;ref&gt;Hendriks, Petra (2000). "The Problem with Logic in the Logical Problem of Language Acquisition".&lt;/ref&gt; and Baker,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C.L.; McCarthy, J.J. (1981). The Logical Problem of Language Acquisition. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; believe negative evidence is a weak form of evidence because children gradually learn from a limited corpus of correct or incorrect utterances that is grammatical or ungrammatical, which undermines the import of direct negative evidence to begin with. Children do not receive negative reactions for each of their negative utterances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There isn't enough of a correlation between negative evidence from parents to the occurrence of ungrammatical utterances from their children for infant learners to be able to base grammatically on negative evidence, as has been concluded in previous corpus studies.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; According to Morgan, Bonamo &amp; Travis (1995), there is no evidence that recasts would dissuade a child from his or her ungrammatical utterances. They argue that children may interpret a recast simply as an alternative way to say something and what they had just said is equally valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=James|last2=Bonamo|first2=Katherine|last3=Travis|first3=Lisa|title=Negative Evidence on Negative Evidence|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1995|volume=31|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive evidence from a parent can immediately be assumed to be grammatical, yet not every parents will correct every child error and some children may even benefit from fewer constraints,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; which diminishes the necessity of direct negative evidence. In spite of the inconsistencies of the negative evidence in the input, all children eventually arrive at a correct grammar which supports the fact that the negative evidence cannot account for a child's ability to learn a grammar since not all children receive the same negative evidence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To the contrary, Marcus states that the more positive evidence for irregular forms a child is exposed to the less likely they are to overgeneralize grammatical concepts. He explains this as a function of an inherent mechanism and the child can suppress the grammatical rule in cases where it does not apply. Finally, Marcus argues that a child can easily acquire grammatical rules, but cannot receive direct feedback from a parent in every case to determine where irregularities occur, thus making implicit negative evidence practically useless for a language learner.

'''Dr. Sbaitso''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] [[speech synthesis]] program released late in 1991 &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpQP3e54P-gC&amp;pg=PT80&amp;dq=sbaitso+1991&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3hpD96ZjRAhWm8YMKHUxrA4EQ6AEILDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=sbaitso%201991&amp;f=false  PC Mag Oct 29, 1991 p.67 advertisement]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Creative Labs]] for [[Microsoft|MS]] [[DOS]]-based [[personal computers]].

==History==
Dr. Sbaitso was distributed with various [[sound cards]] manufactured by [[Creative Labs]] (the name was an acronym for [[Sound Blaster]] Artificial Intelligent Text to Speech Operator) in the early 1990s.

The program "conversed" with the user as if it were a [[psychologist]], though most of its responses were along the lines of "WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY?" rather than any sort of complicated interaction.  When confronted with a phrase it could not understand, it would often reply with something such as "THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM".  Dr. Sbaitso repeated text out loud that was typed after the word "SAY". Repeated swearing or abusive behavior on the part of the user caused Dr. Sbaitso to "break down" in a "[[Parity error|PARITY ERROR]]" before resetting itself.

The program introduced itself with the following lines:
Example:

 HELLO [UserName], MY NAME IS DOCTOR SBAITSO.
 
 I AM HERE TO HELP YOU.
 SAY WHATEVER IS IN YOUR MIND FREELY,
 OUR CONVERSATION WILL BE KEPT IN STRICT CONFIDENCE.
 MEMORY CONTENTS WILL BE WIPED OFF AFTER YOU LEAVE,
 
 SO, TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

The program was designed to showcase the [[speech synthesis|digitized voices]] the cards were able to produce, though the quality was far from lifelike.

'''Eid Mubarak''' or ({{lang-ar|عيد مبارك}}) is an [[Arabic]] term that means “happy holiday”. The term is used by [[Arab Christians]] and [[Arab Muslims]]. Internationally [[Muslims]] use it as a greeting for use on the festivals of [[Eid al-Adha]] and [[Eid al-Fitr]]. ''Eid'' means "celebration", and ''Mubarak'' means "blessings". In the social sense, people usually celebrate Eid al-Fitr after [[Ramadan]] and Eid-al-Adha in the month of Dhul Haj (12th and Final Islamic month). Some state this exchange of greetings is a cultural tradition and not part of any religious obligation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/709700/What-is-Eid-Mubarak-Eid-Al-Adha-2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/13/what-does-eid-mubarak-mean-how-to-say-it-in-arabic-and-reply-6125093/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
Throughout the Muslim world there are numerous other greetings for [[Eid ul-Adha]] and [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid ul-Fitr]]. The companions of the Prophet Mohammad used to say to each other in [[Arabic]] when they met on Eid ul-Fitr: ''Taqabbalallâhu minnâ wa minkum'' (which means "[May] God accept from us and you [our fasts and deeds]"). Throughout the Muslim world, variations in Eid greetings exist.

===Arab world===
[[Arab Christians]] and [[Arab Muslims]] use the term Eid Mubarak, and have a number of other ways to say happy holiday. Some Arabs also add "kul 'am wantum bikhair" (كل عام و أنتم بخير), which means "May you be well with every passing year."

===Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina===
[[Bosnian Muslims]] also commonly say "Bajram Šerif mubarek olsun", the response is "Allah razi olsun". Another common Eid greeting by Bosnian Muslims is "Bajram barećula".

===Serbia===

In Serbia muslims usually celebrate by saying "Bajram Šerif Mumbarek Olsun" to which the other replay's with "Allah Razi Olsun"

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], it is recognized as a legal holiday, though the greeting of Eid Mubarak has gained traction only recently.

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], Turks wish each other happy holidays with Turkish phrases including: "Bayramınız kutlu olsun" ("May your holiday be happy"), "İyi Bayramlar" ("Good Holidays"), and "Bayramınız mübarek olsun" ("May your holiday be blessed").

===South Asia===
In [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], Eid Mubarak wishes are very common and often accompanied by hugging three times after the [[Salat al Eid]].

====Pakistan====
[[Pashto language|Pashto]] speakers (mainly [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] people from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province and eastern [[Afghanistan]]) also use the Eid greeting "''May your festival be blessed''" ({{lang-ps|'''اختر دی مبارک سه'''}} ; ''akhtar de nekmregha sha''). [[Balochi language|Balochi]] speakers (mainly [[Baloch people]] from [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] province and [[Iran]]'s [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]]) also use the Eid greeting "''May your Eid be blessed''" ({{nq|عید تر مبارک با}} ; ''aied tara mubarak ba''). [[Brahui language|Brahui]] speakers may also use the Eid greeting "''Have a blessed Eid''" ({{nq|عید نے مبارک مارے}} ; ''aied ne mubarak mare'').

====Bangladesh====
Many Bangladeshis may also use the Eid greeting, "''Eid's Greetings''" ('''ঈদের শুভেচ্ছা'''; ''Eider Shubheccha'').

===West Africa===
Hausa language originally from Northern Nigeria is widely spoken among Muslims in West Africa. Their equivalent Eid greetings in Hausa is "Barka da Sallah" which translates to "blessed Eid prayers".

====Ghana====
"Ni ti yuun' palli" is the Eid greetings among Dagbanli speakers in Ghana. It means "Happy new Eid season". The Hausa greeting "Barka da Sallah" is also a common exchange during the period.

===Southeast Asia===
Muslims in other countries, such as Indonesia and [[Malay language]]-speaking population ([[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], &amp; [[Singapore]]) use the expression "Selamat Hari Raya" or "Selamat Idul Fitri" (Indonesian) or "Salam Aidilfitri" (Malay). This expression is usually accompanied by the popular expression "Minal Aidin wal Faizin", an Arab sentence meaning "May we be sacred one more time and succeed in our fasting". The expression is not recognized by people in the Arab world, although it's in the Arabic language. It is a quotation from a poem written by [[Shafiyuddin Al-Huli]] during the time Muslims ruled in [[Al-Andalus]].
===Persian Speakers====
Persian speaking Muslims use the term "eid shoma mubarak"(عید شما مبارک)(happy eid).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1182">'''Epistemicism''' is a position about [[vagueness]] in the [[philosophy of language]] or [[metaphysics]], according to which there are facts about the boundaries of a vague predicate which we cannot possibly discover.  Given a vague predicate, such as 'is thin' or 'is bald', epistemicists hold that there is some sharp cutoff, dividing cases where a person, for example, is thin from those in which they are not.  Epistemicism gets its name because it holds that there is no [[semantic]] indeterminacy present in vague terms, only [[epistemology|epistemic]] uncertainty.

Epistemicism was historically considered an untenable position, since it requires vague terms to possess extremely specific conditions of application.  Since the publication of [[Timothy Williamson]]'s ''Vagueness'', which defended the view, it has been taken seriously by many philosophers working in the area.

'''Gangadhar Gopal Gadgil''' (25 August 1923 – 15 September 2008) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

He was born in [[Mumbai]] in 1923. After receiving a master's degree in economics from the [[Mumbai University|University of Mumbai]], he worked as a professor of economics at [[Sydenham College]] and also a few other colleges in Mumbai.He was the first principal of well known [[Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and Economics]] from 1964-71. Gadgil served as Vice-president and member of the General Council of the Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, from 1988-93. He served as the President of the Mumbai Marathi Sahitya Sangh from 1983-1999. Gadgil was a prolific and multi-faceted writer, with published work in Economics, Literature, Biography, Literary Criticism and Travel Writing. The [[Library of Congress]], South Asian Literary Recordings Project has recordings of his reading from six of his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/gangadhargopalgadgil.html|title=Gagnadhar Gadgil South Asian Literary Recordings Project|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress South Asian Literary Recordings|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also acquired sixty-five of his books for their collection.

==Literary accomplishments==
Gadgil's keen intellect, his restlessness and his willingness to experiment led him to write in many different genres, both literary and discursive. Gadgil wrote novels, travelogues, plays, literary criticism, children's stories, and a large number of short stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Who of Indian Writers, 1999.|last=Dhutt|first=Karthik Chandra|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=1999|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Marathi Literature|last=Deshpande|first=Kusumawati|last2=Rajadhyaksha|first2=Mangesh Vithal|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=1988|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been translated into several languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Malay and Turkish.

While he wrote in many genre, he is best known for revolutionizing the Marathi short story in the post-independence years, and creating, along with notables such as Mardhekar, a new tradition of literary realism in the Navkatha or new Marathi short story. His short stories depict the lives of ordinary middle-class Maharashtrian people with subtlety, sensitivity and psychological depth. His first short story, ''Priya ani Manjar'' was published in 1941. By the end of his life he had published more than 300 short stories in multiple volumes.

(Note: May need additional information about his contributions as a short story writer)

His first novella, ''Liliche Phool'' (1955) is an exploration of the themes of love, in all its forms, physical and emotional, in the life of a young actress. It is a novel that is haunting as it traces the choices she makes and the dilemmas she faces.

''Durdamya'', another major work by Gadgil, is a biographical novel about [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Lokmanya Bal Ganagdhar Tilak]], a political leader in the struggle for Indian Independence. It is a depiction of Tilak as a man, along with the qualities that made him a visionary leader, rooting him in the political and social upheavals of that period. ''Durdamya'' also draws convincing portraits of other leaders in the freedom struggle such as Justice M. G. Ranade, [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], [[Gopal Ganesh Agarkar]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Mahatma Gandhi]].

Gadgil had a deep and intense relationship with [[Mumbai]], the city of his birth. He loved Mumbai, studied its history, and wrote biographical profiles of many notable historical figures such a [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], [[Walchand Hirachand]] and [[Vishvanath Narayan Mandlik|Vishwanath Narayan Mandalik]], which have been published as monographs. In ''Prarambh'', a major and ambitious later historicalnovel, he approached the history of Mumbai through the figure of [[Jaganath Shunkerseth|Jagannath Shankarshet]], a towering public figure from the early 1800s. The biographical novel interweaves his life and works with the social, commercial and cultural evolution of the city in the 19th centrury, and incorporates as characters Indian and British figures such as Jamshedtjee Jeejeebhoy, Bhau Daji Lad, Governor Mountstuart Elphinstone, who helped shaped Mumbai into a modern metropolis.

Gadgil was also a well loved humorist who wrote short stories, humorous plays and humorous essay. His particular brand of humor and satire was "nirvish vinod" or non-poisonous humor. He approaches his subjects, whether in his essays about Mumbaikars or in his humorous plays and short stories, with a wry yet warm humor poking gentle fun at all too human foibles, and sometimes venturing into the fantastical. His humorous series of books about Bandu Abjabuddhe, his wife Snehalata, and his friend Nanu are beloved and continue to be performed as one act plays in colleges and community events in Maharashtra. ''Crazy Bombay'' is a collection of essays, many written as a column for the Illustrated Weekly of India and is a humorous tribute to the city he loves and to its denizens.

Children's stories and plays were another genre Gadgil explored. From the early one-act plays such as ''Mule'' ''Chor Pakadtat'' to his later series of modern fairy tales Ashrunche Jhale Hire, his books for children are a reflection of his playfulness as a writer.

Gadgil was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1996 for his autobiography ''Eka Mungiche Mahabharata''. In it he traces his growth and evolution as a writer as much, if not more than, the events of his life. Gadgil's autobiography contains vivid portraits of writers and poets who were his contemporaries and friends.

==Expertise in economics==
Gadgil was a champion of consumer rights. He was associated with ''Grahak Panchayat, Mumbai'' for a long time, and served for 15 years as the organization's president.

He wrote text books on Economics for college students. For some time, he served as an economic and financial advisor to [[Walchand Hirachand]] Group.

Her father Paresh Chandra Chakrabarti was "initiated (given [[diksha]])" by Sri [[Sarada Devi]], and her mother Sivani Chakrabarti, by Swami [[Shivananda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Das|first1=Soumitra|last2=Basu|first2=Anasuya|last3=Basu|first3=Jayanta|title=Damning evidence of books|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120617/jsp/calcutta/story_15619222.jsp#.Vxi2ytR97cd|accessdate=21 April 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing her secondary education at [[St. John's Diocesan Girls' Higher Secondary School]], Spivak attended [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] under the [[University of Calcutta]], from which she graduated in 1959.&lt;ref name="reader" /&gt;

In 1961, Spivak joined the graduate program in English at [[Cornell University]], travelling on money borrowed on a so-called "life mortgage." In 1962, unable to secure financial aid from the department of English, she transferred to Comparative Literature, a new program at Cornell, under the guidance of its first Director, [[Paul de Man]], with insufficient preparation in French and German. Her dissertation, advised by [[Paul de Man]], was on [[William Butler Yeats|W.B. Yeats]] and titled ''Myself Must I Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats''.&lt;ref name="reader" /&gt; In 1959, upon graduation, she secured employment as an English tutor for forty hours a week. Her MA thesis was on the representation of innocence in Wordsworth with M.H. Abrams. In 1963-64, she attended [[Girton College, Cambridge]], as a research student under the supervision of Professor T.R. Henn, writing on the representation of the stages of development of the lyric subject in the poetry of [[William Butler Yeats]]. She presented a course in the summer of 1963 on "Yeats and the Theme of Death" at the Yeats Summer School in [[Sligo|Sligo, Ireland]]. (She returned there in 1987 to present Yeats' position within post-coloniality.){{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the Fall of 1965, Spivak became an [[assistant professor]] in the department of English, [[University of Iowa]]. She received tenure in 1970. She did not publish her doctoral dissertation, but decided to write a critical book on Yeats that would be accessible to her undergraduate students without compromising her intellectual positions. The result is her first book, written for young adults, ''Myself I Must Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gayatri-chakravorty-spivak/myself-must-i-remake-the-life-and-poetry-of-w-b/|title=MYSELF MUST I REMAKE: The Life and Poetry of W. B. Yeats by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, on her regular attempts at self-improvement, Spivak purchased a book, by an author unknown to her, entitled ''De la grammatologie''. She decided to translate the book by an unknown author, and wrote a long translator's preface. This publication was immediately a success, and the Translator's Preface became popular across the world as an introduction to the philosophy of [[deconstruction]] launched by the author, [[Jacques Derrida]]; whom Spivak met in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://conversations.e-flux.com/t/gayatri-spivak-on-derrida-the-subaltern-and-her-life-and-work/4198|title=Gayatri Spivak on Derrida, the subaltern, and her life and work|website=e-flux conversations|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, at the [[University of Iowa]], Spivak founded the MFA in Translation in the department of Comparative Literature [http://www.writinguniversity.org/content/writing-iowa]. The following year, she became the Director of the Program in Comparative Literature and was promoted to full professorship. In 1978, she was National Humanities Professor at the University of Chicago. She received many subsequent residential [[visiting professorship]]s and fellowships.

In 1978, she moved to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as professor of English and Comparative Literature. In 1982, she was appointed as the Longstreet Professor in English and Comparative Literature at [[Emory University]]. In 1986, she went to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] as the first Mellon Professor of English. Here she established the Cultural Studies program. In 1991, she joined [[Columbia University]] as Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, where, in 2007, she was made University Professor in the Humanities.

Spivak has received 11 [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]]: University of Toronto, University of London, Oberlin College, Universitat Rovira Virgili, [[Rabindra Bharati University]], Universidad Nacional de San Martín, University of St Andrews, Université de Vincennes à Saint-Denis, Presidency University, Yale University, University of Ghana-Legon. In 2012, she became the only Indian recipient of the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]] in the category of Arts and Philosophy.

Spivak has served on the advisory board of numerous academic journals, including [[Differences (journal)|''differences'']], ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]]'', and ''Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/differences/|title=differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies|work=Duke University Press|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/about-signs/masthead/|title=Masthead|date=2012-08-22|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/321#|title=Project MUSE - Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Derrida, Spivak has also translated the fiction of the Bengali author, [[Mahasweta Devi]]; the poetry of the 18-century Bengali poet [[Ram Prashad Sen]]; and most recently ''A Season in the Congo'' by [[Aimé Césaire]], poet, essayist and statesman from [[Martinique]]. In 1997 she received a prize for translation into English from the [[Sahitya Akademi|Sahitya Akadami]]—the National Academy of Literature in India.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Her essay, ''Can the Subaltern Speak?'', (1983) established Spivak among the ranks of feminists who consider history, geography, and class when thinking about women. In all her work, Spivak's main effort has been to try to find ways of accessing the subjectivity of those who are being investigated. She is hailed as a critic who has feminized and globalized the philosophy of deconstruction, considering the position of the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]], a word used by Antonio Gramsci as describing ungeneralizable fringe groups of society who lack access to citizenship. In the early 80s, she was also hailed as a co-founder of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]], which she refused to accept fully, as has been demonstrated in her book ''Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present'' (1999), which suggests that so-called postcolonial theory should be considered from the point of view of who uses it in what interest. Spivak's other works are: ''In Other Worlds'' (1987), ''Outside in the Teaching Machine'' (1993), ''Death of a Discipline'' (2003), ''Other Asias'' (2008), and ''An Aesthetic Education in the Age of Globalization'' (2012).

Since 1986, Spivak has been engaged in teaching and training adults and children among the landless illiterates on the border of [[West Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]/[[Jharkhand]]. This sustained attempt to access the [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] damaged by the [[Millennials|millennial]] oppression of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] has allowed her to understand the situation of globality as well as the limits of high theory more clearly. In 1997, her friend Lore Metzger, a survivor of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], left her $10,000 in her will, to help with the work of rural education. With this, Spivak established the Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty Memorial Foundation for Rural Education; to which she contributed the majority of her Kyoto Prize.

[[File:Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.jpg|alt=Gayatri Spivak|thumb|Spivak speaking on The strength of Critique: Trajectories of Marxism – Feminism at the Internationaler Kongress]]
In "Can the Subaltern Speak?" Spivak discusses the lack of an account of the [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] practice, leading her to reflect on whether the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] can even speak.&lt;ref name="sharp6"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spivak writes about the process, the focus on the Eurocentric [[Subject (philosophy)|Subject]] as they disavow the problem of representation; and by invoking the Subject of Europe, these intellectuals constitute the subaltern Other of Europe as anonymous and mute.

Spivak rose to prominence with her translation of [[Derrida]]'s ''[[Of Grammatology|De la grammatologie]]'', which included a translator's introduction that has been described as "setting a new standard for self-reflexivity in prefaces."&lt;ref name="spivak_reader"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spivak Reader: Selected Works of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|pages=1–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCHcsaSi-sUC&amp;pg=PT12|chapter=Reading Spivak}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, as a member of the "[[Subaltern Studies Collective]]," she carried out a series of historical studies and literary critiques of imperialism and international feminism. She has often referred to herself as a "practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist."&lt;ref name=thehindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Lahiri|first=Bulan|title=Speaking to Spivak|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/in-conversation-speaking-to-spivak/article1159208.ece|accessdate=7 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=6 February 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her predominant ethico-political concern has been for the space occupied by the subaltern, especially subaltern women, both in discursive practices and in institutions of Western cultures. [[Edward Said]] wrote of Spivak's work, "She pioneered the study in literary theory of non-Western women and produced one of the earliest and most coherent accounts of that role available to us."&lt;ref&gt;Dinitia Smith, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/arts/creating-a-stir-wherever-she-goes.html "Creating a Stir Wherever She Goes,"] ''New York Times'' (9 February 2002) B7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her  ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason,'' published in 1999, explores how major works of European [[metaphysics]] (e.g., [[Kant]], [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40105116|title=A critique of postcolonial reason : toward a history of the vanishing present|last=Chakravorty.|first=Spivak, Gayatri|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674177642|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=40105116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spivak coined the term "[[strategic essentialism]]," which refers to a sort of temporary solidarity for the purpose of social action. For example, women's groups have many different agendas that potentially make it difficult for feminists to work together for common causes; "Strategic essentialism" allows for disparate groups to accept temporarily an "essentialist" position that enables them able to act cohesively.

However, while others have built upon this idea of "strategic essentialism," Spivak has been unhappy with the ways the concept has been taken up and used. In interviews, she has disavowed the term, although she has not completely deserted the concept itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danius|first=Sara|last2=Jonsson|first2=Stefan|last3=Spivak|first3=Gayatri Chakravorty|date=1993|title=An Interview with Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|jstor=303357|journal=boundary 2|volume=20|issue=2|pages=24–50|doi=10.2307/303357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://literariness.org/2016/04/09/strategic-essentialism/|title=Strategic Essentialism|date=2016-04-09|work=Literary Theory and Criticism Notes|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been a [[Guggenheim fellow]], has received numerous academic honours including an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Oberlin College]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oberlin.edu/commencement/ Oberlin College Commencement 2011&amp;nbsp;– Oberlin College]. Oberlin.edu. Retrieved on 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been on the editorial board of academic journals such as [[boundary 2]]. In March 2007, Columbia University President [[Lee Bollinger]] appointed Spivak University Professor, the institution's highest faculty rank. In a letter to the faculty, he wrote,

{{quote|Not only does her world-renowned scholarship—grounded in deconstructivist literary theory—range widely from critiques of post-colonial discourse to feminism, Marxism, and globalization; her lifelong search for fresh insights and understanding has transcended the traditional boundaries of discipline while retaining the fire for new knowledge that is the hallmark of a great intellect.}}

Spivak's writing has received some criticism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newpartisan.com/home/clarity-is-king-eric-adler-on-postmodernists-limpid-bursts.html Clarity Is King&amp;nbsp;– Eric Adler on Postmodernists' Limpid Bursts]. New Partisan. Retrieved on 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; including the suggestion that her work puts style ahead of substance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/199908090039.html Death sentences]. New Statesman. Retrieved on 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued in her defense, however, that this sort of criticism reveals an unwillingness to substantively engage with her texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n12/letters.html |journal=London Review of Books|volume =21|issue=12 |date=10 June 1999|title=letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Butler]] has noted that Spivak's supposedly complex language has, in fact, resonated with and profoundly changed the thinking of "tens of thousands of activists and scholars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n13/letters.html |journal=London Review of Books|volume =21|issue=13 |date=1 July 1999|title=letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Terry Eagleton]] has lamented that "If colonial societies endure what Spivak calls 'a series of interruptions, a repeated tearing of time that cannot be sutured', much the same is true of her own overstuffed, excessively elliptical prose. She herself, unsurprisingly, reads the book's broken-backed structure in just this way, as an iconoclastic departure from 'accepted scholarly or critical practice'. But the ellipses, the heavy-handed jargon, the cavalier assumption that you know what she means, or that if you don't she doesn't much care, are as much the overcodings of an academic coterie as a smack in the face for conventional scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;Terry Eagleton, "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n10/eagl01_.html In the Gaudy Supermarket]," ''London Review of Books'' (13 May 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

In speeches given and published since 2002, Spivak has addressed the issue of terrorism and suicide bombings. With the aim of bringing an end to suicide bombings, she has explored and "tried to imagine what message [such acts] might contain,"&lt;ref name="terror"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Terror: A Speech After 9-11 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/boundary/v031/31.2spivak.html | volume=31 | issue=2 | journal=boundary 2 |publisher=Duke University Press | year=2004 | pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruminating that "suicidal resistance is a message inscribed in the body when no other means will get through."&lt;ref name="terror"/&gt; One critic has suggested that this sort of stylised language may serve to blur important moral issues relating to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/276661721.html?dids=276661721:276661721&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+10%2C+2003&amp;author=EDWARD+ALEXANDER&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=09.A&amp;desc=Evil+educators+defend+the+indefensible | work=Jerusalem Post | first=Edward | last=Alexander | title=Evil educators defend the indefensible | date=10 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spivak stated in the same speech that "single coerced yet willed suicidal 'terror' is in excess of the destruction of dynastic temples and the violation of women, tenacious and powerfully residual. It has not the banality of evil. It is informed by the stupidity of belief taken to extreme."&lt;ref name="terror"/&gt;

Spivak has advised many significant postcolonial scholars. Professors [[Jenny Sharpe]] and [http://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/mark-sanders.html Mark Sanders] are among her former students.

In May 2018, she signed on to a collective letter that was sent to [[New York University]] following a sexual harassment suit filed by former NYU graduate student Nimrod Reitman against his advisor [[Avital Ronell]]. Spivak and the other signatories called the case a "legal nightmare" for Ronell and charged Reitman with conducting a "malicious campaign" against her. [[Judith Butler]], the chief signatory, subsequently apologized for certain aspects of the letter. &lt;ref&gt;https://jezebel.com/what-are-we-to-make-of-the-case-of-scholar-avital-ronel-1828366966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/letters/judith-butler-explains-letter-in-support-of-avital-ronell/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hebraization of English''' (or '''Hebraicization''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Hebraize Random House Unabridged Dictionary: Hebraize]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hebraicize Random House Unabridged Dictionary: Hebraicize]&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] to write [[English language|English]]. Because Hebrew uses an [[abjad]], it can render English words in multiple ways. There are many uses for hebraization, which serve as a useful tool for [[Israel]]i learners of English by indicating the pronunciation of unfamiliar letters. An example would be the English name spelled "Timothy", which can be Hebraized as "טימותי" in the Hebrew alphabet.

==Table==
=== Consonants ===

For [[full spelling]], when a reader is likely to err in the reading of a word, the use of [[niqqud]] or [[partial vowelling|partial niqqud]] is recommended.  This is especially true when writing foreign words, unfamiliar words, ambiguous words, or words that take a [[dagesh]].

====Final letters====
Five letters in Hebrew, [[Nun (letter)|Nun]], [[Mem (letter)|Mem]], [[Tsadi]], [[Pe (letter)|Pe/Fe]], and [[Kaph|Kaf]], all have final or sofit ([[Hebrew]]: סוֹפִית ''sofit'') forms.  That means, that the letters' appearances change when they are at the end of words from [[כ]], [[פ]], [[צ]], [[מ]], [[נ]] to [[ך]], [[ף]], [[ץ]], [[ם]], [[ן]] respectively.  Final forms are used in transliteration when appropriate, with the exception of foreign words ending in a [p] sound, which retain the non-final form of [[פ]], such as "קטשופ" ("ketchup").

=== Vowels and diphthongs===
Since vowels are not consistent in English, they are more difficult to transliterate into other languages.  Sometimes they are just transcribed by the actual English letter, and other times by its actual pronunciation (which also varies).  For the most accurate transliteration, below is a table describing the different vowel sounds and their corresponding letters.

Hebrew has only 5 vowel sounds, with lack of discrimination in Hebrew between long and short vowels.  In comparison, English which has around 12 vowel sounds (5 long, 7 short) depending on dialect.  As a result, words such as sit/seat ({{IPA|/sɪt/}} and {{IPA|/siːt/}}), hat/hut ({{IPA|/hæt/}} and {{IPA|/hʌt/}}), and cop/cope ({{IPA|/kɒp/}} and {{IPA|/koʊp/}}) are transliterated as the Hebrew vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.  The English pronunciation can be known through prior context.

Vowels will sometimes be put into Hebrew by their letters, and not by their sounds, even though it is less accurate phonetically.  For example, any sort of "a" sound written with the letter "o", (ex. mom, monitor, soft), will often be transliterated as an "o" vowel, that is, with a vav (ו).  The same is the case for an -or ending (pronounced -er), it will also often be transliterated with a vav as well.  If the word with the "a" sound (such as "a" or "ah"), as in "ta ta", or "spa", it will be treated as an "a".

For [[full spelling]], the ''[[niqqudot]]'' (the "dots") is simply omitted, if [[partial vowelling]] is desired, especially for letters like Vav, then the niqqudot is retained.

The picture of the "'''O'''" represents whatever Hebrew letter is used.

====At the beginning or end of a word====
The following are special cases for vowels at the beginning or end of a word. "O", "U", or "I" sound different at the beginning of a word, because they have no consonants before them. Therefore, [[Waw/Vav (letter)|Vav]] and [[Yodh|Yud]], by themselves, would be assumed to be their consonant versions ("V" and "Y" respectively) and not their vowel versions.

If the sounds (that is, vowels with no consonants before it) are made in the middle of a word, the same thing is done as shown below (or looking up, replace the '''"&lt;span style="font-family:Arial, 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', sans-serif; font-size:larger"&gt;ס&lt;/span&gt;"''' with the [[aleph]]).

For [[full spelling]], the ''[[niqqudot]]'' (the "dots") are simply omitted.

The '''Indo-Portuguese creoles''' are the several [[creole language]]s of [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] which had a substantial [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] influence in grammar or lexicon, such as

* [[Sri Lankan Portuguese creole]]
* [[Diu Portuguese creole]]
* [[Daman Portuguese creole]]
* [[Kristi language]]
* [[Indo-Portuguese Creole of Bombay|Bombay Portuguese creole]]
* [[Cochin Portuguese creole]] 
* [[Cannanore Portuguese creole]]
* [[Bengali Portuguese creole]]

The expression '''Indo-Portuguese''' may refer not only to the creoles but also to the ethnic groups speaking those languages.

'''Jagathy N. K. Achary''' (1924–1997) was an Indian dramatist and writer who also worked on [[Malayalam]] films. He is the father of popular Malayalam film actor [[Jagathy Sreekumar]].

==Life sketch==
Jagathy N. Kochukrishnan Achary was born in 1924 at ''Krishnavilasam'' in Jagathy, a small hamlet in [[Trivandrum]], Kerala, (he took the name of the locality as part of his [[nom de plume]]) to Ananthapadmanabhan Achary and Ponnammal. He had his education in Jagathy and Thiruvananthapuram. After obtaining a BA degree, he continued his education and got his graduate degree in Law.

He was married to Prasanna (Ponnamma – pet name) from Edavanacaud and had five children.

'''Judah Kalaẓ (Khallaṣ)''' was a cabalist and moralist. He lived in [[Algeria]], probably at [[Tlemçen]], at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The surname ''Kalaẓ'' is derived from the Arabic ''khallaṣ'' (= "collector of taxes"). Kalaz was descended from a Spanish family, members of which settled in Algeria after the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion from Spain]]. A grandson of his, also named ''Judah'', was rabbi at Tlemçen at the end of the sixteenth century. Kalaẓ was the author of a valuable work on ethics entitled ''Sefer ha-Musar'' (Constantinople, 1536–37). He frequently quotes the ''Zohar'' and other cabalistic works, which he held in great esteem. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9144-kalaz-khallas-judah| title= KALAẒ (KHALLAṢ), JUDAH |publisher=Jewish Enccyclopedia|accessdate=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term "Judeo-Italian"==
The glossonym type ''giudeo-italiano'' is of academic and relatively late coinage.  In [[English language|English]], ''Judeo-Italian'' was first used by [[Lazaro Belleli]] in 1904 for his article '' Judæo-Greek and Judæo-Italian'' in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (vol. 7, 310-313), describing the languages of the [[Jew]]s of [[Corfu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8950-judaeo-greek-and-judaeo-italian Judæo-Greek and Judæo-Italian]&lt;/ref&gt; In Italian, [[Giuseppe Cammeo]] referred to a ''Gergo giudaico-italiano'' in his 1909 article ''Studj dialettali''  (Vessillo Israelitico 57 (1909); the term first appears on p.&amp;nbsp;169).  That same year, [[Umberto Cassuto]] used the term  ''giudeo-italiano'', in the following:

:Actually, while the existence of a Judæo-German dialect is universally known, almost nobody [[Transalpine|beyond the Alps]] suspects that the Italian Jews have, or at least had, not to say a dialect of their own, but at least a way of speaking with peculiar features. True, in practice its importance, limited to the everyday use of some thousand people, is almost nothing versus that of Judæo-German, spoken by millions of individuals that often do not know any other language, and has  [[Yiddish literature|its own literature]], [[Yiddish press|its own journalism]], [[Yiddish theater|its own theater]], and thus, almost the importance of a real language... It is almost nothing, if you will, even compared with other Jewish dialects, [[Judaeo-Spanish|Judæo-Spanish]] for instance, that are more or less used literally; all this is true, but from the linguistic point of view, Judæo-German is worth as much as Judæo-Italian [''giudeo-italiano''], to name it so, since for the [[philology|glottological science]] the different forms of human speech are important in themselves and not by its number of speakers or the artistic forms they are used in. Moreover, a remarkable difference between Judæo-German and Judæo-Italian [''giudeo-italiano''], that is also valuable from the scientific point of view, is that while the former is so different from German as to constitute an independent dialect, the latter by contrast is not essentially a different thing from the language of Italy, or from the individual dialects of the different provinces of Italy...
:256:
:...It was natural that the Judæo-Italian jargon [''gergo giudeo-italiano''] would disappear in a short while.
:([[Umberto Cassuto]] “Parlata ebraica.” Vessillo Israelitico 57 (1909): 255-256)&lt;ref name="Cassuto!"&gt;''Infatti, mentre è universalmente nota l’esistenza di un dialetto giudeo-tedesco, quasi nessuno sospetta oltr’alpe che gli ebrei italiani abbiano pure, o almeno abbiano avuto, non dirò un loro dialetto, ma almeno una loro parlata con peculiari caratteri.  Certo, praticamente l’importanza di essa, limitata all’uso quotidiano di poche migliaia di persone, è pressoché nulla di fronte a quella del giudeo-tedesco, il quale è parlato da milioni di individui che bene spesso non conoscono altra lingua, ed ha una propria letteratura, un proprio giornalismo, un proprio teatro, sì da assumere quasi l’importanza di una vera e propria lingua a sé … è pressoché nulla, se si vuole, anche a paragone di altri dialetti giudaici, del giudeo-spagnuolo ad esempio, che sono più o meno usati letterariamente; è vero tutto questo, ma dal punto di vista linguistico tanto vale il giudeo-tedesco, quanto il giudeo-italiano, se così vogliamo chiamarlo, giacché di fronte alla scienza glottologica le varie forme del parlare umano hanno importanza di per sé e non per il numero di persone che le usano o per le forme d’arte in cui vengono adoperate.  Piuttosto, una notevole differenza fra il giudeo-tedesco e il giudeo-italiano, che ha valore anche per il riguardo scientifico, è che, mentre quello è tanto diverso dalla lingua tedesca da costituire un dialetto a sé stante, questo invece non è essenzialmente una cosa diversa dalla lingua d’Italia, o dai singoli dialetti delle varie provincie d’Italia … '' ; 256: ''… era naturale che il gergo giudeo-italiano in breve volger di tempo sparisse…'' ([[Umberto Cassuto]] “Parlata ebraica.” Vessillo Israelitico 57 (1909): 255-256)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical Representations of Judeo-Italian==
One of the most accessible ways to view the Judeo-Italian language is by looking at translations in [[biblical texts]] such as the Torah and [[Hagiographia]]. Today, there are two locations, the Oxford Bodleian Library and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, in which these translated texts can be found.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Jewish Languages"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Aaron D.|title=Handbook of Jewish Languages|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging|location=The [[Copyright Clearance Center]]|isbn=978-90-04-21733-1|pages=297–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other designations==

*Historically, Italian Jews referred to their vernaculars as "''La`az''" (לעז), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "foreign language" (''i.e.'', specifically, "non-Hebrew language").  The Italian Jewish rite is sometimes called ''minhag ha-lo'azim'', and linguists use ''lo'ez'' as a description of words of Romance origin in [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;''La'az'' or ''lo'ez'' is also used for the French or other Romance words used in [[Rashi]]'s Biblical and Talmudic commentaries to explain the meanings of obscure Hebrew or Aramaic words.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be connected with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] use of the word ''[[Walha|wälsch]]'' (literally, "foreign") for [[Italic peoples|Romance peoples]] and [[Romance languages|languages]] (as in "Welsh", "Walloon" and "Wallachian"): the Italian and Sephardic Hebrew script for Torah scrolls is known as "Velsh" or "Veilish".
*In 1587, [[David de Pomi]] uses the word "italiano" in reference to the [[Italian language|Italian]] glosses in his trilingual dictionary.  The Hebrew title of the 1609 Venice Haggadah uses the word "italiano" for the language of [[Leon of Modena|Leone Modena]]'s translation (u-fitrono bi-leshon iṭalyano; ופתרונו בלשון איטליאנו).
*Other historic descriptions are "''Latino''" and "''Volgare''", both of which were commonly used in the Middle Ages to mean Italian in general.
*After the institution of the [[Ghetto]] forced Jewish communities throughout Italy into segregation, the term '''ghettaiolo''' was identified with local Jewish varieties of regional dialects.
*Another native name type is ''giudeesco'' (e.g., Judeo-Florentine ''iodiesco''; &lt; *IUDÆĬSCU[M], or an assimilation of the hiatus {{IPA|/aˈe/}} *giudaesco &lt; *IUDAĬSCU[M]).
*The neologism '''Italkian''' was coined in 1942 by Solomon Birnbaum (''see [[#References|References]]''), who modelled the word on the modern Hebrew adjective  ית-/אטלקי ''italki(t)'', “Italian”, from the middle Hebrew adjective איטלקי  (&lt; ITALICU[M]), “Italic” or “Roman”.

==Influence on Yiddish==
According to some scholars, there are some Judeo-Italian loan words that have found their way into [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref name="Italian Dialect or Jewish Language?"/&gt; For example, the word in Judeo-Italian for "synagogue" is ''scola'', as opposed to "school," which is ''scuola''. The use of words for "school" to mean "synagogue" dates back to the [[Roman Empire]]. The Judeo-Italian distinction between ''scola'' and ''scuola'' parallels the Standard Yiddish distinction between ''shul/shil'' for 'synagogue' and ''shule'' for 'school'. Another example is ''iente'', from the Judeo-Italian yientile, as differentiated from the standard Italian ''gentile'', meaning 'noble'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jochnowitz.net/Essays/yiddaily.html www.jochnowitz.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Judeo-Italian regional dialects (''ghettaioli'' ''giudeeschi''), including:
* [[Judeo-Ferraran]] (giudeo-ferrarese) from [[Ferrara]]
* [[Judeo-Florentine]] (giudeo-fiorentino, iodiesco) from [[Florence]]
* [[Judeo-Mantuan]] (giudeo-mantovano) from [[Mantua]]
* [[Judeo-Modenan]] (giudeo-modenese) from [[Modena]]
* [[Judaeo-Piedmontese]] (giudeo-piemontese) from the region of [[Piedmont]]
* [[Judeo-Reggian]] (giudeo-reggiano) from the region of [[Reggio Emilia]] in [[Emilia-Romagna]]
* [[Judeo-Roman]] (giudeo-romanesco) from [[Rome]]
* [[Judeo-Venetian]] (giudeo-veneziano) from [[Venice]].
* [[Bagitto]] (giudeo-livornese) from [[Livorno]].

At least two Judeo-Italian varieties, based on [[Sicilian language|Salentino]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]] varieties were also used in [[Corfu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive/indo-european/europe/judeo-italian-corfiote/?searchterm=Judeo-Italian] {{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see relevant section in [[Corfiot Italians#Italkian with Venetian/Apulian influences|Corfiot Italians]]).

All of the spoken Judeo-Italian varieties used a unique (among [[Jewish languages]], although there are arguably parallels in [[Jewish English languages|Jewish English]] usage) combination of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verb stems with [[Italian language|Italian]] conjugations (''e.g.'', "אכלר ''akhlare''", to eat; "גנביר ''gannaviare''", to steal; "דברר ''dabberare''", to speak; "לכטיר ''lekhtire''", to go). Similarly there are abstract nouns such as "טובזה ''tovezza''", goodness.

Also common are lexical incorporations from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], particularly those applicable to daily life.  Terms from other Jewish languages such as [[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish]] were also incorporated.

Bagitto, the dialect of [[Livorno]], is particularly rich in [[loanword]]s from Judaeo-Spanish and [[Judaeo-Portuguese]].

It was claimed by Cassuto that most Judeo-Italian dialects reflect the Italian dialect of places further to the south, due to the fact that since the expulsion of the Jews from the [[Kingdom of Naples]] the general direction of Jewish migration in Italy has been northward.

== Visuals of the Language ==

The Judeo-Italian language can be found in a [[Haggadah]], a Jewish prayer book typically used during a seder. Judeo-Italian is represented in this [[1716 Venice Haggadah.]] &lt;ref name="Venice Haggadah"&gt;{{cite web|first1=https://www.baumanrarebooks.com/rare-books/haggadah/seder-haggadah-shel-pesah/83168.aspx|title=Seder Haggadah Shel Pesah|website=Bauman Rare Books|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Library of Congress/ISO information ==
"Italkian" is not used by the [[Library of Congress]] as a subject heading, neither does it figure as a reference to Judeo-Italian.  The authorized subject heading is "Judeo-Italian language". Subheadings are:
*Judeo-Italian language: Glossaries, vocabularies, etc.
*Judeo-Italian language: Grammar.
*Judeo-Italian language: Italy Livorno Glossaries, vocabularies, etc.
*Judeo-Italian language: Texts.

The subject reference is: Judæo-Italian dialect. LC-MARC uses the following language codes :
Judeo-Italian Assigned collective code [ita] (Italian).

This is in compliance with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] language code ISO 639-2 code (roa).

[[Image:Klostermann Javornik.JPG|thumb|Statue of Karel Klostermann]]
'''Kar(e)l Faustin Klostermann''' (February 13, 1848, in [[Haag am Hausruck]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Austrian Empire]] – July 17, 1923, in [[Štěkeň]], [[Czechoslovakia]]) was a [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Austria]]n writer. He wrote under the alias ''Faustin''.

From 1857 to 1865 he went to school in [[Písek]], a town in the [[South Bohemian Region]] of what is now the [[Czech Republic]]. He studied medicine until 1869 in [[Vienna]], and was later active as a teacher of [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] at the German high school in [[Plzeň]]. He first wrote his works in German; later he turned to the Czech language and wrote novellas about the inhabitants of the middle [[Bohemian Forest]] ({{lang-cs|Šumava}}, {{lang-de|Böhmerwald}}). This can be found in the collection ''V srdci šumavských hvozdů'' ("In the heart of the Šumava"). Some of his novellas are set in and around the town of [[Kašperské Hory]].

Some of his more popular works include ''The son of the free judge'' and ''Fist in stories''.

'''Khitan''' or '''Kitan''' ([[File:Khita-i.png|50px]] in [[large Khitan script|large script]] or [[File:Khita-i small.png|50px]] in [[small Khitan script|small]], ''Khitai'';&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/khitan.htm Khitan]" at ''[http://www.omniglot.com/ Omniglot]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh|&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{linktext|契丹|語}}}}, ''Qìdānyǔ''), also known as '''Liao''', is a now-extinct language once spoken by the [[Khitan people]] (4th to 13th century). It was the official language of the [[Liao dynasty]] (907–1125) and the [[Qara Khitai]] (1124–1218).

==Classification==
Khitan appears to have been related to the [[Mongolic languages]];&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Franke, John King Fairbank, Denis Crispin Twitchett, Roderick MacFarquhar, Denis Twitchett, Albert Feuerwerker. ''The Cambridge History of China'', Vol. 3: ''Sui and T'ang China, 589–906. Part 1'', p.364&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juha Janhunen]] states, "[T]he conception is gaining support that Khitan was a language in some respects radically different from the historically known Mongolic languages. If this view proves to be correct, Khitan is, indeed, best classified as a Para-Mongolic language."{{sfn|Janhunen|2006|p=393}}

[[Alexander Vovin]] (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vovin|first=Alexander|date=June 2017|title=Koreanic loanwords in Khitan and their importance in the decipherment of the latter|url=https://akademiai.com/doi/abs/10.1556/062.2017.70.2.4|journal=Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=207–215|doi=10.1556/062.2017.70.2.4|issn=0001-6446}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Khitan has many [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]] loanwords, pointing to intensive contact between Korean and Khitans. Both of the Korean's [[Goryeo]] dynasty and Khitan's [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]] dynasty claimed themselves to be successors of [[Goguryeo]], thus it is possible to assume the Koreanic words in Khitan are derived from the [[Goguryeo language|language of Goguryeo]].

==Script==
Khitan was written using two mutually exclusive [[writing system]]s known as the [[Khitan large script]] and the [[Khitan small script]].{{sfn|Janhunen|2006|p=393}} The small script, which was a [[syllabary]], was used until the [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]]-speaking [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] replaced it{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} in 1191.{{sfn|Janhunen|2006|p=395}} The large script was [[logographic]] like Chinese.

== Records ==
The ''[[History of Liao]]'' contains a volume of Khitan words transcribed in [[Chinese characters]] titled "Glossary of National Language" (國語解). It is found in Chapter 116.&lt;ref&gt;[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/遼史/卷116 遼史/卷116 卷116].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 123-125 Howorth, H. H.. 1881. “The Northern Frontagers of China. Part V. The Khitai or Khitans”. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland 13 (2). Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland: 121–82. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25196875.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese History: A Manual|first=Endymion Porter|last=Wilkinson|others=|volume=Volume 52 of Harvard Yenching Institute Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard-Yenching Institute monograph series |issue=Issue 52 of Harvard-Yenching Institute monograph series| ISSN =0073-084X|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=illustrated, revised|date=|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;pg=PA864|page=864|isbn=0674002490|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YongPeng2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heming Yong|author2=Jing Peng|title=Chinese Lexicography : A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFBtTUZFxEC&amp;pg=PA382#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=14 August 2008|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-156167-2|pages=382–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] erroneously identified the Khitan people and their language with the [[Solons]], leading him to use the [[Solon language]] to "correct" Chinese character transcriptions of Khitan names in the ''History of Liao'' in his ''Imperial Liao-Jin-Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation'' (欽定遼金元三史國語解) project.

The Liao dynasty referred to the Khitan language with the term Guoyu 國語 "National language", which was also used by other non-[[Han Chinese]] dynasties in China to refer to their languages like [[Manchu language|Manchu]] of the Qing, [[Classical Mongolian]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], Jurchen during the Jin, and [[Xianbei language|Xianbei]] during the [[Northern Wei]]. Even today, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is referred to in [[Taiwan]] as Guoyu.

== Vocabulary ==
There are several closed systems of Khitan lexical items for which systematic information is available.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Daniel ''The Kitan language and script'' 2009, Leiden, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of words in these closed systems that are similar to Mongolic. Mongolian equivalents are given after the English translation:

The [[Liaoshi]] records in Chapter 53:

{{quote| 國語謂是日為「討賽咿兒」。「討」五；「賽咿兒」，月也。}}

{{quote| In the national (Khitan) language this day (5th day of the 5th lunar month) is called 'Tao Saiyier'. 'Tao' means five; 'Saiyier' means moon/month.}}

'Tao Saiyier' corresponds to Mongolian 'tavan sar' (fifth moon/month). The Turkic Kyrgyz equivalent would be 'beshinchi ay' while the Manchu (Tungusic) equivalent would be 'sunja biya'.

== History ==
[[File:LG전자, 스마트 가전 출시(2).jpg|thumb|237x237px|LG introducing their first lineup of THINQ products in 2011, with the former logo of the brand on the top.]]
The branding was first introduced in 2011 in the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas as THINQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/lg-touts-grid-aware-smart-appliances-at-ces-2011/|title=LG touts grid-aware smart appliances at CES 2011|date=2011-01-05|work=CNET|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ThinQ-product is a smart refrigerator, with features such as smart savings options, food management system, and different softwares in the LCD screen on the fridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2011/04/lg-officially-launches-first-in-range-of-smart-grid-ready-smart-appliances/|title=LG OFFICIALLY LAUNCHES FIRST IN RANGE OF SMART GRID-READY SMART APPLIANCES {{!}} LG Newsroom|date=2011-04-19|work=LG Newsroom|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unified branding was then officially launched as ThinQ in the 2017 CES, an artificial intelligence-based brand for all their smart products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lg.com/au/press-release/lg-electronics-launches-thinq-for-its-ai-initiatives|title=LG Electronics launches ThinQ for its AI initiatives {{!}} LG Australia|website=www.lg.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feature ==
LG ThinQ products uses voice control to interact with users, and uses sensor data and different features such as product recognition &amp; learning engine technologies to enhance its performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lg.com/uk/lg-magazine/tech-story/lg-ces-2018-for-a-smarter-home-thinq|title=LG CES 2018 - For a smarter home: ThinQ.|last=RO|first=T.|work=LG MAGAZINE|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-ambient.com/news/lg-thinq-brand-revealed-and-set-for-ai-bonanza-at-ces-148|title=LG reveals new smart home ThinQ brand, and looks set for AI bonanza at CES|date=2017-12-20|work=The Ambient|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep ThinQ''' (or '''LG ThinQ AI''') was introduced as LG's own AI platform as ThinQ products' main AI platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/20/lg-ai-thinq/|title=LG will release new AI products under the 'ThinQ' brand|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that it could engage in two way conversations with users and could be able to educate itself according to the user's behaviour patterns and habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/lg-deep-thinq-ai-technology-features-explained-ahead-rollout-2639279|title=LG Deep ThinQ AI Technology, Features Explained Ahead Of Rollout|date=2018-01-09|work=International Business Times|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, LG ThinQ-branded TV supported Google Assistant and Alexa voice commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/29/17405930/lg-thinq-tv-alexa-voice-commands|title=LG’s 2018 ThinQ TVs now support Alexa voice commands|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/17/lg-appliances-support-alexa-and-google-assistant/|title=LG appliances now respond to both Alexa and Google Assistant|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 30, 2018, LG's ThinQ products now communicate with each other for different tasks such as going to an event or doing a recipe and they have sensors for communicating with other ThinQ devices and appliances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7881">A '''Lease-Purchase Contract''', also known as a '''Lease Purchase Agreement''''',''&lt;ref&gt;http://homeguides.sfgate.com/write-lease-purchase-agreement-2737.html&lt;/ref&gt; is the heart of [[Rent-to-own#Real estate|rent-to-own properties]]. It combines elements of a traditional [[Lease|rental agreement]] with an exclusive [[right of first refusal]] option for later purchase on the home.&lt;ref&gt;http://realestate.about.com/od/realestatebasics/p/lease_purchase.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is a shortened name for Lease with Option to Purchase Contract.

[[File:Lease Purchase Agreement.pdf|thumb|Combines elements of a traditional rental agreement with an exclusive right of first refusal option for later purchase on the home. It is a shortened name for Lease with Option to Purchase Contract.]]

==The typical contents of a Lease-Purchase Contract==

''Monthly Payment'' - How much the tenant will be paying monthly.&lt;br /&gt;
''Rent Credit'' - How much of the tenant's monthly payment will go to the eventual down-payment of the property at the end of the lease. It is strongly suggested that the tenant establish an [[Escrow|escrow account]] to ensure the security of his or her rent credit.&lt;br /&gt;
''Duration'' - The timeframe of the Lease-Purchase Agreement. Usually 2–3 years or more. &lt;br /&gt;
''Property Value'' - The locked-in sale price of the property. The Tenant-Buyer and [[Seller]] usually agree to keep the property value the same despite [[Real estate economics|house market]] changes.&lt;br /&gt;
''Terms and Rules'' - This section talks about other details of the Lease such as [[Property tax|property taxes]], [[Home repair|home repairs]], [[Homeowner association|homeowner's association]] fee, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.lawinfo.com/landlord-tenant/essential-terms-for-a-lease-agreement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transaction Structure==

In a standard Lease-Purchase Contract, the two parties agree to a lease period during which rent is paid, and the terms of the sale at the end of the lease period, including sale price. Often, the contract is structured in two parts, one representing the ''lease term'' and the other a ''contract of sale''. The lease agreement expounds upon what responsibilities the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller undertake during the course of the lease. This contract will also include the option fee and how much of the monthly payment will be credited to the down-payment for the purchase of the home at the end of the lease.

At the end of the lease-term, the tenant/buyer has the option to purchase the house. The lump sum accrued from the initial deposit and the rent credit are only released to the buyer as down-payment on the house should the tenant/buyer decide to proceed with the purchase. The tenant/buyer is responsible for securing the necessary [[mortgage loan]] to finalize the purchase the home.

As is usually stated in the lease purchase contract, the option fee and accrued rent credit are both non-refundable should the tenant/buyer decide to walk at the end of the lease. The tenant/buyer is released from responsibility for the sale, and the landlord/seller is responsible for finding new tenants.

Should the tenant/buyer be unable to purchase the house due to a lack of financing, the tenant and landlord can agree to extend the option period, convert the lease purchase contract into a [[Lease|traditional rental agreement]], or end the contract with the tenant moving out and the landlord seeking other renters or buyers.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2014/01/22/is-rent-to-own-or-contract-for-deed-right-for-you&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

Lease-purchase contract agreements are open source in nature and flexible to the needs of the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller. Lease-purchase contracts are popular with tenant/buyers who have poor [[Credit score|credit scores]], lower savings for down payments, or people who are moving from one city to another but are pending a sale on their previous home. They are great for sellers who are having difficulty securing tenants for their properties, which can be common when a house is for sale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/02/renting-mortgage-property-lifestyle-real-estate_rent_to_buy_slide_2.html?thisSpeed=30000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==

In the [[United States]], when credits are applied to a purchase price the agreement becomes a financing contract and these contracts have been identified as predatory lending arrangements under the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Act]]. Under this federal law any financing arrangement requires the purchaser of an owner occupied dwelling (one to four living units) is to qualify for any financing contract with a registered [[Loan officer|Mortgage Loan Originator]]. There are exemptions under this federal law for homeowners financing their primary residence, those in the business of [[real estate]] such as landlords are considered dealers. In all states, rent to own arrangements are no longer compliant with federal financing requirements.

Commercial loan arrangements are exempt from the Dodd-Frank Act, as a landlord might rent to own a property for the purpose of sub-letting to a tenant. This arrangement is not a popular arrangement but may be accomplished legally.

Lease-purchase contracts are not for everyone. As successful completion of the agreement and sale transaction requires financing through a traditional route, people whose circumstances will not allow them to receive a mortgage should abstain from rent-to-own real estate agreements.

==International Use==

===United Kingdom===

Amid concerns about how long saving for a deposit takes young professionals, a £400 million program was recently announced subsidizing rent at 20% for first-time homeowners. Subsidized rent prices lock in a period of time when the tenant-buyer saves, and the program requires sellers keep rent prices low to accommodate the process. At the end of the saving period, professionals have the option to purchase their flat. It now takes the average first-time buyer 22 years to save for a [[Damage deposit|deposit]] without parental assistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2770614/Young-professionals-seven-years-cheap-rent-save-deposit-new-Government-scheme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===

[[Auckland]]’s special housing area is subsidized by the Housing Foundation, providing homes for young families. Under their program, tenants pay rent on their homes for the first five years, then transition into paying mortgage payments. The Waimahia Inlet flagship development will see 282 new homes built over the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/home-property/10454687/Couple-thankful-for-rent-to-own-scheme&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===

The [[Lagos]] State Home-Ownership Mortgage Scheme (LagosHOMS) is a rent-to-own housing program that targets people who currently cannot afford a mortgage, but given will be able to. Tenants are expected to pay rent for a period of time, after which they are invited to transition into mortgage payments. The program is designed with young professionals in mind, including [[Teacher|teachers]] and junior [[Civil service|public servants]]. The program has produced well over 200 new homeowners in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://businessdayonline.com/2014/07/lagoshoms-plans-rent-to-own-scheme-creates-193-jobs-for-project-firms/#.VC1-2vldWk8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Middle High German''' (abbreviated ''MHG'', {{lang-de|Mittelhochdeutsch}}, abbr. ''{{lang|de|Mhd.}}'') is the term for the form of [[German language|German]] spoken in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It is conventionally dated between 1050 and 1350, developing from [[Old High German]] and into [[Early New High German]]. [[High German]] is defined as those varieties of German which were affected by the [[High German consonant shift|Second Sound Shift]]; the [[Middle Low German]] and [[Middle Dutch]] languages spoken to the North and North West, which did not participate in this [[sound change]], are not part of MHG. 

While there is no ''standard'' MHG, the prestige of the [[Hohenstaufen]] court gave rise in the late 12th century to a supra-regional literary language (''{{lang|de|mittelhochdeutsche Dichtersprache}}'') based on [[Swabian dialect|Swabian]], an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect. This historical interpretation is complicated by the tendency of modern editions of MHG texts to use ''normalised'' spellings based on this variety (usually called "Classical MHG"), which make the written language appear more consistent than is actually the case in the manuscripts. Scholars are uncertain as to whether the literary language reflected a supra-regional ''spoken'' language of the courts.

An important development in this period was the ''{{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}'', the eastward expansion of German settlement beyond the {{lang|de|[[Elbe]]–[[Saale]]}} line which marked the limit of [[Old High German]]. This process started in the 11th century, and all the [[East Central German]] dialects are a result of this expansion.

"Judeo-German", the precursor of the [[Yiddish]] language, sees attestation in the 13th–14th centuries, as a variety of Middle High German written in Hebrew characters.

The Middle High German period is generally dated from 1050 to 1350.{{sfn|Keller|1978|p=236}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1980|p=580}}{{sfn|Waterman|1976|p=83}}{{sfn|Rautenberg|1985|p=1120}} An older view puts the boundary with New High German around 1500.{{sfn|Rautenberg|1985|p=1120}} {{sfn|Roelcke|1998|pp=804-811|ps=: tabulates the various periodisations.}}

There are several phonological criteria which separate MHG from the preceding [[Old High German]] period:{{sfn|Roelcke|1998|p=812}}
* the weakening of unstressed vowels to {{angle bracket|e}}: OHG ''{{lang|goh|taga}}'', MHG ''{{lang|gmh|tage}}'' ("days"){{sfn|Waterman|1976|p=85}}
* the full development of [[Germanic umlaut|Umlaut]] and its use to mark a number of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological categories]]{{sfn|Waterman|1976|p=85}}
* the [[final-obstruent devoicing|devoicing of final stops]]: OHG ''{{lang|goh|tag}}'' &gt; MHG ''{{lang|gmh|tac}}'' ("day"){{sfn|Keller|1978|p=276}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1995|p=6}}

Culturally, the two periods are distinguished by the transition from a predominantly clerical written culture, in which the dominant language was [[Latin]], to one centred on the courts of the great nobles, with German gradually expanding its range of use.{{sfn|Lindgren|1980|p=580}}{{sfn|Waterman|1976|pp=87f.}} The rise of the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty in [[Swabia]] makes the South West the dominant region in both political and cultural terms.{{sfn|Keller|1979|p=337}}

Demographically, the MHG period is characterised by a massive rise in population,{{sfn|Keller|1979|pp=237|ps=: "the population appears to have increased about fivefold."}} terminated by the demographic catastrophe of the Black Death (1348).{{sfn|Keller|1979|pp=336}} Along with the rise in population comes a territorial expansion eastwards (''{{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}''), which saw German-speaking settlers colonise land previously under [[Slavs|Slav]] control.{{sfn|Keller|1979|pp=238-239}}{{sfn|Rautenberg|1985|p=1121}} 

Linguistically, the transition to [[Early New High German]] is marked by four vowel changes which together produce the phonemic system of modern German, though not all dialects participated equally in these changes:{{sfn|Waterman|1976|103}}
* [[Diphthong]]isation of the long high vowels {{IPA|/iː yː uː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/aɪ̯ ɔʏ̯ aʊ̯/}}:  MHG ''{{lang|gmh|hût}}'' &gt; NHG ''{{lang|de|Haut}}'' ("skin")
* [[Monophthong]]isation of the high centering diphthongs {{IPA|/iə yə uə/}} &gt; {{IPA|/iː yː uː/}}: MHG ''{{lang|gmh|huot}}'' &gt; NHG ''{{lang|de|Hut}}'' ("hat") 
* lengthening of stressed short vowels in open syllables: MHG ''{{lang|gmh|sagen}}'' {{IPA|/zaɡən/}} &gt; NHG ''{{lang|de|sagen}}'' {{IPA|/zaːɡən/}} ("say")
* The loss of unstressed vowels in many circumstances: MHG ''{{lang|gmh|vrouwe}}'' &gt; NHG ''{{lang|de|Frau}}'' ("lady")

The centres of culture in the ENHG period are no longer the courts but the towns.{{sfn|Eggers1985|p=1300|ps=: "{{lang|de|Zu Beginn der frnhd. Periode ist die Stadt längst zum Kultur-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialfaktor geworden.}}"}}

==Dialects==

The [[German dialects|dialect map of Germany]] by the end of the Middle High German period was much the same as that at the start of the 20th century, though the boundary with Low German was further south than it now is:{{sfn|Schmidt|2013|p=278}}{{sfn|Keller|1978|p=257}}

{{div col}} 
*[[Central German]]
**[[West Central German]]
***[[Central Franconian dialects]]
***[[Rhine Franconian dialects]]
**[[East Central German]]
***[[Thuringian dialect]]
***[[Upper Saxon German]]
***[[Silesian German]]

***[[Central Bavarian]]
***[[Southern Bavarian]]{{sfn|Keller|1978|p=257}}{{sfn|Paul|1989|pp=5-10}}
{{div col end}}

With the exception of Thuringian, the East Central German dialects are new dialects resulting from the ''{{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}''.{{sfn|Schmidt|2013|p=278}}{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=10}}

== Writing system==

Middle High German texts are written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. There was no standardised spelling, but modern editions generally standardise according to a set of conventions established by [[Karl Lachmann]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Paul|1989|pp=26ff}} There are several important features in this standardised orthography which are not characteristics of the original [[manuscript]]s:
*the marking of vowel length is almost entirely absent from MHG manuscripts.{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=30}}
*the marking of [[Germanic umlaut|umlauted]] vowels is often absent or inconsistent in the manuscripts.{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=31}}
*a curly-tailed z ({{angle bracket|[[ȥ]]}} or {{angle bracket|ʒ}}) is used in modern handbooks and grammars to indicate the {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}-like sound which arose from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/t/}} in the [[High German consonant shift]]. This character has no counterpart in the original manuscripts, which typically use {{angle bracket|s}} or {{angle bracket|z}} to indicate this sound.{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=32}}
*the original texts often use {{angle bracket|i}} and {{angle bracket|u}} for the semi-vowels {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=31}}

A particular problem is that many manuscripts are of much later date than the works they contain; as a result, they bear the signs of later scribes having modified the spellings, with greater or lesser consistency, in accord with conventions of their time.{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=29}} In addition, there is considerable regional variation in the spellings that appear in the original texts, which modern editions largely conceal.{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=19}}

===Vowels===

The standardised orthography of MHG editions uses the following vowel spellings:{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=30}}
* [[Short vowels]]: {{angle bracket|a e i o u}} and the umlauted vowels {{angle bracket|ä ö ü}}
* [[Long vowels]]: {{angle bracket|â ê î ô û}} and the umlauted vowels {{angle bracket|æ œ iu}}
* Closing [[diphthong]]s: {{angle bracket|ei ou}}; and the umlauted diphthong {{angle bracket|öu eu oi}}
* Opening [[diphthong]]s: {{angle bracket|ie uo}}; and the umlauted diphthong {{angle bracket|üe}}

Grammars (as opposed to textual editions) often distinguish between {{angle bracket|ë}} and {{angle bracket|e}}, the former indicating the mid-open {{IPA|/ɛ/}} which derived from Germanic {{IPA|/e/}}, the latter (often with a dot beneath it) indicating the mid-close {{IPA|/e/}} which results from primary umlaut of short {{IPA|/a/}}. No such orthographic distinction is made in MHG manuscripts.{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=31}}

===Consonants===
The standardised orthography of MHG editions uses the following consonant spellings:{{sfn|Paul|1989|p=32}}
* [[Stop consonant|Stops]]: {{angle bracket|p t k/c/q b d g}}
* [[Affricate consonant|Affricates]]: {{angle bracket|pf/ph tz/z}}
* [[Fricative consonant|Fricatives]]: {{angle bracket|v f s ȥ sch ch h}}
* [[Nasal consonant|Nasals]]: {{angle bracket|m n}}
* [[Liquid consonant|Liquids]]: {{angle bracket|l r}}
* [[Semivowel]]s: {{angle bracket|w j}}

==Phonology==
The charts show the vowel and consonant systems of classical MHG. The spellings indicated are the standard spellings used in modern editions – there is much more variation in the manuscripts.

Notes:
# Not all dialects distinguish the three unrounded mid front vowels.
# It is probable that the short high and mid vowels are lower than their long equivalents, as in Modern German, but this is impossible to establish from the written sources.
# The {{angle bracket|e}} found in unstressed syllables may indicate {{IPA|[ɛ]}} or [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}}.

====Diphthongs====
MHG diphthongs are indicated by the spellings: {{angle bracket|ei}}, {{angle bracket|ie}}, {{angle bracket|ou}}, {{angle bracket|öu}} and {{angle bracket|eu}}, {{angle bracket|üe}}, {{angle bracket|uo}}, having the approximate values of {{IPA|/ei/}}, {{IPA|/iə/}}, {{IPA|/ou/}}, {{IPA|/øy/}}, {{IPA|/eu/}}, {{IPA|/yə/}}, and {{IPA|/uə/}}, respectively.

# Precise information about the articulation of consonants is impossible to establish, and will have varied between dialects.
# In the plosive and fricative series, where there are two consonants in a cell, the first is [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] the second [[lenis]]. The voicing of lenis consonants varied between dialects.
# MHG has long consonants, and the following double consonant spellings indicate not vowel length as in Modern German orthography, but rather genuine double consonants: pp, bb, tt, dd, ck (for {{IPA|/kk/}}), gg, ff, ss, zz, mm, nn, ll, rr.
# It is reasonable to assume that {{IPA|/x/}} had an allophone {{IPA|[χ]}} after back vowels, as in Modern German.

==Grammar==

=== Pronouns ===
Middle High German pronouns of the first person refer to the speaker; those of the second person refer to an addressed person; and those of the third person refer to person or thing of which one speaks.
The [[pronoun]]s of the third person may be used to replace [[noun phrase|nominal phrases]]. These have the same [[gender]], [[grammatical number|number]] and [[case (linguistics)|case]] as the original nominal phrase.

The [[instrumental case]], only existing in the neuter singular, is used only with [[preposition]]s: ''{{lang|gmh|von diu}}'', ''{{lang|gmh|ze diu}}'', etc. In all the other genders and in the plural it is substituted with the dative: ''{{lang|gmh|von dëm}}'', ''{{lang|gmh|von dër}}'', ''{{lang|gmh|von dën}}''.

===Nouns===
Middle High German [[nouns]] were declined according to four [[grammatical case|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[accusative]]), two [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular and [[plural]]) and three [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine and neuter), much like Modern High German, though there are several important differences.

===Verbs===
{{Main|Middle High German verbs}}
Verbs were conjugated according to three moods ([[realis mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive (conjunctive)]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]), three persons, two [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular and [[plural]]) and two tenses ([[present tense]] and [[preterite]]) There was a present participle, a past participle and a verbal noun that somewhat resembles the [[Latin]] [[gerund]], but that only existed in the [[genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]] cases.

An important distinction is made between [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]]s (that exhibited [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]) and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s (that didn't).

Furthermore, there were also some irregular verbs.

====Strong verbs====

The [[present tense]] conjugation went as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan="2" |
! colspan="2" | ''{{lang|gmh|nëmen}}''&lt;br/&gt;to take
|-
! Indicative
! Subjunctive
|-
! 1. sg.
| ''{{lang|gmh|ich n'''i'''me}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|ich nëme}}''
|-
! 2. sg.
| ''{{lang|gmh|du n'''i'''m(e)st}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|du nëmest}}''
|-
! 3. sg.
| ''{{lang|gmh|ër n'''i'''m(e)t}}''  || ''{{lang|gmh|er nëme}}''
|-
! 1. pl.
| ''{{lang|gmh|wir nëmen}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|wir nëmen}}''
|-
! 2. pl.
| ''{{lang|gmh|ir nëm(e)t}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|ir nëmet}}''
|-
! 3. pl.
| ''{{lang|gmh|sie nëment}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|sie nëmen}}''
|}
* '''Imperative''': 2.sg.: ''{{lang|gmh|nim}}'', 2.pl.: ''{{lang|gmh|nëmet}}''
* '''Present participle''': ''{{lang|gmh|nëmende}}''

* '''Verbal noun''': ''genitive'': ''{{lang|gmh|nëmen(n)es}}'', ''dative'': ''{{lang|gmh|ze nëmen(n)e}}''

The bold vowels demonstrate [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]; the vowels in brackets were dropped in rapid speech.

The [[preterite]] conjugation went as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan="2" |
! colspan="2" | ''{{lang|gmh|genomen haben}}''&lt;br/&gt;to have taken
|-
! Indicative
! Subjunctive
|-

|-
! 3. pl.
| ''{{lang|gmh|sie n'''â'''men}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|sie n'''æ'''men}}''
|}
* '''Past participle''': ''{{lang|gmh|genomen}}''

====Weak verbs====

The [[present tense]] conjugation went as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan="2" |

|-
! Indicative
! Subjunctive
|-

|-
! 2. pl.
| ''{{lang|gmh|ir suoch(e)t}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|ir suochet}}''
|-
! 3. pl.
| ''{{lang|gmh|sie suochent}}'' || ''{{lang|gmh|sie suochen}}''
|}
* '''Imperative''': 2.sg: ''{{lang|gmh|suoche}}'', 2.pl: ''{{lang|gmh|suochet}}''
* '''Present participle''': ''{{lang|gmh|suochende}}''
* '''Infinitive''': ''{{lang|gmh|suochen}}''
* '''Verbal noun''': ''genitive'': ''{{lang|gmh|suochennes}}'', ''dative'': ''{{lang|gmh|ze suochenne}}''

The vowels in brackets were dropped in rapid speech.

The [[preterite]] conjugation went as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

|&lt;poem&gt;Whoever to true goodness
Turns his mind
He will meet with fortune and honour.
We are taught this by the example of
Good King Arthur
who with knightly spirit
knew how to strive for praise.
In his day
He lived so well
That he wore the crown of honour
And his name still does so.
The truth of this is known
To his countrymen:
They affirm that he still lives today:
He won such fame that
Although his body died
His name lives on.
Of sinful shame
He will forever be free
Who follows his example.
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Commentary:''' This text shows many typical features of Middle High German poetic language. Most Middle High German words survive into modern German in some form or other: this passage contains only one word (''{{lang|gmh|jehen}}'' 'say' 14) which has since disappeared from the language.  But many words have changed their meaning substantially.  ''{{lang|gmh|Muot}}'' (6) means 'state of mind', where modern German ''{{lang|de|Mut}}'' means courage.   ''{{lang|gmh|Êre}}'' (3) can be translated with 'honour', but is quite a different concept of honour from modern German ''{{lang|de|Ehre}}''; the medieval term focusses on reputation and the respect accorded to status in society.{{sfn|Lexer|1999}}

===''[[Nibelungenlied]]''===
[[File:Nibelungenlied manuscript-c f1r.jpg|thumb|Manuscript C of the ''{{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}'', fol.1r]]
The text is the opening strophe of the ''{{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}'' ({{circa|1204}}).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Middle High German{{sfn|Bartsch|De Boor|1998}}'''
&lt;poem lang="gmh"&gt;Uns ist in alten mæren&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;wunders vil geseit

von freuden, hôchgezîten,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;von weinen und von klagen,
von küener recken strîten&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;muget ir nu wunder hœren sagen.&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Modern German translation{{sfn|Brackert|1970}}'''
&lt;poem lang="de"&gt;In alten Erzählungen wird uns viel Wunderbares berichtet
von ruhmreichen Helden, von hartem Streit,
von glücklichen Tagen und Festen, von Schmerz und Klage:
vom Kampf tapferer Recken: Davon könnt auch Ihr nun Wunderbares berichten hören.&lt;/poem&gt;

'''English translation{{sfn|Edwards|2010}}'''
&lt;poem&gt;In ancient tales many marvels are told us
of renowned heroes, of great hardship
of joys, festivities, of weepeing and lamenting
of bold warriors' battles — now ''you'' may hear such marvels told!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Commentary:''' All the MHG words are recognizable from Modern German, though ''{{lang|gmh|mære}}'' ("tale") and ''{{lang|gmh|recke}}'' ("warrior") are archaic and ''{{lang|gmh|lobebære}}'' ("praiseworthy") has given way to ''{{lang|gmh|lobenswert}}''. Words which have changed in meaning include ''{{lang|gmh|arebeit}}'', which means "strife" or "hardship" in MHG, but now means "work", and ''{{lang|gmh|hôchgezît}}'' ("festivity") which now, as ''{{lang|de|Hochzeit}}'', has the narrower meaning of "wedding".{{sfn|Lexer|1999}}

===''Erec''===
The text is from the opening of [[Hartmann von Aue]]'s ''[[Erec (poem)|Erec]]'' ({{circa|1180–1190}}). The manuscript (the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]]) dates from 1516, over three centuries after the composition of the poem.

Now they had not been riding together
with one another very long
when they saw, riding across the heath
from afar, in all haste,
towards them,
a knight and two others with him —
in front of him a dwarf, and between the two there
a comely damsel,
fair and well clad,
and the Queen wondered
who this knight might be.
He was well armed,
as a good knight ought to be.
Young Erec 
asked his lady
if he should find out the knight's identity.&lt;/poem&gt;

The '''military designation of days and hours''' within the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO), is specified in [[Allied Administrative Publication|AAP]]-6 ([[STANAG]] 3680), ''NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions'', and marked ''(NATO)'' in what follows. Those entries marked ''(US)'' are specific to the U.S., and defined only in Joint Publication JP 1-02, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091108082044/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf ''Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms''].

References to days (or hours) preceding or following a designated day (or hour) use a plus or minus sign and an Arabic numeral following the letter. For example, "D−3" is 3 days prior to D-day, "C+7" is 7 days after C-day, "H−2" is 2 hours before H-hour, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/service_pubs/101_5_1.pdf FM 101-5-1 ''Operational Terms &amp; Graphics'' (U.S.)]&lt;/ref&gt; In less formal contexts, the time is usually spelled out, so that "D−3" becomes "D minus three" or "D minus 3".

'''Missing in action''' ('''MIA''') is a [[casualty (person)|casualty]] classification assigned to [[combatant]]s, [[military chaplain]]s, [[combat medic]]s, and [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who are reported missing during [[war]]time or [[ceasefire]]. They may have been [[killed in action|killed]], [[Wounded in action|wounded]], [[prisoner of war|captured]], or [[Desertion|deserted]]. If deceased, neither their remains nor grave has been positively identified. Becoming MIA has been an occupational risk for as long as there has been warfare or ceasefire.

==Problems and solutions==
Until around 1912, service personnel in most countries were not routinely issued with [[Dog tag (identifier)|ID tags]]. As a result, if someone was [[killed in action]] and his body was not recovered until much later, there was little or no chance of identifying the remains. Starting around the time of the [[First World War]], nations began to issue their service personnel with purpose-made ID tags. These were usually made of some form of lightweight metal such as aluminium. However, in the case of the [[British Army]] the material chosen was compressed fiber, which was not very durable. Although wearing ID tags proved to be highly beneficial, the problem remained that bodies could be completely destroyed, burned or buried by the type of high explosive munitions routinely used in [[modern warfare]]. Additionally, the combat environment itself could increase the likelihood of missing combatants such as [[jungle warfare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/820454--jungle-battlefield-lost-for-68-years-discovered |title=Jungle battlefield ‘lost’ for 68 years discovered |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2012-10-11 |location=Toronto |date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Justin R.

As a result, the remains of missing combatants might not be found for many years, if ever. When missing combatants are recovered and cannot be identified after a thorough forensic examination (including such methods as [[DNA]] testing and comparison of [[dental records]]) the remains are interred with a tombstone which indicates their unknown status.

The development of [[genetic fingerprinting]] in the late 20th century means that if cell samples from a cheek swab are collected from service personnel prior to deployment to a combat zone, identity can be established using even a small fragment of human remains. Although it is possible to take genetic samples from a close relative of the missing person, it is preferable to collect such samples directly from the subjects themselves. It is a fact of warfare that some combatants are likely to go missing in action and never be found. However, by wearing ID tags and using modern technology the numbers involved can be considerably reduced. In addition to the obvious military advantages, conclusively identifying the remains of missing service personnel is highly beneficial to the surviving relatives. Having positive identification makes it somewhat easier to come to terms with their loss and move on with their lives. Otherwise, some relatives may suspect that the missing person is still alive somewhere and may return someday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4374611.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Arnhem soldier buried 60 years on | date=March 23, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4755183.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Family of dead WWII airman found | date=May 9, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4198304.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Funeral for RAF crew, 61 years on | date=September 1, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/7745635.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Mystery of soldier's grave solved | date=November 24, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | first=Julian | last=Sturdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/174121.stm |work=BBC News  | title=British War hero finally gets hero's funeral | date=September 18, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/193380.stm |work=BBC News  | title=German WWII pilot laid to rest on Teesside | date=October 14, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.

==Before the 20th century==
It is possible that some of the combatants who took part of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC went missing in action. Certainly, the numerous wars which followed over successive centuries created many MIAs. The list is long and includes most battles which have ever been fought by any nation. The usual problems of identification caused by rapid decomposition were exacerbated by the fact that it was common practice to loot the remains of the dead for any valuables e.g. personal items and clothing. This made the already difficult task of identification even harder. Thereafter the dead were routinely buried in [[mass grave]]s and scant official records were retained. Notable examples include such [[medieval]] battles as [[Battle of Towton|Towton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Armin Schmidt |url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/archsci/depart/resgrp/towton/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907151242/http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/archsci/depart/resgrp/towton/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 7, 2007 |title=brad.ac.uk |publisher=brad.ac.uk |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hundred Years' War]], the later [[English Civil War]]s and [[Napoleonic Wars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/uk-waterloo-skeleton-idUKBRE85E0JM20120615 | work=Reuters | title=Rare remains of soldier found at Waterloo | date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/03/artsandhumanities.research |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=After 190 years the bones of Boney's army are unearthed in a mass grave in Lithuania | first=Ian | last=Traynor | date=September 3, 2002 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with any battle taking place until around the middle of the 19th century. Starting around the time of the [[Crimean War]], [[American Civil War]] and [[Franco-Prussian War]], it became more common to make formal efforts to identify individual soldiers. However, since there was no formal system of [[Dog tag (identifier)|ID tags]] at the time, this could be difficult during the process of battlefield clearance. Even so, there had been a notable shift in perceptions e.g. where the remains of a soldier in Confederate uniform were recovered from, say, the [[battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg battlefield]], he would be interred in a single grave with a headstone which stated that he was an unknown [[Confederate soldier]]. This change in attitudes coincided with the [[Geneva Conventions]], the first of which was signed in 1864. Although the [[First Geneva Convention]] did not specifically address the issue of MIAs, the reasoning behind it (which specified the humane treatment of wounded enemy soldiers) was influential.

==World War I==
The phenomenon of MIAs became particularly notable during World War I, where the mechanized nature of [[modern warfare]] meant that a single battle could cause astounding numbers of casualties. For example, in 1916 over 300,000 Allied and German combatants were killed in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. A total of 19,240 British and Commonwealth combatants were [[killed in action]] or died of wounds on the [[First day on the Somme|first day of that battle]] alone. It is therefore not surprising that the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]] in France bears the names of 72,090 British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] combatants, all of whom went missing in action during the Battle of the Somme, were never found and who have no known grave. Similarly, the [[Menin Gate]] memorial in [[Belgium]] commemorates 54,896 missing Allied combatants who are known to have been killed in the [[Ypres Salient]]. The [[Douaumont ossuary]], meanwhile, contains 130,000 unidentifiable sets of French and German remains from the [[Battle of Verdun]].

If this is achieved, attempts are made to trace any living relatives. However, it is frequently impossible to identify the remains, other than to establish some basic details of the unit they served with. In the case of British and Commonwealth MIAs, the headstone is inscribed with the maximum amount of information that is known about the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lyness-cemetery.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/known-unto-god.html|title=Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery|work=lyness-cemetery.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, such information is deduced from metallic objects such as brass buttons and shoulder flashes bearing regimental/unit insignia found on the body. As a result, headstones are inscribed with such information as "A Soldier of The [[Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)|Cameronians]]" or "An Australian [[Corporal#United Kingdom|Corporal]]" etc. Where nothing is known other than the soldier's national allegiance, the headstone is inscribed "A Soldier of The Great War". The term "Sailor" or "Airman" can be substituted, as appropriate.

In the [[United States Armed Forces]], 78,750 personnel missing in action had been reported by the end of the war, representing over 19 percent of the total of 405,399 killed during the conflict.&lt;ref name="franklin-12"&gt;{{cite book | last=Franklin | first=H.

As with MIAs from the First World War, it is a routine occurrence for the remains of missing personnel killed during the Second World War to be periodically discovered.&lt;ref name="Gassend Jean-Loup"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gassend Jean-Loup |url=https://www.amazon.com/Operation-Dragoon-Autopsy-Liberation-August-September/dp/076434580X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433157056&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gassend |title=Autopsy of a Battle, the Liberation of the French Riviera |publisher=Schiffer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually they are found purely by chance (e.g. during construction or demolition work) though on some occasions they are recovered following deliberate, targeted searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Repatriation and identification of the Finnish World War II soldiers.|pmc=2080560|pmid=17696308 | volume=48|issue=4|date=Aug 2007|journal=Croat Med J|pages=528–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw5T3TOdtEA&amp;feature=related |title=uk.youtube.com |publisher=uk.youtube.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-86873154.html |title=highbeam.com |publisher=highbeam.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishrussia.com/2008/07/19/russian-digging |title=Russian Digging |publisher=English Russia |date=2008-07-19 |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the First World War, in western Europe MIAs are generally found as individuals, or in twos or threes. However, sometimes the numbers in a group are considerably larger e.g. [[Villeneuve-Loubet mass grave|the mass grave at Villeneuve-Loubet]], which contained the remains of 14 [[Wehrmacht|German]] soldiers killed in August 1944.&lt;ref name="Gassend Jean-Loup"/&gt; Others are located at remote aircraft crash sites in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wciv.com/news/stories/0109/586609.html Wciv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122082857/http://www.wciv.com/news/stories/0109/586609.html |date=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Beata Mostafavi | work=Flint Journal |url=http://www.mlive.com/living/flint/index.ssf/2008/04/world_war_ii_soldier_who_went.html |title=World War II soldier who went missing almost 65 years ago finally gets burial |publisher=mlive.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmsW4Y_udfo |title=uk.youtube.com |publisher=uk.youtube.com |date=April 26, 2008 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But in eastern Europe and Russia, [[World War II casualties]] include approximately two million missing Germans, and many mass graves remain to be found. Almost a half million German MIAs have been buried in new graves since the end of the Cold War. Most of them will stay unknown. The [[German War Graves Commission]] is spearheading the effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wwii-buffalo/buffalo01/msg03042.html Ibiblio.org]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are approximately 4 million missing Russian service personnel scattered across the former [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], from [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]] down to [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], though around 300 volunteer groups make periodic searches of old battlefields to recover human remains for identification and reburial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25589709 | work=BBC News | title=Digging for their lives: Russia's volunteer body hunters | date=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, there was renewed attention within and without the U.S. military to finding remains of the missing, especially in the European Theatre and especially since aging witnesses and local historians were dying off.&lt;ref name="nyt-ww2-missing"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/world/europe/06search.html | title=Teams Seeking Remains Dig Back to World War II | author=[[Elisabeth Bumiller]] |work=The New York Times | date=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group World War II Families for the Return of the Missing was founded in 2005 to work with the [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] and other governmental entities towards locating and repatriating the remains of Americans lost in the conflict.&lt;ref name="nyt-ww2-missing"/&gt; The president of the group said in reference to the far more publicised efforts to find remains of U.S. dead from the [[Vietnam War]], “Vietnam had advocates. This was an older generation, and they didn’t know who to turn to.”&lt;ref name="nyt-ww2-missing"/&gt;

In 2008, investigators began to conduct searches on [[Tarawa]] atoll in the Pacific Ocean, trying to locate the remains of 139 [[USMC|American Marines]], missing since the [[Battle of Tarawa]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27922629/ |title=msnbc.msn.com |publisher=msnbc.msn.com |date=November 26, 2008 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2013 and 2016 the remains of 37 USMC were recovered from Tarawa.

As of November 23, 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Accounting Office, there were still 72,772 U.S. servicemen and Civilians still unaccounted for from World War II..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpaa.mil/Our-Missing/Past-Conflicts/ |title=DTIC Cold War Unaccounted For List by Last Name |format=PDF |accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official US Department of Army and Department of Navy casualty records, submitted to Congress in 1946 and updated in 1953, the combined possible total of missing service personnel worldwide is closer to approximately 6600 and probably considerably fewer. Since DPAA alone designates such WWII personnel as the crew of the {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}} and most of that of {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}} as both "missing" and "unaccounted-for" it is possible that DPAA records keeping may be somewhat idiosyncratic.{{clarify|date=August 2017}}

Following the [[Paris Peace Accords]] of 1973, 591 U.S. [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were returned during [[Operation Homecoming]]. The U.S. listed about 1,350 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action and roughly 1,200 Americans reported killed in action and body not recovered.&lt;ref name="dpmo-hist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/vietnamwar/vietnam_history.htm | title=Vietnam War Accounting History | publisher=[[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]] | accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; By the early 1990s, this had been reduced to a total of 2,255 unaccounted for from the war, which constituted less than 4 percent of the total 58,152 U.S. service members killed.&lt;ref name="franklin-12"/&gt; This was by far the smallest proportion in the nation's history to that point.&lt;ref name="franklin-12"/&gt;

About 80 percent of those missing were airmen who were shot down over [[North Vietnam]] or [[Laos]], usually over remote mountains, tropical rain forest, or water; the rest typically disappeared in confused fighting in dense jungles.&lt;ref name="franklin-12"/&gt; Investigations of these incidents have involved determining whether the men involved survived their shootdown and, if not, efforts to recover their remains. POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of the missing. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s, when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process.

Considerable speculation and investigation has gone to a theory that a significant number of these men were captured as [[prisoners of war]] by Communist forces in the two countries and kept as live prisoners after the war's conclusion for the United States in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese government and every American government since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DE1E30F93BA25757C0A965958260 | title=Old M.I.A. Theory Is Given a New Life | author=Engelberg, Stephen |work=The New York Times | date=1993-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular culture has reflected the "live prisoners" theory, most notably in the 1985 film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]] of 1991–1993 led by Senators [[John Kerry]], [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]], and [[John McCain]]. Its unanimous conclusion found "no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia."&lt;ref name="report-exec"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1993_rpt/pow-exec.html | title=Executive Summary | work=Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | date=1993-01-13 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This missing in action issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War. To skeptics, "live prisoners" is a [[conspiracy theory]] unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who have preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing. As two skeptics wrote in 1995, "The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots—who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch—spanning five administrations—to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm |author2=Schweitzer III |author3=Theodore G  | title=Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives: Solving the MIA Mystery | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-671-87118-8}} p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Believers reject such notions; as one wrote in 1994, "It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam."&lt;ref name="schan94"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408,schanberg2,51267,1.html | title=Did America Abandon Vietnam War P.O.W.'s? | authorlink=Sydney Schanberg | author=Schanberg, Sydney | work=[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] | date=September 1994 | accessdate=2007-06-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321171551/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408%2Cschanberg2%2C51267%2C1.html | archivedate=March 21, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) has been active in trying to resolve MIA issues from the war; in October 2008, twenty years after the end of the war, the ICRC forged a memorandum of understanding with the two countries to share information collected in pursuit of resolving cases.&lt;ref name="fox2008"/&gt;  Families are still desperate for knowledge about the fate of their loved ones.&lt;ref name="icrc-iiw"/&gt;

== Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 ==
In the [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1971]], two companies of the Indian Army's [[Punjab Regiment (India)|15th Punjab]] (formerly First Patiala) were attacked by four brigades of the Pakistan Army on 3 December 1971 at 1835 hours. Nearly 4,000 Pakistani men attacked the Indian side with 15 tanks and heavy artillery support. The Indian commanders included Major Waraich, Major Singh's and Major Kanwaljit Sandhu, who was badly injured. Major SPS Waraich was reported captured, as were many [[Junior Commissioned Officer|JCO]]s and men as the squadrons were taken by surprise and had little time to get to their bunkers. A Pakistani radio news telecast reported (in [[Urdu]]) that ''Maj Waraich hamari hiraasat mein hain'' (Maj Waraich is in our custody). There was a subsequent report that Maj Waraich was in a [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier]]  jail. Their current status is unknown. They are listed as missing by the Indian Government along with 52 others including a Maj Ashok Suri who wrote a letter to his father in 1975 from [[Karachi]] stating that he was alive and well. Pakistan denies holding any of the soldiers Missing in Action.

==Gulf War==
According to the [[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]], 47 Americans were listed as POW/MIAs at some point during [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/gulf_war/documents/IRAQI05B.pdf|format=PDF|title=Desert Storm Captives/Unaccounted-for|work=dtic.mil|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the [[Gulf War]] of 1991, U.S. forces resolved all but one of those cases : 21 Prisoners of War were repatriated, 23 bodies were recovered and 2 bodies were lost over the Gulf and therefore classified as Killed-In-Action, Body Not Recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/Iraq_Conflicts/|title=Two KIA-BNR from Desert Storm|work=dtic.mil|accessdate= December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That one MIA case, that of U.S. Lt. Cmdr. [[Michael Scott Speicher]], became quite well known. He was reported as missing after his [[F/A-18]] was shot down in northern Iraq on the first night of the war.&lt;ref name="cnn-speicher"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/04/23/sprj.irq.speicher.search/ | title=Initials may offer clue to missing Gulf War pilot | author=McIntire, Jamie | publisher=CNN | date=2003-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years his status was changed from missing to killed in action to missing-captured, a move that suggested he was alive and imprisoned in Iraq. In 2002, his possible situation became a more high-profile issue in the build-up to the [[Iraq War]]; ''[[The Washington Times]]'' ran five successive front-page articles about it in March 2002 and in September 2002, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] mentioned Speicher in a speech to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] as part of his case for war. However, despite the 2003 invasion of Iraq and U.S. military control of the country, Speicher was not found and his status remained under debate.&lt;ref name="cnn-speicher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ieRx69tRJygBw63QD3HaV-ST_NBAD95JNIR81 | title=Panel calls for continuing probe of lost pilot | author=Evans, Ben | agency=Associated Press | date=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually resolved in August 2009 when his remains were found in the Iraq desert where, according to local civilians, he was buried following his crash in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=12862 | title=Remains Identified as Navy Captain Michael Scott Speicher | publisher=[[U.S. Department of Defense]] | date= August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/02/us.gulf.war.remains/index.html | title=Remains found of first American shot down in Gulf War | publisher=CNN | date=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How many Iraqi forces went missing as a result of the war is not readily known, as estimates of Iraqi casualties overall range considerably.

The two cases KIABNR:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpaa.mil/Our-Missing/Iraq-Other-Conflicts/ |title=DPaa |work=dpaa.mil|accessdate= December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lt. Robert J. Dwyer, U.S. Navy, was lost on February 5, 1991, when his FA-18 aircraft went down in the Persian Gulf.

As of November 23, 2018 according to the US Dept of Defense the Total of unaccounted for from Iraqi and other conflicts – 6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpaa.mil/Our-Missing/Iraq-Other-Conflicts/|title=Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency &gt; Our Missing &gt; Iraq &amp; Other Conflicts|website=www.dpaa.mil|accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Defense POW/MIA website has the following remarks:
"...more than 82,000 Americans remain missing from WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and the Gulf Wars/other conflicts. Out of the 82,000 missing, 75% of the losses are located in the Indo-Pacific, and over 41,000 of the missing are presumed lost at sea (i.e. ship losses, known aircraft water losses, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpaa.mil/Our-Missing/Past-Conflicts/ |title=DTIC Cold War Unaccounted For List by Last Name |format=PDF |accessdate=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIA is sometimes used in American English to describe difficulty finding something, particularly a person.

&lt;!-- NOTE TO ALL EDITORS: The article is about a Canadian company, so please use [[Canadian English|Canadian spellings]]. --&gt;
'''Nelvana Ltd.''' (now known as '''Nelvana Enterprises, Inc.''') is a Canadian [[animation studio]] and children's media company owned by [[Corus Entertainment]]. Founded in 1971, it was named by founders [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]], [[Patrick Loubert]] and [[Clive A. Smith]] after a [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights|Canadian comic book superheroine]] created by [[Adrian Dingle (cartoonist)|Adrian Dingle]] in the 1940s. The company's production logo is a [[Polar bear]] looking at the [[North Star]]. Most of its films, shows and specials are based on licensed properties, mainly children's literature, but original programming is also part of its roster. It ventured into the world of [[live action]] from its establishment and continues to do so.

Nelvana also distributes internationally two [[Nickelodeon]] shows: ''[[Taina (TV series)|Taina]]'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]''&lt;!--It has never been produced by Nelvana outside of the USA. Any removal will be considered vandalizing.--&gt;.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Corus%27+Nelvana+expands+strategic+relationship+with+Nickelodeon+for...-a076747013.  "Corus' Nelvana expands strategic relationship with Nickelodeon for international distribution of "Taina's World" and "The Fairly Odd Parents""]. The Free Library. Retrieved January 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2001}}, its library comprises more than 1,650 cumulative half-hours of original programming.&lt;ref name="kidscreen"/&gt; The company has international offices in France, Ireland and Japan.

==History==

===1970s===
Nelvana started in 1971 when two graduates of [[York University]], [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]] and [[Patrick Loubert]], teamed up with a [[Vitaphone]] animator-designer [[Clive A. Smith]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. Hirsh and Loubert, who had a passion for [[underground film]]making, had founded a small company called Laff Arts in the late 1960s. Smith, whose interest was in [[rock n' roll]] music, had previously been among the crew for [[the Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (TV series)|animated series]] and their 1968 film, ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Hirsh has commented on the background of Nelvana's founding:

{{quote|Clive is an animator, and Patrick and I became interested in animation when we were in university together. At the time, there was no production industry per se in Canada, either in animation or in television production. There were stations making local shows, but you didn't have people making programs for sale around the world. So, blissfully unaware of all it would involve, we decided to start a company in Toronto.}}

Soon after they saw a collection of local [[comic book]]s from the 1940s and acquired the ownership rights. In turn, they made a half-hour television documentary for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] focusing on Canadian comics. Their two-year travelling tour of the art from the [[National Gallery of Canada]], "Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45", gave locals a chance to revisit the country's past heritage in that field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/canada.htm "Canadian Heroes" page] at [[Internationalhero.co.uk]]. Retrieved July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Hirsh and Loubert collaborated on a related primer from [[Peter Martin and Associates]], ''[[The Great Canadian Comic Books]]''. Amid all this success, Hirsh, Loubert and Smith named their new enterprise Nelvana—after a Canadian comic book [[superheroine]] from [[World War II]], [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]], who was one of the characters in the ''[[Canadian Whites]]'' canon.

A derelict apartment in downtown Toronto served as the company's first building, and a homemade wooden stand mounted over a toilet was among its first camera equipment. "To create zooms," Hirsh recalled of his early experience with this machine, "we would pile up phone books under the art work." During their first year and a half, the trio lived off a superfluous [[Chargex]] credit card that Loubert received at university, spending up to C$7,500 on it before they reclaimed double that cost as their first ever transaction.&lt;ref name="kidscreen"/&gt; Under those conditions, Nelvana was involved in the production of documentaries and live-action films. In the area of part-time animation work, they made ten C$1,500 [[filler (media)|filler]]s for the CBC.

Among the studio's first productions was a low-budget CBC [[short subject]] series, ''[[Small Star Cinema]]'', which combined live-action and animation to tell stories of ordinary life from a child's point of view. It was followed by 1974's ''[[Christmas Two Step]]'', a similarly styled special in which a girl tries to be a lead dancer at a Christmas pageant.

Nelvana worked on their first television specials: ''[[A Cosmic Christmas]]'' (1977), ''[[The Devil and Daniel Mouse]]'' (1978), ''Please Don't Eat the Planet'' (better known by its subtitle, ''[[Intergalactic Thanksgiving]]'') (1979), ''[[Romie-0 and Julie-8]]'' (1979), ''[[Easter Fever]]'' (1980) and ''[[Take Me Up to the Ball Game]]'' (1980). During that time, [[George Lucas]], an aficionado of their work,&lt;ref name="kidscreen"/&gt; commissioned the company to work on a 10-minute sequence for the [[CBS]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] TV film, ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]''. This short scene, officially entitled "The Faithful Wookiee", would introduce audiences to the villainous bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], who would make his first theatrical appearance in 1980's ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Nelvana also started to use the polar bear as its mascot.

At the start of the 1980s, Nelvana was offered the chance to work on ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', an animated anthology of science fiction stories that studios in Canada and other countries were working on. Nelvana declined this opportunity, instead going on to concentrate on the production of its first feature film, ''[[Rock &amp; Rule]]''.

Based heavily on the earlier special ''The Devil and Daniel Mouse'', and originally titled ''Drats!'', the film was produced for five years using all of the studio's resources, totalling $8 million. Upon its release by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA]] in 1983, it received little promotion in the United States and quickly disappeared at the box office.

The financial demise of ''Rock &amp; Rule'' would have ended Nelvana's operations altogether, had the company not saved themselves from debt by working full-time on children's television series. On its agenda at that time were its first three live-action franchises, ''[[The Edison Twins]]'', ''[[20 Minute Workout]]'' and ''[[Mr. Microchip]]''. With [[DIC Entertainment]], Nelvana worked on the first season of ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', and animated the pilot episode of ''[[The Get Along Gang]]''.

Early in the decade, the company worked on four television specials based on [[American Greetings]] properties. They were ''[[The Magic of Herself the Elf]]'', based on [[Mattel]]'s [[Herself the Elf|toy line]]; ''[[Strawberry Shortcake: Housewarming Surprise]]''; ''[[Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name]]''; and ''[[Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins]]'', the last three of which featured the [[Strawberry Shortcake|eponymous doll]]. There were two shows from Nelvana based on the [[AmToy]] properties, ''[[Madballs]]'' and ''[[My Pet Monster]]''.

Despite the successes of their earlier works, perhaps its greatest success at the time came in the form of the [[Care Bears]], thanks to its acquisition of the character rights from American Greetings, the franchise owners. In early 1985, [[The Care Bears Movie|the first movie based on the toy line]] turned the company's fortunes around, grossing [[United States dollar|$]]23&amp;nbsp;million in the US, and another [[Canadian dollar|$]]1.5&amp;nbsp;million in its native Canada. Its tremendous success gave way to two more big-screen movies, ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation|A New Generation]]'' and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland|Adventure in Wonderland]]'', as well as a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]].&lt;ref&gt;DiC Entertainment also made 22 episodes of the Care Bears series before Nelvana reclaimed the rights for the animated franchise.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Since this is a GA, please find a source or two for this:
In addition, Nelvana hired [[Gordon Stanfield Animation (GSA)]] in Vancouver for episode storyboarding of the ''Care Bears'' series. The latter worked on many of Nelvana's productions afterward. --&gt;

In the area of science fiction, Nelvana produced ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'' and ''[[Ewoks (TV series)|Ewoks]]'', two Saturday-morning series based on ''[[Star Wars]]''. At one point, there was talk of an animated CBS show from the studio, based on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Doctor Who]]''; the plan never came to fruition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Lofficier|first = Jean-Marc|title = The Nth Doctor|publisher = Virgin Publishing|year = 1997|pages = 9|url = http://www.lofficier.com/nthdoctor.htm|isbn = 0-426-20499-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but concept art was created by [[Ted Bastien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = CBC Television - The Planet of the Doctor ("Ted Bastien's Nelvana photo gallery.")|publisher = CBC Television|url = http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|accessdate = January 27, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051201024349/http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html |archivedate = December 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Orion Pictures]]' [[1986 in film|1986 live-action western comedy]], ''[[Three Amigos]]'', the company made use of lip-sync animation for a musical sequence in which the main characters sing a song at a campfire, with their horses singing along. In 1987, Michael Hirsh produced Nelvana's first self-made film of this calibre, the [[Whoopi Goldberg]] comedy ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]''.

In 1988, Nelvana and [[Scholastic Corporation]] produced a video series of [[Clifford the Big Red Dog (1988 series)|The Video Adventures of Clifford the Big Red Dog]] based on the 1962 book. It was also distributed by [[Family Home Entertainment]] on the video releases.

The company's fourth live-action series, ''[[T. and T.]]'', premiered in 1988 on Canada's [[Global (TV network)|Global]] network. The show's title duo was [[Mr. T]] of ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]'' fame, playing a former boxer named T.S. Turner, and Canadian actress [[Kristina Nicoll]] as an East Coast lawyer by the name of Terri Taler. Nelvana faced bankruptcy for the second time when the show's original American distributor was going out of business; in six weeks, they were saved when they found a replacement.&lt;ref name="sob"/&gt; Also that year, Nelvana established [[BearSpots]], a facility for producing television commercials that lasted until 1993.&lt;ref name="kidscreen"/&gt;

As the decade came to a close, the revived Nelvana had its next big success with [[Babar: The Movie|a movie]] and an [[HBO]] [[Babar (TV series)|television show]] based on [[Jean de Brunhoff]]'s ''Babar'' book series. This franchise, its first [[international co-production]], won many [[CableACE Award|ACE Awards]] in the United States and [[Gemini Award|Geminis]] in Canada. In September 1989, ABC began to air one of the company's products: [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|an animated series]] based on [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Beetlejuice]]''.

===1990s===
Following ''Babar''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s success, the studio acquired the rights to animated series based on [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', [[Maurice Sendak]]'s ''[[Little Bear (book)|Little Bear]]'', [[Joanna Cole (author)|Joanna Cole]]'s ''[[The Magic School Bus]]'' and the British comic strip ''[[Rupert Bear]]''. Nelvana had self-made successes of its own during the 1990s, such as ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'', ''[[Dog City]]'' (with [[Jim Henson Productions]]) and ''[[Ned's Newt]]''. Less successful was its animated series for children, [[Roseanne Barr]]'s ''[[Little Rosey]]'' &lt;!--NOTE: Roseanne did NOT provide the voice of Little Rosie but it is rumoured she might have had the series been renewed--&gt; for the [[American Broadcasting Company]], which was cancelled in 1991, after its first season.

In autumn 1993, Nelvana signed a multi-year project to produce five feature films for [[Paramount Pictures]], with [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] producing; the first two began production the following summer, at a cost of over US$20&amp;nbsp;million each.&lt;ref&gt;McRoberts, Kenneth (1995).

However, none of those films ever made it past the finishing stage. During the 1990s, another set of features from Nelvana was distributed by different companies. A 1993 live-action psychological thriller called ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]'' came out under the [[Columbia Pictures]] banner; 1997 saw the studio's retelling of ''[[Pippi Longstocking (1997 film)|Pippi Longstocking]]'' from [[Warner Bros.]]; and ''[[Babar: King of the Elephants]]'' was released in Canada by [[Alliance Atlantis]] in 1999. Among them, only ''Malice'' would go on to achieve box-office success in North America. Its US$46&amp;nbsp;million gross was the highest ever attained by a Nelvana production,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107497/business Box office data for ''Malice''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].

In 1993, Nelvana along with Galaxy Films and De Souza Productions produced ''[[Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (TV series)|Cadillacs and Dinosaurs]]'' for the CBS Network, based on the comic book of the same name (formally known as ''[[Xenozoic Tales]]'') by [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]]. It only lasted one season.

In September 1995, Nelvana produced ''Nancy Drew'' and ''The Hardy Boys'' based on the popular American book series. Tracy Ryan portrayed [[Nancy Drew]] while Colin Gray and Paul Popowich portrayed [[List of The Hardy Boys characters#Frank Hardy|Frank]] and [[List of The Hardy Boys characters#Joe Hardy|Joe]] Hardy, respectively. In addition, Jehene Erwin and Joy Tanner portrayed [[Bess Marvin]] and [[George Fayne]], respectively, on Nancy Drew, while Fiona Highet played new character Kate Craigen. The series were based off [[The Nancy Drew Files]] and [[List of Hardy Boys books#The Hardy Boys Casefiles|The Hardy Boys Casefiles]]. However, the series was not distributed well, mostly due to it being in first-run syndication, and both series were cancelled in December.

In September 1996, [[Golden Books Family Entertainment]] was in talks to acquire the company for US$102&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D9173CF935A1575AC0A960958260 Golden Books is Negotiating to Buy Nelvana].

Many of the company's staff members, including Smith and Loubert, expressed interest in the proposition. But Hirsh went up against it, arguing with then [[Chief Operating Officer|COO]] [[Eleanor Olmsted]] about its possible effects on his institution. Two months later Golden Books withdrew from the deal stating that they would concentrate more on children's entertainment.&lt;ref name="sob"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E7DF1338F936A35752C1A960958260 Golden Books Withdraws Offer for Nelvana.] (1995, November 5.)

In November 1996, [[Virgin Interactive]] released ''[[Toonstruck]]'', a [[Personal computer|PC]]-based [[adventure game]] featuring animation and artwork produced by Nelvana and Rainbow Animation. The game was set in an animated world using traditional 2D animation, but also featured the digitized likeness of actor [[Christopher Lloyd]] as a live-action character trapped in the animated world interacting with the cartoon characters around him. A sequel to the game was planned, but was cancelled due to poor sales.

In 1997, a small [[computer animation]] company called [[Windlight Studios]] was absorbed into Nelvana's assets. Its co-founder, [[Scott Dyer]], became Nelvana's senior vice-president in charge of production in late 2001.&lt;ref name=much_ado&gt;Maule, Christopher J. and Acheson, Archibald Lloyd Keith (2001).

It was based on the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s ''[[Bob's Birthday]]'', an [[Academy Award]] [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|winner for Best Short]], which Channel 4 also produced.&lt;ref name="much_ado"/&gt;

In December 1997, Nelvana began distributing a syndicated programming block, the Nelvana Kidz Klub, through MediaVentures International, a Chicago-based distributor.

In 2007, Nelvana acquired the rights to its fourth anime series, ''[[Bakugan Battle Brawlers]]''. The series was aired on [[Teletoon]] and became a quick success. In 2008, merchandising rights were sold by Nelvana to [[Cartoon Network]] in the US, and the series began airing on CN in February 2008.

===2010s===
''[[Detentionaire]]'' was released in 2011, with a new season airing on Teletoon about once a year. The show has also been aired internationally, including on [[ABC3]], and has been released on a digital platform provided by Cartoon Network.

On October 19, 2016, Nelvana re-branded their logo as part of Corus' brand change since the latter's acquisition of [[Shaw Media]].

==Franchises==
{{noref|section|date=July 2018}}
{{Main|List of Nelvana programs}}
Many of Nelvana's TV shows are based on properties from other companies, most of which started in other forms of media. A great deal of them are based on [[children's literature]] and [[comic book]]s; examples include ''[[Blazing Dragons]]'', ''[[Stickin' Around]]'', ''[[Wayside (TV series)|Wayside]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'', ''[[Anatole (TV series)|Anatole]]'', ''[[Babar (TV series)|Babar]]'', [[The Berenstain Bears (2003 TV series)|''The Berenstain Bears'' (2003 version)]], ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin the Turtle]]'', ''[[Jane and the Dragon (TV series)|Jane and the Dragon]]'', ''[[Little Bear (TV series)|Little Bear]]'', ''[[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|The Magic School Bus]]'', ''[[Pippi Longstocking (1997 TV series)|Pippi Longstocking]]'', ''[[Redwall (TV series)|Redwall]]'', ''[[Rupert (TV series)|Rupert]]'', ''[[My Dad the Rock Star]]'', and the shows of the ''[[PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch]]'' [[block programming|block]], as well as ''[[Tales from the Cryptkeeper|Tales From the Cryptkeeper]]'', ''[[Beetlejuice (TV series)|Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[Jacob Two-Two (TV series)|Jacob Two-Two]]'', ''[[Sidekick (TV series)|Sidekick]]'' and [[Nick Jr.]]'s ''[[Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends]]''.

Nelvana has also had considerable success with animated fare based on toys; American Greetings' ''Care Bears'' has been the most familiar example of this. Also, there have been series and specials based on ''Strawberry Shortcake'' (also from American Greetings), ''Madballs'' and ''My Pet Monster'' (from AmToy) and ''Rescue Heroes'' (from [[Fisher-Price]]). Nickelodeon had the company producing the sequel to ''[[The Fresh Beat Band]]'', which is called ''[[Fresh Beat Band of Spies]]''.

It has also translated big-screen franchises to televised properties, such as ''Star Wars'' (''Droids'' and ''Ewoks''), ''Beetlejuice'', ''[[An American Tail]]'' (''[[Fievel's American Tails]]''), ''[[Free Willy]]'' and ''[[The Neverending Story]]''. It has even ventured into the video game world with a show based on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] in ''[[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|Donkey Kong Country]]''.

In the field of anime, the company holds the North American rights to Clamp/[[Kodansha]]'s ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' series. Also, it holds international licensing rights to ''Beyblade'' and ''Medabots''.

As with many other animation studios, Nelvana has a wide range of established original series and characters within its roster. ''[[6teen]]'', ''[[Clone High]]'', ''[[Birdz]]'',  and ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'' among others, are some of Nelvana's cartoon series that were not based on any other source material.

{{As of|2008}}, the studio has made close to 25 feature films for theatrical, home entertainment, and television distribution. Well-known releases include ''Rock &amp; Rule'', the first five ''Care Bears'' movies, two ''Babar'' films and 1997's ''Pippi Longstocking''.

Live-action has been a part of its mainstay from its early years. The company has had ''Burglar'' and ''Malice'' as its own feature projects in that area, and has contributed as such to ''Star Wars Holiday Special'' and ''Three Amigos''. On television, Nelvana has made live-action shows such as ''[[The Edison Twins]]'', ''[[Nancy Drew (TV series)|Nancy Drew]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys (TV series)|The Hardy Boys]]'', and ''[[Life with Boys]]''.

On 29 April 2015 they launched a YouTube channel promoted by YTV as [[YTV_(TV_channel)#Related_businesses|Nelvana Retro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/blog/watch-nelvana-retro-now-0 |title=WATCH Nelvana Retro Now! |publisher=YTV |archive-date=16 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616225804/https://www.ytv.com/blog/watch-nelvana-retro-now-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was renamed "YTV Direct" in 2016 after also incorporating non-Nelvana content like Nickelodeon shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425072200/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChUxVeU8kKEjmXOJZJGZE4g |archive-date=25 April 2016 |title=YTV Direct |url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChUxVeU8kKEjmXOJZJGZE4g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable personnel==
Apart from its trio of founders, there have been several key personnel from Nelvana's past and present, a great deal of whom have left the company.

[[Lenora Hume]], from the company's early years, is the senior vice-president of [[DisneyToon Studios]].

==Influence in popular culture==
Nelvana had a planet named after it in the ''Star Wars'' series, on Cartoon Network's [[Star Wars expanded universe|expanded universe]] series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Clone Wars]]''. During Chapters 23 to 25, [[Anakin Skywalker]] travels to a planet called [[Nelvaanian|Nelvaan]]. ''Clone Wars'' also pays homage to the franchise's animation predecessors in the form of the planet's dog-like inhabitants, who resemble characters from ''Rock &amp; Rule'', the studio's first film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361243/trivia Trivia for ''Star Wars: Clone Wars''] at the Internet Movie Database.

The '''Northeast Coast Bantu languages''' are the [[Bantu languages]] spoken along the coast of [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]], and including inland Tanzania as far as [[Dodoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Derek Nurse &amp; Thomas Spear, 1985, ''The Swahili''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie's geographic classification]], they fall within Bantu zones G and E.

The languages, or clusters, are:

*'''Pare''' (G20+E70): [[Pare language|Pare]] (Asu), [[Taveta language|Taveta]]
*'''[[Sabaki languages|Sabaki]]''' (G40+E70): [[Swahili language|Swahili]], Nyika, ''etc.''

The Ruvu languages are 60–70% similar lexically.

[[Mbugu language|Mbugu]] (Ma'a) is a mixed language based largely on Pare.

'''Ogiek''' (also known as ''Okiek'' or ''Akiek''; pronounced {{IPA-xx|oɡiɛk|}}) is a [[Southern Nilotic languages|Southern Nilotic]] language cluster of the [[Kalenjin languages|Kalenjin]] family spoken or once spoken by the [[Ogiek]] peoples, scattered groups of hunter-gatherers in Southern [[Kenya]] and Northern [[Tanzania]]. Most if not all Ogiek speakers have assimilated to cultures of surrounding peoples: the Akiek in northern Tanzania now speak [[Maasai language|Maasai]] and the Akiek of Kinare, Kenya now speak [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]]. ''[[Dorobo|Ndorobo]]'' is a term considered derogatory, occasionally used to refer to various groups of hunter-gatherers in this area, including the Ogiek.

==Dialects==
There are three main Ogiek varieties that have been documented, though there are several dozen named local Ogiek groups: 
*''Kinare'', spoken around the Kenyan place Kinare on the eastern slope of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]]. The Kinare dialect is extinct, and Rottland (1982:24-25) reports that he found a few old men from Kinare in 1976, married with [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] women and integrated in the Kikuyu culture, whose parents had lived in the forests around Kinare as honey-gathering Ogiek. They called themselves /akié:k pa kínáre/, i.e. ''Ogiek of Kinare''.
*''Sogoo'' (or ''Sokóò''), spoken in the southern [[Mau Forest]] between the Amala and [[Ewas Ng'iro]] rivers (Heine 1973). The actual status of the Sogoo dialect is unclear. [[Bernd Heine]] included some Sogoo vocabulary in his 'Vokabulare ostafrikanischer Restsprachen' (1973). [[Franz Rottland]], following Heine's directions, came across a Sogoo settlement of ten round huts in 1977, and reported that he was told that there were several other Sogoo settlements in the immediate surroundings (Rottland 1982:25). The Sogoo speakers had contact with the Kipsikii, another Kalenjin people, and were able to point out lexical differences between their own language and [[Kipsigis language|Kipsigis]]. Ten years later, [[Gabriele Sommer]] (1992:389) classified the Sogoo dialect as being threatened by extinction. The Sogoo variety was recorded in an area where Kipchorng'wonek Okiek reside (Sogoo is the name of a settlement/center there). Extensive texts from naturally occurring conversation recorded in both Kipchorng'wonek communities and Kaplelach Okiek communities are available in the publications of Dr. Corinne A. Kratz.
*''Akiek'' (or ''Akie''), spoken in Tanzania in the southern part of [[Arusha]] region. Akiek is spoken by various little groups in the steppes south of Arusha, which is the territory of the [[Masaai people|Maasai]]. Akiek is probably dying out because many of its speakers have shifted to, or are shifting to, [[Maasai language]]. Maguire (1948:10) already reported a high level of bilinguality in Maasai, and remarked that "[t]he language of the ''Mósiro'' [an Akiek clan name] is dying, as any language except Masai tends to do in the Masai country." In the 1980s, however, Corinne Kratz and James Woodburn visited Akie groups in Tanzania during survey research and found that they were fully bilingual in Akie and Maasai.

==Biography==
Dilanchi's scientific, literary, social, and political articles have been published in publications such as [[:az:Yeni Müsavat (qəzet)|Yeni Musavat]], [[Kayhan|Keyhan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noormags.com/view/fa/articlepage/14809 کیهان فرهنگی » مهر 1367 - شماره 55]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:az:Azadlıq (qəzet)|Azadliq]], [[:az:525-ci qəzet|525-ci qezet]], [[:az:Ədəbiyyat qəzeti|Edebiyyat ve Incesenet]], [[Ettela'at|Ettelaat]] in [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

He was arrested and tortured for his views and for participating in left wing organizations by the Iranian government after the revolution. He fled to [[Azerbaijan SSR]] in 1990 to escape persecution.

Currently he is [[Canada|Canadian]] citizen &lt;ref&gt;http://www.piruzdilanchi.com/images/House%20of%20Commons%20Canada.gif&lt;/ref&gt; and lives in [[Vancouver]] [[British Columbia|BC]].

==Writing==
In 1991, he created a section in the newspaper "[[:az:Ədəbiyyat qəzeti|Literature and art]]" named "Literary Tabriz", which was included in every issue for a year. Later, at the initiative of Pirouz Dilanchi, a number of programs with names such as "Araz-South literature"” and "Shahriyar-South literature"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4njVhzHyYw4 Azerbaijan (AzTv Shahriyar Proqrami - Piruz Dilənçi)]&lt;/ref&gt; were shown on [http://www.aztv.az/ Azerbaijan State Television].

Piruz Dilenchi is a member of the [[Union of Azerbaijani Writers]]. Also his is writer of [http://www.piruzdilanchi.com/mahni.en.html nearly 100 songs].

==Politics==

Ali Ismayilfiruz

He is one of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130219060647/http://southazerbaijan.info/en/ South Azerbaijan National Liberation Movement]'s founders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/594537.stm The head of the National Liberation Movement of Southern Azerbaijan, Piruz Dilenchy...]&lt;/ref&gt; and the leader of this organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130110230606/http://www.gunaskam.com/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=140&amp;Itemid=44 The Islamic Republic and the Independence of the North - By: Dr. Nissman is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and the author of "The Soviet Union and Iranian Azerbaijan" (Westview, 1987).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecoi.net/local_link/180962/298257_de.html Liberation Army of Azerbaijan (Liberation Army of Southern Azerbaijan) (January 1998 - August 2001) believed to have been formed in 1993 in Iran [IRN37710.E] - IRB - Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

An idea of "Separation of Iran" belongs to Piruz Dilanchi which was brought to attention of the government officials in Azerbaijan by him. Because of his idea, Piruz Dilanchi became the most dangerous political figure for Iranian Government between 1994-2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azertimes.com/?page_id=56#SouthAz The Azer Times]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a victim of different attacks by Iranian Government since he became very popular and important political figure acting against Iran. Even once a special terrorist group from Iran attacked him midnight in his apartment in Baku trying to kill him. After the attack terrorist group were able to escape before [[Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan Intelligence]] Officers came to the place of incident along with Azerbaijan Police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2001/33-030901.html An unknown number of people broke into the Baku apartment of Piruz Dilanchi, leader of the irredentist National Liberation Movement of Southern Azerbaijan, on 22 August and tried to kill him, Turan reported. Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry arrested on 18 August six clerics residing in a district bordering Iran on suspicion of cooperating with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, Turan News Agency reported two days later. Moreover, Baku's former ambassador to Tehran, Aliyar Safarli, alleged that Iran is funding some Azerbaijani political parties and also paying off some government officials, "Yeni Musavat" reported on 2 August]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1342844.html IRANIAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN AZERBAIJAN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iranexpert.tripod.com/2001/azeri3september.htm IranExpert]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilanchi collected about 3000 signatures in 2000 and suggested his candidacy to the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|Azerbaijan Republic Parliament]] in order to participate in the next election. His candidacy was officially registered but was denied before the elections by pressure from the mafia responsible for elections. Central Elections Committee ignored the registered candidacy of Dilanchi, citing unfair and contradicting pretexts.

==Kidnapping==
Dilanchi was kidnapped by an unknown group in front of his house on 5 December 2002. As a result of pressure, the media kept his location secret for 21 days, however, the Press Secretary of the Internal Affairs Ministry declared that he was in jail. After being kept some weeks in the cold underground in inhumane conditions, P. Dilanchi was sent to Shuvalan prison. After 38 days in prison, having been arrested without reason, he was allowed to be transferred to house arrest. After three months, he was freed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Release_the_Pirouz_Dilenchi.jpg The decision of the Ministry of Justice to release the Pirouz Dilenchi]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415192302/http://sanlm.org/Archive/14_January_2003-Sherq-Piruz_Dilanchi.jpg "East News" 14 January 2003: About Piruz Dilanchi's Kidnapping]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanlm.org/Archive/15_February_2003_Xalq-Cebhesi_Piruz-Dilanchi.jpg "Popular Front News" 15 February 2003: About Piruz Dilanchi's Kidnapping] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081435/http://sanlm.org/Archive/15_February_2003_Xalq-Cebhesi_Piruz-Dilanchi.jpg |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanlm.org/Archive/18_January_2003-Yeni_Musavat-Baku.jpg "Yeni Musavat Newspaper" 18 January 2003: About Piruz Dilanchi's Kidnapping] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090730/http://sanlm.org/Archive/18_January_2003-Yeni_Musavat-Baku.jpg |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Placemaking''' is a multi-faceted approach to the [[urban planning|planning]], design and management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people's health, happiness, and well being. It is political due to the nature of [[place identity]]. Placemaking is both a process and a philosophy that makes use of urban design principles. It can be either official and government led, or community driven grass roots [[tactical urbanism]], such as extending sidewalks with chalk, paint, and planters, or open streets events such as [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]'s [[Ciclovía]]. Good placemaking makes use of underutilized space to enhance the urban experience at the pedestrian scale.

==History==

[[File:Jane Jacobs.jpg|thumb|Mrs. [[Jane Jacobs]], chairman of the Comm. to save the [[West Village]] holds up documentary evidence at press conference at Lions Head Restaurant at Hudson &amp; Charles Sts.]]
The concepts behind placemaking originated in the 1960s, when writers like [[Jane Jacobs]] and [[William H. Whyte]] offered groundbreaking ideas about designing cities that catered to people, not just to cars and shopping centers. Their work focused on the importance of lively neighborhoods and inviting public spaces. Jacobs advocated citizen ownership of streets through the now-famous idea of "eyes on the street." Whyte emphasized essential elements for creating social life in public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pps.org/articles/what_is_placemaking/ |title=What is Placemaking? &amp;#124; Project for Public Spaces |publisher=Pps.org |date=2009-12-31 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term came into use in the 1970s by [[landscape architect]]s, [[architect]]s and [[urban planner]]s to describe the process of creating squares, plazas, parks, streets and waterfronts that will attract people because they are pleasurable or interesting. Landscape often plays an important role in the design process.  The term encourages disciplines involved in designing the built environment to work together in pursuit of qualities that they each alone are unable to achieve.

Bernard Hunt, of HTA Architects noted that: "We have theories, specialisms, regulations, exhortations, demonstration projects. We have planners. We have highway engineers. We have mixed use, mixed tenure, architecture, community architecture, urban design, neighbourhood strategy.  But what seems to have happened is that we have simply lost the art of placemaking; or, put another way, we have lost the simple art of placemaking. We are good at putting up buildings but we are bad at making places."

Jan Gehl has said "First life, then spaces, then buildings – the other way around never works"; and "In a Society becoming steadily more privatized with private homes, cars, computers, offices and shopping centers, the public component of our lives is disappearing. It is more and more important to make the cities inviting, so we can meet our fellow citizens face to face and experience directly through our senses. Public life in good quality public spaces is an important part of a democratic life and a full life."&lt;ref&gt;/http://www.pps.org/reference/jgehl/&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings of poet [[Wendell Berry]] have contributed to an imaginative grasp of place and placemaking, particularly with reference to local ecology and local economy. He writes that, "If what we see and experience, if our country, does not become real in imagination, then it never can become real to us, and we are forever divided from it... Imagination is a particularizing and a local force, native to the ground underfoot."

== Principles ==
According to [[Project for Public Spaces]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pps.org/reference/11steps/|title=Eleven Principles for Creating Great Community Places - Project for Public Spaces|work=Project for Public Spaces|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; successful placemaking is based on eleven basic principles:

=== The Community Knows Best ===

An important aspect of placemaking is taking into account inputs of the people who will be using the public space most.  That is, to say, the community for which the public space is intended.  This is important because members of the community are likely to have useful insights into how the space does - or should - function, as well as a historical perspective of the area, and an understanding of what does and does not matter to other members of the community.[[File:Hallstatt Austria Town Market.jpg|thumb|415x415px|A plaza in Halstatt Austria with an activated public realm.]]

=== Places, Not Designs ===

Placemaking is not just about designing a park of plaza with efficient pedestrian circulation.  It involves taking into account the interrelations between surrounding retailers, vendors, amenities provided, and activities taking place in the space, then fine-tuning the space with landscape changes, additions of seating, etc., to make all of those elements mesh.  The end result should be a cohesive unit that creates greater value for the community than just the sum of its parts.

=== Placemaking is a Group Effort ===

Partners for political, financial, and intellectual backing are crucial to getting a public space improvement project off the ground.  These partners can range from individuals, to private or municipal institutions, to museums, to schools.

=== Make and Act on Observations ===

By observing how a public space is used, it is possible to gain an understanding of what the community does and does not like about it.  This understanding can be used to assess what activities and amenities may be missing from the space.  Even after a public space has been built, observation is key to properly managing it, and evolving it to better suit the community's needs over time.

=== Requires a Vision ===

As with many other types of project, a placemaking project needs a vision to succeed.  This vision should not be the grand design of a single person, but the aggregate conception of the entire community.

=== Requires Patience ===

A placemaking project does not happen overnight.  Do not be discouraged if things do not go exactly as planned at first, or if progress seems slow.

=== Triangulate ===
[[File:La Candelaria, Bogota.jpg|thumb|451x451px|Triangulation is represented between a mural, cafe, and [[Street vending|street vendor]] in Plazoleta del Chorro de Quevedo, located in [[La Candelaria]], [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. ]]
Triangulation, simply put, is the strategic placement of amenities, such that they encourage social interaction, and are used more frequently.  For example, "if a children's reading room in a new library is located so that it is next to a children's playground in a park and a food kiosk is added, more activity will occur than if these facilities were located separately." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Ignore Naysayers ===
Just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be done.  What it does mean is that there are few people, in either the private or public sectors, who have the job of creating places.

=== Form Supports Function ===
A public space's form factor should be formulated with its intended function(s) in mind.

=== Money Should Not Be an Issue ===
If networking and team building have been executed correctly, public sentiment towards the project should be positive enough to overlook its monetary cost.

=== Placemaking is an Ongoing Process ===
Placemaking is never "done".  Minor tweaks can be made to improve the space's usefulness to its community over time, and regular maintenance/upkeep of facilities and amenities is a fact of life.

== Healthy Placemaking - The Link Between ''Place'' and ''Health'' ==
Both the opportunities available to individuals and the choices made based on those opportunities impact individual, family, and community health. The World Health Organization's definition of health&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title=Health Promotion Glossary|last=|first=|date=1998|website=Health Promotion Glossary|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an appropriate, broad-reaching understanding of health as a "resource for everyday life, not the object of living" and an important frame for discussing the interconnections between ''Place'' and ''Health''.  A 2016 report '''''[https://www.pps.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Healthy-Places-PPS.pdf The Case for Healthy Places],''''' from [[Project for Public Spaces]] and the '''''[https://centerforactivedesign.org/assemblyprojectorientation Assembly Project,]''''' funded by the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] and focusing on research related to Shaping Space for Civic Life both offer insight into the current evidence base showing how health and wellbeing are impacted by where you live and the opportunities available to you.

== The Arts and Creative Placemaking ==
While the arts and creative expression play a substantial part in establishing a sense of place, economic growth and production must also play an equally large role in creating a successful place. These two factors are not mutually exclusive, as the arts and cultural economic activity made up $729.6 billion (or 4.2%) of the United States GDP in 2014, and employed 4.7 million workers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/regional/arts-and-culture/index.cfm|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|last=Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|website=www.bea.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the arts can be deployed as a powerful tool in the creation or rehabilitation of urban spaces.

Jamie Bennett, executive director of ArtPlace America, has identified the following four tools used by communities while implementing creative placemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Jamie|date=2014|title=Creative Placemaking|url=https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/cdir-10-02-final.pdf|journal=Community Development INVESTMENT REVIEW|volume= 10| issue = 2, 2014|pages=77–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Anchoring:''' When a key arts institution, organization, or building in the area prompts additional foot traffic or regional draw. These anchors can attract additional business, and become a strong source of identity for the neighborhood.
* '''Activating:''' When visual or performing arts are brought into the public realm, it activates the space while creating interest, activity, and engagement. More people and eyes on the street drives curiosity to explore and establishes a sense of safety.
* '''Fixing:''' Taking vacant, underutilized, or blighted spaces in a neighborhood and treating them as an opportunity for new art and design projects. This can change how people think about these spaces and the opportunities that they represent.
* '''Planning''' By using the arts and creative community meeting strategies, stakeholder enthusiasm can be bolstered, resulting in valuable input for community design. Bringing artists into the planning process can upend the familiar and allow participants to mentally "unhook" from their preconceived notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Jonathan|date=2011|title="Strange Spaces: A Rationale for Bringing Art and Artists into the Planning Process."|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1473095210389653|journal=Planning Theory|volume= 10| issue =  3, 2011|pages= 213–238|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Attachment ==
Great places must do more than meet the basic requirements if they want to foster greater community attachment. A strong sense of attachment can result in residents who are more committed to the growth and success of their community. The [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] conducted a study measuring community attachment, and found that there 
[[File:ChicagoNow chalk-blog (3822844217).jpg|left|thumb|Community placemaking on the streets of Chicago.|199x199px]]was very little variation in the primary drivers of attachment rates when compared between different cities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knightfoundation.org/sotc/overall-findings/|title=Overall Findings - Knight Foundation|website=Knight Foundation|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drivers of Attachment ===

* '''Social Offerings''' - Gathering places that foster face-to-face interactions, building trust with others, and an environment where people care for one another. This includes perceptions of a healthy nightlife, an arts and cultural scene, and community events.
* '''Openness''' - How inclusive the community is to a wide range of people and lifestyles. Openness is measured by perception that the place is good for old people, racial and ethnic minorities, families and children, gays and lesbians, college grads looking for work, immigrants, and young adults without children.
* '''Aesthetics''' - The physical beauty of the place. Mostly focusing on the availability of open green space, parks, playgrounds, and recreational trails.

=== Attachment Trends ===

* '''Geography:''' The attachment rates are similar between residents who live within the city, and those who live outside of the city.
* '''Age:''' Older residents (65+) have higher rates of attachment, on average, than younger residents.
* '''Community Tenure:''' Newer residents were the least attached, and those who had lived in the community for 3–5 years were the most attached.
* '''Income:''' Higher income resulted in higher attachment rates, with those households making $75,000 per year or more being the most attached.
* '''Race and Ethnicity:''' Hispanic and non-hispanic white residents had similar levels of attachment, while black residents averaged lower levels of attachment.

== Livable Streetscapes ==
[[File:Incremental Development 300 TP.jpg|thumb|479x479px|A diagram displaying an artists rendering of different examples of placemaking that [[architect]]s and [[Urban planner|planners]] use to enhance pedestrian experiences.]]Streets are the stage for activity of everyday life within a city and they have the most potential to be designed to harness a high-quality sense of place. Effective placemaking in the [[street]]scape lends special attention to the streets livability by representing a sense of security, [[sense of place]], visible employment, variety of transportation options, meaningful interactions between residents, "eyes on the street" as well as "[[social capital]]".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The death and life of great American cities|last=Jacobs|first=Jane|publisher=Random House|year=1961|isbn=0394421590|location=New York|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Chester|last2=Aultman-Hall|first2=Lisa|date=2015-08-20|title=Measuring Urban Streetscapes for Livability: A Review of Approaches|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2015.1065546|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=68|issue=1|pages=149–158|doi=10.1080/00330124.2015.1065546|issn=0033-0124}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these interactions take place at the ''mesoscale''. Mesoscale is described as the city level of observation between ''macroscale''—being birdseye view—and ''microscale--''being textures and individual elements of the streetscape (streetlamp type, building textures, etc.); in other words, mesoscale is the area observable from a humans eyes, for example: between buildings, including storefronts, sidewalks, street trees, and people. Placemaking for a street takes place at both mesoscale and microscale. To be effective placemakers, it is important that planners, architects, and engineers consider designing in the mesoscale when designing for places that are intended to be livable by [[William H. Whyte|Whyte]]'s standards.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Social Media and Placemaking ==

As society changes to accommodate new technologies, [[urban planner]]s and citizens alike are looking to consult those technologies to enact physical change. One thing that has had a massive impact on western society is the advent of digital technologies, like [[social media]]. Urban decision makers are increasingly looking to plan cities based on feedback from [[Outreach|community engagement]] so as to ensure the development of a durable, livable place. With the invention of niche social technologies, communities have shifted their engagement away from [[Local government|local-government]]-led forums and platforms, to social media groups on websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Nextdoor]] to voice concerns, critiques and desires.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houghton|first=et al|date=2015|title=Urban Acupuncture: Hybrid Social and Technological Practices for Hyperlocal Placemaking|url=|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|volume=22|pages=3–19|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense, these new platforms have become a [[Third place|Third Place]], in reference to [[Ray Oldenburg]]’s term.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41256327|title=The great good place : cafés, coffee shops, bookstores, bars, hair salons, and other hangouts at the heart of a community|last=Ray.|first=Oldenburg,|date=1999|publisher=Marlowe|isbn=1569246815|location=New York|oclc=41256327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Social media tools such as these show promise for the future of placemaking in that they are being used to reclaim, reinvigorate and activate spaces. These online neighborhood and event-centric groups and [[Internet forum|forums]] provide a convenient non-physical space for [[public discourse]] and discussion through digital networked interactions to implement change on a [[Hyperlocal|hyper-local]] level; this theory is sometimes referred to as [[Urban acupuncture|Urban Acupuncture]]. This type of shift towards a more [[Crowdsourcing|crowd-sourced]] planning method can lead to the creation of more relevant and useful and inclusive places with greater sense of place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">'''''Reconcilee''''' is a [[neologism]] for the [[Czech language|Czech]] word "''upravenec''" (pl. "''upravenci''") which denotes an ''[[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|émigré]]'' from [[Communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] who subsequently "reconciled" his or her relationship with the Communist régime.

== The origins ==
From 1948 until the end of the régime, unauthorized [[Human migration|migration]] from Czechoslovakia was a [[crime]]. Between 1945 and 1987 172,659 people went into [[exile]]. After the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Helsinki Accords]], the Communist establishment wished to show some kind of mitigation of the thus far harsh attitude towards ''émigrés''. Directive No. 4/1977 [[Official Journal (Czech Socialist Republic)|Official Journal]] of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]], ''On Reconciliation Legal Relationships of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to Citizens Who Stay Abroad Without a Permit of Czechoslovak Authorities'', was adopted. Hence the term "''upravenec''".

== Categories ==
In 1980 there were 115,000 ''émigrés''. Directives stipulated two categories of reconcilees:
# those who wished to stay permanently abroad as [[citizen]]s of Czechoslovakia (art. 3–5; 3,145 persons applied), or
# those who wished cessation of citizenship of Czechoslovakia (art. 6–8; 4,533 applied).
A prerequisite to receive a status of ''upravenec'' was an application for a pardon of conviction for illegal emigration (12,486 applied) or being amnestied. Applicants had to pay large sums (officially the cost of education) and after reconciliation were allowed to visit Communist Czechoslovakia with no obstacles.

Those who wished to [[Repatriation|return]] to Czechoslovakia (art. 2 — first category; 452 persons applied) were called "''navrátilci''" (''returnees''). Directives also identified a further category of ''émigrés'' — [[enemy of the state|enemies of the Communist régime]] (art. 9–12). These were deprived of Czechoslovak citizenship and prohibited from visiting Czechoslovakia. (They thus could not be ranked among returnees or reconcilees.)

== Controversy ==
The unsuspendable condition for reconciliation was "good or neutral relationship" towards the Communist régime. ''Upravenci'' were therefore disliked by much of the rest of the exile community and called collaborators. Most reconcilees hid their reconciliation, and speculative accusation of being a ''upravenec'' was considered a slur. The famous Czech author [[Josef Škvorecký]] wrote [[satire|satiric]] short stories about them. Hard-line ''émigrés'' speculated that ''upravenci'' were confidants of the Communist [[secret police]].

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
'''Redshirt''', in United States [[college athletics]], is a delay or suspension of an athlete's participation to lengthen his or her period of eligibility. Typically, a student's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons, like the four years of academic classes typically required to earn a [[bachelor's degree]] at an American college or university.  However, in a '''redshirt year''', [[student athlete]]s may attend classes at the college or university, practice with an athletic team, and “suit up” (wear a team uniform) for play – but they may compete in only a limited number of games, (see "[[#Use of status|Use of status]]" section). Using this mechanism, a student athlete has at most five academic years to use the four years of eligibility, thus becoming what is termed a [[Super senior|fifth-year senior]].

The origin of the term ''redshirt'' was likely from [[Warren Alfson]] of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] who, in 1937, asked to practice but not play and wore a Nebraska red shirt without a number. The term is used as a [[verb]], [[noun]], and [[adjective]]. For example, a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt, and a redshirt [[freshman]] refers to an athlete in the first year of participation, after a redshirt non-participatory year.

== Reasons==
{{original research|section|date=August 2018}}
Student athletes become redshirts for many reasons. One example is that the student athlete may not be ready to balance the demands of both academic and athletic requirements. Redshirting provides the opportunity, with tutoring, to take some classes and become accustomed to the academic rigors demanded of them. They may also redshirt to undergo a year of practice with a team prior to participating in competition. In American [[college football]], a student athlete may redshirt to work towards increasing size, strength, and stamina; all desirable assets for many positions, as the current and post-redshirt years coincide with the final phases of physical maturity. Players may also redshirt to learn the team playbook, as many college teams run more complex formations and executions in comparison to high school teams.

Athletes may be asked to redshirt if they would have little or no opportunity to play as an academic freshman. This is a common occurrence in many sports where there is already an established upperclassman player in a position, or too much depth at the position the freshman in question plans to play. The coaching staff may also want to use the player as a starter later in his or her career so that they may play for the full four years instead of three.

A special case involves the eligibility of a player who loses the majority of a season to injury, known as a '''medical redshirt'''. A '''hardship waiver''' may be granted to those athletes who sustain a major injury while appearing in less than 30% of team competitions, nor can they have participated after the midpoint of a season. For the purposes of eligibility, players granted such a [[waiver]] are treated as though they did not compete in that season.

On rare occasions, players may be allowed to play in their sixth year of college if they suffered a serious injury that kept them from competing for more than one season. Former [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] [[quarterback]] [[Jason White (American football)|Jason White]] is perhaps the best known example of this; White had redshirted his first year, then subsequently [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tore]] the [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in both knees, forcing him to miss nearly two years of eligible play time. Another recent example is former [[Houston Cougars football|Houston Cougars]] quarterback [[Case Keenum]]; Keenum redshirted his freshman year of 2006, and subsequently tore an ACL three games into the 2010 season, which would have otherwise been his final year of eligibility.

==Terminology==
The term '''redshirt freshman''' indicates an academic [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] who is in his or her first season of athletic participation. A redshirt freshman is distinguished from a true [[Freshman#United States|freshman]]: a student who is in their first year both academically and athletically. A redshirt freshman may have practiced with the team during the prior season. The term '''redshirt sophomore''' is also commonly used to indicate an academic [[Junior (education)|junior]] who is in the second season of athletic participation. After the second athletic year, the term redshirt is rarely used; the terms '''fourth-year junior''' and '''fifth-year [[Senior (education)|senior]]''' are used instead.

In 2016, a new status could be applied to prospective student athletes, dubbed an '''academic redshirt'''. That year, the NCAA started enforcing new, stricter admissions requirements for incoming athletic freshmen. Under these new requirements, a student athlete who meets a school’s own academic admission requirements yet does not meet the NCAA requirement of a 2.3 GPA across four years, may enter school as an academic redshirt.  This student can receive an athletic scholarship and practice with the team, but may not participate in competition.  An academic redshirt does not lose a year of eligibility, and may later take an injury redshirt if needed. Finally, academic redshirts must complete nine academic credit hours in their first semester and may then compete in their second year, free of restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/7885522/new-incoming-eligibility-standards-create-term |title=New eligibility standards on the way: Toughest initial requirements ever enacted start with Class of 2016 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other colors==
Athletes may also use a "grayshirt" year in which they attend school, but cannot enroll as a full-time student, and do not receive a scholarship for that year.  This means that they are an unofficial member of the team and do not participate in practices, games, or receive [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial assistance]] from their athletic department. Typically, grayshirts are players who are injured right before college and require an entire year to recuperate.  Rather than waste the redshirt, the player can attend school as a part-time regular student and join the team later.  This is also used by players with religious or military obligations that keep them out of school for a full academic year.

"Blueshirt" athletes are those that the [[NCAA]] does not classify as a "recruited student-athlete". They have never made an official visit to the school, met with the school's athletic employees or had more than one phone call with them, or received a scholarship offer. Such athletes are [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]]s, but can receive scholarships after enrolling; although they are immediately eligible to play, their scholarships count for the school's quota in the following year. The [[New Mexico State Aggies football]] program was the first to blueshirt in the early 2000s; other football programs include [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]].&lt;ref name="mizell20140215"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-state-football-how-deionte-noel-went-from-texas-tech-commitment-to-osu-blueshirt/article/3934197/ | title=How Deionte Noel went from Texas Tech commitment to OSU 'blueshirt' | work=The Oklahoman | date=February 15, 2014 | accessdate=February 16, 2014 | author=Mizell, Gina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of status==

While the redshirt status may be conferred by a coach at the beginning of the year, it is not confirmed until the end of the season, and more specifically, it does not rule a player ineligible in advance to participate in the season. If a player shows great talent, or there are injuries on the team, the coach may remove the redshirt status and allow the player to participate in competition for the remainder of the year.

The first athlete known to extend his eligibility in the modern era of redshirting was [[Warren Alfson]] of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite news|title=Warren Alfson|url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=944901|accessdate=February 4, 2016|publisher=huskers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfson requested that he be allowed to sit out his sophomore season due to the number of experienced players ahead of him. In addition, he had not started college until several years after graduating from high school, and thus felt he needed more preparation.  The year off greatly benefited him; Alfson was All-[[Big Eight Conference|Big Six Conference]] in 1939 and an [[All-American]] [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]] in 1940.

In January 2017, the trade association for college football coaches, the [[American Football Coaches Association]], proposed a change to that sport's eligibility rules that maintains the current model of four years of play in five years, but significantly changes the redshirt rule. Under the proposal, medical redshirts would be eliminated, but redshirt status would not be lost unless a player participated in more than four games in a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/new-redshirt-proposal-would-allow-athletes-to-play-four-games-regardless-of-injury/ |title=New redshirt proposal would allow athletes to play four games, regardless of injury |first1=Ben |last1=Kercheval |first2=Dennis |last2=Dodd |website=[[CBSSports.com]] |date=January 11, 2017 |accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, which was unanimously passed by the AFCA subcommittees for all three NCAA divisions,&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/2017/12/30/college-football-can-benefit-revised-redshirt-rule-tim-sullivan/987732001/ |title=College football can benefit from a revised redshirt rule |first=Tim |last=Sullivan |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]] |date=December 31, 2017 |accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was approved by the NCAA Division I Council in June 2018, taking effect with the 2018 college football season.&lt;ref name=Dellenger&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2018/06/13/ncaa-redshirt-rule-change-eligibility-reaction |title=The NCAA's Redshirt Rule Change Is a Major Win for Both Coaches and Players |first=Ross |last=Dellenger |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=June 13, 2018 |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original proposal was to have been retroactive, meaning that players with athletic eligibility remaining who had played in four or fewer games in a given season would have effectively received one extra season of eligibility,&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt; but the final passed proposal was not retroactive.&lt;ref name=Dellenger/&gt;

== In professional sports ==
Unofficially, redshirting in professional sports is mostly for medical reasons, mostly done for delaying their debuts. [[Blake Griffin]] won the Rookie of the Year in his second year because his first year was written off with injuries, but had he not declared for the draft, he would have been a college junior. [[Larry Bird]] opted to declare for the draft early in 1978, but decided to stay in college for one year to finish his senior year. [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] was redshirted for two years due to military requirements. [[Jerry Lucas]], however, effectively held out due to contract disputes. All four went on to win Rookie of the Year in their first years of eligibility for the award. In the NFL, quarterbacks cannot be officially redshirted because they are unused backups that never started in their rookie year. It is the same case with other positions, while players can become 'redshirt rookies' for injury reasons, they are not eligible for rookie of the year/month/week honors.

==Etymology==
According to ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' and ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]'', the term ''redshirt'' comes from the red [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] commonly worn by such a player in practice [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]s against the regulars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of REDSHIRT|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redshirt|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is spoken in parts of southern [[Ethiopia]] by the [[Sidama people]], particularly in the densely populated [[Sidama state]]. Sidaamu Afoo is the ethnic [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] for the language, while Sidaminya is its name in [[Amharic language|Amharic]]. Although it is not known to have any specific dialects, it shares over 64% lexical similarity with [[Alaba-K’abeena language|Alaba-K'abeena]], 62% with [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]], and 53% with [[Hadiyya language|Hadiyya]], all of which are other languages spoken in southwestern Ethiopia. The word order is typically SOV. Sidaama has over 100,000 [[Second language|L2]] speakers. The literacy rate for [[First language|L1]] speakers is 1%-5%, while for L2 speakers it is 20%. In terms of its writing, Sidaama used an Ethiopic script up until 1993, from which point forward it has used a Latin script.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Sidamo'' has also been used by some authors to refer to larger groupings of East Cushitic and even [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Trudy, Noelle Watson, and Paul Schellinger. [https://books.google.com/books?id=R44VRnNCzAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "International Dictionary of Historic Places: Middle East and Africa, Volume 4."] 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The languages within this Sidamo grouping contain similar, alternating phonological features.&lt;ref&gt;Leslau, Wolf. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/596302 "Sidamo Features in the South Ethiopic Phonology."] "Journal of the American Oriental Society," 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The results from a research study conducted in 1968-1969 concerning mutual intelligibility between different Sidamo languages suggest that Sidaama is more closely related to the [[Gedeo language]], which it shares a border with to the south, than other Sidamo languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bender, Marvin L. and Robert L. Cooper. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002438417190074X "Mutual Intelligibility Within Sidamo."] 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Ethnologue'', the two languages share a lexical similarity of 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sidaama vocabulary has been influenced by [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and [[Amharic language|Amharic]], and has in turn influenced [[Oromo language|Oromo]] vocabulary.

== Grammar ==

=== Noun Phrases ===
In Sidaama, not all [[noun phrase]]s have [[noun]]s. This can occur when it is so obvious what kind of thing the [[referent]] of the noun phrase is, that it is unnecessary for the speaker to mention it. Sidaama has two types of noun phrases without nouns. One type is made up only of an [[adjective]] or a [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]], where the adjective or the numeral agrees in case, number, and gender with the referent of a noun phrase. This is shown in the examples below:
 	
:''busul-u'' ''da-ø-ino.''

:smart-&lt;small&gt;NOM.M&lt;/small&gt; come-&lt;small&gt;3SG.M-PERF.3&lt;/small&gt;

:‘The smart one (masculine) came.’

:''sas-u'' ''da-ø-ino''

:three-&lt;small&gt;NOM.M&lt;/small&gt; come-&lt;small&gt;3SG.M-PERF.3&lt;/small&gt;

:‘The three (masculine) came.’

The other type of noun phrase without a noun is formed with a noun-phrase [[clitic]], or &lt;small&gt;NPC&lt;/small&gt;. This &lt;small&gt;NPC&lt;/small&gt; starts with ''t'' (&lt;small&gt;FEM&lt;/small&gt;) or ''h'' (&lt;small&gt;MASC&lt;/small&gt;). This is thought to originate from the Afro-Asiatic [[demonstrative]] containing ''t'' (&lt;small&gt;FEM&lt;/small&gt;) or ''k'' (&lt;small&gt;MASC&lt;/small&gt;). The Sidaama &lt;small&gt;NPC&lt;/small&gt; appears in various forms. Which form is used then depends on the gender of the referent of the noun phrase, and the syntactic role or case of the noun phrase. When a noun phrase without a noun is formed with an &lt;small&gt;NPC&lt;/small&gt;, both the speaker and the listener know its referent. In this case, the &lt;small&gt;NPC&lt;/small&gt; attaches to the end of a [[Genitive case|genitive]] noun phrase or relative clause to form a noun phrase without a noun. This is shown in the examples below:

:''isí=ti'' ''ba’-’-ino.''

:&lt;small&gt;3SG.M.GEN=NPC.F.NOM&lt;/small&gt; disappear-&lt;small&gt;3SG.F-PERF.3&lt;/small&gt;

:‘His (&lt;small&gt;FEM&lt;/small&gt;) disappeared.’

:''ani ku’uí beett-í=ta seekk-o-mm-o.''

:&lt;small&gt;1SG.NOM&lt;/small&gt; that.&lt;small&gt;M.GEN&lt;/small&gt; child-&lt;small&gt;GEN.M.MOD=NPC.F.ACC&lt;/small&gt; repair-&lt;small&gt;PERF.1-1SG-M&lt;/small&gt;

:‘I (&lt;small&gt;MASC&lt;/small&gt;) repaired that boy’s (&lt;small&gt;FEM&lt;/small&gt;).’&lt;ref&gt;Kawachi, Kazuhiro. [http://www.lacus.org/volumes/index.php?volume=36 "Noun Phrases Without Nouns in Sidaama (Sidamo)."] 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Michelangelo Caravaggio 026.jpg|thumb|[[Caravaggio]]'s ''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'' (1594–96)]]

'''Sight-reading''', also called '''''a prima vista''''' (Italian meaning "at first sight"), is the [[reading (activity)|reading]] and performing of a piece of [[music]] or song in [[music notation]] that the performer has not seen before. '''Sight-singing''' is used to describe a singer who is sight-reading. Both activities require the musician to play or sing the notated rhythms and pitches. Many believe that sight-singing is the more challenging of the two, because singers do not have any keys, frets or valves (on keyboard instruments, guitars, and valved brass instruments, respectively) to help them obtain the correct pitches. Singers must also read and sing the correct lyrics, which adds another layer beyond pitch and dynamics. However, difficulty is related both to the instrument and the difficulty of the piece itself. For instance, sight-reading on a polyphonic instrument, such as the classical guitar, can be more challenging due to the fact that the guitarist has to read polyrhythms and polyphonic passages that can often be played in different positions using different frets.

==Terminology==

===Sight-reading===
People in music literature commonly use the term "sight-reading" generically for "the ability to read and produce both instrumental and vocal music at first sight […] the conversion of musical information from sight to sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Udtaisuk|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udtaisuk and some other authors prefer the use of the more specific terms "sight-playing" and "sight-singing" where applicable. This differentiation leaves a third, more restricted use of the term "sight-reading" for the silent reading of music without creating sound by instrument or voice.

Highly skilled musicians can sight-read ''silently''; that is, they can look at the printed music and hear it in their heads without playing or singing (see [[audiation]]).&lt;ref&gt;True sight-reading or sight-singing—not code-deciphering—is actually ''notational'' audiation.&lt;/ref&gt; Less able sight-readers generally must at least hum or whistle in order to sight-read effectively. This distinction is analogous to ordinary prose reading in [[late antiquity]], when the ability to read silently was notable enough for St. [[Augustine]] to comment on it. &lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manguel|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''a prima vista'' is also used, as Italian words and phrases are commonly used in music and music notation. To play a musical piece ''a prima vista'' means to play it 'at first sight'. According to Payne, "the ability to hear the notes on the page is clearly akin to music reading and should be considered a prerequisite for effective performance.... Egregious errors can occur when a student, analyzing a piece of music, makes no effort to play or hear the composition but mechanically processes the notes on the page".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Payne|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to sight-read is important for all musicians, even amateur performers, but with professional [[orchestra]] musicians and [[session musicians]], it is an essential professional skill. Some professional orchestras require sight-reading as part of an audition.

===Sight transposition===
{{main|Sight transposition}}
Some musicians can [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] music during performance to suit particular instruments or vocal ranges, to make the playing of the instrument(s) or singing easier, or a number of other uses.

===Sight-playing===
According to Udtaisuk, "many [authors] use the term sight-playing for instrumental sight-reading performance." However, Udtaisuk and some other authors use the more descriptive term "sightplaying" (or "sight-playing") for instrumental sight-reading, because sight-playing combines two unique skill sets: music reading and music making.

===Sight-singing===
Some authors, according to Udtaisuk, use the term "sight-singing" for vocal sight-reading. As with sight-playing, Udtaisuk advocates and uses the more descriptive term "sightsinging" for vocal sight-reading because sight-singing combines sight-reading and singing skills.

==Psychology==
The ability to sight-read partly depends on a strong [[Short-term memory|short-term musical memory]]. An experiment on sight reading using an [[eye tracker]] indicates that highly skilled musicians tend to look ahead further in the music, storing and processing the notes until they are played; this is referred to as the [[eye–hand span]].

Storage of notational information in working memory can be expressed in terms of the amount of information (load) and the time for which it must be held before being played (latency). The relationship between load and latency changes according to tempo, such that t = x/y, where t is the change in tempo, x is the change in load, and y is the change in latency. Some teachers and researchers have proposed that the eye–hand span can be trained to be larger than it would otherwise be under normal conditions, leading to more robust sight-reading ability.

[[Human memory]] can be divided into three broad categories: long-term memory, sensory memory, and short-term (working) memory. According to the formal definition, working memory is "a system for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension." The paramount feature that distinguishes the working memory from both the long-term and sensory memory is this system's ability to simultaneously process and store information. The knowledge has what is called a
"limited capacity", so there is only a certain amount of information that can be stored and it is easily accessible for only a small window of time after it has been processed, with a recall time block of roughly fifteen seconds to one minute.

Experiments dealing with memory span have been conducted by [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] in 1956 that indicated, "Most common number of items that can be stored in the working memory is five plus or minus two.” However, if this information is not retained and stored (“consolidated”) in one's long-term memory, it will fade quickly.

Research indicates that the main area of the brain associated with the working memory is the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The prefrontal cortex is located in the frontal lobe of the brain. This area deals with cognition and contains two major neural loops or pathways that are central to processing tasks via the working memory: the visual loop, which is necessary for the visual component of the task, and the phonological loop, which deals with the linguistic aspects of the task (i.e. repeating the word or phrase). Although the [[hippocampus]], in the temporal lobe, is the brain structure most frequently paired with memories, studies have indicated that its role is more vital for consolidation of the short-term memories into long-term ones than the ability to process, carry out, and briefly recall certain tasks.

This type of memory has specifically come into focus when discussing sight reading, since the process of looking at musical notes for the first time and deciphering them while playing an instrument can be considered a complex task of comprehension. The main conclusion in terms of this idea is that working memory and short-term memory capacity and mental speed are three important predictors for sight reading achievement. Although none of the studies discredits the correlation between the amount of time one spends practicing and musical ability, specifically sight-reading proficiency, more studies are pointing to the level at which one’s working memory functions as the key factor in sight-reading abilities. As stated in one such study, "Working memory capacity made a statistically significant contribution as well (about 7 percent, a medium-size effect). In other words, if you took two pianists with the same amount of practice, but different levels of working memory capacity, it's likely that the one higher in working memory capacity would have performed considerably better on the sight-reading task."

Based on the research and opinions of multiple musicians and scientists, the take home message about one's sight-reading ability and working memory capacity seems to be that “The best sight-readers combined strong working memories with tens of thousands of hours of practice.”

Sight-reading also depends on familiarity with the musical idiom being performed; this permits the reader to recognize and process frequently occurring patterns of notes as a single unit, rather than individual notes, thus achieving greater efficiency. This phenomenon, which also applies to the reading of language, is referred to as [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Errors in sight-reading tend to occur in places where the music contains unexpected or unusual sequences; these defeat the strategy of "reading by expectation" that sight-readers typically employ.

==Professional use==
Studio [[musician]]s (e.g., musicians employed to record pieces for [[Advertising|commercials]], etc.) often record pieces on the first take without having seen them before. Often, the music played on [[television]] is played by musicians who are sight-reading. This practice has developed through intense commercial competition in these industries.

McNerney, jazz musician, professor, and private instructor, describes auditions for [[University of North Texas]] Jazz Lab Bands as being almost completely based on sight-reading: "you walk into a room and see three or four music stands in front of you, each with a piece of music on it (in different styles ...). You are then asked to read each piece in succession."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McNerney|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on sight-reading, according to McNerney, prepares musicians for studio work "playing backing tracks for pop performers or recording [commercials]."  The expense of the studio, musicians, and techs makes sight-reading skills essential.  Typically, a studio performance is "rehearsed" only once to check for copying errors before recording the final track. Many professional big bands also sight-read every live performance. They are known as "rehearsal bands", even though their performance is the rehearsal.

According to Frazier, score reading is an important skill for those interested in the conducting profession and "Conductors such as the late [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]] and [[Yoel Levi]] have incredibly strong piano skills and can read at sight full orchestral scores at the piano" (a process which requires the pianist to make an instant [[piano reduction]] of the key parts of the score).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Frazier|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
Although 86% of piano teachers polled rated sight-reading as the most important or a highly important skill, only 7% of them said they address it systematically. Reasons cited were a lack of knowledge of how to teach it, inadequacy of the training materials they use, and deficiency in their own sight-reading skills. Teachers also often emphasize rehearsed reading and repertoire building for successful recitals and auditions to the detriment of sight-reading and other functional skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hardy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy reviewed research on piano sight-reading pedagogy and identified a number of specific skills essential to sight-reading proficiency:
* Technical fundamentals in reading and [[Fingering (music)|fingering]]
* [[Creative visualization|Visualization]] of keyboard topography
* [[Touch|Tactile]] facility (psychomotor skills) and memory
* Ability to read, recognize, and remember groups of notes (directions, patterns, phrases, [[chord (music)|chords]], [[rhythm]]ic groupings, [[theme (music)|themes]], [[Inversion (music)|inversions]], [[interval (music)|intervals]], etc.)
* Ability to read and remember ahead of playing with more and wider progressive fixations
* Aural imagery (ear-playing and sight-singing improves sight-reading)
* Ability to keep the basic pulse, read, and remember rhythm
* Awareness and knowledge of the music's structure and theory

Beauchamp (1999) identifies five building blocks in the development of piano sight-reading skills:
# [[Grand staff|Grand-staff]] knowledge
# Security within the five finger positions
# Security with keyboard topography
# Security with basic accompaniment patterns
# Understanding of basic fingering principles

Grand-staff knowledge consists of fluency in both clefs such that reading a note evokes an automatic and immediate physical response to the appropriate position on the keyboard. Beauchamp asserts it is better to sense and know where the note is than what the note is. The performer does not have time to think of the note name and translate it to a position, and the non-scientific [[Musical note|note]] name does not indicate the [[octave]] to be played. Beauchamp reports success using a Key/Note Visualizer, note-reading flashcards, and computer programs in group and individual practice to develop grand-staff fluency.

Udtaisuk also reports that a sense of keyboard geography and an ability to quickly and efficiently match notes to keyboard keys is important for sight-reading. He found that "computer programs and flash cards are effective ways to teach students to identify notes [and] enhance a sense of keyboard geography by highlighting the relationships between the keyboard and the printed notation."

Most students do not sight-read well because it requires specific instruction, which is seldom given. A major challenge in sight-reading instruction, according to Hardy, is obtaining enough practice material. Since practicing rehearsed reading does not help improve sight-reading, a student can only use a practice piece once. Moreover, the material must be at just the right level of difficulty for each student, and a variety of styles is preferred. Hardy suggests music teachers cooperate to build a large lending library of music and purchase inexpensive music from garage sales and store sales.

==Assessment and standards==
In some circumstances, such as examinations, the ability of a student to sight-read is assessed by presenting the student with a short piece of music, with an allotted time to peruse the music, then testing the student on the accuracy of the performance.  A more challenging test requires the student to perform without any preparation at all.

The [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning]] has piloted a classroom based assessment which requires 5th and higher grade students to sight-sing or perform on instruments from sheet music they have written. It is suggested that students use [[solfege]] or numbering systems or fingering without instruments as aids. 8th graders are expected to sing by sight: "Students are asked to perform a sight-singing exercise of four measures of music. Students will be assessed on their understanding of rhythm and steady beat and their ability to perform in the designated key with accurate interval changes, acappella."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/WASL/Arts/CBPANewRevised2009.aspx "Arts Revised Classroom-Based Performance Assessment (CBPA)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many students and adults cannot sight-sing, and even some professional singers cannot sing by sight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, in combination with an assessment which requires composing music on a staff as early as 5th grade, it is hoped that such a requirement will raise arts achievement. Pilot data show that many students can meet or exceed such standards.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The Standard Assessment of Sight Reading (SASR) is a non-subjective sight reading evaluation method. It was created with a scientific/electronic platform to insure a non-subjective approach to grading and administering that test.  It consists of several thousand pieces of music over 80 graded levels of difficulty that have been reviewed by 135 teachers and students to ascertain the correct difficulty levels.  Their scores were averaged electronically in order to insure a scientific approach to graduating the difficulty levels of the music.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

'''Siobhán Ní Shúilleabháin''', (31 August 1928 – 21 May 2013), was an Irish dramatist and writer.

==Early life==
Siobhán Ní Shúilleabháin was in [[Ballyferriter]], [[County Kerry]]. She was one of six children of Séamus Ó Súilleabháin and Máire Feiritéar. Her brother was author [[Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin (writer)|Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin]].

== Recognition ==
[[John B. Keane]] called him the “best dramatist writing in Ireland”. Ní Shúilleabháin was the winner of the Irish Life award for plays in 1974, and of thirty Oireachtas literary awards. Her novel ''Aistriú'' (2004) led Pól Ó Muirí to write, "[It] is a work of great compassion and poignancy and Ní Shúilleabháin tells the story fluently. Her use of dialogue is particularly impressive, giving the reader the immediate sense of what is said but, magically, also conveying a second meaning behind the spoken one. It is the sound of speech and the whisper of a sigh that adds so much to a wonderful novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/john-b-keane-said-she-was-best-dramatist-in-ireland-1.1439775|title=John B Keane said she was 'best dramatist in Ireland'|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband, academic Patrick Leo Henry, died in 2011.

Ní Shúilleabháin died in [[Galway]] on 21 May 2013, survived by her six children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3497">A [[regular language]] is said to be '''star-free''' if it can be described by a [[regular expression]] constructed from the letters of the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], the [[empty set]] symbol, all [[boolean operators]] &amp;ndash; including [[Complement (set theory)|complementation]] &amp;ndash; and [[concatenation]] but no [[Kleene star]].&lt;ref name=Law235&gt;Lawson (2004) p.235&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the language of words over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{a,\,b\}&lt;/math&gt; that do not have consecutive a's can be defined by &lt;math&gt;(\emptyset^c aa \emptyset^c)^c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X^c&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complement of a subset &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\{a,\,b\}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Tunica''' (or '''Tonica''', or less common form '''Yuron''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsmarc.com/crs/lang0152.htm#tunica|title=Language names:T|accessdate=2010-02-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113045831/http://www.itsmarc.com/crs/lang0152.htm#tunica|archivedate=2010-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; language is a [[language isolate]] that was spoken in the Central and Lower Mississippi Valley in the [[United States]] by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Tunica people|Tunica]] peoples. There are no native speakers of the Tunica language, but {{As of|2017|lc=y}}, there are 32 [[second language]] speakers.&lt;ref name="ethnologue20" /&gt;

[[Tunica-Biloxi]] tribal member [[William Ely Johnson]] worked with Swiss ethnologist [[Albert Samuel Gatschet|Albert Gatschet]] to help him document the language in 1886. This initial documentation was further developed by linguist [[John R. Swanton]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanton|first=John R.|date=1921|title=The Tunica Language|jstor=1263179|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=2|issue=1/2|pages=1–39|doi=10.1086/463732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last known native speaker, [[Sesostrie Youchigant]], died in 1948. In the 1930s, linguist [[Mary Haas]] worked with him to describe what Youchigant remembered of the language, and the description was published in ''A Grammar of the Tunica Language'' in 1941. That was followed by ''Tunica Texts'' in 1950 and ''Tunica Dictionary'' in 1953.

By the 17th century, the people had suffered a high rate of fatalities from Eurasian infectious diseases, warfare, and social disruption. The reduced [[History of the Tunica people|Tunica tribe]] lived close to the [[Mosopelea|Ofo]] and [[Avoyel]]les tribes, in present-day Louisiana. They communicated by [[Mobilian Jargon]] or [[French language|French]]. The small population and the use of a jargon made Haas note that the eventual deterioration of the Tunica language was inevitable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Mary Haas|Haas, Mary R.]], ''Tunica'', New York: J.J. Augustin Publisher, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language revitalization efforts ==
In 2010, the [[Tunica-Biloxi]] tribe formed the Tunica Language Project in partnership with the Linguistics Program at [[Tulane University]] in a continuing effort to revitalize the Tunica language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tunicabiloxi.org/taluhchi-yoroni-woruhk%E2%80%99iti.html|title=Taluhchi Yoroni Woruhk’iti|website=www.tunicabiloxi.org|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal members read from a new children's book in Tunica at a 2010 pow wow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about half of the tribal members live within {{Convert|75|miles}} of the reservation, in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles Parish]].

===Vowels===
Tunica has seven [[vowels]], all of which are usually short but may be lengthened in [[stressed syllable]]s, and all of which are voiced completely, except if a /u/ is at the end of a phrase in a word with stress on the second-last syllable, when it is unvoiced after a /k/ or /hk/. Vowels are paired with a certain [[melody]] in last or occasionally second-last syllable of a word. The melodies are high, low, rising, falling, and falling-rising.

Vowels may appear only following or preceding [[consonants]], never adjacent to one another. Also, /i/, /a/, and /u/ may appear in any position, but the others appear only in syllables with stress. Vowels do not typically occur at the end of a phrase, and when any vowel precedes ''n'' in the same syllable, it becomes [[nasalized]].

===Consonants===
The [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] style (represented in bolded symbols below) is based on Mary Haas' work ''Tunica Language''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The IPA symbols are in brackets next to each consonant.

The consonants /p/, /t/, /k/, and /t͡ʃ/ are always fairly [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] unless they occur before a /ʔ/, when they are completely [[unaspirated]]. Meanwhile, /b/, /d/, and /g/ do not occur frequently, as is the case with /f/. The fricatives /s/ and /š/ are pronounced with a stronger hiss than in English, and /ʔ/ is said to have a very strong closure. The semi-vowels /j/ and /w/ are always [[voiced]], as is the [[nasal stop|nasal]] /m/. On the other hand, /n/, /l/, and /r/ can be voiced or [[voiceless]]. The /l/ and /r/ are voiced between vowels or before /ʔ/ or continuants. However, they are voiceless before voiceless consonants except /ʔ/ or at the end of a phrase: ''ši'lka'' "blackbird," ''ši'hkal'' "stone." Similarly, /n/ is voiced between vowels or before /ʔ/ and is voiceless at the end of a phrase or before voiceless consonants except /ʔ/.

===Prosody===
Tunica has both stressed and unstressed syllables, and stressed syllables can have a higher [[pitch (music)|pitch]] than other syllables, depending on the position of the syllable in a phrase. The first stressed syllable of a phrase is typically spoken with a slightly higher pitch than the following syllables are. The exception is the last syllable when the high or the falling melody is used or the last syllable during the use of the low or the rising melody. The phrase-final melody then determines much of the stress in the rest of the phrase.

When there is use of the high melody, the last syllable is about a minor third higher pitch than the second-last syllable. The first syllable with stress is usually a major second higher than the following syllables are except for the last. All other syllables may not be spoken with any kind of pitch, and the same goes for other unstressed syllables. For example, ''ta'čiyak ʔura'pʔikʔahčá'' "You will kill the squirrel" shows the melody. ''ta'-'' is a major second higher than the syllables that follow it except for ''-ča'', which is a minor third higher than any syllable that comes before it other than ''ta'-''.

The falling melody causes the last syllable to start at a minor third higher than the second-last syllable: it goes down quickly: ''ʔa'hkiš ma'rʔikî'' "Go back!"

The low melody that occurs as the last syllable is lower than the last stressed syllable, which is a little higher than the syllables that it immediately follows. All unstressed syllables between the last stressed syllable and the last syllable take on the same stress as the latter. Unless it is also the last stressed syllable, the first stressed syllable is higher than any following syllable except that last stressed syllable:'ʔu'riš ma'rʔuwa'nì'' "He went back home, they say."

When the rising melody occurs, the last syllable starts lower than the last stressed syllable and goes upward quickly by about a minor third. Elsewhere in the phrase, the tone is like a low melody: ''lɔ'ta wiwa'nǎn'' "Do you want to run?"

The falling-rising melody is a fast drop by a fourth, followed by a fast rise by a minor third. However, only one word uses it: ''hőn'' "Yes."

===Phonological processes===
Every syllable in Tunica begins with a single consonant. Sometimes, double or triple consonants may occur in the middle of words or phrases, but no more than two consonants in a row occur at the end of a phrase. The smallest phonetic group in Tunica is a [[phrase]], but a word and a phrase can be differentiated by certain processes. Those that affect grammatical elements that merge to form words are vocalic [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]], vocalic [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], vocalic [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], consonantic syncope, [[haplology]], and patterns in stress. Those that affect words that combine into phrases are vocalic [[apocope]], consonantic apocope, [[amalgamation (linguistics)|amalgamation]], and stress losses. More specific information and basic examples are detailed below:

* /a/ assimilates after /i/ or /e/ &gt; /ɛ/, and /a/ assimilates after /o/ or /u/ &gt; /ɔ/: ''mi'lʔɛhɛ'' "not red" &lt; ''mi'li'' "red" + ''-ʔaha'' "not."
* When the first vowel of ''aha'' or ''ehe'' contracts or assimilates with the preceding vowel, the second vowel takes on the same quality as the first: ''ka'šʔɛhɛ'' "not true" &lt; ''ka'ši'' "true" + ''-ʔaha'' "not."
* In combining grammatical elements into words, a vowel preceding /ʔ/ is syncopated (lost) unless at the end of a monosyllabic stem or prefix: ''la'pʔɔhɔ'' "not good" &lt; ''la'pu'' "good" + ''-ʔaha'' "not."
* /h/ between a continuant and a voiceless stop is dropped in consonantic syncope; /k/ between /h/ and a voiceless stop is dropped; /hk/ before a continuant aside from /h/ is dropped; /š/ before another/š/ makes one of them drop; the prefix ''ta'-'' becomes ''t-'' before the stems beginning with /ʔ/, and /ʔ/ is syncopated.
*Haplology occurs when the last syllable of the preceding noun stem takes is /k/, followed by a vowel: the last syllable drops if the second noun member starts with /k/: ''ha'hkiri'' "cornmeal" &lt; ''ha'hka'' "corn" + ''ki'ri'' "ground."
* All stems have an intrinsic stress, and some affixes have intrinsic stress on the first syllable. In the combination of elements to form words and phrases, the stresses are retained if possible, but two stressed syllables do not occur consecutively, which causes the need for certain accommodations. For example, monosyllabic or syncopated disyllabic stems, followed by another element with intrinsic stress, cause the latter to lose its stress. Also, a stem, combined with a stressed monosyllabic prefix, loses its stress.
* Vocalic apocope occurs before another word starting with /ʔ/ if the prior word does not have a stressed second-last syllable: ''tu'wak(u) ʔu'wakɔ'ni'' "the owl hooted," or, if it does, the following word does not contain a stressed first syllable: ''ʔu'w(i) ʔonɛni'' "he was a person."
* When a word is vocalically apocopated, with the sound lost at the end of the word, and ends in a consonant group of a continuant plus a voiceless stop, it then goes through consonantic apocope and so the word-final consonant is lost. A voiceless stop between /h/ and another voiceless stop is dropped. A voiceless stop after any continuant except /h/ is dropped. A consonant group of /h/ followed by a voiceless stop is dropped if a continuant follows.
* Amalgamations occur when words beginning with /h/ lose it after a word that is vocalically apocopated: ''ta'hala'yiht'' "on the ground" &lt; ''ta'hal(i)'' "the ground" + ''(h)a'yihta''.
* If an irregularly-apocopated word with a stressed second-last syllable is placed before a word with stress on the first syllable, the first word loses its stress. If the second word does not have stress on the first syllable, the first word keeps the stressed syllable.

==Morphology&lt;ref name="autogenerated1940"/&gt;==

===Inflection===
Nouns can be divided into the categories of indeterminative and [[determinative]]. The indeterminative nouns have a [[word stem|stem]] without any [[affixes]], and the determinative nouns are distinguished by the articular [[prefix]] or the pronominal prefix. Determinative nouns belong are definitive, non-definitive, and locative, which may be distinguished by different prefixes or suffixes.

The articular prefix is similar to the definite article in English and appears as ''ta'-'' before all stems not beginning with /ʔ/ or /t/. The prefix appears as ''t-'' before stems beginning with /ʔ/, and it is omitted by haplology before stems beginning with /t/: ''te'tiha'yihta'' "on the road"; ''te'ti'' "the road" &lt; ''te'ti'' "road"

All proper nouns, unless their stems begin with /t/, must begin with the articular prefix. For instance, ''ta'wišmi'li'' "Red River" is ''ta'-'' + ''wi'š(i)mi'li'' "red water".

The pronominal prefixes signify possession when they attached to a noun and preclude the need for articular prefixes with the same stem. Some stems, called inalienably-possessed noun stems, cannot be used without a pronominal prefix. They include those of kinship, body parts, and miscellaneous terms. Kinship terms are those such as ''-e'si'' "father" or '''-gači'' "mother." Body part terms are those such as ''-e'sini'' "head" or ''-e'neri'' "horns." Finally, miscellaneous terms can be nouns like ''-e'htiwa'hkuni'' "breechcloth" or ''-e'tisa'' "name."

Gender-number suffixes can be used only in the definitive case of the determinative category so whenever one is used, there must also be a determining prefix attached to the stem. Below is a table showing the gender-number suffixes:

Sometimes, gender-number suffixes are put on an inflected verb form to convert it to a relative clause. It could be that a noun has the appropriate suffix, and the verb of the clause then takes the same one. Other times, only the verb takes the suffix. Examples of the use of the gender-number suffixes follow:

*''ta'čɔhǎku'', "the chief" &lt; ''ta'-'' + ''čɔ'hǎ'' + ''-ku''
*''ti'sasi'nimǎn'', "her dogs" &lt; ''tihk'' + ''sa''' + ''-si'nima''
*''to'nišisɛ'mǎn'', "the men" &lt; ''ta'-'' + ''ʔo'niši'' + ''sɛ'ma''

Finally, there are three possible [[locative]] suffixes to put nouns in the locative case. The nouns will also have a determining prefix attached. Gender-number suffixes and locative suffixes are mutually exclusive, but a locative noun may have a number. Also, locative suffixes can take stems and convert them into [[adverbs]] and [[postpositions]]. ''-ši'' is the most commonly used locative suffix, and its meaning is comparable to the English "in, into" or "on, over," but in Tunica, it is used as "at, to." That can be seen in the sentence "He stayed at home," which breaks down into ''ʔu'riš ʔunanì'' &lt; "at his house" ''ʔu'riš(i)'' &lt; ''ʔuhk-'' + ''ri-'' "house" + ''ši''. ''-štihki'' "toward, in the direction of" is the second suffix.

Usually, it is used with the names of directions: ''ta'sapʔaraštihk'' "to the west" &lt; ''ta-'' +''sa'pʔara'' "west" + ''-štihki''. The final locative suffix is ''-hat'' "on, onto." It is typically used only with ''ta'hali'' "the ground." It can be seen in the sentence "He spat on the ground" as ''ta'haltǎn, ču'hʔuhkɛ'nì''; ''ta'halta'' &lt; ''ta'-'' + ''ha'l(i)'' "ground, land" + ''-hat''.

==Syntax&lt;ref name="autogenerated1940"/&gt;==

===Sentence parts===
The possible word classes that are found in Tunica include independent personal [[pronouns]], [[nouns]], interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, [[postpositions]], [[adjectives]], comparatives, adverbs, [[auxiliary verbs]], active verbs, static verbs, sentence [[connectives]], and exclamatives and imitatives. Syntactic elements of a sentence are made up of words, phrases, or clauses acting in one of the following: predicative words, independent subjects, independent objects, subject or object modifiers, predicate modifiers, predicate complements, or sentence connectives. The syntactic elements can all be made into clauses that are either main or subordinate, and subordinate clauses can be dependent, complementary, relative, or adverbial.

There are three types of sentences that the Tunica language produces: simple, compound, and complex. Simple sentences must contain only one predicative word. Compound sentences have two or more main clauses. Complex sentences have a main clause and one or more of the different types of subordinate clauses that are mentioned above.

The following are brief descriptions of possible syntactic elements of a clause:

*''The predicative word'' may be an independent personal pronoun, a noun, an interrogative-indefinite pronoun, and quantificative, an adjective, or a verb.
*''The independent subject'' may be an independent personal pronoun, a noun, an interrogative-indefinite pronoun, or a quantificative.
*''The independent object'' may be an independent personal pronoun, a noun, an interrogative-indefinite pronoun, or a quantificative.
*''The subject or object modifiers'' may be quantificatives or relative clauses.
*''The predicate modifier''
may be words when used as adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, and locatives and may be phrases and clauses when it is adverbial.
*''The predicate complement'' may be words or clauses.
*''The sentence connective'' makes a basic conjunctive or contrastive relation between a sentence and the one before it.

There are other special constructions that also take place in certain specific environments. For example, quantificatives and nouns can be in apposition to other nouns that independent subjects or objects: ''ʔuhkʔo'nisɛ'mǎn, ho't ʔaku'hpanʔuhkɛ'nì'' "He assembled all (of) his people, it is sad" &lt; "he assembled, it is said, his people, all." Additionally, a possessive [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] can serve in the same syntactical functions that a noun can. For example, ''ta'čɔhak ʔu'rǐhč, hi'yuhɔ'nì'' "The chief's house was (made of) grass" (''ta'čɔhaku'' "the chief", possessor noun, + ''ʔu'rihči'' "his house", alienably possessed noun, the combination serving as independent subject).

===Syntactic order===
There are certain rules that are observed to form sentences in the correct order:

* When a sentence connective is in a sentence, it precedes the other elements in that sentence.
* The predicative word of any type of clause is at the end of a clause.
* An independent subject is before all other syntactic elements, except the sentence connective.
* An independent object is immediately before the predicative word.
* An adjective is immediately after the noun that it modifies.
* A comparative is immediately after the word that it modifies.
* A postposition is always immediately after a [[substantive]].
* Predicate modifiers that describe spatial location are immediately before or after the verb that they modify.
* Non-locative predicate modifiers have free order.
* A predicate [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] is immediately before the predicative word that it complements.

There are also certain rules in the order of clauses:

* Main [[clauses]] always are always at the end of a sentence, except if the clause both is complementary and complements or modifies the predicative word of the main clause.
* Dependent clauses are before the main clause.
* Complementary clauses take the form of a clause within a clause, and the larger clause is either a main or dependent clause.
* Relative clauses are after the substantive that they modify.
* Adverbial clauses may be directly before or after the verb that they modify.

===Noun classification===
Noun can belong to one of the following gender-number classes: masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine dual, feminine dual, masculine plural, or feminine plural. There are rules to help determine classification of nouns:

* Nouns that refer to human or non-human male animate objects/people in any number are masculine in gender, and those that refer to human or non-human female animate objects/people in any number are feminine in gender.
* Nouns that refer specifically to human male and female animates in any number are masculine.
* Nouns that refer to non-human male and female animates are masculine when in the dual number but feminine in collective and plural numbers.
* Nouns that refer to human animates with an unknown sex always seem to take the masculine gender.

Nouns in Tunica are also classified according to what position they take. There are three positions that are available and that encompass every noun in the Tunica language: horizontal, squatting, and vertical. Humans and four-legged non-humans can take any of the positions, but elongated non-human animates (like fish or snakes) always take the horizontal position. Smaller non-human animates, like frogs and birds, always take the [[squatting position]].

Inanimates are always horizontal or vertical: abstract nouns are always horizontal, and inanimate objects that take an erect position, like trees, are vertical.

===Preverbs and postfixes===
The preverbs are often used with active verb predicative words:
* ''te-'' "about, all about"
* ''ki-'' "in, into"
* ''ho-'' "out, out of"
* ''ha-'' "up, down"

There are many postfixes, which express different meanings like certain tenses and negation. Sometimes, more than one postfix may be attached to one word, and each postfix has its own governing rules.

* ''-man'' "and," coordinates clauses
* ''-ʔama'' "and, together with," coordinates nouns
* ''-škan'' "although, but"
* ''-hč'' "when, after, as, while"
* ''-hčika'ši'': similar to the English "so...that" but it may be more like "because so..."
* ''-a'ni'': quotative
* ''-n'': interrogative, imperative, or exhortative
* ''-ki'': imperative
* ''-hčan'': imperative but with force; similar to "must..."
* ''-tan'': imperative
* ''-kʔahča'': indicates the future
* ''-kʔi'': sometimes seen as ''-ʔi''; can be defined as "if"
* ''-pan'' "even if, even though, though"
* ''-k'': future subjunctive
* ''-aha'' "not"
* ''-kʔaha'' "not," but builds habitual negation
* ''-ʔaha'' "not" but used with non-inchoative forms of static verbs and also with independent personal pronouns, nouns, and adjectives when they are predicative
* ''-pʔaha'' "no, not any"
* ''-štukʔɔhɔ'' "can't"
* ''-hat'' "on...-'s part"
* ''-pa'' "too, also, even"
* ''-nahku'' "like, resembling..."
* ''-tahki'' "only, nothing but..." can also be "...alone; by...-self"
* ''-štahahki'' "only...," used with numbers
* ''-tɛ'pan'' "every...," used with nouns that imply a length of time
* ''-ša'' "...-ish; almost, not quite, somewhat"
* ''-štʔɛ'' "very much"
* ''-što'hku'' "fairly, quite, a little bit"
* ''-le'he'' "right, precisely"

===Other word classes===
There are two possible noun categories: the determinative and the indeterminative. The determinative category can be divided into definitive, non-definitive, and locative. Indeterminative nouns can be predicative words, subjects of predications, objects of transitive and transimpersonal active verbs and of static verbs, and complements of impersonal and transimpersonal active verbs and of static verbs.

Personal pronouns are inflected depending on person, number, and gender, but they do not have special forms that indicate whether they fall into the determinative or indeterminative categories. They substitute for nouns, and they can be used like nouns, except in the locative case.

The interrogative-indefinite pronouns are ''ka'ku'' "who, someone, anyone" and ''ka'nahku'' "what, something, anything." They can substitute for nouns when they do not occur in the locative case. Also, ''ka'nahku'' does not appear as an independent subject.

Quantificatives include numerals and others like ''ho'tu'' "all, everything," ''na'mu'' "many, much," ''ka'šku'' "a few, a little bit," ''ka'škuto'hku'' "several, quite a few," and ''ʔa'mari'' "enough." They can be used as minimal clauses, substitutes for nouns, modifiers of nouns, and modifiers of active verbs.

Postpositions are used to modify locatives and predicates.

Adjectives can be used as predicate words, as noun modifiers used as predicative words, or as modifiers of the interrogative-indefinite pronoun ''ka'nahku''.

Comparatives can be used as modifiers of adjectives, static verbs, adverbs, nouns, or quantificative ''na'mu''.

Adverbs can be used to modify auxiliary and active verbs.

Auxiliary verbs are always in a predicative word position. Active verbs are either finite or infinitive in form. Finite verbs take subjective pronominal referentials and are predicative words. Infinitives are taken as predicate complements. Sometimes, they are inflected for an objective referential. Static verbs are always inflected for an objective referential and are always predicative words.

Sentence connectives connect or contrast two sentences or sometimes two words.

Exclamatives and imitatives always appear as minimal clauses. The most predominant exclamatives are ''hõn'' "yes", ''ʔahâ'' "no", and ''dâ'' "now; ready."

'''Uri Nissan Gnessin''' (1879–1913) was a [[Russia]]n [[Jewish]] writer, generally considered a pioneer in modern [[Hebrew literature]]. He is a brother of [[Menahem Gnessin]], a co-founder of the [[Habima Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Gershony"&gt;Gershony, Gershon K. (2007). "Gnessin, Menahem." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Vol.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;648. Retrieved 2017-05-23, via ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''. Also available online [http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gnessin-menahem via ''Encyclopedia.com''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Starodub]], and grew up in the small town of [[Pochep, Bryansk Oblast|Prochep]], Orel province.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;[[Leah Goldberg|Goldberg, Lea]] (2007). "Gnessin, Uri Nissan." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Vol.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;648-650. Retrieved 2017-05-23, via ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''. Also available online [http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gnessin-uri-nissan via ''Encyclopedia.com''].&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a rabbi and the head of a yeshiva in Pochep.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; After attending [[cheder]], Gnessin studied at his father's yeshiva, and there became friends with [[Yosef Haim Brenner]], a fellow student.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; As a boy he wrote poetry and was interested secular subjects; when he was 15 years old, he and Brenner together produced a literary journal that they distribured to a small circle of friends.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt;

==Literary career and later years==
Around 1899, when Gnessin was 18 years old, he was invited by [[Nahum Sokolow]] to join the editorial board of the Hebrew-language newspaper ''[[Ha-Tsefirah]]'', in [[Warsaw]], where he began to publish his poems and stories, as well as literary criticism and translations.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; His first book, ''Zilelei ha-Hayyim'' (The Shadows of Life), a collection of stories and sketches, was published in 1904.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt;

In 1906, he co-founded the Hebrew-language publishing house "Nisyonot" (Attempts), and after moving to London in 1907, he co-edited (with Brenner) ''Ha'Meorer'', a Hebrew periodical.

In the fall of 1907, he immigrated to [[Yishuv|Palestine]]; however, his experience there disappointed him, and in 1908 he returned to [[Russian Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; In 1913, he died in Warsaw of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithl.org.il/page_13637  Uri Nissan Gnessin]". Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature (ITHL). ithl.org.il. Retrieved 2017-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gnessin wrote in a unique style of prose that was notable for its [[expressionism|expressionistic]] language form. Many Israeli literary scholars, such as [[Dan Miron]] and [[Gershon Shaked]] have written of his work, especially about the short story "BaGanim" (At the Gardens).

[[File:Winston Hall, Gloucester.jpg|thumb|Winston Hall, built in Gloucester in 1750 for the wool-stapler Richard Chandler.&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt;]]
A '''wool-stapler''' is a dealer in [[wool]]. The wool-stapler buys wool from the producer, sorts and grades it, and sells it on to manufacturers. Staple in this particular context means a market. 

Before the 17th century a [[The Staple|staple]] was also a particular type of market, "a place appointed by royal authority, in which a body of merchants had exclusive right of purchase of certain goods destined for export". 

The now best known English staple was at Calais but in medieval times there were, at various times, many others throughout the kingdoms of England and Ireland and the facing coast of the [[Low Countries]] all involved, though not exclusively, with the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]].

The importance of wool to the English economy can be shown by the fact that since the 14th Century, the presiding officer of the [[House of Lords]] has sat on the "[[Woolsack]]", a chair stuffed with wool.

Wool-staplers could acquire significant wealth, such as Richard Chandler of Gloucester who built [[Winston Hall]] in 1750.&lt;ref name=NHL&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1271655|desc=Winston Hall|access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term wool-stapler fell out of use during the 20th century.

{{italic title}}
'''''¡Ay, caramba!''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈai kaˈɾamba|pron}}), from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] interjections ''ay'' (denoting surprise or pain) and ''caramba'' (a [[euphemism]] for ''[[:wiktionary:carajo|carajo]]''), is an exclamation used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to denote surprise (usually positive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spanish-English/English-Spanish Dictionary|year=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-345-40547-1|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''caramba'' is also used in Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aulete.com.br/caramba|title=Aulete digital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and the arts== 
The exclamation became associated with the [[Madrid]] flamenco dancer and singer [[La Caramba]] in the 1780s. Her headdress of brightly colored ribbons became known as a ''caramba''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZuPJjZLrJHoC&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Spanish Theater Songs -- Baroque and Classical Eras: Medium High Voice |author=Carol Mikkelsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgCQOLBKm28C&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Researching the song |author=[[Shirlee Emmons]], Wilbur Watkin Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Nancy Cartwright.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nancy Cartwright]], voice of [[Bart Simpson]]]]

The fictional character [[Bart Simpson]] from the animated sitcom ''[[The best show ever: The Simpsons!]]'' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) used the phrase "¡Ay, caramba!" (pronounced with an American accent) when surprised. It became one of his most notable [[catchphrase]]s, further popularizing the phrase in modern [[pop culture]]. For example, in the episode "[[Selma's Choice]]", Bart, Lisa, and their Aunt Selma approach a very popular ride at [[Duff Gardens]]. Upon seeing the exceptionally long line for the ride, Bart exclaims, "¡Ay, caramba!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Turner (author) |title=[[Planet Simpson|Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation]] |others=Foreword by [[Douglas Coupland]]. |edition=1st |year=2004 |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |oclc=670978714 |isbn=978-0-306-81341-2 |page=60}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Åsa Tindra Jinder Otter''' (born 9 October 1963&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birthday.se/sok/?f=%c5sa&amp;l=Jinder&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Danderyd Municipality|Danderyd]], [[Stockholm County]], [[Sweden]]) is a Swedish [[nyckelharpa]] player, composer, producer, songwriter, author and lecturer.
