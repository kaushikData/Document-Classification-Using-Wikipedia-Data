The '''39M Csaba''' was an armoured car produced for the [[Royal Hungarian Army]] during [[World War II]].

== Development ==
[[File:39M Csaba páncélautó. Fortepan 9223.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 39M Csaba, showing the reverse, driving position]]
Hungarian expatriate [[Nicholas Straussler]] designed several armoured cars for Britain while living there between the two world wars. Straussler came to an agreement with the [[Weiss Manfred factory]] of [[Csepel|Csepel, Budapest]] to produce vehicles from his designs for use in his home country - the most prominent was the Csaba (named after the son of [[Attila the Hun]]) which was designed based on his experience of the [[Alvis Cars|Alvis]] AC2 armoured car.

After successful trials in 1939, the Hungarian Army placed an order for 61, and a further order for an additional 40 vehicles was placed in 1940. Of these, twenty were used as actual fighting vehicles, with the remainder serving as armoured command cars and reconnaissance vehicles.

The Csaba had a 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[Solothurn S-18/100|Solothurn anti-tank rifle]]&lt;ref name ='Zaloga 22'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven J.|title=The Anti-Tank Rifle|date=2018|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-4728-1722-8|ref={{harvid|Zaloga|2018}}|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 8&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun fixed on a centrally mounted turret, with 9&amp;nbsp;mm armoured plating. The vehicle was also equipped with a detachable 8&amp;nbsp;mm light machine gun fired through the rear hatch in the anti-aircraft role.  The crew could dismount and carry this MG when conducting reconnaissance on foot. It also had two driving positions - one at the front as normal, and an additional one at the rear.

The '''40M Csaba''' was a command version armed only with the turret-mounted 8&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun. This vehicle was fitted with a second R-4T radio, which had a large lattice radio mast.

'''Abecedarians''' were a 16th-century [[Germany|German]] sect of [[Anabaptists]] who rejected all human learning. Questions have been raised as to the historical accuracy of the name and sect.

==Rejection of education==

According to the original ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the Abecedarians were a 16th-century [[Germany|German]] sect of [[Anabaptists]] who affected an absolute disdain for all human knowledge, contending that [[God]] would enlighten his elect from within themselves, giving them knowledge of necessary truths by visions and ecstasies, with which human learning would interfere.&lt;ref name="Handy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZtHAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22Abecedarian%22+Anabaptists+news&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EWkH1QMi8G&amp;sig=873dNzhIoW11kFlqNOgnLs3hBH4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jna6S6CZA4_YsgPA4LirBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=A Handy Book of Reference on All Subjects and for All Readers|first1=Ainsworth Rand|last1=Spofford|first2=Charles|last2=Annandale|date=13 November 2018|publisher=Gebbie publishing Company, limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/dictionaryofengl00hyamiala|title=A dictionary of English phrases; phraseological allusions, catchwords, stereotyped modes of speech and metaphors, nicknames, sobriquets, derivations from personal names, etc., with explanations and thousands of exact references to their sources or early usage|first=Albert Montefiore|last=Hyamson|date=13 November 2018|publisher=London : Routledge; New York, Dutton|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They rejected every other means of instruction, and claimed that to be saved one must even be ignorant of the first letters of the [[alphabet]]; whence their name, A-B-C-darians. They also considered the study of [[theology]] as a species of [[idolatry]], and regarded learned men who did any preaching as falsifiers of God's word.&lt;ref name="Handy" /&gt;

[[Nicholas Storch]] led this sect, preaching that the teaching of the [[Holy Spirit]] was all that was necessary.&lt;ref name="Handy" /&gt;
[[Andreas Karlstadt]] adopted these views, abandoned his title of doctor and became a street [[porter (carrier)|porter]].

===Doubts of accuracy===

Early Anabaptists were viewed disdainfully by their adversaries as a radical peasant movement. Thus some{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} consider the extant descriptions to be an elitist caricature of either a particular Anabaptist group or Anabaptists as a whole. Most more recent reference works have ceased to mention the group at all. No equivalent entry was present in the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia''. No historical references later than the early 20th century mention these claims.

==Other historical information==

John Bell stated their founder's name was Stork, a disciple of [[Martin Luther|Luther]], and that "this sect was some time considerable in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;Rev. John Bell, ''The Wonderings of the Human Intellect'', Edward Walker, Newcastle, 1814&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
In the graphic novel ''[[The Calculus Affair]]'', [[Captain Haddock]] uses the word "Abecedarian" as an epithet.

The '''Assizes of Capua''' were the first of three great legislative acts of the [[kingdom of Sicily]] of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Sicily]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. They were the first, promulgated at [[Capua]] in 1220, before the [[Assizes of Messina]] on 1221 and the [[Constitutions of Melfi]] of 1231.

The Assizes were promulgated on the mainland of the realm as they were a reform of the [[Assizes of Ariano]], promulgated by Frederick's grandfather [[Roger II]] in 1140 at [[Ariano Irpino]], nearby to Capua. The intent was, as in the previous Assizes and his coming Constitutions, the strengthening of the royal power in the kingdom, usually at the expense of the noblesse.

The ''' Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia''' is an international association of [[Asia]]n [[Cardiothoracic surgeons]]. It was founded in 1972 by cardiothoracic surgeons in the Asian countries and its headquartered in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.vietnamplus.vn/vietnam-hosts-asian-congress-on-thoracic-cardiovascular-surgery/67889.vnp|title=Vietnam hosts Asian congress on thoracic, cardiovascular surgery |work=en.vietnamplus.vn|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The association consists of members from 44 countries and to be considered for membership, a cardiothoracic surgeon must have a track record of distinction in the field and have made meritorious contributions to the knowledge of cardiothoracic disease and its surgical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atcsa.org/council/|title= Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia|work=atcsa.org|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1308">'''Boila''' ({{lang-bg|боила}} or {{lang|bg|боил}}; {{lang-cu|бꙑлꙗ}}; {{lang-el|βοιλα}}) was a title worn by some of the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] aristocrats (mostly of regional governors and noble warriors) in [[First Bulgarian Empire]] (681-1018). For the linguists, the title "Boila" is predecessor or old form of the title "[[Boyar|Bolyar]]".

The '''Boil(a)s''' were two types: internal ("great") and external ("small"). The internal '''Boil'''a'''s''' were governors of the ''Comitates (administrative regions)''.

==Etymology==
Most of the popular linguists says that "'''Boila'''" has [[Old Turkic language|old-Turkic]] origin and the meaning of the word can be translated as "''noble''".

In several French-speaking countries, the '''Chef de Cabinet''' ([[French language|French]], literally "Cabinet Chief") is a senior [[civil servant]]  who acts as an [[Personal assistant|aide]] or [[Private Secretary]] to a government figure, typically a [[Minister (government)|minister]]. They typically work in the ministerial office (''cabinet'').

The title is used by the head of an office in the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat]], appointed by the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]], or in the [[European Commission]], appointed by an individual [[European Commissioner]] for his or her [[Cabinet (European Commission)|personal cabinet]]. The position's rank and responsibilities are equivalent to a [[Chief of staff (politics)|chief of staff]]. The current chef de cabinet to the United Nations [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary&amp;#8209;General]] is [[Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/profiles/maria-luiza-ribeiro-viotti&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Staatsbegräbnis.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Law enforcement in Austria|Austrian police]] in [[Vienna]].]]
'''Crime in Austria''' is combated by a range of [[Law enforcement in Austria|Austrian law enforcement agencies]].  

== Crime by type ==
=== Murder ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2016, Austria (with a population of about 8.74 million) had an intentional homicide rate of 0.53 per 100,000 population - one of the lowest rates in the world. There were a total of 46 intentional homicides in Austria in 2016.&lt;ref name=''Federal Ministry of the Interior - Federal Criminal Police Office''&gt;[http://bundeskriminalamt.at/501/files/BroschuereSicherheit_2016.pdf ''Polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik 2016'', Federal Ministry of the Interior - Federal Criminal Police Office, 26 June 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theft ===
[[File:Österreichische Bundespolizei 09.jpg|thumb|Austrian police at a traffic stop.]]
Pickpockets and purse snatchers can be found in the highly populated areas, including areas frequented by tourists, bus and train stations, and on subways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12180  "Austria 2012 Crime and Safety Report", United States Department of State, Overseas Security Advisory Council, 13 March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Residential burglaries are a significant concern, especially in the more affluent areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12180  "Austria 2012 Crime and Safety Report", United States Department of State, Overseas Security Advisory Council, 13 March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; The US government rates Vienna as being "medium" for levels of residential crime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12180  "Austria 2012 Crime and Safety Report", United States Department of State, Overseas Security Advisory Council, 13 March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Austria had the lowest rates of car theft in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeansafetyobservatory.eu/downloads/EUICS%20-%20The%20Burden%20of%20Crime%20in%20the%20EU.pdf  "The Burden of Crime in the EU, A Comparative Analysis of the European Survey of Crime and Safety (EU ICS) 2005", Gallup Europe, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Main|Corruption in Austria}}

Austria has a well-developed institutional and legal system, and most [[corruption]] cases under investigation by a parliamentary committee end with judicial trials and effective judgments. Several significant Austrian corruption cases took place during the 2000s involving land and regional officials, high-level public officials, the central government and, in one instance, the former [[Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria Corruption Profile-Political Climate|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/austria/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, corrupt practices were related to conflicts of interest, abuse of office, money laundering and influence peddling. The corruption scandals have put into doubt the ethical standards of the political elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria Corruption Profile-Political Climate|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/austria/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This doubt is reflected in the findings of [[Eurobarometer]] 2012, where two-thirds of respondents perceive national politicians to be corrupt and also the most corrupt institution in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurobarometer 2012- Austria|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_374_en.pdf|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime dynamics ==
Austria is targeted by foreign criminals, with 64 percent of drug-related offences being carried out by criminals who are born abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tirone |last=Jonathan |title=Austria to Tighten Immigration as Crime Increases |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=19 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to British criminal Colin Blaney in his autobiography ''Undesirables'', British thieves and confidence tricksters have targeted Austria on account of the fact that it is viewed as a soft touch due to its relatively low crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By location ==
Most criminal activity is focused in the larger metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12180  "Austria 2012 Crime and Safety Report", United States Department of State, Overseas Security Advisory Council, 13 March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Degenia''''' is a monotypic plant genus in the [[Brassicaceae|mustard family]] containing the single species '''''Degenia velebitica''''' ({{lang-hr|velebitska degenija}}).

The '''Dudeşti culture''' is a farming/herding culture that occupied part of [[Romania]] in the [[6th millennium BC]], typified by [[Pit-house|semi-subterranean habitations]] (Zemlyanki) on the edges of low plateaus. This culture contributed to the origin of both the subsequent [[Hamangia culture]] and the [[Boian culture]]. It was named after [[Dudești, Bucharest|Dudeşti]], a quarter in the southeast of Bucharest.

== Nomenclature ==
The [[Greek language|Greek]] name [[Aethiopia|Αἰθιοπία]] (from {{lang|grc|Αἰθίοψ}}, ''Aithiops'', 'an Ethiopian') is a compound word, derived from the two Greek words, from {{lang|grc|αἴθω}} + {{lang|grc|ὤψ}} (''aitho'' "I burn" + ''ops'' "face"). According to the Perseus Digital Library, the designation properly translates as ''Burnt-face'' in noun form and ''red-brown'' in adjectival form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%232329&amp;redirect=true |contribution=Aithiops|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Herodotus]] used the appellation to denote the parts of Africa below the [[Sahara]] that were then known within the [[Ecumene]] (inhabitable world).&lt;ref name=Herodotus1&gt;For all references to Ethiopia in Herodotus, see: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/nebrowser?query=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;id=tgn%2C7000489 this list] at the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu Perseus project].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek formation may be a [[folk etymology]] for the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] term ''athtiu-abu'', which means 'robbers of hearts'.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric. Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. 1966, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Roman Empire|Roman]] epigraphs, ''Aethiopia'' was a specific toponym for ancient [[Nubia]].&lt;ref name="Hatke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatke|first1=George|title=Aksum and Nubia: Warfare, Commerce, and Political Fictions in Ancient Northeast Africa|date=2013|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0814760666|pages=52–53|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=PA4UCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least as early as c. 850,&lt;ref&gt;[[Etymologicum Genuinum]] s.v. Αἰθιοπία; see also [[Aethiopia]]&lt;/ref&gt; the name ''Aethiopia'' also occurs in many translations of the [[Old Testament]] in allusion to Nubia. The ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts identify Nubia instead as [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Ezekiel 29:10&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[New Testament]], the Greek term Aithiops does occur, referring to a servant of Candace or [[Kandake]], possibly an inhabitant of [[Meroë]] in Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 8:27&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Hellenic and Biblical traditions, the [[Monumentum Adulitanum]], a third century inscription belonging to the [[Aksumite Empire]], indicates that Aksum's then ruler governed an area which was flanked to the west by the territory of Ethiopia and Sasu. The Aksumite King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] would eventually conquer Nubia the following century, and the Aksumites thereafter appropriated the designation "Ethiopians" for their own kingdom. In the [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] version of the Ezana inscription, Aἰθιόποι is equated with the unvocalized ''Ḥbštm'' and ''Ḥbśt'' (Ḥabashat), and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of Aksum. This new demonym would subsequently be rendered as ''’ḥbs'' (’Aḥbāsh) in [[Sabaic language|Sabaic]] and as ''Ḥabasha'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Hatke"/&gt;

In the 15th-century Ge'ez ''[[Book of Aksum]]'', the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called ''[[Ityopp'is]]''. He was an extra-Biblical son of [[Cush (Bible)|Cush, son of Ham]], said to have founded the city of [[Axum]].&lt;ref name="Agrvt"&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa Geoscience Review, Volume 10|date=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, and generally outside of Ethiopia, the country was once historically known as Abyssinia. This toponym was derived from the Latinized form of the ancient ''Habash''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoff|first1=Wilfred Harvey|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: travel and trade in the Indian Ocean|date=1912|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|page=62|url=https://archive.org/stream/periplusoferythr00schouoft#page/62/mode/2up|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of&amp;nbsp;[[palaeontology]]. The oldest [[Hominidae|hominid]] discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2 million year old ''[[Ardipithecus|Ardipithicus ramidus]]'' ([[Ardi]]) found by [[Tim D. White]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="OldestHuman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/10/01/oldest.human.skeleton/index.html|title=Oldest human skeleton offers new clues to evolution|last=Ansari|first=Azadeh|date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=CNN.com/technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well known hominid discovery is ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]). Known locally as Dinkinesh, the specimen was found in the [[Awash Valley]] of Ethiopia's [[Afar Region]] in 1974 by [[Donald Johanson]], and is one of the most complete and best preserved adult [[Australopithecus|Australopithecine]] fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made. The hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/human/human_evolution/mother_of_man1.shtml|title=Mother of man – 3.2 million years ago|date=|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dinkinesh"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lucy's Legacy: The Quest for Human Origins|last2=Wong|first2=Kate|date=2010|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0307396402|pages=8–9|last1=Johanson|first1=Donald C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iho1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iho.asu.edu/about/lucys-story|title=Institute of Human Origins: Lucy's Story|last=|first=|date=|accessdate=March 23, 2017|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopia is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of [[anatomically modern human]]s, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The oldest of these local fossil finds, the [[Omo remains]], were excavated in the southwestern [[Omo Kibish]] area and have been dated to the [[Middle Paleolithic]], around 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Mcdougall2005&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = I.| last2 = Brown| last3 = Fleagle | first2 = H. | first3 = G. | journal = Nature | volume = 433| last1 = Mcdougall | title = Stratigraphic placement and age of modern humans from Kibish, Ethiopia| issue = 7027 | pages = 733–736 | date=Feb 2005 | pmid = 15716951 | doi = 10.1038/nature03258|bibcode = 2005Natur.433..733M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, skeletons of ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' were found at a site in the [[Middle Awash]] valley.

According to linguists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing [[Neolithic]] era from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|urheimat]] ("original homeland") in the [[Nile Valley]],&lt;ref name="Zarins"/&gt; or the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="Aane"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1078208 | last1 = Diamond | first1 = J. | last2 = Bellwood | first2 = P. | title = Farmers and Their Languages: The First Expansions | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5619 | pages = 597–603 | year = 2003 |jstor=3834351 | pmid = 12714734|bibcode = 2003Sci...300..597D | url = http://faculty.bennington.edu/%7Ekwoods/classes/enviro-hist/diamond%20agriculture%20and%20language.pdf | type = Submitted manuscript | citeseerx = 10.1.1.1013.4523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.&lt;ref name="Blench143144"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blench|first1=R.|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|date=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0759104662|pages=143–144|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craniometric analysis of the Herto ''Homo sapiens idaltu'' skull found that the fossil was morphologically distinct from crania belonging to modern Afroasiatic-speaking groups from the Horn of Africa and [[Ancient Egypt|Dynastic Egypt]].

===Antiquity===
{{Main|Dʿmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}
[[File:ET Axum asv2018-01 img37 Stelae Park.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Obelisk of Aksum]]]]
Around the 8th century BC, a kingdom known as [[Dʿmt]] was established in northern Ethiopia and [[Eritrea]]. The polity's capital was located at [[Yeha]], in northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]]-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the Red Sea.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay57"/&gt;

Other scholars regard Dʿmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local Agaw peoples and Sabaeans from [[South Arabia]]. However, [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]], one of the [[South Semitic languages]]. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed.&lt;ref&gt;Tamrat, Taddesse (1972) ''Church and State in Ethiopia: 1270–1527''. London: Oxford University Press, pp. 5–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uhlig, Siegbert (ed.) (2005) ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]'', "Ge'ez". Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt; Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay57"/&gt;
[[File:KingEndybisEthiopia227-235CE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aksumite currency]] of the Aksumite king [[Endubis]], 227–35, at the [[British Museum]]. The inscriptions in [[Ancient Greek]] read "ΑΧΩΜΙΤΩ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ" ("KING OF AXUM") and "ΕΝΔΥΒΙΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ" ("KING ENDUBIS"), the Greek language was the [[lingua franca]] by that time so the [[Axumite kings]] used it in coins to simplify foreign trade.]]
After the fall of Dʿmt during the fourth century BC, the Ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the first century AD, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in what is now northern Ethiopia and Eritrea. According to the medieval ''[[Book of Aksum]]'', the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.&lt;ref name="Agrvt"/&gt; Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David W. |last=Phillipson |title=Ancient Ethiopia.

Around 316 AD, [[Frumentius]] and his brother Edesius from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travelers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as [[Slavery in Ethiopia|slaves]]. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum.&lt;ref name="isbn0-313-32273-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adejumobi, Saheed A. |title=The history of Ethiopia |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2007 |page=171 |isbn=978-0-313-32273-0|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3Un6_LGIEyQC&amp;pg=PA171}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Aksumite currency|coin]] dated to 324 shows that Ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after [[Armenia]] did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major power to do so.

As the Aksumite kingdom gradually declined, one of the earliest local Muslim states, the [[Shewa Sultanate|Makhzumi Sultanate]], was established in the [[Shewa]] region. The polity was governed by the Makhzumi dynasty, which reigned over the province until it was deposed around 1280 by the [[Walashma dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville, Stuart Christopher Munro-Hay|title=Islam: An Illustrated History|date=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=978-1441165336|pages=177–178|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=3fKoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During Muhammad's era===
{{Main|Migration to Abyssinia|List of expeditions of Muhammad|Hegira}}
The first interaction that the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] had with Ethiopia was during the reign of [[Aṣḥama ibn Abjar]], who was at the time the Emperor of [[Aksum]] and gave refuge to several [[Muslim]]s in the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] in 614 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Fiaccadori, Gianfranco (2005) "Ellä Säham" in ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'', vol. 2, Wiesbaden&lt;/ref&gt; According to other authors, Ashama may have been the same person as king [[Armah]], or his father or son.&lt;ref&gt;Hable Sellassie, Sergew (1972).  ''Ancient and Medieval Ethiopian History to 1270''. Addis Ababa:  United Printers, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Taddesse Tamrat records that the inhabitants of [[Wiqro]], where the ruler is known as ''Ashamat al-Negashi'', claim that his tomb is located in their village.&lt;ref&gt;Tamrat, Taddesse (1972) ''Church and State in Ethiopia (1270–1527)''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria, Rafiq (1991) ''Muhammad and The Quran'', New Delhi: Penguin Books, pp. 403–4. {{ISBN|0-14-014423-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad's second interaction with Ethiopia was during the [[Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)|Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha]], when he sent [[Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri]] to the King of Ethiopia (then Abyssinia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Al-Mubarakpuri, Safiur-Rahman |title=الرحيق المختوم: بحث في السيرة النبوية على صاحبها افضل الصلاة و السلام|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&amp;pg=PA221|date=2002|publisher=ideas4islam|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Zagwe dynasty|Ethiopian Empire}}
[[File:Lebna Dengel.png|thumb|upright|[[Dawit II]] (Lebna Dengel), [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] (r. 1507–1540) and a member of the [[Solomonic dynasty]]]] 
The [[Zagwe dynasty]] ruled many parts of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea between the early 12th and late 13th century. The name of the [[dynasty]] is derived from the Cushitic-speaking [[Agaw people|Agaw]] of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 AD until the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' (Age of Princes), the [[Solomonic dynasty]] governed the [[Ethiopian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Irvine, "Review: The Different Collections of Nägś Hymns in Ethiopic Literature and Their Contributions." ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London''. School of Oriental and African Studies, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since the Aksumite era. A letter from [[Henry IV of England]] to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Ian (2007) ''The Fears of Henry IV'', p.111. {{ISBN|1-84413-529-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1428, [[Yeshaq I]] sent two emissaries to [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], who sent return emissaries. They failed to complete the return trip.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah]], pp. 13–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The first continuous relations with a European country began in 1508 with Portugal under [[Dawit II]] (Lebna Dengel), who had just inherited the throne from his father.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ET Gondar asv2018-02 img03 Fasil Ghebbi.jpg|thumb|left|The castle of [[Fasilides]]]]
This proved to be an important development, for when the Empire was subjected to the attacks of the [[Adal Sultanate]]'s general and [[imam]], [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (called "''Grañ''&amp;thinsp;" "the Left-handed"), Portugal assisted the Ethiopian emperor by sending weapons and four hundred men, who helped his son [[Gelawdewos]] defeat Ahmad and re-establish his rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah]], pp. 45–52.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Abyssinian–Adal war]] was also one of the first proxy wars in the region, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Portugal]] took sides in the conflict.
When Emperor [[Susenyos I]] converted to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed, resulting in thousands of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah]], pp. 91, 97–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit missionaries]] had offended the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo]] faith of the local Ethiopians. In June 1632, [[Fasilides]], Susenyos' son, declared the state religion again to be the Ethiopian Orthodoxy. He expelled the Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah]], p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Donzel, Emeri, "Fasilädäs" in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'' (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aussa Sultanate===
{{Main|Sultanate of Aussa|Mudaito Dynasty}}
The [[Sultanate of Aussa]] or "Afar Sultanate" succeeded the earlier [[Imamate of Aussa]]. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577 when [[Muhammed Jasa]] moved his capital from [[Harar]] to Aussa ([[Asaita]]) with the split of the [[Adal Sultanate]] into the Sultanate of Aussa and the [[Sultanate of Harar]]. At some point after 1672, the Sultanate of Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam [[Umar Din bin Adam]]'s recorded ascension to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abir|Abir]], p. 23 n.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sultanate was subsequently re-established by [[Kedafu]] around the year 1734. It was thereafter ruled by his [[Mudaito Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abir|Abir]], pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver [[Baton (military)|baton]], which was considered to have magical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zemene Mesafint===
{{Main|Zemene Mesafint}}
[[File:Téwodros II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]]'s rule is often placed as the beginning of modern Ethiopia, ending the decentralized ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' ("Era of the Princes").]]
Between 1755 and 1855, Ethiopia experienced a period of isolation referred to as the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' or "Age of Princes". The Emperors became figureheads, controlled by warlords like [[Ras (title)|''Ras'']] [[Mikael Sehul]] of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], [[Ras (title)|''Ras'']] [[Wolde Selassie]] of Tigray, and by the [[Yejju Oromo tribe|Yejju Oromo dynasty]], such as ''Ras'' [[Gugsa of Yejju]], which later led to 17th-century Oromo rule of Gondar, changing the language of the court from Amharic to [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]].&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Richard, ''The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles'', (London:Oxford University Press, 1967), pp. 139–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx |title=POLITICAL PROGRAM OF THE OROMO PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (OPC) |publisher=Gargaaraoromopc.org |date=23 April 1996 |accessdate=16 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307213227/http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that Ethiopia was completely united and the power in the Emperor restored, beginning with the reign of [[Tewodros II]]. Upon his ascent, he began [[Modernization theory|modernizing]] Ethiopia and recentralizing power in the Emperor. Ethiopia began to take part in world affairs once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-279|title=Ethiopia in the Nineteenth Century|last=Tibebu|first=Teshale|date=June 2018|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Tewodros suffered several rebellions inside his empire. Northern Oromo militias, Tigrayan rebellion, and the constant incursion of Ottoman Empire and Egyptian forces near the Red Sea brought the weakening and the final downfall of Tewodros II. He killed himself in 1868 during his last battle with the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. Emperor Tewodros II was born in [[Begemder]] from a nobleman of [[Qwara Province|Qwara]], where the [[Qwara dialect]] of Agaw language is spoken.

After Tewodros' death, [[Tekle Giyorgis II]] was proclaimed Emperor. He was defeated in the Battles of Zulawu (21 June 1871) and Adua (11 July 1871). Kassai was subsequently declared [[Yohannes IV]] on 21 January 1872. In 1875 and 1876, Turkish/Egyptian forces, accompanied by many European and American 'advisors', twice invaded Abyssinia but were initially defeated: once at the Battle of Gundet losing 800 men, and then in the second invasion, decisively defeated by Emperor Yohannes IV at the [[Battle of Gura]] on 7 March 1875, where the invading forces lost at least 3000 men by death or captured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vislardica.com/VisImperica/Wars/vi_egypt_abyssinia.htm The Egyptians in Abyssinia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226155100/http://vislardica.com/VisImperica/Wars/vi_egypt_abyssinia.htm |date=26 December 2011 }}.

During his reign, Menelik II made advances in road construction, electricity and education; the development of a central taxation system; and the foundation and building of the city of Addis Ababa—which became capital of Shewa Province in 1881. After he ascended to the throne in 1889, it was renamed as Addis Ababa, the new capital of Abyssinia. Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889 in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims. This conflict erupted in the [[Battle of Adwa]] on 1 March 1896 in which Italy's colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.&lt;ref name=igg&gt;International Crisis Group, "Ethnic Federalism and its Discontents".

[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]] at his study at the palace]]
The early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] ''(Ras Tafari)''. Haile Selassie I was born to parents from three of Ethiopia's Afroasiatic-speaking populations: the ''Oromo'' and ''Amhara'', the country's two largest ethnic groups, as well as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]]. He came to power after [[Iyasu V]] was deposed, and undertook [[Modernization under Haile Selassie I|a nationwide modernization campaign]] from 1916, when he was made a ''Ras'' and Regent (''Inderase'') for the [[Queen regnant|Empress Regnant]], [[Zewditu]], and became the ''de facto'' ruler of the Ethiopian Empire. Following Zewditu's death, on 2 November 1930, he succeeded her as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merit.unu.edu/publications/publications-search/|title=U.S. and Soviet Foreign Aid during the Cold War – A Case Study of Ethiopia|last=BROICH|first=TOBIAS|date=2017|website=The United Nations University – Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (UNU-MERIT)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independence of Ethiopia was interrupted by the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], beginning when it was invaded by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] in early October 1935, and Italian occupation of the country (1936–1941).&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, Christopher, "Ḫaylä Śəllase" in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'' (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), pp. 1062–3.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Haile Selassie appealed to the [[League of Nations]] in 1935, delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure, and the 1935 [[Time Person of the Year|''Time'' Man of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755559-1,00.html|title=Man of the Year|date=6 January 1936|publisher=TIME|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the majority of the Ethiopian population lived in rural towns, Italy faced continued resistance and ambushes in urban centers throughout its occupation. Haile Selassie fled into exile in [[Fairfield House, Bath]] and Mussolini was able to proclaim the [[Italian Ethiopia|Empire of Ethiopia]] and the assumption of the imperial title by the Italian king [[Vittorio Emanuele III]], recognized by the countries belonging to the international organization of the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Leggere la storia, Dai Nazionalismi alla Seconda Guerra Mondiale.

In 1937, the Italian massacre of [[Yekatit 12]], in which many Ethiopians were imprisoned and massacred, took place. This was because of a failed attempt to assassinate [[Rodolfo Graziani]], the Viceroy of [[Italian East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arb.crasc.dz/index.php/fr/37-volume-12-n%C2%B0-02-septembre-2016/313-italian-massacres-in-occupied-ethiopia1|title=Italian Massacres in Occupied Ethiopia|last=David|first=Forgacs|date=September 2016|website=Revue Africaine des Livres - Centre de Recherche en Antropologie Sociale et Culturelle|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1897).svg|thumb|left|The 1897 [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] with the [[Lion of Judah]]]]
Following the entry of Italy into World War II, [[British Empire]] forces, together with the ''[[Gideon Force|Arbegnoch]]'' (lit. "patriots", referring to armed resistance soldiers) restored sovereignty of Ethiopia in the course of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] in 1941. An [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla campaign]] continued until 1943. This was followed by British recognition of Ethiopia's full [[sovereignty]], (''i.e.'' without any special British privileges), with the signing of the [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement]] in December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, "Ḫaylä Śəllase", ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'', p. 1063.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 1942, Haile Selassie issued a proclamation that removed Ethiopia's legal basis for slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, Peter P.; McKivigan, John R. and Williams, R. Owen (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_SeZrcBqt-YC Encyclopedia of Antislavery and Abolition]'', Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 248. {{ISBN|0-313-33143-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia had between two and four million slaves in the early 20th century, out of a total population of about eleven million.{{sfn|Campbell|Miers|Miller|2007|p=219}}

In 1952, Haile Selassie orchestrated the federation with Eritrea. He dissolved this in 1962 and illegally annexed Eritrea against the UN Federation Agreement, which resisted and finally won its [[Eritrean War of Independence|war of independence]]. Haile Selassie played a leading role in the formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blackpast.org/1963-haile-selassie-towards-african-unity|title=(1963) Haile Selassie, “Towards African Unity”|last=J.

Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie I owing to the worldwide [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]]. This oil crisis caused a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974; food shortages; uncertainty regarding the succession; border wars; and discontent in the middle class created through modernization.&lt;ref name="Black Book"&gt;''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', pp. 687–695&lt;/ref&gt; The high gasoline prices motivated the taxi drivers and teachers to go on strike on 18 February 1974, and students and workers in Addis Ababa began demonstrating against the government on 20 February 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Valdes Vivo|Valdes Vivo]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The feudal oligarchial cabinet of Akilou Habte Wolde was toppled, and a new government was formed with [[Endelkachew Makonnen]] serving as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Valdes Vivo|Valdes Vivo]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haile Selassie's reign came to an end on 12 September 1974, when he was deposed by the [[Derg]], a Soviet-backed [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] military dictatorship led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Valdes Vivo|Valdes Vivo]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Provisional Military Administrative Council]] established a [[one-party]] [[communist state]] in March 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Africa South of the Sahara 2003|last=Eur|first=|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=9781857431315|location=|pages=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing regime suffered several coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and a huge refugee problem. In 1977, Somalia, which had been receiving assistance and arms from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], invaded Ethiopia in the [[Ogaden War]], capturing part of the Ogaden region. Ethiopia recovered it after it began receiving massive military aid from the USSR, [[Cuba]], [[South Yemen]], [[East Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dagne |first=Haile Gabriel |title=The commitment of the German Democratic Republic in Ethiopia: a study based on Ethiopian sources |publisher=Lit; Global |year=2006 |location=Münster, London |isbn=978-3-8258-9535-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North Korea]].

The [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]] affected around eight million people, resulting in one million dead. Insurrections against Communist rule sprang up, particularly in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. In 1989, the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the coalition known as the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Genocide in Africa|last=Stapleton|first=Timothy J.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2017|isbn=9781440830525|location=|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, the Soviet Union began to retreat from building world communism under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' policies, marking a dramatic reduction in aid to Ethiopia from Socialist Bloc countries. This resulted in more economic hardship and the collapse of the military in the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north. The collapse of Marxism–Leninism in general, and in [[Eastern Europe]] during the [[revolutions of 1989]], coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990. The strategic outlook for Mengistu quickly deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://memory.loc.gov/frd/etsave/et_04_08.html|title=Foreign Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress - American Memory: Remaining Collections.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2110/1/U613342.pdf|title=RESTRUCTURING THE SOVIET-ETHIOPIAN RELATIONSHIP: A CASE STUDY IN ASYMMETRIC EXCHANGE|last=CROWELL ANDERSON-JAQUEST|first=TOMMIE|date=May 2002|website=London School of Economics and Political Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1991, EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa and the Soviet Union did not intervene to save the government side.

Ethiopia's [[Ethiopian general election, 2005|3rd multiparty election]] on 15 May 2005 was highly disputed, with some opposition groups claiming fraud.

The politics of Ethiopia takes place in a framework of a [[Federation|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]], wherein the [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. On the basis of Article 78 of the 1994 Ethiopian Constitution, the [[Judiciary]] is completely independent of the executive and the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicwebs.com/cwvlib/constitutions/ethiopia/constitution_1994.htm Constitution of Ethiopia – 8 December 1994]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509194433/http://www.civicwebs.com/cwvlib/constitutions/ethiopia/constitution_1994.htm |date=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current realities of this provision are questioned in a report prepared by [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/ethiopia|title=Ethiopia {{!}} Country report {{!}} Freedom in the World {{!}} 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=freedomhouse.org|publisher=|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6nM47n5Kc?url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/ethiopia|archive-date=8 January 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-01-08|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abiy Ahmed next einstein forum.jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister of Ethiopia [[Abiy Ahmed|Abiy Ahmed Ali]]]]
According to the [[Democracy Index]] published by the United Kingdom-based [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] in late 2010, Ethiopia is an "authoritarian regime", ranking as the 118th-most democratic out of 167 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf The Economist Intelligence Unit's Index of Democracy 2010]. (PDF). Retrieved on 3 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia has dropped 12 places on the list since 2006, and the latest report attributes the drop to the government's crackdown on opposition activities, media and civil society before the [[Ethiopian general election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election]], which the report argues has made Ethiopia a ''de facto'' one-party state.

In July 2015, during a trip that then US President [[Barack Obama]] took to Ethiopia, he highlighted the role of the country in the fight against Islamic terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/07/26/obama-visit-highlights-ethiopias-role-fighting-islamic-terrorists/30662123/ | work=USA Today | first=Tonny | last=Onyulo | title=Obama visit highlights Ethiopia's role in fighting Islamist terrorists | date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama was the first sitting United States president to visit Ethiopia.

===Governance===
{{Main|Government of Ethiopia}}
The election of Ethiopia's 547-member constituent assembly was held in June 1994. This assembly adopted the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in December 1994. The elections for Ethiopia's first popularly chosen national parliament and regional legislatures were held in May and June 1995. Most opposition parties chose to boycott these elections. There was a landslide victory for the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF). International and non-governmental observers concluded that opposition parties would have been able to participate had they chosen to do so.
[[File:Addis Abeba City hall.jpg|thumb|[[Addis Ababa]]'s city hall]]
The current government of Ethiopia was installed in August 1995. The first President was [[Negasso Gidada]]. The EPRDF-led government of Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] promoted a policy of [[ethnic federalism]], devolving significant powers to regional, ethnically based authorities. Ethiopia today has nine semi-autonomous administrative regions that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues. Under the present government, some fundamental freedoms, including [[freedom of the press]], are circumscribed.&lt;ref name="FH Ethiopia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2007/ethiopia?page=22&amp;year=2007&amp;country=7175 |year=2007 |title=Map of Freedom 2007 |publisher=Freedom House |accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens have little access to media other than the state-owned networks, and most private newspapers struggle to remain open and suffer periodic harassment from the government.&lt;ref name="FH Ethiopia"/&gt; At least 18 journalists who had written articles critical of the government were arrested following the 2005 elections on genocide and treason charges. The government uses press laws governing libel to intimidate journalists who are critical of its policies.&lt;ref name="HRW Ethiopia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/ethiop14704.htm |title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Ethiopia |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=25 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224074548/http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/ethiop14704.htm |archivedate=24 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meles' government was elected in 2000 in Ethiopia's first-ever multiparty elections; however, the results were heavily criticized by international observers and denounced by the opposition as fraudulent. The EPRDF also won the 2005 election returning Meles to power. Although the opposition vote increased in the election, both the opposition and observers from the European Union and elsewhere stated that the vote did not meet international standards for fair and free elections.&lt;ref name="FH Ethiopia"/&gt; Ethiopian police are said to have massacred 193 protesters, mostly in the capital [[Addis Ababa]], in the violence following the May 2005 elections in the [[Ethiopian police massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian probe team criticises judge over report. |url=http://www.kilil5.com/node/4419 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907072116/http://www.kilil5.com/node/4419 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 September 2012 |publisher=Reuters |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=21 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government initiated a crackdown in the provinces as well; in Oromia state the authorities used concerns over insurgency and terrorism to use torture, imprisonment, and other repressive methods to silence critics following the election, particularly people sympathetic to the registered opposition party [[Oromo National Congress]] (ONC).&lt;ref name="HRW Ethiopia"/&gt; The government has been engaged in a conflict with rebels in the [[Ogaden]] region since 2007. The biggest opposition party in 2005 was the [[Coalition for Unity and Democracy]] (CUD). After various internal divisions, most of the CUD party leaders have established the new [[Unity for Democracy and Justice]] party led by Judge [[Birtukan Mideksa]]. A member of the country's [[Oromo people|Oromo]] ethnic group, Ms. Birtukan Mideksa is the first woman to lead a political party in Ethiopia.

In 2008, the top five opposition parties were the Unity for Democracy and Justice led by Judge Birtukan Mideksa, [[United Ethiopian Democratic Forces]] led by Dr. [[Beyene Petros]], [[Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement]] led by Dr. [[Bulcha Demeksa]], [[Oromo People's Congress]] led by Dr. Merera Gudina, and [[Ethiopian Democratic Party|United Ethiopian Democratic Party – Medhin Party]] led by [[Lidetu Ayalew]]. &lt;!--Please clarify the following before reinstating it: The prominent leader of the Unity (Birtukan) is rearrested after accusing her based on "reckless" accusation of her speech in Sweden about her pardon after the 2005 Ethiopian election.--&gt; After the 2015 elections, Ethiopia lost its single remaining opposition MP;&lt;ref name = "AJE opposition"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ethiopia election: No seat in parliament for opposition | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2015/06/ethiopia-election-seat-parliament-opposition-150623150257749.html | website = aljazeera.com | date = 23 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are now no opposition MPs in the Ethiopian parliament.&lt;ref name = "BBC Obama trip"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Obama in Ethiopia for key talks with regional leaders | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33671340 | website = BBC News | date = 27 July 2015 | accessdate = 27 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merera Gudina, leader of the Oromo People's Congress, said the East African country was at a "crossroads". "People are demanding their rights," he said. "People are fed up with what the regime has been doing for a quarter of a century. They're protesting against land grabs, reparations, stolen elections, the rising cost of living, many things. "If the government continue to repress while the people are demanding their rights in the millions that (civil war) is one of the likely scenarios," Merera said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt;

[[File:Map of zones of Ethiopia.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A map of Ethiopia's [[Regions of Ethiopia|regions]] and [[list of zones of Ethiopia|zones]]]]
Before 1996, Ethiopia was divided into thirteen [[Provinces of Ethiopia|provinces]], many derived from historical regions. The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|district]]s (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' ("neighbourhoods").

Since 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&amp;thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&amp;thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.

The constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.

Article 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').

[[File:Köppen_climate_types_of_Ethiopia.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Köppen climate classification]] of Ethiopia]]
At {{convert|435071|sqmi|km2|0|order=flip}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA World Factbook – Rank Order – Area |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html |accessdate=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia is the world's 27th-largest country, comparable in size to [[Bolivia]]. It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].

The major portion of Ethiopia lies on the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. Bordering Ethiopia are [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] to the west, [[Djibouti]] and [[Eritrea]] to the north, [[Somalia]] to the east and [[Kenya]] to the south. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. The great diversity of terrain determines wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation, and settlement patterns.

Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has a large number of [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] ("Simien fox"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.

===Climate===
{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}
[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]
The predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|–|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.
[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]
The modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.

There are on average 7 hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|°C|°F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|°C|°F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|°C|°F|1}}.

Most major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|°C|°F|1}}.

===Wildlife===
{{Main|Wildlife of Ethiopia}}
[[File:Canis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|thumb|The [[Ethiopian wolf]]]]
Ethiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.&lt;ref name="Massicot"/&gt; The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at [[Finicha'a]], this canid is thought to be potentially [[local extinction|locally extinct]]. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.

Ethiopia is a global center of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lepage|first=Denis|title=Bird Checklists of the World|url=http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/checklist.jsp?region=et&amp;list=clements|publisher=Avibase|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered. A large number of these birds feed on butterflies, like the ''[[Bicyclus anynana]].''&lt;ref&gt;Bicyclus, Site of Markku Savela&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, around 420,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (or 35%) of Ethiopia's land was covered by trees, but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 11.9% of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Mongabay.com Ethiopia statistics.

[[File:Ethiopia, Trends in the Human Development Index 1970-2010.png|thumb|Ethiopia's [[Human Development Index]] rating 1970–2010]]
According to the [[IMF]], Ethiopia was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, registering over 10% economic growth from 2004 through 2009.&lt;ref name="Outlook 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Economic Outlook|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/02/pdf/text.pdf|publisher=[[IMF]]|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fastest-growing non-oil-dependent African economy in the years 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia: IMF Positive on Country's Growth Outlook|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200706181790.html|publisher=allAfrica|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the World Bank highlighted that Ethiopia had witnessed rapid economic growth with real domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 10.9% between 2004 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/ethiopia/publication/ethiopia-great-run-growth-acceleration-how-to-pace-it|title=With Continued Rapid Growth, Ethiopia is Poised to Become a Middle Income Country by 2025|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 and 2011, Ethiopia's growth performance and considerable development gains were challenged by high [[inflation]] and a difficult [[balance of payments]] situation. Inflation surged to 40% in August 2011 because of loose [[monetary policy]], large [[civil service]] wage increase in early 2011, and high food prices.&lt;ref name="Ethiopia Overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/ethiopia/overview|title=Economic Overview|date=23 September 2015|publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2011/12, end-year inflation was projected to be about 22%, and single digit inflation is projected in 2012/13 with the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies.&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2012/pr12224.htm|title=Statement by an IMF Staff Mission on the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Ethiopia|date=14 June 2012|publisher=[[IMF]]|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. However, with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks, Ethiopia's economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-industrialoutput-idUSL8N1343EO20151109|title=Ethiopia to launch four more industry parks within two years|date=2015-11-09|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethiopian [[constitution]] defines the right to own land as belonging only to "the state and the people", but citizens may lease land (up to 99 years), and are unable to mortgage or sell. Renting of land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user. Land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Corruption in Ethiopia|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/ethiopia/business-corruption-in-ethiopia.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=8 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406173808/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/ethiopia/business-corruption-in-ethiopia.aspx|archive-date=6 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no land ownership, infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users, which then end up being displaced and without home or land. A lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests. In addition, agricultural productivity remains low, and frequent droughts still beset the country, also leading to internal displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Six_million_children_threatened_by_Ethiopia_drought_UN_999.html |title=Six million children threatened by Ethiopia drought: UN |publisher=Terradaily.com |accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy and hydropower===
{{see also|Energy in Ethiopia|List of power stations in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Renaissance Dam site.jpg|thumb|Layout of the [[Grand Renaissance Dam]].]]
Ethiopia has 14 major rivers, which flow from its highlands, including the [[Nile]]. The country has the largest water reserves in Africa. {{as of|2012}}, hydroelectric plants represented around 88.2% of the total installed electricity capacity. The remaining electrical power was generated from fossil fuels (8.3%) and other renewable sources (3.6%). The electrification rate for the total population in 2013 was 24%, with 85% coverage in urban areas and 10% coverage in rural areas. {{as of|2014}}, total electricity production was 9.5 billion kWh and consumption was 6.7 billion kWh. There were 1.1 billion kWh in electricity exports, 0 kWh in electricity imports, and 2.4 million kW of installed generating capacity.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;

Ethiopia delivers roughly 81% of water volume to the Nile through the river basins of the [[Blue Nile]], [[Sobat River]] and [[Atbara]]. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the [[Water politics in the Nile Basin|1959 Nile Waters Agreement]], which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt under international law vetoed almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/31/business/ethiopia-grand-renaissance-dam/index.html|title=Ethiopia powers on with controversial dam project – CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By Victoria Eastwood and Nima Elbagir|website=CNN|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gilgel Gibe III Dam|Gibe III]] hydroelectric project already generates an estimated 1,870-MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2015/10/power-generation-begins-at-1-870-mw-gibe-iii-hydroelectric-project-in-ethiopia.html|title=Power generation begins at 1,870-MW Gibe III hydroelectric project in Ethiopia|website=www.hydroworld.com|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
[[File:Tef in Ethiopia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Eragrostis tef|Tef]] field near [[Mojo, Ethiopia|Mojo]]]]
Agriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the [[gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include [[coffea|coffee]], [[legume]]s, [[rapeseed|oilseeds]], [[cereal]]s, potatoes, [[sugarcane]], and vegetables.

Exports are almost entirely agricultural commodities (with the exception of [[Gold]] exports), and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner. Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest [[maize]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Get the gangsters out of the food chain | publisher = The Economist | date = 7 June 2007 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/9304411?story_id=9304411 | accessdate = 2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UN estimations the per capita GDP of Ethiopia has reached $357 {{As of|2011|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates | publisher = The United Nations Statistics Division | url = http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=SNAAMA&amp;f=grID%3a101%3bcurrID%3aUSD%3bpcFlag%3a1 | accessdate = 12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report indicated that the life expectancy had improved substantially in recent years.

Cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation. In [[East Africa]], over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep, and goats from Ethiopia sold to [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], and [[Kenya]] generates an estimated total value of between 250 and 300 million USD annually (100 times more than the official figure).&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Pavanello, Sara 2010.

This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions, and promote regional integration.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

The country also has large mineral resources and oil potential in some of the less inhabited regions. Political instability in those regions, however, has inhibited development. Ethiopian geologists were implicated in a major gold swindle in 2008. Four chemists and geologists from the Ethiopian Geological Survey were arrested in connection with a fake gold scandal, following complaints from buyers in South Africa. Gold bars from the National Bank of Ethiopia were found by police to be gilded metal, costing the state around 17 million USD, according to the Science and Development Network website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scidev.net/en/sub-suharan-africa/news/sub-saharan-africa-news-in-brief-13-25-march.html |title=Sub-Saharan Africa news in brief: 13–25 March |publisher=SciDev.Net |date=28 March 2008 |accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] project was commenced. When completed, it will provide surplus [[energy in Ethiopia]] which will be available for export to neighboring countries.

The country's population is highly diverse, containing over 80 different ethnic groups. According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population. The [[Amhara people|Amhara]] represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while [[Somalis]] and [[Tigrayans]] represent 6.22% and 6.08% of the population, respectively. Other prominent ethnic groups are as follows: [[Sidama people|Sidama]] 4.00%, [[Gurage people|Gurage]] 2.52%, [[Welayta people|Welayta]] 2.27%, [[Afar people|Afar]] 1.73%, [[Hadiya people|Hadiya]] 1.72%, [[Gamo people|Gamo]] 1.49% and [[List of ethnic groups in Ethiopia|others]] 12.6%.&lt;ref name=2007Census /&gt;

[[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic-speaking]] communities make up the majority of the population. Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the [[Habesha people]]. The [[Arabic]] form of this term (''al-Ḥabasha'') is the etymological basis of "Abyssinia," the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/timetrails/selassie/hs260809.html |title=Time Europe&amp;nbsp;– Abyssinia: Ethiopian Protest |accessdate=5 June 2005 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040206124546/http://www.time.com/time/europe/timetrails/selassie/hs260809.html |archivedate=6 February 2004 }}. 9 August 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan-speaking]] ethnic minorities inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas of the [[Gambela Region]] which borders [[South Sudan]].

In 2009, Ethiopia hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 135,200. The majority of this population came from Somalia (approximately 64,300 persons), Eritrea (41,700) and Sudan (25,900). The Ethiopian government required nearly all refugees to live in refugee camps.&lt;ref name="World Refugee Survey 2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008 |publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants |date=19 June 2008 |url=http://www.refugees.org/resources/refugee-warehousing/archived-world-refugee-surveys/2009-wrs-country-updates/ethiopia.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502073801/http://www.refugees.org/resources/refugee-warehousing/archived-world-refugee-surveys/2009-wrs-country-updates/ethiopia.html |archivedate=2 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Script===
In terms of [[writing system]]s, Ethiopia's principal orthography is the [[Ge'ez script]]. Employed as an [[abugida]] for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an [[abjad]] to transcribe the Semitic [[Ge'ez language]].&lt;ref&gt;Fattovich, Rodolfo (2003) "Akkälä Guzay" in von Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C''. Weissbaden: Otto Harrassowitz KG, p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]. During the 1980s, the Ethiopic character set was computerized. It is today part of the [[Unicode]] standard as Ethiopic, [[Ethiopic Extended]], [[Ethiopic Supplement]] and [[Ethiopic Extended-A]].

Other writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. The latter include [[Bakri Sapalo]]'s script for Oromiffa.&lt;ref name="HH-551"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0041977X00144209|jstor=616613| title = The Oromo orthography of Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō| journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies| volume = 44| issue = 3| pages = 550| year = 2009| last1 = Hayward | first1 = R.

Ethiopia has close historical ties with all three of the world's major [[Abrahamic religions]]. In the 4th century, the Ethiopian empire was one of the first in the world to officially adopt [[Christianity]] as the state religion.

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] is part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. It is by far the largest Christian denomination, although a number of [[P'ent'ay]] ([[Protestantism|Protestant]]) churches have recently gained ground. Since 1930, a relatively small [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]] has existed in [[full communion]] with Rome, with adherents making up less than 1% of the total population.&lt;ref name="bx"/&gt;

[[Islam in Ethiopia]] dates back to the founding of the religion in 622 when a group of Muslims were counseled by [[Muhammad]] to escape persecution in [[Mecca]].

According to the 2007 Population and Housing Census, around 1,957,944 people in Ethiopia are adherents of [[traditional African religion|traditional religions]]. An additional 471,861 residents practice other creeds.&lt;ref name=2007Census/&gt; While followers of all religions can be found in each region, they tend to be concentrated in certain parts of the country. Christians predominantly live in the northern Amhara and Tigray regions, and are largely members of the non-Chalcedonian Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Those belonging to P'ent'ay are centered in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNP) and Oromia. Muslims in Ethiopia predominantly adhere to [[Sunni Islam]] and generally inhabit eastern and northeastern areas; particularly the Somali, Afar, Dire Dawa and Harari regions.

===Urbanization===

Population growth, migration, and urbanization are all straining both governments' and ecosystems' capacity to provide people with basic services.&lt;ref&gt;Racin, L.

Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization has steadily been increasing in Ethiopia, with two periods of significantly rapid growth. First, in 1936–1941 during the Italian occupation of Mussolini's fascist regime, and from 1967 to 1975 when the populations of urban centers tripled.&lt;ref name="countrystudies1991"&gt;Ofcansky, T and Berry, L. "Ethiopia: A Country Study". Editied by Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991. [http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia Countrystudies.us]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia, building infrastructure to connect major cities, and a dam providing power and water.&lt;ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008"&gt;Shivley, K. "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia" [http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/kshively/index.html Macalester.edu]. Retrieved 15 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This along with the influx of Italians and laborers was the major cause of rapid growth during this period. The second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975 when rural populations migrated to urban centers seeking work and better living conditions.&lt;ref name="countrystudies1991"/&gt;

This pattern slowed due to the 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970–1983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Frank 1991.

====Rural and urban life====
[[File:Gonder from the Goha hotel.jpg|thumb|[[Gondar]] skyline]]
Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia are living on less than 1 dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the [[World Health Organization]]'s minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.&lt;ref name="Crawley"&gt;Crawley, Mike.

Retrieved on 24 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Most poor families (75%) share their sleeping quarters with livestock, and 40% of children sleep on the floor, where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees Celsius in the cold season.&lt;ref name="Crawley"/&gt; The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30-square-meter mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.&lt;ref name="Crawley"/&gt;
[[File:On The Road To Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia (2446794591).jpg|thumb|left|Rural area in the [[Simien Mountains National Park]]]]
The peasant associations face a cycle of poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow, which reduces soil fertility.&lt;ref name="Crawley"/&gt; This [[land degradation]] reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields.&lt;ref name="Crawley"/&gt; Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced.&lt;ref name="Crawley"/&gt; The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working the land and the productivity drops further.&lt;ref name="Crawley"/&gt;

Although conditions are drastically better in cities, all of Ethiopia suffers from [[poverty]] and poor [[sanitation]]. However, poverty in Ethiopia fell from 44% to 29.6% during 2000–2011, according to the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/01/20/poverty-ethiopia-down-33-percent|title=Poverty in Ethiopia Down 33 Percent Since 2000|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]], 55% of the population used to live in slums.&lt;ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008"/&gt; Now, however, a construction boom in both the private and public sector has led to a dramatic improvement in living standards in major cities, particularly in Addis Ababa.

Despite the living conditions in the cities, the people of Addis Ababa are much better off than people living in the peasant associations owing to their educational opportunities. Unlike rural children, 69% of urban children are enrolled in primary school, and 35% of those are eligible to attend secondary school.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008"/&gt; Addis Ababa has its own [[Addis Ababa University|university]] as well as many other secondary schools.

Many NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) are working to solve this problem; however, most are far apart, uncoordinated, and working in isolation.&lt;ref name="Accessed 5-10-08"/&gt; The Sub-Saharan Africa NGO Consortium is attempting to coordinate efforts.&lt;ref name="Accessed 5-10-08"/&gt;

Ethiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable (contagious) diseases worsened by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Over 44 million people (more than half the population) do not have access to clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WaterAid UK – Where we work – Ethiopia|url = http://www.wateraid.org/uk/where-we-work/page/ethiopia|website = www.wateraid.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained doctors and nurses and health facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia/75.htm |title=Ethiopia – Health and Welfare |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of public health is considerably better in the cities. [[Birth rate]]s, [[infant mortality rate]]s, and [[death rate]]s are lower in cities than in rural areas due to better access to education, medicines, and hospitals.&lt;ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008"/&gt; Life expectancy is better in cities compared to rural areas, but there have been significant improvements witnessed throughout the country in recent years, the average Ethiopian living to be 62.2 years old, according to a UNDP report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.et.undp.org/content/ethiopia/en/home/library/mdg/EthiopiaMDG2014.html|title=Ethiopia MDG Report (2014)|website=UNDP in Ethiopia|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Accessed 5-10-08"/&gt; As in other parts of Africa, there has been a steady migration of people towards the cities in hopes of better living conditions.

The government of Ethiopia and many private organizations like World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations, are launching campaigns and are working aggressively to improve Ethiopia's health conditions and promote health awareness on AIDS and other communicable diseases (Dugassa, 2005).

Ethiopia has a relatively high infant and maternal mortality rate. Although, Ethiopia did not meet the MDG target of reducing maternal mortality rate by two thirds in 2015, there are improvements nonetheless. For instance, the contraception prevalence rate increased from 8.1% in 2000 to 41.8% in 2014, and Antenatal care service coverage increase from 29% to an astounding 98.1% in the same period. Currently, the maternal mortality rate stands at 420 per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/user7/Downloads/UNDP%20MDG%202014%20Final2Oct.pdf |title=MDG UNDP Ethiopia |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812155911/http://c/ |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals, while most are born in rural households. Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery (Kater, 2000).  The "WHO estimates that a majority of maternal fatalities and disabilities could be prevented if deliveries were to take place at well-equipped health centers, with adequately trained staff" (Dorman et al., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;622).

The low availability of health-care professionals with modern medical training, together with lack of funds for medical services, leads to the preponderance of less-reliable traditional healers that use home-based therapies to heal common ailments.

One common cultural practice, irrespective of religion or economic status, is [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), a procedure that involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ "WHO | Female genital mutilation"]. ''who.int''.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has been made illegal in Ethiopia in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2004 Penal Code: Article 565 – Female Circumcision; Article 566 – Infibulation of the Female Genitalia [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/70993/75092/F1429731028/ETH70993.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa and parts of the [[Near East]] that has its ultimate origins in [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Rohayes"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1525/ae.1975.2.4.02a00030| title = Female genital mutilation, fertility control, women's roles, and the patrilineage in modern Sudan: A functional analysis1| journal = American Ethnologist| volume = 2| issue = 4| pages = 617–633| year = 1975| last1 = Hayes | first1 = R.

The country has a high prevalence of FGM, but prevalence is lower among young girls. Ethiopia's 2005 Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) noted that the national prevalence rate is 74% among women ages 15–49.&lt;ref&gt;Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (Central Statistics Agency, 2005), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is almost universal in the regions of [[Dire Dawa]], [[Somali Region|Somali]], and [[Afar Region|Afar]]. In the [[Oromia Region|Oromo]] and [[Harari Region|Harari]] regions, more than 80% of girls and women undergo the procedure. FGC is least prevalent in the regions of Tigray and Gambela, where 29% and 27% of girls and women, respectively, are affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-fgm-countries-ethiopia.pdf "Female Genital Mutilation in Ethiopia"], Africa Department, gtz.de, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 study performed by the Population Reference Bureau, Ethiopia has a prevalence rate of 81% among women ages 35 to 39 and 62% among women ages 15–19.&lt;ref&gt;Fedman-Jacobs, Charlotte and Clifton, Donna (February 2010) [http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2010/fgm2010.aspx Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Data and Trends Update 2010]. prb.org&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 UNICEF report found that only 24% of girls under 14 had undergone FGM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unicef.org/resources/fgmc-country-profiles "UNICEF STATISTICS"].

The Government of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia is signatory to various international conventions and treaties that protect the rights of women and children. Its constitution provides for the fundamental rights and freedoms for women. There is an attempt being made to raise the social and economic status of women through eliminating all legal and customary practices, which hinder women's equal participation in society and undermine their social status.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Addis Abeba University (Sam Effron).jpg|thumb|Entrance of [[Addis Ababa University]].]]
Education in Ethiopia was dominated by the Tewahedo Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s. The current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budget finances allocated to the education sector. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Teferra|first1=Damtew|last2=Altbach|first2=Philip G.|title=African Higher Education: An International Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RROdAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34186-0}}, pp. 316–325&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly. Approximately 3 million people were in primary school in 1994/95, and by 2008/09, primary enrolment had risen to 15.5 million – an increase of over 500%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engel|first1=Jakob|title=Ethiopia's progress in education: A rapid and equitablension of access – Summary|url=http://www.developmentprogress.org/sites/developmentprogress.org/files/case-study-summary/ethiopia_web_master_final_summary.pdf|website=Development Progress|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013/14, the country had witnessed significant boost in gross enrolment across all regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/en/search/site?f[0]=im_field_countries%3A1076|title=Search Result: Ethiopia's plans and policies|last=IIEP-UNESCO|first=|date=2017|website=Planipolis|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national GER was 104.8% for boys, 97.8% for girls and 101.3% across both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002317/231724e.pdf|title=National EFA review, 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literacy rate has increased in recent years: according to the 1994 census, the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 23.4%.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt; In 2007 it was estimated to be 39% (male 49.1% and female 28.9%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html "Literacy"] in ''The World Factbook''. ''cia.gov''.&lt;/ref&gt; A report by UNDP in 2011 showed that the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 46.7%. The same report also indicated that the female literacy rate has increased from 27 to 39 percent from 2004 to 2011, and the male literacy rate has increased from 49 to 59 percent over the same period for persons 10 years and older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Human Development Report 2015 Ethiopia {{!}} Human Development Reports|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/national-human-development-report-2015-ethiopia|website = hdr.undp.org|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the literacy rate had further increased, to 49.1% (57.2% male and 41.1% female).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=EDULIT_DS&amp;popupcustomise=true&amp;lang=en#|title=Education|first=|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
{{Main|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}
Ethiopians have a different naming system to the [[family name]]-based Western system. Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first name.

Everyone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''አቶ''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''ወይዘሮ''') for married women; and ''Weyzerīt'' ('''ወይዘሪት''') for unmarried women.

===Calendar===
{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}
[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia, which shows the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]
Ethiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.

Like the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day—which in essence is a [[leap day]]—is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].

Another prominent calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time===
[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from in many Western countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 6 AM as opposed to 12 AM, concurrently with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) 6 hours to the Western time. For example, 2 AM local Addis Ababa time is called "8 at night" in Ethiopia, while 8 PM is called "2 in the evening".

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}
{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}
[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[Injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]
The best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entrées and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others in your group with your own hands—a tradition referred to as "[[Ethiopian cuisine#Gursha|gursha]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Simpsons Episode Well-Received by Ethiopians On Social Media|url=http://www.tadias.com/12/01/2011/the-simpsons-episode-well-received-by-ethiopians-on-social-media-elsewhere/|publisher=Tadias Magazine|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no [[pork]] or [[shellfish]] of any kind, as they are forbidden in the Christian ([[Ethiopian Orthodox]]), Islamic and Jewish faiths.

[[Fit-fit#Kitcha fit-fit|Chechebsa]], [[marqa]], [[chukko]], [[michirra]] and [[dhanga (food)|dhanga]] are the most popular dishes from the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. [[Kitfo]], which originated among the [[Gurage people|Gurage]], is one of the country's most popular delicacies. In addition, ''Doro wot'' is another popular food, originated from the [[Amhara people]] of northwestern Ethiopia.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Tihlo]] (ጥሕሎ)—which is a type of [[dumpling]]—is prepared from roasted barley flour. It originated in the [[Tigray Region]], and is now very popular in [[Amhara Region|Amhara]] and spreading further south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of the people of Tigrai|url=http://www.tigraionline.com/bahlina.html|publisher=Tigrai Online|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===

[[File:Ethiopian Television.JPG|thumb|The [[ETV (Ethiopia)|Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation]] headquarters in Addis Ababa]]
[[ETV (Ethiopia)|Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation]] (EBC), formerly known as ETV, is the government-owned national channel. Other television stations in the country include [[Kana TV]].

The most widely circulated newspapers in Ethiopia are [[Addis Fortune]], [[Capital Ethiopia]], [[Ethiopian Reporter]], Addis Zemen{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} (''Amharic'') and [[Ethiopian Herald]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

===Music===

The [[music of Ethiopia]] is extremely diverse, with each of the country's 80 ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Ethiopian music uses a distinct [[Musical mode|modal system]] that is [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]], with characteristically long intervals between some notes. As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighboring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, and Sudan.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abdullahi |first=Mohamed Diriye |title=Culture and Customs of Somalia |year=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-31333-2 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Nu918tYMB8C&amp;pg=PA170 |quote=Somali music, a unique kind of music that might be mistaken at first for music from nearby countries such as Ethiopia, the Sudan, or even Arabia, can be recognized by its own tunes and styles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tekle"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tekle |first=Amare |title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: from conflict to cooperation |year=1994 |publisher=The Red Sea Press |isbn=978-0-932415-97-4 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC&amp;pg=PA197 |quote=Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan have significant similarities emanating not only from culture, religion, traditions, history and aspirations&amp;nbsp;...

Traditionally, lyricism in Ethiopian song writing is strongly associated with views of patriotism or national pride, romance, friendship, and a most unique type of memoire known as 'Tizita'.

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Addis Ababa Stadium.jpg|thumb|The [[Addis Ababa Stadium]] in Addis Ababa]]
The main sports in Ethiopia are [[track and field]] (particularly [[long distance running]]) and [[Association football|football]]. Ethiopian athletes have won many Olympic gold medals in track and field, most of them in long distance running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/ethiopia|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haile Gebrselassie]] is a world-renowned long distance runner with several [[world record]]s under his belt. [[Kenenisa Bekele]] and [[Tirunesh Dibaba]] are also dominant runners, particularly in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in which they hold the world records.

Other notable Ethiopian athletes are [[Abebe Bikila]], [[Mamo Wolde]], [[Miruts Yifter]], [[Derartu Tulu]], [[Meseret Defar]], [[Almaz Ayana]], [[Birhane Adere]], [[Tiki Gelana]], [[Genzebe Dibaba]], [[Tariku Bekele]], and [[Gelete Burka]]. {{As of|2012}} going into 2013, the current national Ethiopian football team (Walayia Antelopes) has made itself history by qualifying for the 2012 African Cup of Nations (CAF) and more recently by reaching the last 10 African football teams in the last stage of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Noted players include captain [[Adane Girma]] and top scorer [[Saladin Said]].

Ethiopia has Sub-Saharan Africa's longest [[basketball]] tradition as it established a [[Ethiopia national basketball team|national basketball team]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/FIBA/fibaStru/nfLeag/nfProf.asp?nationalFederationNumber=279 FIBA National Federations – Ethiopia], fiba.com, accessed 24 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faerie Knight''' was, in the [[Matter of Britain]], a bastard son of [[Tom a'Lincoln]] and [[Caelia]], the [[Fairy Queen|Faerie Queen]]. His proper name is never given. He appears in [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''Tom a' Lincoln''.

Tom himself was a bastard of [[King Arthur]] with Angelica, daughter of the Earl of [[London]]. Therefore, the Faerie Knight was, like [[Sons of Mordred|Melehan, Melou]] and the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]], Arthur's grandson.

Being half-[[Fairy|faerie]], the Faerie Knight inherited some of his mother's magical talents. He met his half-brother, the Black Knight (another bastard of Tom's), and they traveled together on many adventures.

The '''flag of [[Donetsk]]''', [[Ukraine]], has two horizontal stripes with the shield (in [[escutcheon (heraldry)|heraldry, an ''escutcheon'']]) of the city's [[coat of arms]] overlaid centrally.

== Description ==

A rectangular panel with a ratio of 1.5 length to 1.2 width ([[5:4]]). The flag is divided horizontally into two equal parts, the top half colored [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] and the bottom [[sable (heraldry)|sable]] (black). Overlaid in the center lies the shield (escutcheon) from the [[coat of arms of Donetsk]].  The flag is hoist at the left, with the flagpole tipped.&lt;ref name="vxru"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vexillographia.ru/ukraine/towns/doneck.htm |script-title=ru:Флаг Донецка |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CdFTTLek?url=http://www.vexillographia.ru/ukraine/towns/doneck.htm |archivedate=2012-12-03 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |df= }} "Approved by the Decision №13 / 5 of Donetsk City Council September 27, 2004"&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield is a [[pentagon|pentagonal]] extension of a rectangle, with an [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] (gold) hand clutching a hammer as if to strike, with a star at the edge of the top right [[canton (heraldry)|canton]], which should not be confused with it being at the [[canton (flag)|upper dexter corner of the flag]] itself, which generally signifies a war flag.

The shield is a symbol from [[socialist heraldry]] and denotes the city's status as a major centre for the mining of [[coal]] and production of [[steel]].&lt;ref name="vxru"/&gt;

'''Greeklish''', a [[portmanteau]] of the words '''Greek''' and '''English''', also known as '''Grenglish''', '''Latinoellinika'''/'''Λατινοελληνικά''' or '''[[ASCII]] Greek''', is the [[Greek language]] written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Unlike standardized systems of [[Romanization of Greek]], as used internationally for purposes such as rendering Greek proper names or place names, or for [[bibliography|bibliographic]] purposes, the term ''Greeklish'' mainly refers to informal, ad-hoc practices of writing Greek text in environments where the use of the [[Greek alphabet]] is technically impossible or cumbersome, especially in electronic media. Greeklish was commonly used on the Internet when Greek people communicate by [[Internet forum|forum]], [[e-mail]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[instant messaging]] and occasionally on [[Short message service|SMS]], mainly because older operating systems did not have the ability to write in Greek, or in a [[unicode]] form like [[UTF-8]]. Nowadays most Greek language content appears in the Greek alphabet.

Sometimes, the term Greeklish is also used informally for a non-standard language variety used by [[bilingualism|bilingual]] speakers of English and Greek, i.e. Greek with heavy [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] or [[code-switching]] admixture of English words, or vice versa.

==History==
Some older traditions of using the Latin alphabet for Greek existed in earlier centuries. The term '''frankolevantinika''' properly refers to the use of the Latin script to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism. ("Frankos" is an older Greek term for Roman Catholic.) This usage was routine in the Venetian-ruled Greece and in [[Venetian Crete]] in the early modern era. Indeed, the autograph manuscripts of several Greek literary works of the Renaissance are in Latin script (e.g. the comedy ''Fortounatos'' by Markos Antonios Foskolos, 1655). This convention was also known as '''frankochiotika'''/'''φραγκοχιώτικα''', "Frankish/Catholic Chiot", alluding to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of [[Chios]].

==Orthographic and phonetic Greeklish==
Greeklish may be [[Orthography|orthographic]] or [[phonetic]]. In orthographic use, the intent is to reproduce Greek orthography closely: there is a one-to-one mapping between Greek and Latin letters, and digraphs are avoided, with occasional use of punctuation or numerals resembling Greek letters rather than Latin digraphs. While letters are in the first instance chosen for phonetic similarity, visual equivalence, and corresponding keyboard keys, are used when phonetically similar letters are exhausted. Thus, psi (ψ) may be written as '''ps, 4''' or '''y'''; xi (ξ) as  '''ks, x''' or '''3'''; and theta (θ) as  '''th''' or '''8'''.

In phonetic use, there is no concern to reproduce Greek orthography, and the Greeklish is a phonetic transcription (usually with English phonetic norms, sometimes with other languages' like German) of Greek words — although often there is a mixture of the two. In particular, [[iotacism]] is preserved: the various letters and digraphs now pronounced as /i/ are transcribed as '''i''', and not differentiated as they are in an orthographic scheme (e.g. '''h''', '''i''', '''u''', '''ei''', '''oi''' for η ι υ ει οι). In a phonetic scheme, xi is usually '''x''' or '''ks''' or '''3'''; '''ks''' or '''3''' is used if '''x''' has been chosen, following orthographic norms, for chi (χ). Psi and theta will usually be the digraphs '''ps''' and '''th'''. '''3''' is often used to represent xi (ξ) because of the similar shape of the number 3 to the original letter albeit mirrored.

An example of [[orthography|orthographic]] Greeklish could be the word '''''"plateia"''''', which in Greek means ''"square"'' and using the Greek alphabet is spelled ''"πλατεία"''. The word ''"plateia"'' derives from the exact replacement of each Greek letter with its Latin respective: π='''p''', λ='''l''', α='''a''', τ='''t''', ε='''e''', ι='''i''', α='''a'''.

An example of [[phonetic]] Greeklish could be the same word, ''"square"'', written like this: '''''"platia"'''''. The reason the same word is, in this occasion, written without the letter "e", is the fact that, phonetically, the word "square" in Greek [[sounds]] '''exactly''' like this: ''"plat'''i'''a"'' (since -"εί"- is now pronounced /i/, as an instance of iotacism), but not for the [[Ancient Greek phonology|phonology]] and the historical or learned pronunciation of the [[Ancient Greek]] language (where it was ''"plateia''").

The most extreme case of orthographic Greeklish, which achieves the greater optical resemblance to the Greek prototypes, is perhaps the so-called "byzantine" or "arabesque" or "calligraphic/artistic" Greeklish introduced in the [http://www.greece.org/hellas/Hlist.html Hellas mailing list] by the mathematician [http://www.oswego.edu/~baloglou/ George Baloglou]. Main characteristics of Baloglou's "byzantine" is the distinction of σ and s (σ='''c''' ς='''s'''), the distinction οf lower and upper letters, such as π='''n''', Π='''TT''' or '''5''', θ='''8''', Θ='''0''' or '''Q''', ψ='''y''', Ψ='''4''', and the unusual, but with great resemblance with the Greek prototype, transliterations σ='''c''', π='''n''' ρ='''p''' Ρ='''P'''.

Since there were many relevant differences both in the written and in the spoken language -such as in the grammar, orthography and phonology of Greek- at the time of the [[Ancient Greek phonology|Ancient Greek]], the [[Koine Greek|Koine]], [[Jewish Koine Greek|Jewish Koine]], [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and [[Modern Greek|Modern]], thus the same word across the history may change outstandingly  and therefore have multiple choices of "rendering" ([[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]) depending on the time on which the referring text was written or translated.

==Books written in Greeklish==
Giannis Androutsopoulos (see references) talks about ''Exegesis'', a book in Greeklish that was published by Oxy Publications in 2000. The Greeklish transliteration was based on the Greek translation of the original book written by [[Astro Teller]]. A novel about artificial intelligence, it describes a computer program that has acquired a "mind" of its own. The original book was written entirely in the form of e-mail messages, something that prompted Androutsopoulos and his collaborators to publish a version of it in Greeklish.

==Computer usage==
In the past there was a variety of mutually incompatible systems for displaying non-ASCII characters (IBM 437, ELOT 928, ISO 8859-7 plus a few company-specific encodings) and no standard method for typing them on a computer keyboard. This situation was resolved with the introduction of [[Unicode]]. Before the introduction of Unicode-compatible software (web servers and clients) many Greek personal or informal web sites were written in Greeklish. This is no longer the case and most (if not all) of the sites with Greek content are written in native Greek.

Almost all electronic mail messaging was also using Greeklish, and only recently, with the introduction of full Unicode compatibility in modern e-mail client software and gradual replacement of older programs, that usage of Greek characters became widespread.

Some [[Internet Service Provider]]s in Greece use both Greek and Greeklish in their [[email]]s. For example, the corporate announcements sent to users via email are usually written in English, Greek, and Greeklish. This is done to ensure that the recipient can understand an important service message even if the settings of their computer for non-ASCII characters don't match those of the sender.

==Commercial use==

=== Use in advertisements ===
As of 2008, business advertisements using Greeklish have appeared in [[Attiko Metro]] and other areas. Companies that have used Greeklish in some of their advertisements include [[Pizza Hut]], [[Forthnet]] and [[Vodafone]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Use in business communication===
Use of Greeklish for business purposes or business communication is considered as a lack of business ability or respect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Current trends==
Around 2004, after most computer software became compatible with Unicode UTF-8 or UTF-16 systems, use of Greeklish was strongly discouraged in many Greek online Web discussion boards (forums) where Greeklish was in use before. Administrators threatened to ban users who continued to use Greeklish, thus making the use of Greek mandatory; but using Greeklish failed to become a serious reason to get banned. Examples include the [http://www.translatum.gr/forum/ Translatum Greek Translation Forum], the     [http://www.awmn.net/forum/ Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network Forum], the     [http://venus.cslab.aueb.gr/forum/ Venus Project Forum], the [http://adslgr.com/ adslgr.com Forum], the [http://www.e-steki.gr e-steki.gr] forum, the [http://www.greektechforum.com/ Greek Technological Forum] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150217003912/http://www.e-foititis.gr/ e-foititis.gr] Greek student forum. The reason for this is the fact that text written in Greeklish is considerably less aesthetically pleasing, and also much harder to read, compared to text written in the Greek alphabet. A non-Greek speaker/reader can guess this by this example: "δις ιζ χαρντ του ριντ" would be the way to write "this is hard to read" in English but utilizing the Greek alphabet.

A counterargument used by forum users is that a fair number of users live abroad and access the Internet from computers they don't own (university, internet cafes, etc.). There, they are not able to install additional keyboard layouts so they don't have the ability to type in Greek, therefore Greeklish is the only option available to them.

On Greek [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channels and [[Instant Messaging|IM]] [[application software|applications]], most of the time only Greeklish is used because it is simpler to type and typing errors are more easily excused. However, Greeklish has been criticised because the user's text bypasses spellcheck, resulting in lowering their ability to write native Greek correctly.

On the Facebook social networking web site there are various groups against the use of "Greeklish".

Wide use for Greeklish in long texts as of 2010, is unusual.

Another current trend in Greeklish is the introduction of [[Leet]] phrasing and vocabulary. Many Leet words or slang have been internalized within the Greek spoken language through Greek gamers online in games such as [[World of Warcraft]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Greeklish-to-Greek conversion==
Since the appearance of Greeklish there have been numerous attempts to develop applications for automatic conversion from Greeklish to Greek. Most of them can cope with only some of Greeklish transliteration patterns and can be found and downloaded from the Internet. The first complete system for automatic transcription of Greeklish into Greek, obtaining correct spelling is [http://speech.ilsp.gr/greeklish/greeklishdemo.asp '' All Greek to Me!'' ], developed and provided by [http://www.ilsp.gr/ Institute for Language and Speech Processing].

The first open online application for the transcription of Greeklish to Greek, was developed by Artificial Intelligence Group at University of Patras, named deGREEKLISH.

An open source Greeklish converter, written in the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language, is available as a [http://sites.google.com/site/freesmsuk/Home/greeklish-text-converter stand alone program].

The '''Guinean League for Ecological Protection''' ({{lang-pt|Liga Guineense para a Protecção Ecológica}}, LIPE) is a [[political party]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The party was established on 20 July 1991 by [[Bubácar Rachid Djaló]], and was legalised on 8 September 1993.&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p255&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 it joined the [[Union for Change]], an alliance formed to contest the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1994|1994 general elections]]. Djaló was the Union's presidential candidate, but received only 3% of the vote. However, the UM did win six seats in the [[National People's Assembly (Guinea-Bissau)|National People's Assembly]].

The [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1999–2000|1999–2000 elections]] saw the UM lose three seats. Djaló remained the alliance's presidential candidate, but again received only 3% of the vote. Following the Union's support for the victorious [[Kumba Ialá]] in the run-off election, Djaló became Secretary of State for Commerce.&lt;ref name=M1&gt;Mendy, p256&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 LIPE left the UM and joined the [[Electoral Union]] (UE) alliance, which won two seats in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref name=M1/&gt; The UE was dissolved prior to the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]] and LIPE ran alone, receiving just 233 votes (0.05%). The party's application to contest the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 2014|2014 general elections]] was rejected by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anacao.cv/online/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4420:guine-bissau-supremo-chumba-oito-candidaturas-presidenciais-e-sete-partidos&amp;catid=87:destaque&amp;Itemid=475 GUINÉ-BISSAU: SUPREMO “CHUMBA” OITO CANDIDATURAS PRESIDENCIAIS E SETE PARTIDOS] A Nação, 16 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg lies on the [[River Elbe]] and two of its [[tributaries]], the [[River Alster]] and the [[Bille (Elbe)|River Bille]]. 

The official name reflects [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg's history]] as a member of the medieval [[Hanseatic League]] and a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Before the 1871 [[Unification of Germany]], it was a fully [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[city state]], and before 1919 formed a civic republic [[constitutional monarchy|headed constitutionally]] by a class of hereditary [[grand burgher]]s or {{lang|de|[[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseaten]]}}. Beset by disasters such as the [[Great Fire of Hamburg]], [[north Sea flood of 1962]] and military conflicts including [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|World War II bombing raids]], the city has managed to recover and emerge wealthier after each catastrophe.

Hamburg is Europe's third-largest port. Major regional broadcasting firm [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]], the printing and publishing firm {{lang|de|[[Gruner + Jahr]]|italic=no}} and the newspapers {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]|italic=yes}} and {{lang|de|[[Die Zeit]]|italic=yes}} are based in the city.

The city hosts specialists in world economics and international law, including [[list of diplomatic missions in Hamburg|consular and diplomatic missions]] as the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]], the [[EU-LAC Foundation]], and the [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning]], multipartite international political conferences and summits such as [[Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe|Europe and China]] and the [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|G20]]. Former German Chancellor {{lang|de|[[Helmut Schmidt]]|italic=no}} and [[Angela Merkel]], German chancellor since 2005, come from Hamburg.

The city is a major international and domestic [[#Tourism|tourist destination]]. It [[mercer Quality of Living Survey|ranked 18th]] in the world for [[livability]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imercer.com/content/quality-of-living.aspx |title=2015 Quality of Living survey |publisher=Mercer.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|de|[[Speicherstadt]]}} and {{lang|de|Kontorhausviertel}} were declared [[World Heritage Site]]s by [[UNESCO]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marketing.hamburg.de/unesco-welterbe.html Media release] on the website of Hamburg Marketing, retrieved on 19 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg is a major European [[education in Hamburg|science, research, and education hub]], with several universities and institutions. Among its most notable cultural venues are the {{lang|de|[[Elbphilharmonie]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|[[Laeiszhalle]]|italic=no}} concert halls. It gave birth to movements like {{lang|de|[[Hamburger Schule]]}} and paved the way for bands including [[The Beatles in Hamburg|The Beatles]]. Hamburg is also known for several [[list of theatres in Hamburg|theatres]] and a variety of musical shows.

==Geography==
[[File:Hamburg-Elbphilharmonie.jpg|alt=Elbphilharmonie|thumb|The iconic [[Elbphilharmonie]] in [[HafenCity|Hafen-City,]] seen from the [[Speicherstadt]]. ]]
Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], between [[Continental Europe]] to the south and [[Scandinavia]] to the north, with the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the northeast. It is on the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] at its confluence with the [[Alster]] and [[Bille (Elbe)|Bille]]. The city centre is around the [[Binnenalster]] ("Inner Alster") and [[Außenalster]] ("Outer Alster"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The islands of [[Neuwerk]], [[Scharhörn]], and [[Nigehörn]], {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} away in the [[Wadden Sea National Parks|Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]], are also part of the city of Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park Act {{Citation |title=Gesetz über den Nationalpark Hamburgisches Wattenmeer |url=http://www.landesrecht.hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bshaprod.psml?doc.id=jlr-WattMGHArahmen&amp;st=lr&amp;showdoccase=1&amp;paramfromHL=true#focuspoint|date=9 April 1990 |accessdate=26 February 2011|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighborhoods of [[Neuenfelde]], [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]], Francop and [[Finkenwerder]] are part of the ''[[Altes Land]]'' (old land) region, the largest contiguous fruit-producing region in [[Central Europe]]. [[Neugraben-Fischbek]] has Hamburg's highest elevation, the [[Hasselbrack]] at {{convert|116.2|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|AMSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=''Geologisches Landesamt Hamburg'' (Hamburg State Geological Department) |title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2007/2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Statistisches Amt für Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein |location=Hamburg |issn=1614-8045|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamburg borders the [[states of Germany|states]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Lower Saxony]].

===Climate===
Hamburg has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), influenced by its proximity to the coast and marine air masses that originate over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also enjoy a maritime temperate climate. The amount of snowfall has differed a lot during the past decades: while in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at times heavy snowfall occurred,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndr.de/kultur/geschichte/chronologie/197879-Schneekatastrophe-legt-Norden-lahm,schneechaosindex100.html Report] on the snowfall desaster of 1978/1979 in northern Germany, retrieved on 20 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the winters of recent years have been less cold, with snowfall only on a few days per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.de/primaklima/2010/12/07/kalte-winter-in-europa/ Article] on the winters in Germany, retrieved on 20 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winterchronik.de/winter-chronik.jsf;jsessionid=20F25C886A43B1A698DA6B01BB5FCA95 Comparison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007000947/http://www.winterchronik.de/winter-chronik.jsf%3Bjsessionid%3D20F25C886A43B1A698DA6B01BB5FCA95 |date=7 October 2016 }} of the weather and snowfall in German winters (from 1950 on), retrieved on 20 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hamburg in 1150.jpg|thumb|right|Hamburg in 1150]]

===Origins===
[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (2nd century AD) reported the first name for the vicinity as '''Treva'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/mapping-ancient-germania-berlin-researchers-crack-the-ptolemy-code-a-720513-2.html|title=Mapping Ancient Germania: Berlin Researchers Crack the Ptolemy Code|first=Matthias|last=Schulz|date=1 October 2010|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Hamburg comes from the first permanent building on the site, a [[castle]] which the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] ordered constructed in AD 808. It rose on rocky terrain in a marsh between the [[Alster|River Alster]] and the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] as a defence against [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] incursion, and acquired the name ''Hammaburg'', ''burg'' meaning castle or fort. The origin of the ''Hamma'' term remains uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite id=Verg&gt;{{Citation |last1=Verg |first1=Erich |last2=Verg|first2=Martin|year=2007 |title=Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt |edition=4th |location=Hamburg |publisher=Ellert&amp;Richter |isbn=978-3-8319-0137-1 |page=8|language=de}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as does the exact location of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hammaburg – der große Irrtum |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/12/12/826430.html |date=12 December 2007 |publisher=Hamburg Abendblatt |accessdate=30 September 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Hamburg===
In 834, Hamburg was designated as the seat of a [[Prince-Bishop|bishopric]]. The first bishop, [[Ansgar]], became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]] as the [[List of administrators, archbishops, bishops, and prince-archbishops of Bremen|Bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]].&lt;ref name=verg15&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, 600 [[Viking]] ships sailed up the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] and destroyed Hamburg, at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="verg15"/&gt; In 1030, King [[Mieszko II Lambert]] of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]] burned down the city. [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The [[Black Death]] killed at least 60% of the population in 1350.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Hamburg experienced several great fires in the medieval period.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1189, by imperial charter, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I "Barbarossa"]] granted Hamburg the status of an [[Free Imperial City]] and tax-free access (or [[free-trade zone]]) up the Lower Elbe into the North Sea. In 1265, an allegedly forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=verg26&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This charter, along with Hamburg's proximity to the main trade routes of the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]], quickly made it a major port in [[Northern Europe]]. Its trade alliance with [[Lübeck]] in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. On 8 November 1266, a contract between [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a ''hanse'' in London. This was the first time in history that the word ''hanse'' was used for the trading guild of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref name=verg30&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 30
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1270, the solicitor of the [[senate of Hamburg]], ''Jordan von Boitzenburg'', wrote the first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in the German language, the ''Ordeelbook'' (''Ordeel'': sentence).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 1410, civil unrest forced a compromise (German: ''Rezeß'', literally meaning: withdrawal). This is considered the first [[constitution of Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529, the city embraced [[Lutheranism]], and it received [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed]] refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]].

===Modern times===
When [[Jan van Valckenborgh]] introduced a second layer to the fortifications to protect against the [[Thirty Years War]] in the seventeenth century, he extended Hamburg and created a "New Town" (''Neustadt'') whose street names still date from the grid system of roads he introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carltoepferstiftung.de/img/pdf/tourist_information_inner_pages.pdf History of the area] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206104950/http://www.carltoepferstiftung.de/img/pdf/tourist_information_inner_pages.pdf |date=6 February 2013 }}, accessed 3 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial City]] of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges ([[Mediatization|mediatised]]), but became a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state with the official title of the ''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg''. Hamburg was briefly annexed by [[Napoleon I]] to the [[First French Empire]] (1804–1814/1815). Russian forces under [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]] finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the [[German Confederation]] (1815–1866).

In 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the "[[Great Fire of Hamburg|Great Fire]]". The fire started on the night of 4 May and was not extinguished until 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.

After periodic political unrest, particularly in [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]], Hamburg adopted in 1860 a semidemocratic constitution that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations included the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the [[North German Confederation]] (1866–1871) and of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918), and maintained its self-ruling status during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933). [[Accession of Hamburg to the German Customs Union (Zollverein)|Hamburg acceded to the German Customs Union or Zollverein]] in 1888, the last (along with Bremen) of the German states to join. The city experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade helped make it Europe's second-largest port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%202011.pdf |title=World Port Ranking 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]], with [[Albert Ballin]] as its director, became the world's largest [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] shipping company around the start of the 20th century. Shipping companies sailing to [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[East Asia]] were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for many Germans and [[Eastern Europe]]ans to emigrate to the [[United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves there.

A major outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.

===Second World War===
[[File:Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945. CL3400.jpg|thumb|[[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg after the 1943 bombing]]]]
[[File:Hamburg Medienbunker 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|''[[Flak tower|Flakturm]]'' on the Heiligengeistfeld in Hamburg – one of four enormous fortress-like bunkers which were built of reinforced concrete between 1942 and 1944 and equipped with anti-aircraft artillery for air defense]]

In [[Nazi Germany]] (1933–1945), Hamburg was a ''[[Administrative division of Nazi Germany|Gau]]'' from 1934 until 1945. During the [[Second World War]], Hamburg suffered a series of Allied [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|air raids]] which devastated much of the city and the harbour. On 23 July 1943, Royal Air Force ([[Royal Air Force|RAF]]) firebombing created a [[firestorm]] which spread from the ''Hauptbahnhof'' (main railway station) and quickly moved south-east, completely destroying entire boroughs such as [[Hammerbrook]], [[Billbrook]] and [[Hamm, Hamburg|Hamm South]]. Thousands of people perished in these densely populated working class boroughs. The raids, codenamed [[Operation Gomorrah]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], killed at least 42,600 civilians; the precise number is not known.
About one million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids. While some of the boroughs destroyed were rebuilt as residential districts after the war, others such as Hammerbrook were entirely developed into office, retail and limited residential or industrial districts. 

The [[Hamburg Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery]] is in the greater [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] in the north of Hamburg.

At least 42,900 people are thought to have perished&lt;ref name="kz-neuengamme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |title=Gedenkstätte Konzentrationslager Neuengamme |publisher=Kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |date= |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] (about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city in the marshlands), mostly from epidemics and in the [[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|bombing of Kriegsmarine evacuation vessels]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] at the end of the war.

Hamburg had the greatest concentration of Jews in Germany. Systematic [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent]] started on 18 October 1941. These were all directed to [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe]] or to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Most deported persons perished in [[the Holocaust]]. By the end of 1942 the ''Jüdischer Religionsverband in Hamburg'' was dissolved as an independent legal entity and its remaining assets and staff were assumed by the [[Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland]] (District Northwest). On 10 June 1943 the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] dissolved the ''Reichsvereinigung'' by a decree.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. 'Schreiben der Geheimen Staatspolizei – Staatspolizeileitstelle Hamburg – an den Oberfinanzpräsidenten, Vermögensverwaltungsstelle vom 1. Juni 1943', Staatsarchiv Hamburg, Bestand Oberfinanzpräsident, Arb. Sign. 31/1 A, here after: ''Vierhundert Jahre Juden in Hamburg: eine Ausstellung des Museums für Hamburgische Geschichte vom 8. November 1991 bis 29. März 1992'', Ulrich Bauche (ed.), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, 1991, (Die Geschichte der Juden in Hamburg; vol. 1), p. 492, {{ISBN|3-926174-31-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few remaining employees not somewhat protected by a [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriage]] were deported from Hamburg on 23 June to [[Theresienstadt]], where most of them perished.

===Post-war history===
Hamburg surrendered without a fight to [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] on 3 May 1945,&lt;ref&gt;
Ortwin Pelc, Kriegsende in Hamburg, Hamburg 2005&lt;/ref&gt; three days after [[Adolf Hitler]]'s death. After the [[Second World War]], Hamburg formed part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British Zone of Occupation]]; it became a state of the then [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949.

From 1960 to 1962, [[the Beatles]] launched their career by playing in various music clubs like the Star Club in the city.

On 16 February 1962, a [[North Sea flood of 1962|North Sea flood]] caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one-fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people.

The [[Inner German border]] – only {{convert|50|km|mi|-1}} east of Hamburg – separated the city from most of its hinterland and reduced Hamburg's global trade. Since [[German reunification]] in 1990, and the accession of several [[Central Europe]]an and [[Baltic states]] into the [[European Union]] in 2004, the [[Port of Hamburg]] has restarted ambitions for regaining its position as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre.

There were 915,319 women and 945,440 men in Hamburg. For every 1,000 females, there were 1,033 males. In 2015, there were 19,768 births in Hamburg (of which 38.3% were to unmarried women); 6422 marriages and 3190 divorces, and 17,565 deaths. In the city, the population was spread out with 16.1% under the age of 18, and 18.3% were 65 years of age or older. 356 People in Hamburg were over the age of 100.&lt;ref name="Statistikamt Nord"&gt;https://www.statistik-nord.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Statistische_Berichte/bevoelkerung/A_I_S_1_j_H/A_I_S1_j16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Statistical Office for Hamburg and [[Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig Holstein]], the number of people with a migrant background is at 34% (631,246).&lt;ref name="statistik-nord.de"&gt;https://www.statistik-nord.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Statistik_informiert_SPEZIAL/SI_SPEZIAL_V_2017_Korrektur.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants come from 180 different countries. 5,891 people have acquired German cititzenship in 2016.&lt;ref name="statistik-nord.de1"&gt;https://www.statistik-nord.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Jahrb%C3%BCcher/Hamburg/JB16HH_Gesamt_Internet_min.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{See also|Hamburgisch dialect}}

Like elsewhere in Germany, [[Standard German]] is spoken in Hamburg, but as typical for northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is [[Low German]], usually referred to as ''Hamborger Platt'' (German ''Hamburger Platt'') or ''[[Hamburgisch|Hamborgsch]]''. Since large-scale [[Standard language|standardization]] of the German language beginning in earnest in the 18th century, various Low German-colored dialects have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates). Originally, there was a range of such [[Missingsch]] varieties, the best-known being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat more bourgeois ''Hanseatendeutsch'' (Hanseatic German), although the term is used in appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Die deutsche Sprache—eine Dialektlandschaft |title=Nationalatlas Bundesrepublik Deutschland |last=Bausch |first=Karl-Heinz |url=http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |year=2007 |accessdate=24 September 2008 |publisher=Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde |location=Leipzig |isbn=3-8274-0947-0 |pages=94–95 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719043439/http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these are now moribund due to the influences of Standard German used by education and media. However, the former importance of Low German is indicated by several songs, such as the famous [[sea shanty]] [[Hamborger Veermaster]], written in the 19th century when Low German was used more frequently. Many toponyms and street names reflect Low Saxon vocabulary, partially even in Low Saxon spelling, which is not standardised, and to some part in forms adapted to Standard German.&lt;ref&gt;Several places are named ...brook (Billbrook, Brooktor, Grasbrook, Hammerbrook, Hellbrook, Iserbrook) rather than Standard German ...bruch (neutr.; =brook riverscape), Bullenhusen rather than Bullenhausen, Lohbrügge rather than Lohbrücke, several localities starting with Nien... (Niendorf, Nienstedten) rather than Neuen..., or ending ...hude (Dockenhuden, Harvestehude, Winterhude) rather than ...hut[ung] (fem.; =pasture), Uhlenhorst rather than Eulenhorst, several places and water bodies are named ...bek (Barmbek, Eilbek, Fischbek, Flottbek, Goldbek, Isebek, Kirchsteinbek, Langenbek, Osterbek, Pepermölenbek, Wandsbek) rather than ...bach, several places and water bodies are called ...fleet (Alsterfleet, Bleichenfleet, Moorfleet) rather than ...fließ (=brook, stream). Further toponyms with no close Standard German correspondents appear, such as ...büttel (=inhabited place; Eimsbüttel, Fuhlsbüttel, Hummelsbüttel, Poppenbüttel, Wellingsbüttel) or Twiete (=alley wedged between buildings). Like in other parts of Northern Germany ...stedt (Bergstedt, Billstedt, Duvenstedt, Eidelstedt, Lokstedt, Mellingstedt, Nienstedten, Ohlstedt, Rahlstedt) prevails over ...stadt (=town, originally simply stead).&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Hamburg is one of 16 [[States of Germany|German states]], therefore the [[Government of Hamburg|Mayor of Hamburg]]'s office corresponds more to the role of a [[minister-president]] than to the one of a city mayor. As a [[States of Germany#Politics|German state government]], it is responsible for public education, correctional institutions and public safety; as a municipality, it is additionally responsible for libraries, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.

Since 1897, the seat of the government has been the [[Hamburg Rathaus]] (Hamburg City Hall), with the office of the mayor, the meeting room for the Senate and the floor for the [[Hamburg Parliament]].&lt;ref name=rathaus&gt;{{Citation |title=Kleiner Rathausführer |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Government of Hamburg#Ministries|State Chancellery]] |year=2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 until 2010, the mayor of Hamburg was [[Ole von Beust]],&lt;ref name=usatoday2008&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-24-Germany-elections_N.htm |title=German conservatives win most votes |accessdate=13 August 2008 |publisher=USA today |date=24 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; who governed in Germany's first statewide "black-green" coalition, consisting of the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and the alternative GAL, which are Hamburg's regional wing of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Alliance 90/The Greens]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hamburg is made up of seven boroughs (German: ''Bezirke'') and subdivided into 104 quarters (German: ''Stadtteile''). There are 181 localities (German: ''Ortsteile''). The urban organization is regulated by the Constitution of Hamburg and several laws.&lt;ref name=constitution/&gt;&lt;ref name=borough&gt;Borough Administration Act {{Citation |title=Bezirksverwaltungsgesetz (BezVG) |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/BezVwG_HA_2006.htm |accessdate=21 September 2008 |date=6 July 2006 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070813163835/http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/BezVwG_HA_2006.htm |archivedate=13 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the quarters were former independent cities, towns or villages annexed into Hamburg proper. The last large annexation was done through the [[Greater Hamburg Act]] of 1937, when the cities [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]] and [[Hamburg-Wandsbek|Wandsbek]] were merged into the state of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=greateract&gt;[[Greater Hamburg Act]] {{Citation |title=Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37.htm |date=26 January 1937 |accessdate=24 September 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg'' established Hamburg as a state and a municipality.&lt;ref name=reichconst&gt;Reich Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg {{Citation |title=Reichsgesetz über die Verfassung und Verwaltung der Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37-1.htm |date=9 December 1937 |accessdate=24 September 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the boroughs and quarters have been rearranged several times.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: ''Bezirksversammlung'') and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: ''Bezirksamtsleiter''). The boroughs are not independent municipalities: their power is limited and subordinate to the [[Mayor of Hamburg|Senate of Hamburg]]. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by Hamburg's Senate.&lt;ref name=borough/&gt; The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.

Hamburg has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles and no [[skyscraper]]s (see [[List of tallest buildings in Hamburg]]). Churches are important landmarks, such as [[St. Nikolai, Hamburg|St Nicholas']], which for a short time in the 19th century was the world's tallest building. The skyline features the tall spires of the most important churches (''Hauptkirchen'') [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St Michael's]] (nicknamed "Michel"), [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St Peter's]], [[St. Jacobi, Hamburg|St James's]] (''St. Jacobi'') and [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg|St. Catherine's]] covered with copper plates, and the [[Heinrich-Hertz-Turm]], the radio and television tower (no longer publicly accessible).

The many parks are distributed over the whole city, which makes Hamburg a very verdant city. The biggest parks are the ''[[Hamburg Stadtpark|Stadtpark]]'', the [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] and [[Planten un Blomen]]. The ''[[Hamburg Stadtpark|Stadtpark]]'', Hamburg's "Central Park", has a great lawn and a huge water tower, which houses one of Europe's biggest [[planetarium|planetaria]]. The park and its buildings were designed by [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1910s.

[[File:Wasserlichtkonzert 3.jpg|thumb|Water-light concert at ''[[Planten un Blomen]]'' park]]
The lavish and spacious ''[[Planten un Blomen]]'' park (Low German dialect for "plants and flowers") located in the centre of Hamburg is the green heart of the city. Within the park are various thematic gardens, the biggest Japanese garden in Germany, and the ''[[Alter Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'', which is a historic [[botanical garden]] that now consists primarily of [[greenhouse]]s.

The ''[[Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'' is a modern [[botanical garden]] maintained by the [[University of Hamburg]]. Besides these, there are many more parks of various sizes. In 2014 Hamburg celebrated a birthday of park culture, where many parks were reconstructed and cleaned up. Moreover, every year there are the famous water-light-concerts in the ''[[Planten un Blomen]]'' park from May to early October.

==Culture and contemporary life==
Hamburg has more than 40 theatres, 60 museums and 100 music venues and clubs. In 2005, more than 18 million people visited concerts, exhibitions, theatres, cinemas, museums, and cultural events.

Two ''museum ships'' near Landungsbrücken bear witness to the freight ship (''[[Cap San Diego]]'') and cargo sailing ship era (''[[Rickmer Rickmers]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museen-in-hamburg.de/ |title=Museums in Hamburg |accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's largest model railway museum [[Miniatur Wunderland]] with {{convert|15.4|km|2|abbr=on}} total railway length is also situated near Landungsbrücken in a former warehouse.

''[[BallinStadt]] (Emigration City)'' is dedicated to the millions of Europeans who emigrated to North and South America between 1850 and 1939. Visitors descending from those overseas emigrants may search for their ancestors at computer terminals.

Since the German premiere of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 1986, there have always been [[musical theatre|musicals]] running, including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing#Stage version|Dirty Dancing]]'' and ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)]]''. This density, the highest in Germany, is partly due to the major musical production company ''[[Stage Entertainment]]'' being based in the city.

Hamburg is the birthplace of [[Johannes Brahms]], who spent his formative early years in the city, and the birthplace and home of the famous waltz composer [[Oscar Fetrás]], who wrote the well-known "Mondnacht auf der Alster" waltz.

Prior to the group's initial recording and widespread fame, Hamburg provided residency and performing venues for the [[The Beatles in Hamburg|Beatles]] from 1960 to 1962. Hamburg has nurtured a number of pop musicians. Identical twins [[Bill Kaulitz]] and Tom Kaulitz from the rock band [[Tokio Hotel]] live and maintain a recording studio in Hamburg, where they recorded their second and third albums, [[Zimmer 483]] and [[Humanoid]]. Singer [[Nena]] also lives in Hamburg. There are German hip hop acts, such as [[Fünf Sterne deluxe]], [[Samy Deluxe]], [[Beginner (band)|Beginner]] and [[Fettes Brot]]. There is a substantial [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[punk rock|punk]] scene, which gathers around the [[Rote Flora]], a [[squatting|squatted]] former theatre located in the [[Sternschanze]]. Hamburg is famous for an original kind of German [[alternative rock|alternative music]] called ''[[Hamburger Schule]]'' ("Hamburg School"), a term used for bands like [[Tocotronic]], [[Blumfeld]], [[Tomte (band)|Tomte]] or [[Kante (band)|Kante]].

The city was a major centre for [[heavy metal music]] in the 1980s. [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]] started in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=allmusic (((Helloween&gt; Biography ))) |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4471|pure_url=yes}} |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |publisher=allmusic |accessdate=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[industrial rock]] band [[KMFDM]] was also formed in Hamburg, initially as a performance art project. The influences of these and other bands from the area helped establish the subgenre of [[power metal]].

Hamburg has a vibrant psychedelic trance community, with record labels such as [[Spirit Zone Records|Spirit Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Spirit Zone Recordings |author=Staff |url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Spirit+Zone+Recordings |publisher=www.discogs.com |accessdate=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alsterwasser'' (in reference to the city's river, the [[Alster]]) is the local name for a type of [[shandy]], a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (''Zitronenlimonade''), the lemonade being added to the beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/01/52867.html |title=Alsterwasser – Bier und Limonade |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the curious regional dessert pastry called [[Franzbrötchen]]. Looking rather like a flattened croissant, it is similar in preparation but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar [[streusel]]. The name may also reflect to the roll's [[croissant]]-like appearance – ''franz'' appears to be a shortening of ''französisch'', meaning "French", which would make a ''Franzbrötchen'' a "French roll".
Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is ''Schrippe'' (scored lengthways) for the oval kind and, for the round kind, ''Rundstück'' ("round piece" rather than mainstream German ''[[Brötchen]]'', diminutive form of ''Brot'' "bread"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/05/53895.html |title=Rundstück – Hamburger Brötchen |date=5 August 2002 |accessdate=6 June 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; a relative of Denmark's ''rundstykke''. In fact, while by no means identical, the cuisines of Hamburg and [[Denmark]], especially of [[Copenhagen]], have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish.

The American [[hamburger]] may have developed from Hamburg's ''[[Frikadeller]]'': a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked [[staling|stale bread]], egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun. The Oxford Dictionary defined a ''Hamburger steak'' in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stradley |first=Linda |title=History of Hamburgers |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm |year=2004 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name and food, "hamburger", has entered all English-speaking countries, and derivative words in non-English speaking countries.

There are restaurants which offer most of these dishes, especially in the [[HafenCity]].

===Alternative culture===
Hamburg has long been a centre of alternative music and counter culture movements. The boroughs of [[St. Pauli]], [[Sternschanze]] and [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] are known for being home to many radical left-wing and anarchist groups, culminating every year during the traditional May Day demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/1-mai-demo-in-hamburg-was-soll-der-krawall-auf-der-schanze-noch-a-1090104.html |title=1. Mai-Demo in Hamburg: Was soll der Krawall auf der Schanze noch? |accessdate= 9 February 2017|publisher=www.spiegel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rote Flora]] is a former theatre, which was [[Squatting|squatted]] in 1989 in the wake of re-development plans for that area. Since then, the Rote Flora has become one of the most well-known strongholds against gentrification and a place for radical culture throughout Germany and Europe. Especially during the [[33rd G8 summit]] in nearby [[Heiligendamm]], the Rote Flora served as an important venue for organising the counter-protests that were taking place back then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2007/05/370114.html |title=Raid of "Rote Flora" G8 Convergence Centre in Hamburg |accessdate= 9 February 2017|publisher=www.indymedia.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|2017 G20 summit]], which took place in Hamburg from 7–8 July that year, protestors clashed violently with the police in the [[Sternschanze]] area and particularly around the Rote Flora. On 7 July, several cars were set on fire and street barricades were erected to prevent the police from entering the area. In response to that, the police made heavy use of water cannons and tear gas in order to scatter the protestors. However, this was met with strong resistance by protestors, resulting in a total of 160 injured police and 75 arrested participants in the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/video/g20-gipfel-in-hamburg-randalierer-setzen-autos-in-brand-video-1780686.html |title=Raid of "Krawalle beim G20-Gipfel - Randalierer setzen Autos in Brand |accessdate= 11 July 2017|publisher=www.spiegel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the summit, however, the Rote Flora issued a statement, in which it condemns the arbitrary acts of violence that were committed by some of the protestors whilst generally defending the right to use violence as a means of self-defence against police oppression. In particular, the spokesperson of the Rote Flora said that the autonomous cultural centre had a traditionally good relationship with its neighbours and local residents, since they were united in their fight against gentrification in that neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/g20-gipfel-rote-flora-distanziert-sich-von-gewaltausbruechen-aid-1.6935697 |title=Krawalle in Hamburg beim G20-Gipfel - Rote Flora distanziert sich von Gewaltausbrüchen |accessdate= 11 July 2017|publisher=www.rp-online.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Wordsworth]], [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] spent the last two weeks of September 1798 at Hamburg.   
Dorothy wrote a detailed journal of their stay, labelled "The Hamburg Journal (1798) by noted Wordsworth scholar [[Edward de Selincourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth, Macmillan 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hamburg saying, referring to its anglophile nature, is: "Wenn es in London anfängt zu regnen, spannen die Hamburger den Schirm auf." ... "When it starts raining in London, people in Hamburg open their umbrellas.".

=== Memorials ===
A memorial for successful English engineer [[William Lindley]], who reorganized, beginning in 1842, the drinking water and sewage system and thus helped to fight against cholera, is near Baumwall train station in Vorsetzen street.

In 2009, more than 2,500 "stumbling blocks" ''([[Stolpersteine]])'' were laid, engraved with the names of deported and murdered citizens. Inserted into the pavement in front of their former houses, the blocks draw attention to the victims of Nazi persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Die Orte bleibe |last1=Behling |first1=Heidburg |last2=Garbe |first2=Detlef |newspaper=Mittelungen des Freundeskreises KZ-Gedenkstätte Neuengamme |date= January 2009|page=3 |issue=11|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking===
Hamburg has for centuries been a commercial centre of Northern Europe, and is the most important [[banking]] city of [[Northern Germany]]. The city is the seat of [[History of banking|Germany's oldest bank]], the [[Berenberg Bank]], [[M.M.Warburg &amp; CO]] and [[HSH Nordbank]]. The [[Hamburg Stock Exchange]] is the oldest of its kind in Germany.

===Port===

The most significant economic unit is the [[Port of Hamburg]], which ranks third to [[Rotterdam]] and [[Antwerp]]en in Europe and 17th-largest worldwide with transshipments of {{TEU|8.9 million|first=yes}} of cargo and 138.2 million tons of goods in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hafen-hamburg.de/en/statistics|title=Welcome to the Port of Hamburg|website=The official website of the Port of Hamburg.|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; International trade is also the reason for the large number of consulates in the city. Although situated {{convert|68|mi|km|-1}} up the Elbe, it is considered a sea port due to its ability to handle large ocean-going vessels.&lt;ref&gt;M.

===Industrial production===
Heavy industry of Hamburg includes the making of steel, aluminium, copper and various large shipyards such as [[Blohm + Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.mittalsteel.com/Facilities/Europe/Hamburg/ |title=ArcelorMittal Website / Hamburg |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.trimet.de/hamburg0.html |title=Trimet Website / Hamburg |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.aurubis.com/en/corporate-group/group-structure/sites/ |title=Aurubis Website / Hamburg |accessdate=26 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308182802/http://www.aurubis.com/en/corporate-group/group-structure/sites/ |archivedate=8 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.blohmvossyachts.com/index.php?level=2&amp;CatID=2.8&amp;inhalt_id=8 |title=Blohm + Voss Website / Hamburg |accessdate=26 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328081957/http://www.blohmvossyachts.com/index.php?level=2&amp;CatID=2.8&amp;inhalt_id=8 |archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg, along with [[Seattle]] and [[Toulouse]], is an important location of the civil [[aerospace]] industry. [[Airbus]], which has an assembly plant in [[Finkenwerder]], employs over 13,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=[[Spiegel online]] |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,428905,00.html |title=Past Cost-Cutting and Layoffs Haunt Airbus in Germany |date=28 July 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg is also home to [[Rotring]], the famed maker of technical drawing instruments and pens, and [[DVA Group]], a [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] and [[life sciences]] company.

===HafenCity===
[[File:Projekt Heißluftballon - Highflyer -IMG-1414.jpg|thumb|Western HafenCity area and [[Speicherstadt]] (UNESCO World Heritage)]]
The [[HafenCity]] is Europe's largest urban development project and is located in the [[Hamburg-Mitte]] district. It consists of the area of the Great Grasbrook, the northern part of the former Elbe island [[Grasbrook]], and the warehouse district on the former Elbe island Kehrwieder and Wandrahm. It is bordered to the north, separated by the customs channel to Hamburg's city center, west and south by the Elbe and to the east, bounded by the upper harbor, [[Rothenburgsort]]. The district is full of rivers and streams and is surrounded by channels, and has a total area of about 2.2&amp;nbsp;square-kilometers.

HafenCity has 155 hectares in the area formerly belonging to the free port north of the Great Grasbrook. Residential units for up to 12,000 people are planned to be built on the site by around the mid-2020s, and jobs for up to 40,000 people, mainly in the office sector, should be created. It is the largest ongoing urban development project in Hamburg.

Construction work started in 2003, and in 2009 the first part of the urban development project was finished with the completion of the Dalmannkai / Sandtorkai neighborhood – which is the first stage of the HafenCity project. According to the person responsible for the development and commercialization of HafenCity, ''HafenCity Hamburg GmbH'', half of the master plan underlying structural construction is already completed, whereas the other half is either under construction or is in the construction preparation stages.

Many companies operating in [[E-commerce|E-Commerce]] have moved into HafenCity or started there. In addition to cruise agents such as the [http://www.1000kreuzfahrten.de/ CaptainTravel GmbH] many [[Start-up company|start-up companies]] that have no direct connection to the port or ships can be found in HafenCity.

===Tourism===
[[File:Hamburg logo.jpg|thumb|Hamburg city logo]]
[[File:HH Neuer Wall Dezember 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Neuer Wall]], one of Europe's most luxurious shopping streets]]
In 2016, more than 6,566,071&amp;nbsp;visitors with 13,331,001&amp;nbsp;overnight stays visited the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.statistik-nord.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Statistische_Berichte/bevoelkerung/industrie__handel_und_dienstl/G_IV_1_m_H/G_IV_1-m1612_HH.pdf|title=Tourismus in Hamburg im Dezember und im gesamten Jahr 2016 [in German]|last=|first=|date=21 February 2017|work=Statistik informiert ...|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tourism sector employs more than 175,000 people full-time and brings in [[revenue]] of almost €9 billion, making the tourism industry a major economic force in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Hamburg has one of the fastest-growing tourism industries in Germany. From 2001 to 2007, the overnight stays in the city increased by 55.2% (Berlin +52.7%, [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] +33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=[[Politics of Hamburg#Ministries|Behörde für Kultur, Sport und Medien]] |url=http://www.hamburg.de/daten-fakten/349180/aktuelles.html |title=Umsatzbringer und Jobmotor Tourismus |author=Staff |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809030041/http://www.hamburg.de/daten-fakten/349180/aktuelles.html |archivedate=9 August 2010|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Hamburg visit includes a tour of the city hall and the grand church [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St. Michaelis]] (called the ''Michel''), and visiting the old warehouse district (''[[Speicherstadt]]'') and the [[Landungsbrücken|harbour promenade]] (''Landungsbrücken''). Sightseeing buses connect these points of interest. As Hamburg is one of the world's largest harbours many visitors take one of the harbour and/or canal boat tours (''Große Hafenrundfahrt'', ''Fleetfahrt'') which start from the ''Landungsbrücken''. Major destinations also include [[museum]]s.

The area of [[Reeperbahn]] in the quarter [[St. Pauli]] is Europe's largest red light district and home of strip clubs, brothels, bars and nightclubs. The singer and actor [[Hans Albers]] is strongly associated with St. Pauli, and wrote the neighbourhood's unofficial anthem, "Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts um Halb Eins" ("[[On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight (song)|On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight]]") in the 1940s. [[The Beatles]] had stints on the Reeperbahn early in their careers. Others prefer the laid-back neighbourhood ''Schanze'' with its street cafés, or a barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. Hamburg's famous zoo, the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]], was founded in 1907 by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] as the first zoo with moated, barless enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=[[National Audubon Society]] |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S.

Hamburg is a major transportation hub, connected to four [[Autobahn]]en (motorways) and the most important railway junction on the route to Scandinavia.

Bridges and tunnels connect the northern and southern parts of the city, such as the [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|old Elbe Tunnel]] (''Alter Elbtunnel'') or St. Pauli Elbtunnel (official name) which opened in 1911, now is major tourist sight, and the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|Elbe Tunnel]] (''Elbtunnel'') the crossing of a [[Bundesautobahn 7|motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/09/10/67509.html |title=Elbe ohne e – Buchstaben fallen weg |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg's [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|licence plate]] prefix was "HH" (Hansestadt Hamburg; English: Hanseatic City of Hamburg) between 1906 and 1945 and from 1956 onwards, rather than the single letter normally used for large cities since the federal registration reform in 1956, such as B for Berlin or M for Munich. "H" was Hamburg's prefix in the years between 1945 and 1947 (used by [[Hanover]] since 1956);&lt;ref&gt;other prefixes used between 1945 and 1956 were "MGH" (Military Government, Hamburg: 1945 only), "HG" (1947 only) and "BH" (British Zone, Hamburg) between 1948 and 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public transport ===
[[Public transport]] by rail, bus and ship is organised by the ''[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]]'' ("Hamburg transit authority") (HVV). Tickets sold by one company are valid on all other HVV companies' services. The HVV was the first organisation of this kind worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=HVV – Mehr als ein Ziel – Historie |url=http://www.hvv.de/ueber-uns/historie/ |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Verkehrsverbund |accessdate=25 September 2008|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

33 mass transit rail lines across the city are the backbone of public transport.&lt;ref name="Zahlen {{!}} HVV-Verbundbericht"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hvv-verbundbericht.de/zahlen/#zahlen|title=Zahlen {{!}} HVV-Verbundbericht|website=www.hvv-verbundbericht.de|language=en-US|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hamburg S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] (heavy railway system) comprises six lines and the [[Hamburg U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] four lines – ''U-Bahn'' is short for ''Untergrundbahn'' (underground railway). Approximately {{convert|41|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of {{convert|101|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the U-Bahn is underground; most is on embankments or viaduct or at ground level. Older residents still speak of the system as ''Hochbahn'' (elevated railway), also because the operating company of the subway is the ''[[Hamburger Hochbahn]]''. The [[AKN Eisenbahn|AKN railway]] connects satellite towns in Schleswig-Holstein to the city. On some routes regional trains of Germany's major railway company [[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] and the regional ''[[metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft|metronom]]'' trains may be used with an HVV ticket. Except at the four bigger stations of the city, [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]], [[Hamburg Dammtor station|Dammtor]], [[Hamburg-Altona station|Altona]] and [[Hamburg-Harburg station|Harburg]] regional trains do not stop inside the city. The [[Trams in Hamburg|tram system]] was opened in 1866 and shut down in 1978.&lt;ref name=tramway-atlas-germany-1996&gt;{{cite book|title=Tramway &amp; Light Railway Atlas – Germany 1996|year=1995|publisher=[[Light Rail Transit Association]]|location=London|isbn=0-948106-18-2|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaps in the rail network are filled by more than 669 bus routes, operated by single-deck two-, three- and four-axle diesel buses.&lt;ref name="Zahlen {{!}} HVV-Verbundbericht"/&gt; Hamburg has no [[tram]]s or [[trolleybus]]es, but has hydrogen-fueled buses. The buses run frequently during working hours, with buses on some so-called MetroBus routes as often as every 2 minutes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} On special weekday night lines the intervals can be 30 minutes or longer, on normal days (Monday-Friday) the normal buses stop running at night. (MetroBuses run all around the clock, every day at the year at least every half-hour.)

There are eight ferry lines along the [[River Elbe]], operated by ''[[HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst|HADAG]]'', that fall under the aegis of the HVV. While mainly used by citizens and dock workers, they can also be used for sightseeing tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hvv-verbundbericht.de/zahlen/|title=Zahlen {{!}} HVV-Verbundbericht|website=www.hvv-verbundbericht.de|language=en-US|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international airport at Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel, official name [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg Airport „Helmut Schmidt“]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: HAM, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDH) is the fifth biggest and oldest airport in Germany, having been established in 1912 and located about {{convert|5|mi|0|abbr=off}} from the city centre. About 60 airlines provide service to 125 destination airports, including some long distance destinations like [[Newark, New Jersey]] on [[United Airlines]], [[Dubai]] on [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], and [[Tehran]] on [[Iran Air]]; [[Lufthansa]] is the hub carrier, with the most flights and operates one of its biggest [[Lufthansa Technik|maintenance facilities]] at the Hamburg airport ([[Lufthansa Technik]]). The second airport is located in [[Hamburg-Finkenwerder]], official name [[Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: XFW, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDHI). It is about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city centre and is a nonpublic airport for the [[Airbus Operations GmbH|Airbus]] plant. It is the second biggest Airbus plant, after [[Toulouse]], and the third biggest aviation manufacturing plant after [[Seattle]] and Toulouse; the plant houses the final assembly lines for A318, A319, A320, A321 and [[Airbus A380|A380]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Airbus in Germany |url=http://www.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/airbus-in-germany/ |author=Staff |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=27 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123102122/http://www.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/airbus-in-germany/ |archivedate=23 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity for Hamburg and Northern Germany is largely provided by ''[[Vattenfall|Vattenfall Europe]]'', formerly the state-owned ''Hamburgische Electricitäts-Werke''. Vattenfall Europe used to operate the [[Brunsbüttel Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[Krümmel Nuclear Power Plant]], both taken out of service as part of the [[Nuclear power in Germany#Closures and phase-out|nuclear power phase-out]]. In addition, [[E.ON]] operates the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] near Hamburg.

Hamburg is sometimes called Germany's capital of sport since no other city has more first-league teams and international sports events.

[[Hamburger SV]] is a [[Association football|football]] team playing in the [[2. Bundesliga]] (as of 2018). The HSV was the oldest team of the Bundesliga, playing in the league since its beginning in 1963 until a change of results saw them relegated from the [[Bundesliga]] in 2018. HSV is a six-time German champion, a three-time German cup winner and triumphed in the European Cup in 1983, and has played in the group stages of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] twice: in 2000–01 and in 2006–07. They play at the [[Volksparkstadion]] (average attendance in the [[2012–13 Bundesliga|12–13 season]] was 52,916). In addition, [[FC St. Pauli]] was a [[2. Bundesliga|second division]] football club that came in second place in the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|2009–10 season]] and qualified to play alongside [[Hamburger SV]] in the [[Bundesliga|first division]] for the first time since the [[2001–02 Bundesliga|2001–02 season]]. St. Pauli's home games take place at the [[Millerntor-Stadion]].

The [[Hamburg Freezers]] represented Hamburg until 2016 in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]], the premier [[ice hockey]] league in Germany.

[[HSV Hamburg|HSV Handball]] represented Hamburg until 2016 in the German [[Bundesliga (handball)|handball league]]. In 2007, HSV Handball won the European Cupwinners Cup. The Club won the league in the 2010–11 season and had an average attendance of 10.690 in the [[O2 World Hamburg]] the same year. The most recent success for the team was the [[EHF Champions League]] win in 2013. Since 2014, the club has suffered from economic problems and was almost not allowed the playing licence for the 2014–15 season. But due to economic support from the former club president/sponsor Andreas Rudolf the club was allowed the licence in the last minute. On 20 January 2016 however, their licence was removed due to violations following the continued economic struggles. In 2016–17, they were not allowed to play in the first or second league. The team lives on through their former second team (now their main team) in the third division (2016-2018) and in second division (since 2018).

The ''BCJ Hamburg'' played in the [[Basketball Bundesliga]] from 1999 to 2001. Since then, teams from Hamburg have attempted to return to Germany's elite league. The recently founded [[Hamburg Towers]] have already established themselves as one of the main teams in Germany's second division [[ProA]] and aim to take on the heritage of the BCJ Hamburg. The Towers play their home games at the ''Inselparkhalle'' in [[Wilhelmsburg, Hamburg|Wilhelmsburg]].

Hamburg is the nation's [[field hockey]] capital and dominates the men's as well as the women's Bundesliga. Hamburg hosts many top teams such as Uhlenhorster Hockey Club, Harvesterhuder Hockey Club and Club An Der Alster.

The [[Hamburg Warriors]] are one of Germany's top lacrosse clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamburgwarriors.com/ |title=HTHC Hamburg Warriors |publisher=Hamburgwarriors.com |date=|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club has grown immensely in the last several years and includes at least one youth team, three men's, and two women's teams. The team participates in the Deutsch Lacrosse Verein.

Hamburg made a bid for the [[2024 Olympic Games]], but 51.7 percent of those city residents participating in a [[referendum]] in November 2015 voted against continuing Hamburg's bid to host the games. Meanwhile, Hamburg's partner city [[Kiel]] voted in favour of hosting the event, with almost 66 percent of all participants supporting the bid. Opponents of the bid had argued that hosting the 33rd Olympic Games would cost the city too much in public funds.

{{Quotation|In Hamburg it's hard to find a native Hamburger. A hurried and superficial search turns up only crayfish, people from Pinneberg, and those from Bergedorf. One accompanies the contented little kippers of a striving society; mackerels from Stade, sole from Finkenwerder, herrings from Cuxhaven swim in expectant throngs through the streets of my city and lobsters patrol the stock exchange with open claws.... The first so-called unguarded glance always lands on the bottom of the sea and falls into twilight of the aquarium. [[Heinrich Heine]] must have had the same experience when he tried, with his cultivated scorn and gifted melancholy, to find the people of Hamburg.|[[Siegfried Lenz]]||in ''Leute von Hamburg'' (People of Hamburg) {{ISBN|978-3-423-11538-4}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jennifer |last=Jenkins |title=Provincial modernity: local culture and liberal politics in fin-de-siècle Hamburg |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-8014-4025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:UNAIDS building Geneva, Switzerland.JPG|thumb|UNAIDS Headquarters building in Geneva, Switzerland.]]

The '''Joint [[United Nations]] Programme on HIV and AIDS''' ('''UNAIDS''') is the main advocate for accelerated, comprehensive and coordinated global action on the [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] pandemic.

The mission of UNAIDS is to lead, strengthen and support an expanded response to HIV and AIDS that includes preventing transmission of HIV, providing care and support to those already living with the virus, reducing the [[vulnerability]] of individuals and communities to HIV and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. UNAIDS seeks to prevent the HIV/AIDS epidemic from becoming a severe pandemic.

UNAIDS has five goals:
# Leadership and advocacy for effective action on the pandemic;
# Strategic information and technical support to guide efforts against AIDS worldwide;
# Tracking, monitoring and evaluation of the pandemic and of responses to it;
# Civil society engagement and the development of strategic partnerships;
# Mobilization of resources to support an effective response.

UNAIDS is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, where it shares some site facilities with the [[World Health Organization]]. It is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P%3D13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first executive director was [[Peter Piot]]; [[Michel Sidibé]] currently leads UNAIDS. The agency promotes the GIPA principle (greater involvement of people living with HIV) formulated in 1994, and endorsed by the United Nations in 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;The UNAids GIPA briefing paper of March 2007 may be viewed on-line [http://data.unaids.org/pub/BriefingNote/2007/jc1299_policy_brief_gipa.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
[[File:UNAIDS Policy Position.jpg|thumb|UNAIDS Policy Position Paper on Intensifying HIV Prevention in 2005]]

The aim of UNAIDS is to help mount and support an expanded response to HIV/AIDS, one that engages the efforts of many sectors and partners from government and civil society.

Established by ECOSOC resolution 1994/24 on 26 July 1994, UNAIDS officially launched in January 1996. The organizations is guided by a Programme Coordinating Board with representatives of 22 governments from all geographic regions, the UNAIDS Cosponsors, and five representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including associations of people living with HIV/AIDS.

==Leadership==
[[Peter Piot]] was the first executive director of UNAIDS. He served from its inception in 1995 until 2008, when he departed to lead the Institute for Global Health at [[Imperial College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/formerexecutivedirectorofunaids/formerunaidsexecutivedirectorpeterpiot/|author=UNAIDS|title=Biography of former UNAIDS Executive Director Dr Peter Piot|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401225442/http://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/formerexecutivedirectorofunaids/formerunaidsexecutivedirectorpeterpiot/|archivedate=1 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2009, [[Michel Sidibé]] became the new executive director of UNAIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/biography/2009/2012_Bio_EXD_MSidibe_en.pdf|title=Biography, Mr. Michel Sidibe|accessdate=11 April 2013|author=UNAIDS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508190310/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/biography/2009/2012_Bio_EXD_MSidibe_en.pdf|archivedate=8 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jan Beagle]] is the Deputy Executive Director of Management and Governance, and [[Luiz Loures]] is the Deputy Executive Director of Programme.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership UNAIDS leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;

UNAIDS has eleven global Goodwill Ambassadors who help strengthen awareness of the organisation's work.&lt;ref name="ambassadors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsgoodwillambassadors/|title=Goodwill Ambassadors and Representatives|author=UNAIDS|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401144054/http://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsgoodwillambassadors/|archivedate=1 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are: [[Myung-Bo Hong]], [[Michael Ballack]], [[Toumani Diabaté]], [[Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]], [[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]], [[David Luiz]], [[Vera Brezhneva]], [[Victoria Beckham]] and [[Pia Wurtzbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Legaspi|first1=C.

==Partnerships==
The United Nations Declaration Commitment on HIV/AIDS provides the guiding framework for UNAIDS action. Promoting partnerships among various stakeholders is reflected within the leadership section of the Declaration of Commitment. In particular, it calls for complementation of government efforts by the full and active participation of civil society, the business community and the private sector through:

*Establishing and strengthening mechanisms that involve civil society including faith-based organizations (FBOs), the private sector, and people living with HIV/AIDS at all levels
*Encouraging and supporting local and national organizations to expand and strengthen regional partnerships, coalitions and networks
*Full participation of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), those in vulnerable groups and people mostly at risk, particularly young people
*Addressing issue of [[Social stigma|stigma]] and [[discrimination]].

UNAIDS works to promote partnerships among and between this diverse and broad range of non-state entities. This calls for increases in both the number of new actors, as well as in innovative ways of working, to facilitate increased capacity of non-state entities to respond effectively to the epidemic at all levels.

With the momentum generated by the UN Special Session on HIV/AIDS, the main challenges are to:

*Sustain and deepen involvement of those contributing and critical to the response such as PLWHA organizations
*Move beyond the organizations already involved and reach out to optimally engage a broad range of sectors/actors.

UNAIDS has collaborated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], especially [[Caritas Internationalis]], in the fight against AIDS, something which materialized in a December 2005 message by Pope Benedict XVI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/fr/Partnerships/Civil+society/default.asp Partnerships in civil society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202202949/http://www.unaids.org/fr/Partnerships/Civil%2Bsociety/default.asp |date=2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it indicated in a 2009 communiqué that it did not agree with the Pope's statement that condoms were unhelpful in AIDS prevention, instead calling them "essential".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-croix.com/afp.static/pages/090318173648.eqy3xtlg.htm La Croix article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322112543/http://www.la-croix.com/afp.static/pages/090318173648.eqy3xtlg.htm |date=2009-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From policy to action===
In engaging non-state entities in an expanded response to the epidemic, the UNAIDS Secretariat:

*Fosters and supports global, regional and country level partnerships which include linkages between and among civil society, private sector, philanthropy, media, and with particular attention to organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS
*Supports governments and UN agencies in developing partnerships with non-state entities. This includes support for approaches intended to increase participation, improve connectedness of efforts and strengthen the various participants' capacity for action.

==Donors==
As the main advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS leads, strengthens and supports an expanded response aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV, providing care and support, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV/AIDS, and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. To fulfil this mandate, UNAIDS is supported by voluntary contributions from governments, foundations, corporations, private groups (for example, students, universities, sporting clubs, etc.) and individuals.

In 2003, more than US$118.5 million was received from 30 governments, philanthropic organizations, individuals from around the world and others. The largest donors were the Netherlands followed by Norway, the United States, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Japan. In 2004, 35 governments contributed to UNAIDS.

This is an alphabetical '''list of [[sovereign state]]s and [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] in the [[Americas]]'''. The [[Americas]] (also known as Pan-America, America or the [[New World]]) are the landmasses of [[North America]] and [[South America]], collectively sometimes considered a single [[continent]]. The Americas are almost entirely located in the [[Western Hemisphere]], with some of the north-west islands of [[Alaska]] entering the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. The majority of islands lying in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] between the Americas and [[Afro-Eurasia]], such as [[Iceland]], are not normally associated with the Americas and are therefore excluded from this list.

==Sovereign states==
The following is a list of [[sovereign state]]s in the [[Americas]]. All 35 are members of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]].

[[File:Lovős.jpg|thumb|''Lovagias ügy'' performed at the Pest Theater, March 23, 1935]]
'''''Lovagias ügy''''' (Hungarian for '''''An Affair of Honor''''') is a [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] play, written by [[Sándor Hunyady]]. It was first produced in 1935. It is considered to be one of Hunyady's great dramas and was soon adapted for film.

Since its premiere, the work has been featured several times on Hungarian stage and abroad. In 1937, it played in [[Milan]] and [[Rome, Italy]]. Postwar performances took place in 1964, 1993, and 1996. More recently, ''Lovagias ügy'' was presented at Budapest's Karinthy Theater in 2012.

The '''Manifest Party of the People''' ({{Lang-pt|Partido do Manifesto do Povo}}, PMP) is a [[political party]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The PMP was established in 2003 by [[Faustino Imbali]].&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p229&lt;/ref&gt; The party received 0.8% of the vote in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]], failing to win a seat in the [[National People's Assembly (Guinea-Bissau)|National People's Assembly]]. Imbali was the party's candidate for the [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential elections]], but received just 0.52% of the vote, finishing tenth in a field of 13 candidates.

The party did not contest elections in [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008]], [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2009|2009]] or [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2012|2012]], but returned to active politics when it ran in the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 2014|2014 parliamentary elections]]. It received 0.7% of the vote and failed to win a seat.

[[NATO]] (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an international alliance that consists of 29 [[member states]] from [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. It was established at the signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on 4 April 1949. [[North Atlantic Treaty#Article 5|Article Five]] of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it should be [[Collective defense|considered an attack against all members]], and other members shall assist the attacked member, with [[armed forces]] if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The North Atlantic Treaty|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/faq.htm|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|date=1949-04-04|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 29 member countries, two are located in [[North America]] ([[Canada]] and the [[United States]]) and 27 are [[Europe]]an countries while [[Turkey]] is in [[Eurasia]]. All members have militaries, except for [[Iceland]] which does not have a typical army (but does, however, have a [[coast guard]] and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons states]]: [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. NATO has 12 original founding member nation states, and from 18 February 1952 to 6 May 1955, it added three more member nations, and a fourth on 30 May 1982. After the end of the [[Cold War]], NATO added 13 more member nations (10 former [[Warsaw Pact]] members and three former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics) from 12 March 1999 to 5 June 2017.

==Founding and changes in membership==
{{main article|Enlargement of NATO}}
NATO has added new members seven times since its founding in 1949, and since 2017 NATO has had 29 members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[the United Kingdom]], and [[the United States]]. In 1952, Greece and Turkey became members of the Alliance, joined later by [[West Germany]] (in 1955) and [[Spain]] (in 1982). In 1990, with the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]], NATO grew to include the former country of [[East Germany]]. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] initiative and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. In 1997, three former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], were invited to join NATO. After this fourth enlargement in 1999, the [[Vilnius group]] of the Baltics and seven East European countries formed in May 2000 to cooperate and lobby for further NATO membership. Seven of these countries joined in the fifth enlargement in 2004. The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] States [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]] joined in the sixth enlargement in 2009, [[Montenegro]] in 2017.

United States President [[Donald Trump]] expressed interest in withdrawing from the organization during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his 2016 presidential campaign]], and only recently stated the United States would protect allies in the event that Article V is invoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170518-white-house-official-trump-threatens-leave-nato-usa-g7-russia|title=Trump threatens to quit NATO: White House official  - France 24|date=2017-05-18|work=France 24|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/europe/donald-trump-eu-nato.html|title=In NATO Speech, Trump Is Vague About Mutual Defense Pledge|last=Landler|first=Michael D.

Only in the US and Canada did more than 50% of the people answer that they should.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/06/support-for-nato-is-widespread-among-member-nations/ Support for NATO is widespread among member nations], ''Pew Research''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-nato-survey-idUSKBN18J21J U.S. would defend NATO despite Trump's criticism, Europeans believe: study], ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt;

The base borders [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Senegal]] to the north, and [[Mali]] to the north and north-east; the inland part borders [[Côte d'Ivoire]] to the south-east, [[Liberia]] to the south, and [[Sierra Leone]] to the west of the southern tip. Its water sources include the [[Niger River|Niger]], [[Senegal river|Senegal]], and [[Gambia River|Gambia]] rivers.  Guinea is sometimes called '''Guinea-Conakry''' (Conakry being its capital) to differentiate it from the neighboring [[Guinea-Bissau]] (whose capital is [[Bissau]]).

{{Expand Czech|topic=culture|date=August 2010|Pan Theodor Mundstock}}
'''''Pan Theodor Mundstock''''' (''Mr. Theodore Mundstock'') is the debut novel by [[Czech language|Czech]] author [[Ladislav Fuks]], first published in 1963.&lt;ref name="Winner" /&gt; The English translation by Iris Urwin was published by Orion Press, New York, in 1968.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

It tells the story of a [[Jew]] in [[Prague]] in 1942, during the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], who is waiting to be [[deportation|deported]] to the [[concentration camp]]s but trying to maintain as normal an existence as possible.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; When the occupying [[Nazi]]s force him to leave the rope shop he owns, Mundstock's psyche starts to crack. Seeing the camps as inevitable, he later starts practising for life in them.&lt;ref name="Schott" /&gt;

==Reception==
In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Richard Elman|Richard M. Elman]] described the book as "brilliant" and said of it that "Ladislav Fuks's novel is not just another pious [[Holocaust]] book; it is acute, unsentimental, and unsparing, a work of intricate but compassionate narrative art, as if [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s [[The Castle (novel)#Characters|K]] had literally confronted the [[cremation|crematoria]]." He highlighted how Mundstock's attempts to keep up a normal life "makes the trap he is in all the more absolute and terrifying" and praised the book both for the quality of its translation and the way "its artfulness, though always functional, is never permitted to victimize the humanity of Mundstock".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Webster Schott in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine called it "one of literature's near miracles" and "excruciatingly poignant, clear and hard as diamonds in its English translation by Iris Urwin", saying that it "catapults Ladislav Fuks, Mundstock's 44-year-old Czech creator, into the first rank of contemporary literary moralists."&lt;ref name="Schott" /&gt;

==Adaptations==
''Pan Theodor Mundstock'' was adapted for the stage as ''Mr. M'' in 2011 by Vít Hořejš. It was performed by [[The Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theatre]] at [[Theater for the New City]] and JCC Manhattan. The name is an allusion to [[The Castle (novel)#Characters|K]] in [[Franz Kafka|Franz Kafka]]'s unfinished novel [[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]].&lt;ref name="Times of Israel" /&gt;

In 2016, a Czech language stage adaptation written by Miloš Horanský and starring {{ill|Vojtěch Dyk|cs}} as Mundstock was performed at the Veletržní Palác, part of the [[National Gallery in Prague]]. The adaptation was praised for its performances but criticised by some critics for straying from the novel in its characterisation.&lt;ref name="iDNES" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Novinky.cz" /&gt;

'''Pankaj Ghemawat''' (born September 30, 1959) is an Indian-American economist, professor, [[global strategy|global strategist]], speaker and author known for his work in the study of globalization. He created the DHL Global Connectedness Index and the [[CAGE Distance Framework]].

He is the Global Professor of Management and Strategy and Director of the Center for the Globalization of Education and Management at the [[New York University Stern School of Business|Stern School of Business]] at [[New York University]], and the Anselmo Rubiralta Professor of Global Strategy at [[IESE Business School]].  Ghemawat previously served on the faculty of [[Harvard Business School]], where he was the youngest person ever appointed a full professorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/08110?gko=b9ada|title=Pankaj Ghemawat: The Thought Leader Interview|last=Kleiner|first=Art|newspaper=strategy+business|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in India, Ghemawat spent parts of his childhood in India and in Indiana, where the family lived while his father pursued a Ph.D at [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/08110?gko=b9ada|title=Pankaj Ghemawat: The Thought Leader Interview|last=Kleiner|first=Art|newspaper=strategy+business|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghemawat received his bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and his Ph.D. in [[business economics]] from [[Harvard University]]. Entering [[Harvard College]] at the age of 16, he was accepted to Harvard Business School's Ph.D. in Business Economics program at 19, graduating three years later.

After a two-year stint at [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/node/14201826 |title=Pankaj Ghemawat |date=7 August 2009 |website=The Economist |access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he spent 25 years on the full-time faculty at [[Harvard Business School]]. Since 2006, Ghemawat has been the Anselmo Rubiralta Professor of Global Strategy at [[IESE Business School]] in [[Barcelona]]. In 2013, he was appointed as Distinguished Visiting Professor of Global Management at [[Stern School of Business]], New York University.

==Career and research==
Ghemawat has devoted much of his career to studying globalization and its effects on national economies.  In 2011 he introduced the DHL Global Connectedness Index, which emphasizes analysis of hard data to measure the global connectedness of countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/press-releases/dhl-launches-landmark-global-connectedness-index-2011-112011100107_1.html|title=DHL Launches Landmark Global Connectedness Index 2011|last=Announcement|date=2012-01-11|newspaper=Business Standard India|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key ideas of his work include:
* While globalization is expanding after a steep drop during the world financial crisis, it is less widespread and is growing more slowly than widely believed. 
* Countries with greater global connectedness tend to grow faster than those with less connectedness.
Much of Ghemawat's work serves as a counterpoint to journalist [[Thomas Friedman]]’s contention in his book [[The World Is Flat|The World is Flat]] that globalization is a fast-growing and dominant force in the 21st century economy. In 2009 Ghemawat published  the article ''Why the World Isn’t Flat'' in [[Foreign Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/14/why-the-world-isnt-flat/|title=Why the World Isn’t Flat|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Ghemawat gave a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] entitled ''Actually, the World Isn’t Flat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ghemawat|first=Pankaj|title=Actually, the world isn't flat|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/pankaj_ghemawat_actually_the_world_isn_t_flat|language=en|accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these and other works, Ghemawat cited the measures of global connectedness compiled in his research to show that globalization is less widespread than generally thought. He has revived the term “[[wikt:globaloney|globaloney]]", coined in the 1940s by [[Clare Boothe Luce]], to refer to these misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/pdf/Fall_2014_Global_Problem_Solving_Without_The_Globaloney.pdf|title=Global Problem-Solving Without the Globaloney|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2016 Ghemawat has turned his attention to the effects of isolationist and nationalist movements such as the United Kingdom's [[Brexit]] vote and the policies of President Donald Trump on trade, globalization, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2016/11/trump-globalization-and-trades-uncertain-future|title=Trump, Globalization, and Trade’s Uncertain Future|newspaper=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2016/11/people-are-angry-about-globalization-heres-what-to-do-about-it|title=People Are Angry About Globalization.

Pankaj Ghemawat's books include ''Commitment'' (Free Press, 1991), ''Games Businesses Play'' (MIT Press, 1998), ''Strategy and the Business Landscape'' (Pearson Prentice Hall, 3rd edition, 2009), the award-winning ''Redefining Global Strategy'' (Harvard Business School Press, 2007),  and ''World 3.0 Global Prosperity And How To Achieve It'' (Harvard Business Press, 2011), which continues to receive international acclaim.

{{Politics of Chile}}
[[Chile]] is divided into 16 [[region]]s (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''regiones''; singular ''región''), which are the country's first-level administrative division. Each region is headed by an [[intendant]] (''intendente)'', appointed by the [[President of Chile]], and a directly-elected regional board (''consejo regional'').

The regions are divided into [[Provinces of Chile|province]]s (the second-level administrative division), each headed by a governor (''gobernador'') appointed by the President. There are 56 provinces in total. Provinces are divided into [[Communes of Chile|communes]] (the third and lowest level administrative division), which are governed by [[municipal council]]s.

==Naming==
Each region is given a [[Roman numeral]], followed by a name (e.g. ''IV Región de Coquimbo'', read as "fourth region of Coquimbo" in Spanish). When the regional structure was created, Roman numerals were assigned in ascending order from north to south, with the northernmost region designated as I (first) and the southernmost region as XII (twelfth). The [[Santiago Metropolitan Region]], located in the center of the country and home to the country's capital [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], was excluded from this naming scheme and given instead the initials RM, standing for ''Región Metropolitana'' ("Metropolitan Region" in Spanish). With the creation of regions XIV and XVI in the south and XV in the north (XIII is not used) in 2007, the north-south Roman numeral order was broken.

In February 2018, the '''Strengthening of Regionalization Law''' (Law 21074) was enacted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/ciudades/ley-les-quito-los-numeros-a-las-regiones-ahora-solo-se-conoceran-por-su-nombre/2018-03-07/101936.html|title=Ley les quitó los números a las regiones: Ahora solo se conocerán por su nombre - Cooperativa.cl|first=|last=Cooperativa.cl|date=|website=cooperativa.cl|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308231826/http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/ciudades/ley-les-quito-los-numeros-a-las-regiones-ahora-solo-se-conoceran-por-su-nombre/2018-03-07/101936.html|archivedate=8 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among other things, it removed the [[roman numerals]] from the designations.

==History of the regional structure==
The administrative divisions of Chile were created in 1974 and limited to 13 regions (this limitation was eliminated in 2005 via a constitutional reform). Previously, Chile was divided into 25 provinces, which were further divided into departments, and then into communes. The new territorial organization was implemented in phases with some initial "pilot regions" beginning to operate in 1974, extending the process on January 1, 1976 to the rest of the country. The Santiago Metropolitan Region began to operate in April 1980.

In December 2006, two new regions were created: the northern [[Arica and Parinacota Region]], by taking out the two northernmost provinces from the [[Tarapacá Region]]; and [[Los Ríos Region]] in the south, encompassing the provinces of [[Valdivia Province|Valdivia]], formerly part of the [[Los Lagos Region]], and [[Ranco Province|Ranco]], formerly part of Valdivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariolanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20061219/pags/20061219152219.html|title=La Nación|author=|date=|website=diariolanacion.cl|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920200532/http://www.diariolanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20061219/pags/20061219152219.html|archivedate=2016-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both regions became operative in October 2007.

In August 2017, the [[Ñuble Region]] was created from what was then the [[Ñuble Province]] of the [[Biobío Region]]. The old province was divided into three new provinces: [[Diguillín Province|Diguillín]], [[Punilla Province|Punilla]] and [[Itata Province|Itata]]. The new region's capital is [[Chillán]]. It became operational in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1107597&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2018-09-06|title=LEY-21033 05-SEP-2017 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR Y SEGURIDAD PÚBLICA - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|author=|date=5 September 2017|website=leychile.cl|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916052739/https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1107597&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2018-09-06|archivedate=16 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile does not utilise the number 13 (XIII) in numbering its regions, most of which increase in number from north to south.

==Administration==
Since their creation, each region is headed by a [[intendant]] (intendente) appointed by the President of Chile, and a regional board (consejo regional). The intendants count with the direct collaboration of the SEREMI (Ministerial Regional secretary) in specific matters, such as public health, education, agriculture, among others. The SEREMI are  appointed by the President. Thanks to the Strengthening of Regionalization Law, since the [[Elections in Chile|2020 municipal elections]] each intendant will be elected at the same date along with the mayors and municipal councillors, using a [[two-round system]]. If no candidate obtains the minimum threshold 40% of the valid votes, a runoff election is held between the two candidates with the most votes, and the winner is elected by a [[majority|simple majority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2017/12/20/lista-para-promulgacion-queda-ley-que-establece-eleccion-directa-de-gobernadores-regionales-a-partir-de-2020/|title=Lista para promulgación queda ley que establece elección directa de gobernadores regionales a partir de 2020|first=El|last=Mostrador|date=|website=elmostrador.cl|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308231845/http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2017/12/20/lista-para-promulgacion-queda-ley-que-establece-eleccion-directa-de-gobernadores-regionales-a-partir-de-2020/|archivedate=8 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.camara.cl/pdf.aspx?prmTIPO=CUENTADOCUMENTO&amp;prmID=3083 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308232744/https://www.camara.cl/pdf.aspx?prmTIPO=CUENTADOCUMENTO&amp;prmID=3083 |archivedate=2018-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the law will change the name ''Intendant'' to ''Regional Governor'' (Gobernador regional). The President will appoint a Regional presidential delegate (delegado presidencial regional), who will represent the national government in the region.

The board was elected among the members of the municipal councils (consejo municipal) of each commune of the respective region. Since the [[Chilean general election, 2013|2013 election]] the regional board members (Consejero regional) are directly elected using an [[open list]] [[proportional representation]], with seats allocated using the [[D'Hondt method]]. Each of the 54 provinces are headed by a governor (gobernador) appointed by the President. In 2020, the provincial governors will change their name to ''Provincial presidential delegate''' (delegado presidencial provincial), still appointed by the President.

This book, focusing on the course of study pursued today by aspiring actors in Russia and on the philosophy that informs this curriculum, draws on extensive observation during the academic year 2000-2001 of the actor training program of the St. Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy and on interviews of a wide array of individuals (primarily faculty) in the Academy.  The book is a good source of information on the Academy.

==Reviews==
“The Light Thief might be a simple story, but it's ultimately a complex film” –Montreal Gazette 

“European funds contributing to the production and with a burning subject such as energy control high on the world’s priority list, this is a surefire festival item, with definite chances for niche art house distribution.” –[http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/the-light-thief-svet-ake/5016911.article Screen Daily]

'''''The Mud Soldier''''' was an artwork by [[Damian and Killian Van Der Velden]] displayed in [[Trafalgar Square]]. It was commissioned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sawer|first1=Patrick|title=Passchendaele mud soldier slowly dissolves to mark centenary of battle|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/29/passchendaele-mud-soldier-slowly-dissolves-mark-centenary-battle/|accessdate=13 October 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Mud Soldier' rests in Trafalgar Square for Ypres/Passchendaele Centenary|url=http://www.centenarynews.com/article/mud-soldier-rests-in-trafalgar-square-for-yprespasschendaele-centenary|publisher=Centenary News|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture, depicting a [[First World War]] soldier seated on a bedroll, was constructed from sand and mud taken from [[Flanders Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melting mud soldier sculpture is built at Trafalgar Square|work=cetusnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated in the open air, it was intended to disintegrate over the five days that it was on show.

*''For the figure in Norse mythology, see [[Urðr]]''
The '''University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna)''' or  '''UTHR(J)''' was formed in 1988 at the [[University of Jaffna]], [[Jaffna]] in [[Sri Lanka]] as part of the national organization University Teachers for Human Rights. Its public activities as a constituent part of university life came to a standstill following the assassination on September 21, 1989 of [[Rajini Thiranagama]], a key founding member, by the rebel group [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]. This has not been conclusively proven. 

During the course of 1990 the others who identified openly with the UTHR(J), such as its current head [[Rajan Hoole|Prof. Rajan Hoole]], were forced to leave Jaffna. 

It functions as an organization upholding the founding spirit of the UTHR(J) with its original aims: to challenge the external and internal terror engulfing the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] community as a whole through making the perpetrators accountable, and to create space for humanizing the social and political spheres relating to the life of the community.

The UTHR(J) is no longer functioning within the University of Jaffna. Its latest report on documenting human rights abuses in Sri Lanka, as seen from its website, was on January 2, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2474">A '''user fee''' is a fee, tax, or impost payment paid to a facility owner or operator by a facility user as a [[necessary condition]] for using the facility.

People pay user fees for the use of many [[Public_service|public services and facilities]]. At the [[federal government of the United States|federal]] level in the [[United States]], there is a charge for walking to the top of the [[Statue of Liberty]], to drive into many [[national parks]], or to use particular services of the [[Library of Congress]].

States may charge [[toll road|tolls]] for driving on [[highway]]s or impose a fee on those who camp in [[state park]]s. Communities usually have entrance fees for public [[swimming pools]] and meters for parking on local streets as well as perhaps even parking spaces at public beaches, dump stickers and [[postage stamps]].

In [[international development]], user fees refer to a system fee for basic health care, education, or other services implemented by a [[developing country]] to make up for the costs of these services.

The [[International Monetary Fund]] often recommends that nations start charging fees for these services in order to reduce their [[budget deficit]]s. This position is more and more challenged by many people who claim that user fees  hurt the poorest the most. Some even argue that they should be free at the point of use.&lt;ref&gt;Removing User Fees in the Health Sector in Low-Income Countries: A Multi-Country Review Bruno Meessen, David Hercot, Mathieu Noirhomme, Valery Ridde, Abdelmajid Tibouti, Abel Bicaba, Christine Kirunga Tashobya and Lucy Gilson / UNICEF, [http://www.itg.be/itg/Uploads/Volksgezondheid/unicef/UNICEF_Multi-Country_review.pdf UNICEF Programme division working paper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Great leap forward on free healthcare  [http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=86280 Irin news]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Brown: The next global cause: free education for all; [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/gordon-brown-the-next-global-cause-free-education-for-all-521528.html The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative to funding facilities and services with user fees is to fund them with [[income taxes]].  Unlike user fees, income taxes are paid by everyone, including those who don't necessarily use or benefit from a specific facility or service.

'''Woodford's Battery''' was an [[artillery battery]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name="Finlayson2006"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Darren|last1=Fa|authorlink1=Darren Fa|first2=Clive|last2=Finlayson|authorlink2=Clive Finlayson|title=The Fortifications of Gibraltar 1068-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC5QBR0oB04C&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-016-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at [[Europa Point|Europa Flats]] between the [[Defensible Barracks, Gibraltar|Defensible Barracks]] and the ''Officer's Barracks'' and [[Eliott's Battery]].&lt;ref name=map1859&gt;{{cite web|title=1859 Map of the Fortifications of Gibraltar|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/1859_Gibraltar_fortifications_map.jpg|publisher=UK National Archives MPH 1/23|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery was built before 1738 as a demi-bastion set into the old Spanish-era coastal wall, constructed by Charles V. It was originally called Five Gun Battery but its complement of guns was later expanded. It was equipped with four embrasures on the left flank, facing south-east towards Europa Point, and two on the right flank, facing north-west towards the nearby [[Hutment Battery]]. Further firing positions were provided a short distance further south by the three-gun Woodford's Left Flank battery, which together with the 1st Europa Point Right Flank battery [[Enfilade and defilade|enfiladed]] the ground in front of the Defensible Barracks. It was renamed after a [[governor of Gibraltar]], Field Marshal Sir [[Alexander George Woodford]], who served in that role between 1836–43.&lt;ref name="Hughes383"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strong as the Rock of Gibraltar|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|last2=Migos|first2=Athanassios|publisher=Exchange Publications|year=1995|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nine guns had been installed in the battery by 1859 and it continued to mount a variety of guns up to 1892. During [[World War II]] it was used to mount a defence electric light, which was removed in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hughes383" /&gt;
