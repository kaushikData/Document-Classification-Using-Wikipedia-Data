      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">In [[mathematics]], '''6-sphere coordinates''' are the [[coordinate system]] created by [[Inversive geometry|inverting]] the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] across the [[unit sphere]].  They are so named because the [[locus (mathematics)|loci]] where one coordinate is constant form [[sphere]]s tangent to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] from one of six sides (depending on which coordinate is held constant and whether its value is positive or negative).

The three coordinates are
:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{x}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\quad v = \frac{y}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\quad w = \frac{z}{x^2+y^2+z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since inversion is its own [[inverse function|inverse]], the equations for ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in terms of ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'' are similar:
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{u}{u^2+v^2+w^2},\quad y = \frac{v}{u^2+v^2+w^2},\quad z = \frac{w}{u^2+v^2+w^2}.&lt;/math&gt;  
This coordinate system is [[Separable partial differential equation|&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-separable]] for the 3-variable Laplace equation.

'''Ackermann's formula''' is a [[control system]] design method for solving the [[Full state feedback|pole allocation]] problem. One of the primary problems in control system design is the creation of controllers that will alter the dynamics of a system and alter the poles to a more suitable, and sometimes more stable, state. Such a problem can be tackled by many different methods; one such solution is the addition of a feedback loop in such a way that a gain is added to the input with which one can change the poles of the original system. If the system is [[ Controllability|controllable]], an efficient method for pole placement is Ackermann's formula, which allows one to choose arbitrary poles within the system. &lt;ref&gt; Modern Control System Theory and Design, 2nd Edition by Stanley M. Shinners &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/utari/acs/ee4314/lectures/Lecture%2022.pdf |format=PDF |title=State variable feedback  |website=Uta.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State feedback system==
Consider a linear time invariant system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/State_Feedback#Ackerman.27s_formula|title=Control Systems/State Feedback - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[state-space representation]]

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; y(t)=Cx(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the state vector, &lt;math&gt; u(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the input vector, and &lt;math&gt; A,B,C &lt;/math&gt; are matrices of compatible dimensions that represent the dynamics of our system, and, for simplicity's sake, assume  &lt;math&gt; D=0 &lt;/math&gt;. An input-output description of this system is given by the [[transfer function]]

: &lt;math&gt; C(sI-A)^{-1}B=C\ \frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)}\ B.&lt;/math&gt;

Since  &lt;math&gt;(sI-A)^{-1}=\frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)} &lt;/math&gt;,  the denominator of the system is given by the [[characteristic polynomial]] of  &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the poles of the system are the [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

If the system is [[Exponential stability|unstable]], or has a slow response or any other characteristic that does not specify the design criteria, it could be advantageous to make changes to it. The realization given by &lt;math&gt;\{A,B,C\}&lt;/math&gt;, however, represents the dynamics of the system, and sometimes cannot be altered. Thus, one approach to this problem might be to create a feedback loop with a gain &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that will feed the state variable into the input.

If the system is [[Controllability|controllable]], there is always an input &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that any state &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; can be transferred to any other state &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. With that in mind, a feedback loop can be added to the system with the control input &lt;math&gt;u(t)=r(t)-Kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such that the new dynamics of the system will be 

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+B[r(t)+Kx(t)]= [A+BK] x(t)+Br(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y(t)=Cx(t).&lt;/math&gt;

In this new realization, the poles will be dependent on the characteristic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{new}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A-BK&lt;/math&gt;, that is 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(s)=\det(sI-(A-BK)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Ackermann's formula==

Computing the characteristic polynomial and choosing a suitable feedback matrix can be a challenging task, especially in larger systems. One way to make computations easier is through Ackermann's formula. For simplicity's sake, consider a single input vector with no reference parameter &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, such as 

: &lt;math&gt;u(t)=-k^T x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot x(t)=Ax(t)-Bk^T x(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; is a feedback vector of compatible dimensions. Given that the system is still controllable, Ackermann's method states that the design process can be simplified by the following equation: 

: &lt;math&gt;k^T =\left[0\ 0\ \cdots \ 0\ 1\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta_\text{new}(A),
&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

=== Proof===
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c18/e6-43-13-11.pdf |title=Pole Placement Control |format=PDF |website=Eolss.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Assume that the system is [[Controllability|controllable]]. Defining &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}:=(A-Bk^{T})&lt;/math&gt; gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A_{CL})^n + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \alpha_k A_{CL}^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the powers of &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt; results in 

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^0=(A-Bk^T)^0=I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^1 = (A-Bk^T)^1=A-Bk^T&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^2=(A-Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A+(Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-(Bk^T)[A-Bk^T]=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^n = (A-Bk^T)^n=A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}- \cdots -Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing the previous equations into &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})&lt;/math&gt; yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}-\cdots-Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1})+\cdots+\alpha_2(A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}) + \alpha_1 (A-Bk^T)+\alpha_0I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL}) =(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1}+\cdots + \alpha_2 A^2+\alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)-(A^{n-1}Bk^{T}+A^{n-2}Bk^T A_{CL}+\cdots+Bk^TA_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots +\alpha_2 (ABk^T+Bk^T A_{CL})+\alpha_1(Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1} + \cdots + \alpha_2 A^2 + \alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-(A^{n-1}Bk^T+A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL} + \cdots + Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots + \alpha_2 (ABk^T + Bk^T A_{CL}) +\alpha_1 (A+Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the above equation as a matrix product and omitting the terms that  &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; does not appear isolated gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1} B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]],  &lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(A_{CL}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;, thus

&lt;math&gt;\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right] &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Controllability#Continuous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems|controllability matrix]] of the system. Since the system is controllable,  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. Thus, 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

To find &lt;math&gt;k^{T}&lt;/math&gt;, both sides can be multiplied by the vector &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;. This yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

Consider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.31/www/Fall06/1631_topic13.pdf |format=PDF |title=Topic #13 : 16.31 Feedback Control|website=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]x+\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]u&lt;/math&gt;

We know from the characteristic polynomial of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that the system is unstable since &lt;math&gt;det(sI-A)=(s-1)(s-2)-1=(s-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will only have positive eigenvalues. Thus, to stabilize the system we shall put a feedback gain &lt;math&gt;K=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
k_1 &amp; k_2\end{array}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

From Ackermann's formula, we can find a matrix &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  that will change the system so that its characteristic equation will be equal to a desired polynomial. Suppose we want &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(s)=s^2+11s+30&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(A)=A^2+11A+30I&lt;/math&gt; and computing the controllability matrix yields

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
B &amp; AB\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Also, we have that &lt;math&gt;A^2=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, from Ackermann's formula

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right]+11\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]+30I\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
43 &amp; 14\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
29 &amp; -43\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
14 &amp; 57\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Andrew Paul Guinand''' (known as '''Andrew Guinand'''), {{nowrap|(1912 - 1987)}} was an Australian mathematician and a professor at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].&lt;ref name=guibio&gt;{{cite web|date=1997 |author=J J O'Connor and E F Robertson |title=Andrew Paul Guinand |publisher=MacTutor |accessdate=2016-01-30 |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Guinand.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Guinand attended [[St Peter's College, Adelaide&lt;!--correct one?--&gt;|St Peter's College]], [[Adelaide]] from 1924 to 1929. In 1930, he entered [[St. Mark's College (University of Adelaide)|St Mark's College]] of the [[University of Adelaide]] to study mathematics. After graduating in 1933, Guinand attended the [[University of Oxford]] on a [[Rhodes Scholarship]], where [[Edward Charles Titchmarsh]] supervised his doctoral research.&lt;ref name="guibio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=14696}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1937 to 1938, he studied at [[Göttingen]], after which he studied at [[Princeton University]], until in 1940 he joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and served as a navigator.&lt;ref name=guibio/&gt;

Guinand worked as an assistant at the [[University of Cambridge]], and then as a lecturer at the [[Defence College of Management and Technology|Royal Military College of Science]], where he was eventually promoted to [[Associate professor]] of Mathematics. In 1955, he was named Head of Department at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] at [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]].&lt;ref name=guibio/&gt;  After two years at Armidale, he moved to the [[University of Alberta]] in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], and in 1960 moved again to the [[University of Saskatchewan]]. In 1964, he moved once more, becoming the first chairman of the mathematics department at [[Trent University]] which had been founded the previous year.&lt;ref name=guibio/&gt;

== Work ==
Guinand's research included work in [[number theory]] (particularly [[prime number]]s and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]), as well as generalizations of the [[Fourier transform]], in addition to publications on assorted topics including air navigation and the computation of [[pi]].&lt;ref name=guibio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guinand|first=A.

In 1959, he published a paper on the [[Poisson summation formula]] for which he presented a simpler solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guinand|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5267">[[File:Tetragon measures.svg|thumb|230px|A quadrilateral.]]

In [[geometry]], '''Bretschneider's formula''' is the following expression for the [[area]] of a general [[quadrilateral]]:
:&lt;math&gt; K = \sqrt {(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - abcd  \cdot \cos^2 \left(\frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - \tfrac{1}{2} abcd [ 1 + \cos (\alpha+ \gamma) ]} .&lt;/math&gt;
Here, {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''d''}} are the sides of the quadrilateral, {{math|''s''}} is the [[semiperimeter]], and {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''γ''}} are two opposite angles.

Bretschneider's formula works on any quadrilateral, whether it is [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]] or not.

The German mathematician [[Carl Anton Bretschneider]] discovered the formula in 1842. The formula was also derived in the same year by the German mathematician [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]].

== Proof ==
Denote the area of the quadrilateral by {{math|''K''}}. Then we have
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} K &amp;= \text{area of } \triangle ADB + \text{area of } \triangle BDC \\
                        &amp;= \frac{a d \sin \alpha}{2} + \frac{b c \sin \gamma}{2}. 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt; 2K= (ad) \sin \alpha + (bc) \sin \gamma. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 4K^2 = (ad)^2 \sin^2 \alpha + (bc)^2 \sin^2 \gamma + 2abcd \sin \alpha \sin \gamma. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[law of cosines]] implies that
:&lt;math&gt; a^2 + d^2 -2ad \cos \alpha = b^2 + c^2 -2bc \cos \gamma, &lt;/math&gt;
because both sides equal the square of the length of the diagonal {{math|''BD''}}. This can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2}{4} = (ad)^2 \cos^2 \alpha +(bc)^2 \cos^2 \gamma -2 abcd \cos \alpha \cos \gamma. &lt;/math&gt;

Adding this to the above formula for {{math|4''K''{{sup|2}}}} yields
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
4K^2 + \frac{(a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2}{4} &amp;= (ad)^2 + (bc)^2 - 2abcd \cos (\alpha + \gamma) \\
                                           &amp;= (ad+bc)^2-2abcd-2abcd\cos(\alpha+\gamma) \\
                                           &amp;= (ad+bc)^2 - 2abcd(\cos(\alpha+\gamma)+1) \\
                                           &amp;= (ad+bc)^2 - 4abcd\left(\frac{\cos(\alpha+\gamma)+1}{2}\right) \\
                                           &amp;= (ad + bc)^2 - 4abcd \cos^2 \left(\frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}\right). 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that: &lt;math&gt;\cos^2\frac{\alpha+\gamma}{2} = \frac{1+\cos(\alpha+\gamma)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (a trigonometric identity true for all &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha+\gamma}{2}&lt;/math&gt;)

Following the same steps as in [[Brahmagupta's formula#Trigonometric proof|Brahmagupta's formula]], this can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;16K^2 = (a+b+c-d)(a+b-c+d)(a-b+c+d)(-a+b+c+d) - 16abcd \cos^2 \left(\frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the semiperimeter
:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{a+b+c+d}{2},&lt;/math&gt; 
the above becomes
:&lt;math&gt;16K^2 = 16(s-d)(s-c)(s-b)(s-a) - 16abcd \cos^2 \left(\frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K^2 = (s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - abcd \cos^2 \left(\frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and Bretschneider's formula follows after taking the square root of both sides:
:&lt;math&gt; K = \sqrt {(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - abcd  \cdot \cos^2 \left(\frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

== Related formulas ==
Bretschneider's formula generalizes [[Brahmagupta's formula]] for the area of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], which in turn generalizes [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a [[triangle]].

The trigonometric adjustment in Bretschneider's formula for non-cyclicality of the quadrilateral can be rewritten non-trigonometrically in terms of the sides and the diagonals {{math|''e''}} and {{math|''f''}} to give&lt;ref&gt;J.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
K &amp;=\tfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{4e^2f^2-(b^2+d^2-a^2-c^2)^2} \\
  &amp;=\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - \tfrac{1}{4}(ac+bd+ef)(ac+bd-ef)}.
\end{align}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20599">In engineering, applied mathematics, and physics, the '''Buckingham {{pi}} theorem''' is a key [[theorem]] in [[dimensional analysis]].  It is a formalization of [[Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis]]. Loosely, the theorem states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving a certain number ''n'' of physical variables, then the original equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of ''p'' = ''n'' &amp;minus; ''k'' dimensionless parameters {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; constructed from the original variables. (Here ''k'' is the number of physical dimensions involved; it is obtained as the [[rank (matrix theory)|rank]] of a particular [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].)

The theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from the given variables, or [[nondimensionalization]], even if the form of the equation is still unknown.

== History ==

Although named for [[Edgar Buckingham]], the {{pi}} theorem was first proved by French mathematician [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Joseph Bertrand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=J.|year=1878|title=Sur l'homogénéité dans les formules de physique|url=http://gidropraktikum.narod.ru/Bertrand-1878.djvu|journal=Comptes rendus|volume=86|number=15|pages=916–920}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1878. Bertrand considered only special cases of problems from electrodynamics and heat conduction, but his article contains, in distinct terms, all the basic ideas of the modern proof of the theorem and clearly indicates the theorem's utility for modelling physical phenomena. The technique of using the theorem (“the method of dimensions”) became widely known due to the works of [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] (the first application of the {{pi}} theorem ''in the general case''&lt;ref&gt;When in applying the pi–theorem there arises an ''arbitrary function'' of dimensionless numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; to the dependence of pressure drop in a pipe upon governing parameters probably dates back to 1892,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayleigh|year=1892|title=On the question of the stability of the flow of liquids|url=http://gidropraktikum.narod.ru/Rayleigh-1892.djvu|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume=34|pages=59–70|doi=10.1080/14786449208620167}}&lt;/ref&gt; a heuristic proof with the use of series expansions, to 1894&lt;ref&gt;Second edition of ``The Theory of Sound’’({{cite book|last=Strutt|first=John William|year=1896|title=The Theory of Sound|url=https://archive.org/details/theorysound05raylgoog|publisher=Macmillan|volume=2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;).

Formal generalization of the {{pi}} theorem for the case of arbitrarily many quantities was given first by A. Vaschy in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from Vaschy’s article with his statement of the pi–theorem can be found in: {{cite journal|last=Macagno|first=E.

Riabouchinsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riabouchinsky|first=D.|year=1911|title=Мéthode des variables de dimension zéro et son application en aérodynamique|url=http://gidropraktikum.narod.ru/Riabouchinsky-Aerophile-1911.djvu|journal=L'Aérophile|pages=407–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1914 by Buckingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gidropraktikum.narod.ru/Buckingham.djvu Original text of Buckingham’s article in ''Physical Review'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was Buckingham's article that introduced the use of the symbol "{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;" for the dimensionless variables (or parameters), and this is the source of the theorem's name.

== Statement ==
More formally, the number of dimensionless terms that can be formed, ''p'', is equal to the [[Kernel (linear algebra)#nullity|nullity]] of the [[Buckingham π theorem#Formal proof|dimensional matrix]], and ''k'' is the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]]. For experimental purposes, different systems that share the same description in terms of these [[dimensionless number]]s are equivalent.

In mathematical terms, if we have a physically meaningful equation such as

:&lt;math&gt;f(q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the ''n'' physical variables, and they are expressed in terms of ''k'' independent physical units, then the above equation can be restated as

:&lt;math&gt;F(\pi_1,\pi_2,\ldots,\pi_p)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are dimensionless parameters constructed from the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''p'' = ''n'' − ''k'' dimensionless equations — the so-called ''Pi groups'' — of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_i=q_1^{a_1}\,q_2^{a_2}\cdots q_n^{a_n},&lt;/math&gt;

where the exponents ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are rational numbers (they can always be taken to be integers by redefining {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as being raised to a power that clears all denominators).

== Significance ==
The Buckingham {{pi}} theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from given variables, even if the form of the equation remains unknown. However, the choice of dimensionless parameters is not unique; Buckingham's theorem only provides a way of generating sets of dimensionless parameters and does not indicate the most "physically meaningful".

Two systems for which these parameters coincide are called ''similar'' (as with [[similar triangles]], they differ only in scale); they are equivalent for the purposes of the equation, and the experimentalist who wants to determine the form of the equation can choose the most convenient one. Most importantly, Buckingham's theorem describes the relation between the number of variables and fundamental dimensions.

== Proof ==

=== Outline ===
It will be assumed that the space of fundamental and derived physical units forms a [[vector space]] over the [[rational number]]s, with the fundamental units as basis vectors, and with multiplication of physical units as the "vector addition" operation, and raising to powers as the "scalar multiplication" operation:
represent a dimensional variable as the set of exponents needed for the fundamental units (with a power of zero if the particular fundamental unit is not present). For instance, the [[standard gravity]] ''g'' has units of &lt;math&gt;D/T^2=D^1T^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; (distance over time squared), so it is represented as the vector &lt;math&gt;(1,-2)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the basis of fundamental units (distance, time).

Making the physical units match across sets of physical equations can then be regarded as imposing linear constraints in the physical-units vector space.

=== Formal proof ===
Given a system of ''n'' dimensional variables (with physical dimensions) in ''k'' fundamental (basis) dimensions, write the ''dimensional matrix'' ''M'', whose rows are the fundamental dimensions and whose columns are the dimensions of the variables: the (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'')th entry is the power of the ''i''th fundamental dimension in the ''j''th variable. The matrix can be interpreted as taking in a combination of the dimensions of the variable quantities and giving out the dimensions of this product in fundamental dimensions. So
:&lt;math&gt;M\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\ \vdots \\ a_n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
is the units of
:&lt;math&gt;q_1^{a_1}\,q_2^{a_2}\cdots q_n^{a_n}. &lt;/math&gt;

A dimensionless variable is a quantity with fundamental dimensions raised to the zeroth power (the zero vector of the vector space over the fundamental dimensions), which is equivalent to the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of this matrix.

By the [[rank–nullity theorem]], a system of ''n'' vectors (matrix columns) in ''k'' linearly independent dimensions (the rank of the matrix is the number of fundamental dimensions) leaves a nullity, p, satisfying (''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''), where the nullity is the number of extraneous dimensions which may be chosen to be dimensionless.

The dimensionless variables can always be taken to be integer combinations of the dimensional variables (by [[clearing denominators]]). There is mathematically no natural choice of dimensionless variables; some choices of dimensionless variables are more physically meaningful, and these are what are ideally used.

== Examples ==

=== Speed ===
This example is elementary but serves to demonstrate the procedure.

Suppose a car is driving at 100&amp;nbsp;km/h; how long does it take to go 200&amp;nbsp;km?

This question considers three dimensioned variables: distance ''d'', time ''t'', and velocity ''v'', and we are seeking some law of the form {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''Duration''(''v'', ''d'')}} . These variables admit a basis of two dimensions: time dimension ''T'' and distance dimension ''D''. Thus there is 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 dimensionless quantity.

The dimensional matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;M=\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \;\;\;1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

in which the rows correspond to the basis dimensions ''D'' and ''T'', and the columns to the considered dimensions ''D'', ''T'', and ''V'', where the latter stands for the velocity dimension. The elements of the matrix correspond to the powers to which the respective dimensions are to be raised. For instance, the third column (1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1), states that {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''D''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''V''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, represented by the column vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=[0,0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, is expressible in terms of the basis dimensions as &lt;math&gt;V = D^1 T^{-1} = D/T &lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt; M\mathbf{v} = [1,-1]&lt;/math&gt;.

For a dimensionless constant &lt;math&gt;\pi=D^{a_1}T^{a_2}V^{a_3}&lt;/math&gt;, we are looking for vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=[a_1,a_2,a_3]&lt;/math&gt; such that the matrix-vector product ''M'''''a''' equals the zero vector [0,0]. In linear algebra, the set of vectors with this property is known as the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] (or nullspace) of (the [[linear map]] represented by) the dimensional matrix. In this particular case its kernel is one-dimensional. The dimensional matrix as written above is in [[reduced row echelon form]], so one can read off a non-zero kernel vector to within a multiplicative constant:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=\begin{bmatrix} -1\\ \;\;\;1\\ \;\;\;1\\ \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the dimensional matrix were not already reduced, one could perform [[Gauss–Jordan elimination]] on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant, replacing the dimensions by the corresponding dimensioned variables, may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi = d^{-1}t^1v^1 = tv/d .&lt;/math&gt;

Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, the above dimensionless constant raised to any arbitrary power yields another (equivalent) dimensionless constant.

Dimensional analysis has thus provided a general equation relating the three physical variables:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\pi)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

or, letting &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; denote a [[Zero of a function|zero]] of function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi=C,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;t=C\frac{d}{v},&lt;/math&gt;

The actual relationship between the three variables is simply &lt;math&gt;d=vt&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, in this case &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has one physically relevant root, and it is unity. The fact that only a single value of ''C'' will do and that it is equal to 1 is not revealed by the technique of dimensional analysis.

===The simple pendulum===
We wish to determine the period ''T'' of small oscillations in a simple pendulum. It will be assumed that it is a function of the length ''L'', the mass ''M'', and the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth ''g'', which has dimensions of length divided by time squared. The model is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(T,M,L,g) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that it is written as a relation, not as a function: ''T'' isn't written here as a function of ''M'', ''L'', and ''g''.)

There are 3 fundamental physical dimensions in this equation: time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and 4 dimensional variables, ''T'', ''M'', ''L'', and ''g''. Thus we need only 4&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 dimensionless parameter, denoted π, and the model can be re-expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;f(\pi) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where π is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\pi =T^{a_1}M^{a_2}L^{a_3}g^{a_4}&lt;/math&gt;

for some values of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

The dimensions of the dimensional quantities are:

:&lt;math&gt;T = t, M = m, L = \ell, g = \ell/t^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The dimensional matrix is:

:&lt;math&gt;M=\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -2\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;  1
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The rows correspond to the dimensions &lt;math&gt;t, m&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and the columns to the dimensional variables ''T'', ''M'', ''L'' and ''g''. For instance, the 4th column, (&amp;minus;2,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1), states that the ''g'' variable has dimensions of &lt;math&gt;t^{-2}m^0 \ell^1&lt;/math&gt;.)

We are looking for a kernel vector ''a'' = [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] such that the matrix product of ''M'' on ''a'' yields the zero vector [0,0,0]. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a kernel vector within a multiplicative constant:

:&lt;math&gt;a=\begin{bmatrix}2\\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Were it not already reduced, one could perform [[Gauss–Jordan elimination]] on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\pi &amp;= T^2M^0L^{-1}g^1\\
                        &amp;= gT^2/L\end{align}.&lt;/math&gt;
In fundamental terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi=(t)^2(m)^0(\ell)^{-1}(\ell/t^2)^1 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which is dimensionless. Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, if the above dimensionless constant is raised to any arbitrary power, it will yield another equivalent dimensionless constant.

This example is easy because three of the dimensional quantities are fundamental units, so the last (''g'') is a combination of the previous. Note that if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were non-zero, there would be no way to cancel the ''M'' value; therefore ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''must'' be zero. Dimensional analysis has allowed us to conclude that the period of the pendulum is not a function of its mass. (In the 3D space of powers of mass, time, and distance, we can say that the vector for mass is linearly independent from the vectors for the three other variables. Up to a scaling factor, &lt;math&gt;\vec g + 2 \vec T - \vec L&lt;/math&gt; is the only nontrivial way to construct a vector of a dimensionless parameter.)

The model can now be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;f(gT^2/L) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the zeroes of ''f'' are discrete, we can say ''gT''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''n''th zero of the function ''f''. If there is only one zero, then ''gT''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''. It requires more physical insight or an experiment to show that there is indeed only one zero and that the constant is in fact given by ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For large oscillations of a pendulum, the analysis is complicated by an additional dimensionless parameter, the maximum swing angle. The above analysis is a good approximation as the [[small angle approximation|angle approaches zero]].

===Other examples===

A simple example of dimensional analysis can be found for the case of the mechanics of a thin, solid and parallel-sided rotating disc.  There are five variables involved which reduce to two non-dimensional groups.  The relationship between these can be determined by numerical experiment using, for example, the finite element method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsay|first1=Angus|title=Dimensional Analysis and Numerical Experiments for a Rotating Disc|url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/knowledge-base/technical-notes/dimensional-analysis--numerical-experiments-for-a-rotating-disc/|website=Ramsay Maunder Associates|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CellML''' is an [[XML]] based [[markup language]] for describing [[mathematical model]]s. Although it could theoretically describe any mathematical model, it was originally created with the [[Physiome Project]] in mind, and hence used primarily to describe models relevant to the field of biology. This is reflected in its name CellML, although this is simply a name, not an abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.cellml.org/sympa/arc/cellml-discussion/2007-07/msg00005.html|title=[cellml-discussion] Expanding the CellML abbreviation}}&lt;/ref&gt; CellML is growing in popularity as a portable description format for computational models, and groups throughout the world are using CellML for modelling or developing software tools based on CellML. CellML is similar to Systems Biology Markup Language [[SBML]] but provides greater scope for model modularity and reuse, and is not specific to descriptions of biochemistry.

== History ==
The CellML language grew from a need to share models of cardiac cell dynamics among researchers at a number of sites across the world. The original working group formed in 1998 consisted of David Bullivant, Warren Hedley, and Poul Nielsen; all three were at that time members of the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Auckland. The language was an application of the XML specification developed by the World Wide Web Consortium&amp;nbsp;– the decision to use XML was based on late 1998 recommendations from Warren Hedley and André (David) Nickerson. Existing XML-based languages were leveraged to describe the mathematics (content [[MathML]]), metadata ([[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]), and links between resources ([[XLink]]). The CellML working group first became aware of the [[SBML]] effort in late 2000, when Warren Hedley attended the 2nd workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in Tokyo.

The working group collaborated with a number of researchers at Physiome Sciences Inc. (particularly Melanie Nelson, Scott Lett, Mark Grehlinger, Prasad Ramakrishna, Jeremy Rice, Adam Muzikant, and Kam-Chuen Jim) to draft the initial CellML 1.0 specification, which was published on the 11th of August 2001. This first draft was followed by specifications for CellML Metadata and an update to CellML to accommodate structured nesting of models with the addition of the &lt;import&gt; element. Physiome Sciences Inc. also produced the first CellML capable software. The [http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/ National Resource for Cell Analysis and Modeling (NRCAM)] at the  University of Connecticut Health Center also produced early CellML capable software called [http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/login/login.html Virtual Cell].

In 2002 the CellML 1.1 specification was written, in which imports were added. Imports provide the ability to incorporate external components into a model, enabling modular modelling. This specification was frozen in early 2006. Work has continued on [[metadata]] and other specifications.

In July 2009 the CellML website was completely revamped, and an initial version of the new CellML repository software (PMR2) was released.

== The structure of a CellML model ==
A CellML model consists of a number of components, each described in their own component element. A component can be an entirely conceptual entity created for modelling convenience, or it can have some real physical interpretation (for example, it could represent the cell membrane).

Each component contains a number of variables, which must be declared by placing a variable element inside the component. For example, a component representing a cell membrane may have a variable called V representing the potential difference (voltage) across the cell membrane.

Mathematical relationships between variables are expressed within components, using [[MathML]]. MathML is used to make declarative expressions (as opposed to procedural statements as in a computer programming language). However, most CellML processing software will only accept a limited of range of mathematics (for example, some processing software requires equations with a single variable on one side of an equality). The choice of MathML makes CellML particularly suited for describing models containing differential equations. There is no mechanism for the expression of stochastic models or any other form of randomness.

Components can be connected in other components using a connection element, which describes the name of two components to be connected, and the variables in the first component which are mapped to variables in the second component. Such connections are a statement that the variable in one component is equivalent to another variable in another component.

CellML models also allow relationships between components to be expressed. The CellML specification defines two types of relationship, encapsulation and containment, however more can be defined by the user. The containment relationship is used to express that one component is physically within another. The encapsulation relationship is special because it is the only relationship that affects the interpretation of the rest of the model. The effect of encapsulation is that components encapsulated beneath other components are private and cannot be accessed except by the component directly above in the encapsulation tree. The modeller is free to use encapsulation as a conceptual tool, and it does not necessarily have any physical interpretation.

== Specifications ==

CellML is defined by core specifications as well as additional specifications for metadata, used to annotate models and specify simulations.

=== CellML 1.0 ===
[http://www.cellml.org/specifications/cellml_1.0 CellML 1.0] was the first final specification, and is used to describe many of the models in the [http://www.cellml.org/models CellML Model Repository].

CellML 1.0 has some biochemistry specific elements for describing the role of variables in a reaction model.

=== CellML 1.1 ===
[http://www.cellml.org/specifications/cellml_1.1 CellML 1.1] introduced the ability to import components and units. In order to fully support this feature, variables in CellML 1.1 accept variable names as initial values.

=== Metadata specifications ===

CellML has several metadata specifications, used to annotate models or provide information for running and/or visualizing simulations of models.
* [http://www.cellml.org/specifications/metadata The metadata 1.0 specification] is used to annotate models with a variety of information; relevant references, authorship information, the species the model is relevant to, and so on.
* [http://www.cellml.org/specifications/metadata/simulations Simulation metadata] provides the information required to reproduce specific simulations using a CellML model.
* [http://www.cellml.org/specifications/metadata/graphs Graphing metadata] provides information to specify particular visualizations of simulation output, for example to reproduce a particular graph from a paper.

== CellML.org ==
[http://www.cellml.org CellML.org] aims to provide a focal point for the CellML community. Members can submit, review, and update models and receive feedback and help from the community. A CellML discussion mailing list can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070608072510/http://www.cellml.org/mailman/listinfo/cellml-discussion CellML-discussion mailing list]. The scope of this mailing list includes everything related to the development and use of CellML.

A repository of several hundred biological models encoded into CellML can be found on the CellML community website at [http://www.cellml.org/models CellML Model Repository]. These models are actively undergoing a curation process aiming to provide annotations with biological ontologies such as [[Gene Ontology]] and to validate the models against standards of unit balance and biophysical constrains such as conservation of mass, charge, energy etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">'''"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems"''' is a paper published in 1949 by [[Claude Shannon]] discussing [[cryptography]] from the viewpoint of [[information theory]]. It is one of the foundational treatments (arguably ''the'' foundational treatment) of modern cryptography. It is also a proof that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]].

Shannon published an earlier version of this research in the classified report ''A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography,'' Memorandum MM 45-110-02, Sept. 1, 1945, Bell Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.att.com/~njas/doc/shannonbib.html Bibliography of Claude Elwood Shannon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems," p. 656. [http://www.prism.net/user/dcowley/shannon/shannon01.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;  This classified report also precedes the publication of his "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]", which appeared in 1948.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">A '''comparametric equation''' is an [[equation]] that describes a [[parameter|parametric]] relationship between a [[function (mathematics)|function]] and a [[Scaling (geometry)|dilated]] version of the same function, where the equation does not involve the [[parameter]].  For example, ''ƒ''(2''t'') = 4''ƒ''(''t'') is a comparametric equation, when we define ''g''(''t'') = ''ƒ''(2''t''), so that we have ''g'' = 4''ƒ'' no longer contains the parameter, ''t''.  The comparametric equation ''g'' = 4''ƒ'' has a family of solutions, one of which is ''ƒ'' = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

To see that ''ƒ'' = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a solution, we merely substitute back in: ''g'' = ''ƒ''(2''t'') = (2''t'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''ƒ'', so that ''g'' = 4''ƒ''.

Comparametric equations arise naturally in [[signal processing]] when we have multiple measurements of the same phenomenon, in which each of the measurements was acquired using a different sensitivity.  For example, two or more differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter give rise to a comparametric relationship, the solution of which is the response function of the camera, image sensor, or imaging system.

Comparametric equations have been used in many areas of research, and have many practical applications to the real world. They are used in [[radar]], [[microphone array]]s, and have been used in processing crime scene video in [[homicide]] trials in which the only evidence against the accused was video recordings of the murder.

== Solution ==
An existing solution is Comparametric Camera Respnose Function (CCRF) for real-time comparametric analysis. It has applications in the analysis of multiple images. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|others=吴安, 金西, 杜学亮, 张克宁, 姚春赫, 马淑芬|title=HDR视频算法优化及硬件实现|url=http://crad.ict.ac.cn/EN/abstract/abstract3440.shtml|journal=计算机研究与发展|language=cn|volume=54|issue=5|doi=10.7544/issn1000-1239.2017.20160122|issn=1000-1239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/maths/MPS_2008_03.pdf|title=Periodic solutions for nonlinear dilation equations|last=Grindrod|first=Peter|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''complexification''' or '''universal complexification''' of a [[real Lie group]] is given by a continuous homomorphism of the group into a [[complex Lie group]] with the universal property that every continuous homomorphism of the original group into another complex Lie group extends compatibly to a complex analytic homomorphism between the complex Lie groups. The complexification, which always exists, is unique up to isomorphism. Its [[Lie algebra]] is a quotient of the [[complexification]] of the Lie algebra of the original group. They are isomorphic if the original group has a quotient by a discrete normal subgroup which is linear.

For [[compact Lie group]]s, the complexification, sometimes called the '''Chevalley complexification''' after [[Claude Chevalley]], can be defined as the group of complex characters of the [[Hopf algebra]] of [[representative function]]s, i.e. the [[matrix coefficient]]s of finite-dimensional [[unitary representation|representation]]s of the group. In any finite-dimensional faithful unitary representation of the compact group it can be realized concretely as a closed subgroup of the complex [[general linear group]]. It consists of operators with [[polar decomposition]] {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''u'' • exp ''iX''}}, where {{math|''u''}} is a unitary operator in the compact group and {{math|''X''}} is a skew-adjoint operator in its Lie algebra. In this case the complexification is a [[algebraic group|complex algebraic group]] and its Lie algebra is the complexification of the Lie algebra of the compact Lie group.

==Universal complexification==

===Definition===
If {{math|''G''}} is a Lie group, a '''universal complexification''' is given by a complex Lie group {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and a continuous homomorphism {{math|''φ'': ''G'' → ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with the universal property that, if {{math|''f'': ''G'' → ''H''}} is an arbitrary continuous homomorphism into a complex Lie group {{math|''H''}}, then there is a unique complex analytic homomorphism {{math|''F'': ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; →  ''H''}} such that {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''F'' ∘ ''φ''}}. 

Universal complexifications always exist and are unique up to a unique complex analytic isomorphism (preserving inclusion of the original group).

===Existence===
If {{math|''G''}} is connected with Lie algebra {{math|𝖌}}, then its [[universal covering group]] {{math|'''G'''}} is simply connected. Let {{math|'''G'''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the simply connected complex Lie group with Lie algebra {{math|𝖌 ⊗ '''C'''}}. Let {{math|''Φ'':  '''G'''  → '''G'''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the natural homomorphism and {{math|''π'':'''G'''  → ''G''}} the natural covering map. Then given a homomorphism {{math|''f'': ''G'' → ''H''}}, there is a unique complex analytic homomorphism {{math|''E'':  '''G'''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''H''}} such that {{math|''f'' ∘ ''π''  {{=}} ''E'' ∘ ''Φ''}}. Let {{math|''K''}} be the intersection of the kernels of the homomorphisms {{math|''E''}} as {{math|''f''}} varies over all possibilities. Then {{math|''K''}} is a closed normal complex Lie subgroup of {{math|'''G'''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the quotient group is a universal complexification. In particular if {{math|''G''}} is simply connected, its universal complexification is just {{math|'''G'''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;See:

* {{harvnb|Hochschild|1965|P=204-205}}
* {{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=212–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-connected Lie groups {{math|''G''}} with identity component {{math|''G''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}} and component group {{math|Γ {{=}} ''G'' / ''G''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the extension

:&lt;math&gt; \{1\} \rightarrow G^o \rightarrow G \rightarrow \Gamma \rightarrow \{1\} &lt;/math&gt;

induces an extension

:&lt;math&gt;\{1\} \rightarrow (G^o)_{\mathbf{C}} \rightarrow G_{\mathbf{C}} \rightarrow \Gamma \rightarrow \{1\} &lt;/math&gt;

and the complex Lie group {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a complexification of {{math|''G''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=210–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniqueness===
The universal property implies that the universal complexification is unique up to complex analytic isomorphism.

===Injectivity===
If the original group is linear, so too is the universal complexification and the homomorphism between the two is an inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hochschild|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Onishchik|Vinberg|1994}} give an example of a connected real Lie group for which the homomorphism is not injective even at the Lie algebra level: they take the product of {{math|'''T'''}} by the [[universal covering group]] of {{math|SL(2,'''R''')}} and quotient out by the discrete cyclic subgroup generated by an irrational rotation in the first factor and a generator of the center in the second.

==Chevalley complexification==

===Hopf algebra of matrix coefficients===
If {{math|''G'' }}is a compact Lie group, the *-algebra {{math|''A''}} of matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional unitary representations is a uniformly dense *-subalgebra of {{math|''C''(''G'')}}, the *-algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on {{math|''G''}}. It is naturally a [[Hopf algebra]] with [[comultiplication]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Delta f(g,h)= f(gh).}&lt;/math&gt;

The characters of {{math|''A''}} are the *-homomorphisms of {{math|''A''}} into {{math|'''C'''}}. They can be identified with the point evaluations {{math|''f'' ↦ ''f''(''g'')}} for {{math|''g''}} in {{math|''G''}} and the comultiplication allows the group structure on {{math|''G''}} to be recovered. The homomorphisms of {{math|''A''}} into {{math|'''C'''}} also form a group. It is a complex Lie group and can be identified with the complexification {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''G''}}. The *-algebra {{math|''A''}} is generated by the matrix coefficients of any faithful representation {{mvar|σ}} of {{math|''G''}}. It follows that {{mvar|σ}} defines a faithful complex analytic representation of {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Hochschild|1965}}
*{{harvnb|Chevalley|1946}}
*{{harvnb|Bröcker|tom Dieck|1985}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invariant theory===
The original approach of {{harvtxt|Chevalley|1946}} to the complexification of a compact Lie group can be concisely stated within the language of classical [[invariant theory]], described in {{harvtxt|Weyl|1946}}. Let {{math|''G''}} be a closed subgroup of the [[unitary group]] {{math|''U''(''V'')}} where {{math|''V''}} is a finite-dimensional complex inner product space. Its Lie algebra consists of all skew-adjoint operators {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|exp ''tX''}} lies in {{math|''G''}} for all real {{math|''t''}}. Set {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''V'' ⊕ '''C'''}} with the trivial action of {{math|''G''}} on the second summand. The group {{math|''G''}} acts on {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''N'' &lt;/sup&gt;}}, with an element {{math|''u''}} acting as {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The [[commutant]] (or centralizer algebra) is denoted by {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} End&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It is generated as a *-algebra by its unitary operators and its commutant is the *-algebra spanned by the operators {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The complexification {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''G''}} consists of all operators {{math|''g''}} in {{math|GL(''V'')}} such that {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} commutes with {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''g''}} acts trivially on the second summand in {{math|'''C'''}}. By definition it is a closed subgroup of {{math|GL(''V'')}}. The defining relations (as a commutant) show that {{math|''G''}} is an algebraic subgroup. Its intersection with {{math|''U''(''V'')}} coincides with {{math|''G''}}, since it is ''a priori'' a larger compact group for which the irreducible representations stay irreducible and inequivalent when restricted to {{math|''G''}}. Since {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is generated by unitaries, an invertible operator {{math|''g''}} lies in {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} if the unitary operator {{math|''u''}} and positive operator {{math|''p''}} in its [[polar decomposition]] {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''u'' ⋅ ''p''}} both lie in {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Thus {{math|''u''}} lies in {{math|''G''}} and the operator {{math|''p''}} can be written uniquely as {{math|''p'' {{=}} exp ''T''}} with {{math|''T''}} a self-adjoint operator. By the [[functional calculus]] for polynomial functions it follows that {{math|''h''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} lies in the commutant of {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} if {{math|''h'' {{=}} exp ''z'' ''T''}} with {{math|''z''}} in {{math|'''C'''}}. In particular taking {{math|''z''}} purely imaginary, {{math|''T''}} must have the form {{math|''iX''}} with {{math|''X''}} in the Lie algebra of {{math|''G''}}. Since every finite-dimensional representation of {{math|''G''}} occurs as a direct summand of {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it is left invariant by {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and thus every finite-dimensional representation of {{math|''G''}} extends uniquely to {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The extension is compatible with the polar decomposition. Finally the polar decomposition implies that {{math|''G''}} is a maximal compact subgroup of {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, since a strictly larger compact subgroup would contain all integer powers of a positive operator {{math|''p''}}, a closed infinite discrete subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Chevalley|1946}}
*{{harvnb|Weyl|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decompositions in the Chevalley complexification==

===Cartan decomposition===
The decomposition derived from the polar decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G_{\mathbf{C}} = G\cdot P =G \cdot \exp i\mathfrak{g},}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|𝖌}} is the Lie algebra of {{math|''G''}}, is called the '''[[Cartan decomposition]]''' of {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The exponential factor {{math|''P''}} is invariant under conjugation by {{math|''G''}} but is not a subgroup. The complexification is invariant under taking adjoints, since {{math|''G''}} consists of unitary operators and {{math|''P''}} of positive operators.

===Gauss decomposition===
The '''Gauss decomposition''' is a generalization of the [[LU decomposition]] for the general linear group and a specialization of the [[Bruhat decomposition]]. For {{math|GL(''V'')}} it states that with respect to a given orthonormal basis {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} an element {{math|''g''}} of {{math|GL(''V'')}} can be factorized in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g=XDY}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''X''}} lower [[unitriangular matrix|unitriangular]], {{math|''Y''}} upper unitriangular and {{math|''D''}} diagonal if and only if all the [[principal minor]]s of {{math|''g''}} are non-vanishing. In this case {{math|''X'', ''Y''}} and {{math|''D''}} are uniquely determined.

In fact Gaussian elimination shows there is a unique {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''g''}} is upper triangular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper and lower unitriangular matrices, {{math|'''N'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''N'''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;}}, are closed unipotent subgroups of GL(''V''). Their Lie algebras consist of upper and lower strictly triangular matrices. The exponential mapping is a polynomial mapping from the Lie algebra to the corresponding subgroup by nilpotence. The inverse is given by the logarithm mapping which by unipotence is also a polynomial mapping. In particular there is a correspondence between closed connected subgroups of {{math|'''N'''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;}} and subalgebras of their Lie algebras. The exponential map is onto in each case, since the polynomial function  {{math|log ( ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''B''&lt;/sup&gt; )}} lies in a given Lie subalgebra if {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} do and are sufficiently small.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bump|2001|pp=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gauss decomposition can be extended to complexifications of other closed connected subgroups {{math|''G''}} of {{math|U(''V'')}} by using the root decomposition to write the complexified Lie algebra as&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Bump|2001}}
*{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}} = \mathfrak{n}_- \oplus \mathfrak{t}_{\mathbf{C}} \oplus \mathfrak{n}_+,}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|𝖙}} is the Lie algebra of a maximal torus {{math|''T''}} of {{math|''G''}} and {{math|𝖓&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the direct sum of the corresponding positive and negative root spaces. In the weight space decomposition of {{math|''V''}} as eigenspaces of {{math|''T'', 𝖙}} acts as diagonally, {{math|𝖓&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} acts as lowering operators and {{math|𝖓&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;}} as raising operators. {{math|𝖓&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;}} are nilpotent Lie algebras acting as nilpotent operators; they are each other's adjoints on {{math|''V''}}. In particular {{math|''T''}} acts by conjugation of {{math|𝖓&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}}, so that {{math|𝖙&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ 𝖓&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a semidirect product of a nilpotent Lie algebra by an abelian Lie algebra.

By [[Engel's theorem]], if {{math|𝖆 ⊕ 𝖓}} is a semidirect product, with {{math|𝖆}} abelian and {{math|𝖓}} nilpotent, acting on a finite-dimensional vector space {{math|''W''}} with operators in {{math|𝖆}} diagonalizable and operators in {{math|𝖓}} nilpotent, there is a vector {{math|''w''}} that is an eigenvector for {{math|𝖆}} and is annihilated by {{math|𝖓}}. In fact it is enough to show there is a vector annihilated by {{math|𝖓}}, which follows by induction on {{math|dim 𝖓}}, since the derived algebra {{math|𝖓'}} annihilates a non-zero subspace of vectors on which {{math|𝖓 / 𝖓'}} and {{math|𝖆}} act with the same hypotheses.

Applying this argument repeatedly to {{math|𝖙&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ 𝖓&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} shows that there is an orthonormal basis {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}  of {{math|''V''}} consisting of eigenvectors of {{math|𝖙&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|𝖓&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} acting as upper triangular matrices with zeros on the diagonal.

If {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the complex Lie groups corresponding to {{math|𝖓&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|𝖙&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the Gauss decomposition states that the subset

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{N_- T_{\mathbf{C}} N_+}&lt;/math&gt;

is a direct product and consists of the elements in {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for which the principal minors are non-vanishing. It is open and dense. Moreover, if {{math|'''T'''}} denotes the maximal torus in {{math|U(''V'')}},

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{N_\pm=\mathbf{N}_\pm\cap G_{\mathbf{C}},\,\,\, T_{\mathbf{C}} = \mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{C}}\cap G_{\mathbf{C}}.}&lt;/math&gt;

These results are an immediate consequence of the corresponding results for {{math|GL(''V'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bruhat decomposition===
If {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') / ''T''}} denotes the [[Weyl group]] of {{math|''T''}} and {{math|''B''}} denotes the [[Borel subgroup]] {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; ''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the Gauss decomposition is also a consequence of the more precise '''[[Bruhat decomposition]]'''

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G_{\mathbf{C}} =\bigcup_{\sigma\in W} B\sigma B,}&lt;/math&gt;

decomposing {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} into a disjoint union of [[double coset]]s of {{math|''B''}}. The complex dimension of a double coset {{math|''BσB''}} is determined by the length of {{mvar|σ}} as an element of {{math|''W''}}. The dimension is maximized at the [[Coxeter element]] and gives the unique open dense double coset. Its inverse conjugates {{math|''B''}} into the Borel subgroup of lower triangular matrices in {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''}}&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Gelfand|Naimark|1950}}, section 18, for {{math|SL(''n'','''C''')}}
*{{harvnb|Bruhat|1956|p=187}} for {{math|SO(''n'','''C''')}} and {{math|Sp(''n'','''C''')}}
*{{harvnb|Chevalley|1955}} for complexifications of simple compact Lie groups

*{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977|pp=216–217}}
*{{harvnb|Bump|2001|pp=205–211}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruhat decomposition is easy to prove for {{math|SL(''n'','''C''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinberg|1974|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|''B''}} be the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} the subgroup of diagonal matrices. So {{math|N(''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;) /  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For {{math|''g''}} in {{math|SL(''n'','''C''')}}, take {{math|''b''}} in {{math|''B''}} so that {{math|''bg''}} maximizes the number of zeros appearing at the beginning of its rows. Because a multiple of one row can be added to another, each row has a different number of zeros in it. Multiplying by a matrix {{math|''w''}} in {{math|N(''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, it follows that {{math|''wbg''}} lies in {{math|''B''}}. For uniqueness, if {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''b'' ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the entries of {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} vanish below the diagonal. So the product lies in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, proving uniqueness.

{{harvtxt|Chevalley|1955}} showed that the expression of an element {{math|''g''}} as {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''σb''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} becomes unique if {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is restricted to lie in the upper unitriangular subgroup {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''σ N''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In fact, if {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''σ N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, this follows from the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{N_+=N_\sigma\cdot M_\sigma.}&lt;/math&gt;

The group {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} has a natural filtration by normal subgroups {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')}} with zeros in the first {{math|''k'' − 1}} superdiagonals and the successive quotients are Abelian. Defining {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')}} to be the intersections with {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')}}, it follows by decreasing induction on {{math|''k''}} that {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') {{=}}  ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') ⋅ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')}}. Indeed, {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'' + 1)}} and {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'' + 1)}} are specified in {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')}} by the vanishing of complementary entries {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} on the {{math|''k''}}th superdiagonal according to whether {{mvar|σ}} preserves the order {{math|''i'' &lt; ''j''}} or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevalley|1955|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruhat decomposition for the other classical simple groups can be deduced from the above decomposition using the fact that they are fixed point subgroups of folding automorphisms of {{math|SL(''n'','''C''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Steinberg|1974|pp=73–74}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981a|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; For {{math|Sp(''n'','''C''')}}, let {{math|''J''}} be the {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrix with {{math|1}}'s on the antidiagonal and {{math|0}}'s elsewhere and set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; J\\ -J &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Then {{math|Sp(''n'','''C''')}} is the fixed point subgroup of the involution {{math|''θ''(''g'') {{=}} ''A'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of SL(2''n'','''C''')}}. It leaves the subgroups {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''B''}} invariant. If the basis elements are indexed by {{math|''n'', ''n''−1, ..., 1, −1, ..., −''n''}}, then the Weyl group of {{math|Sp(''n'','''C''')}} consists of {{mvar|σ}} satisfying
{{math|''σ''(''j'') {{=}} −''j''}}, i.e. commuting with {{mvar|θ}}. Analogues of {{math|''B'', ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;}} are defined by intersection with {{math|Sp(''n'','''C''')}}, i.e. as fixed points of {{mvar|θ}}. The uniqueness of the decomposition {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''nσb'' {{=}} ''θ''(''n'') ''θ''(''σ'') ''θ''(''b'')}} implies the Bruhat decomposition for {{math|Sp(''n'','''C''')}}.

The same argument works for {{math|SO(''n'','''C''')}}. It can be realised as the fixed points of {{math|''ψ''(''g'') {{=}} ''B'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} in {{math|SL(''n'','''C''')}} where {{math|''B'' {{=}} ''J''}}.

===Iwasawa decomposition===
The '''[[Iwasawa decomposition]]'''

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G_{\mathbf{C}} = G\cdot A \cdot N}&lt;/math&gt;

gives a decomposition for {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for which, unlike the Cartan decomposition, the direct factor {{math|''A'' ⋅ ''N''}} is a closed subgroup, but it is no longer invariant under conjugation by {{math|''G''}}. It is the [[semidirect product]] of the [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] subgroup {{math|''N''}} by the Abelian subgroup {{math|''A''}}.

For {{math|U(''V'')}} and its complexification {{math|GL(''V'')}}, this decomposition can be derived as a restatement of the [[Gram–Schmidt process|Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sepanski|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact let {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be an orthonormal basis of {{math|''V''}} and let {{math|''g''}} be an element in {{math|GL(''V'')}}. Applying the Gram–Schmidt process to {{math|''ge''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ge''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, there is a unique orthonormal basis {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and positive constants {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_i= a_i ge_i + \sum_{j&lt;i} n_{ji} ge_j.}&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''k''}} is the unitary taking {{math|(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} to {{math|(''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, it follows that {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''k''}} lies in the subgroup {{math|'''AN'''}}, where {{math|'''A'''}} is the subgroup of positive diagonal matrices with respect to  {{math|(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|'''N'''}} is the subgroup of upper [[unitriangular matrix|unitriangular matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knapp|2001|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the notation for the Gauss decomposition, the subgroups in the Iwasawa decomposition for {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are defined by
&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973|pp=288–290}}
*{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977|pp=197–207}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=257–262}}
*{{harvnb|Bump|2001|pp=197–204}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A=\exp i\mathfrak{t} = \mathbf{A} \cap G_{\mathbf{C}}, \,\,\, N=\exp \mathfrak{n}_+=\mathbf{N}  \cap G_{\mathbf{C}}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the decomposition is direct for {{math|GL(''V'')}}, it is enough to check that {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''GAN''}}. From the properties of the Iwasawa decomposition for {{math|GL(''V'')}}, the map {{math|''G'' × ''A'' × ''N''}} is a diffeomorphism onto its image in {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is closed. On the other hand, the dimension of the image is the same as the dimension of {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, so it is also open. So {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''GAN''}} because {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bump|2001|pp=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Zhelobenko|1973}} gives a method for explicitly computing the elements in the decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; For {{math|''g''}} in {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} set {{math|''h'' {{=}} ''g''*''g''}}. This is a positive self-adjoint operator so its principal minors do not vanish. By the Gauss decomposition, it can therefore be written uniquely in the form
{{math|''h'' {{=}} ''XDY''}} with {{math|''X''}} in {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''D''}} in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''}} in {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Since {{math|''h''}} is self-adjoint, uniqueness forces {{math|''Y'' {{=}} ''X''*}}. Since it is also positive {{math|''D''}} must lie in {{math|''A''}} and have the form {{math|''D'' {{=}} exp ''iT''}} for some unique {{math|''T''}} in {{math|𝖙}}. Let {{math|''a'' {{=}} exp ''iT''/2}} be its unique square root in {{math|''A''}}. Set {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''Y''}} and {{math|''k'' {{=}} ''g'' ''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Then {{math|''k''}} is unitary, so is in {{math|''G''}}, and {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''kan''}}.

==Complex structures on homogeneous spaces==
The Iwasawa decomposition can be used to describe complex structures on the {{math|''G''-[[orbit]]}}s in [[complex projective space]] of [[highest weight vector]]s of finite-dimensional [[irreducible representation]]s of {{math|''G''}}. In particular the identification between {{math|''G'' / ''T''}} and {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''B''}} can be used to formulate the [[Borel–Weil theorem]]. It states that each irreducible representation
of {{math|''G''}} can be obtained by [[induced representation|holomorphic induction]] from a character of {{math|''T''}}, or equivalently that it is realized in the space of [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s of a [[holomorphic line bundle]] on {{math|''G'' / ''T''}}.

The closed connected subgroups of {{math|''G''}} containing {{math|''T''}} are described by [[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]]. They are exactly the [[centralizer]]s of tori {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''T''}}. Since every torus is generated topologically by a single element {{math|''x''}}, these are the same as centralizers {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}} of elements {{math|''X''}} in {{math|𝖙}}. By a result of Hopf {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is always connected: indeed any element {{math|''y''}} is along with {{math|''S''}} contained in some maximal torus, necessarily contained in {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}.

Given an irreducible finite-dimensional representation {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}} with highest weight vector {{math|''v''}} of weight {{math|''λ''}}, the stabilizer of {{math|'''C''' ''v''}} in {{math|''G''}} is a closed subgroup {{math|''H''}}. Since {{math|''v''}} is an eigenvector of {{math|''T''}}, {{math|''H''}} contains {{math|''T''}}. The complexification {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} also acts on {{math|''V''}} and the stabilizer is a closed complex subgroup {{math|''P''}} containing {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Since {{math|''v''}} is annihilated by every raising operator corresponding to a positive root {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''P''}} contains the Borel subgroup {{math|''B''}}. The vector {{math|''v''}} is also a highest weight vector for the copy of {{math|'''sl'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponding to {{math|''α''}}, so it is annihilated by the lowering operator generating {{math|𝖌&lt;sub&gt;−''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} if {{math|(''λ'', ''α'') {{=}} 0}}.  The Lie algebra {{math|'''p'''}} of {{math|''P''}} is the direct sum of {{math|𝖙&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and root space vectors annihilating {{math|''v''}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{b}\oplus \bigoplus_{(\alpha,\lambda)=0} \mathfrak{g}_{-\alpha}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The Lie algebra of {{math|''H'' {{=}} ''P'' ∩ ''G''}} is given by {{math|'''p''' ∩ 𝖌}}. By the Iwasawa decomposition {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''GAN''}}. Since {{math|''AN''}} fixes {{math|'''C''' ''v''}}, the {{math|''G''}}-orbit of {{math|''v''}} in the complex projective space of {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} coincides with the {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} orbit and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G/H=G_{\mathbf{C}}/P.}&lt;/math&gt;

In particular

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G/T=G_{\mathbf{C}}/B.}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identification of the Lie algebra of {{math|''T''}} with its dual, {{math|''H''}} equals the centralizer of {{mvar|λ}} in {{math|''G''}}, and hence is connected. The group {{math|''P''}} is also connected. In fact the space {{math|''G'' / ''H''}} is simply connected,
since it can be written as the quotient of the (compact) universal covering group of the compact semisimple group {{math|''G'' / ''Z''}} by a connected subgroup, where {{math|''Z''}} is the center of {{math|''G''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''P''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the identity component of {{math|''P''}},   {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''}} has {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}} as a covering space, so that {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''P''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The homogeneous space {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''}} has a complex structure, because {{math|''P''}} is a complex subgroup. The orbit in complex projective space is closed in the Zariski topology by [[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry#Chow.27s theorem|Chow's theorem]], so is a smooth projective variety. The Borel–Weil theorem and its generalizations are discussed in this context in {{harvtxt|Serre|1954}}, {{harvtxt|Helgason|1994}}, {{harvtxt|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Sepanski|2007}}.

The parabolic subgroup {{math|''P''}} can also be written as a union of double cosets of {{math|''B''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{P=\bigcup_{\sigma\in W_\lambda} B\sigma B,}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the stabilizer of {{mvar|λ}} in the Weyl group {{math|''W''}}. It is generated by the reflections corresponding to the simple roots orthogonal to {{mvar|λ}}.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Humphreys|1981}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981a}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noncompact real forms==
There are other closed subgroups of the complexification of a compact connected Lie group ''G'' which have the same the complexified Lie algebra. These are the other '''real forms''' of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977|pp=164–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involutions of simply connected compact Lie groups===
If ''G'' is a simply connected compact Lie group and σ is an automorphism of period 2, then the fixed point subgroup ''K'' = ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is ''automatically connected''. (In fact this is true for any automorphism of ''G'', as shown for inner automorphisms by [[Robert Steinberg|Steinberg]] and in general by [[Armand Borel|Borel]].) &lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=320–321}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=46–48}}
*{{harvnb|Duistermaar|Kolk|2000|pp=194–195}}
*{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977|p=151}}, Exercise 11
&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be seen most directly when the involution σ corresponds to a [[Hermitian symmetric space]]. In that case σ is inner and implemented by an element in a one-parameter subgroup  exp ''tT'' contained in the center of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt;. The innerness of σ implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''G'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a general involution σ, the connectedness of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; can be seen as follows.&lt;ref&gt;See:
{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point is the Abelian version of the result: if ''T'' is a maximal torus of a simply connected group ''G'' and σ is an involution leaving invariant ''T'' and a choice of positive roots (or equivalently a [[Weyl chamber]]), then the fixed point subgroup ''T''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is connected. In fact the kernel of the exponential map from &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; onto ''T'' is a lattice Λ with a '''Z'''-basis indexed by simple roots, which σ permutes. Splitting up according to orbits, ''T'' can be written as a product of terms '''T''' on which σ acts trivially or terms '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where σ interchanges the factors. The fixed point subgroup just corresponds to taking the diagonal subgroups in the second case, so is connected.

Now let ''x'' be any element fixed by σ, let ''S'' be a maximal torus in C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; and let ''T'' be the identity component of C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''S''). Then ''T'' is a maximal torus in ''G'' containing ''x'' and ''S''. It is invariant under σ and the identity component of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is ''S''. In fact since ''x'' and ''S'' commute, they are contained in a maximal torus which, because it is connected, must lie in ''T''. By construction ''T'' is invariant under σ. The identity component of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; contains  ''S'', lies in C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; and centralizes ''S'', so it equals ''S''. But ''S'' is central in ''T'', to ''T'' must be Abelian and hence a maximal torus. For σ acts as multiplication by −1 on the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}\ominus \mathfrak{s}&lt;/math&gt;, so it and therefore also &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; are Abelian.

The proof is completed by showing that σ preserves a Weyl chamber associated with ''T''. For then ''T''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is connected so must equal ''S''. Hence ''x'' lies in ''S''.  Since ''x'' was arbitrary, ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; must therefore be connected.

To produce a Weyl chamber invariant under σ, note that there is no root space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; on which both ''x'' and ''S'' acted trivially, for this would contradict the fact that C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''S'') has the same Lie algebra as ''T''. Hence there must be an element ''s'' in ''S'' such that ''t'' = ''xs'' acts non-trivially on each root space. In this case ''t'' is a ''regular element'' of ''T''—the identity component of its centralizer in ''G'' equals ''T''. There is a unique [[affine Weyl group|Weyl alcove]] ''A'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''t'' lies in exp ''A'' and 0 lies in the closure of ''A''. Since ''t'' is fixed by σ, the alcove is left invariant by σ and hence so also is the [[Weyl chamber]] ''C'' containing it.

===Conjugations on the complexification===
Let ''G'' be a simply connected compact Lie group with complexification ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;. The map ''c''(''g'') = (''g''*)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; defines an automorphism of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; as a real Lie group with ''G'' as fixed point subgroup. It is conjugate-linear on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; and satisfies ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = id. Such automorphisms of either ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''conjugations'''.
Since ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; is also simply connected any conjugation ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a unique automorphism ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The classification of conjugations ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; reduces to that of involutions σ of ''G'' because
given a ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; there is an automorphism φ of the complex group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{c_0=\varphi\circ c_1\circ \varphi^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

commutes with ''c''. The conjugation ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; then leaves ''G'' invariant and restricts to an involutive automorphism σ. By simple connectivity the same is true at the level of Lie algebras. At the Lie algebra level ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be recovered from σ by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{c_0(X+iY)=\sigma(X)- i\sigma(Y)}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''X'', ''Y'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

To prove the existence of φ let ψ = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''c'' an automorphism of the complex group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;. On the Lie algebra level it defines a self-adjoint operator for the complex inner product

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(X,Y)=-B(X,c(Y)),}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'' is the [[Killing form]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus ψ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a positive operator and an automorphism along with all its real powers. In particular take

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\varphi=(\psi^2)^{1/4}}&lt;/math&gt;

It satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{c_0c=\varphi c_1 \varphi^{-1} c=\varphi cc_1 \varphi=(\psi^2)^{1/2} \psi^{-1} =\varphi^{-1} cc_1 \varphi^{-1}=c \varphi c_1\varphi^{-1}=cc_0.}&lt;/math&gt;

===Cartan decomposition in a real form===
For the complexification ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;, the Cartan decomposition is described above. Derived from the [[polar decomposition]] in the complex [[general linear group]], it gives a diffeomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G_{\mathbf{C}} = G\cdot \exp i\mathfrak{g} = G\cdot P = P\cdot G.}&lt;/math&gt;

On ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; there is a conjugation operator ''c'' corresponding to ''G'' as well as an involution σ commuting with ''c''. Let ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'' σ and let ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the fixed point subgroup of ''c''. It is closed in the matrix group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; and therefore a Lie group. The involution σ acts on both ''G'' and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. For the Lie algebra of ''G'' there is a decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

into the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of σ. The fixed point subgroup ''K'' of σ in ''G'' is connected since ''G'' is simply connected. Its Lie algebra is the +1 eigenspace &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. The Lie algebra of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the fixed point subgroup of σ is again ''K'', so that ''G'' ∩ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''. In ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a Cartan decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G_0=K\cdot \exp i\mathfrak{p} =K\cdot P_0 = P_0\cdot K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is again a diffeomorphism onto the direct and corresponds to the polar decomposition of matrices.
It is the restriction of the decomposition on ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;. The product gives a diffeomorphism onto a closed subset of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. To check that it is surjective, for ''g'' in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; write ''g'' = ''u'' ⋅ ''p'' with ''u'' in ''G'' and ''p'' in ''P''. Since ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''g'' = ''g'', uniqueness implies that σ''u'' = ''u'' and σ''p'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence ''u'' lies in ''K'' and ''p'' in ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Cartan decomposition in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; shows that ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is connected, simply connected and noncompact, because of the direct factor ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a noncompact real semisimple Lie group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977|pp=166–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, ''A'' = exp  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is a toral subgroup such that σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on ''A''; and any two such &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;'s are conjugate by an element of ''K''.
The properties of ''A'' can be shown directly.  ''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so its Lie algebra lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and hence equals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the centralizer of ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of the conjugates of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular some conjugate of ''X'' lies in any other choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Helgason|1978|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar statements hold for the action of ''K'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_0=i\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}_0&lt;/math&gt;. Morevoer, from the Cartan decomposition for ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_0&lt;/math&gt;, then

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9232">The '''deterministic rendezvous problem''' is a variant of the [[rendezvous problem]] where the players, or ''robots'', must find each other by following a [[determinism#Mathematical models|deterministic]] sequence of instructions. Although each robot follows the same instruction sequence, a unique label assigned to each robot is used for [[symmetry breaking]]. Typically, the robots act synchronously, though non-synchronous versions of the deterministic rendezvous problem exist.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ta-Shma|first1=Amnon|last2=Zwick|first2=Uri|author2-link=Uri Zwick|title=Deterministic rendezvous, treasure hunts, and strongly universal exploration sequences|journal=ACM Transactions on Algorithms|date=April 2014|volume=10|issue=3|at=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the synchronous version of the deterministic rendezvous problem, both robots are initially placed at arbitrary [[vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] in a finite, connected, undirected [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The size and structure of the graph is unknown to the robots.

The information known by a robot is as follows:
*''T'', the number of time steps since it has been activated
*''d'', the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the node currently occupied by the robot
*''L'', the label of the robot (typically taking the form of a bit string)

To solve the deterministic rendezvous problem, both robots must be given a sequence of deterministic instructions which allow the robots to use their known information to find each other. The robots are considered to have found each other if they are both occupying the same node in the graph during the same time step.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014"/&gt;

== Solutions ==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
A number of algorithms exist to solve the deterministic rendezvous problem. Some of the solutions are listed below:

=== Dessmark et. al ===
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
In 2006, Dessmark et al. presented a solution which solves the deterministic rendezvous problem in time proportional to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;O\left(n^5\sqrt{\tau l}+n^{10}l\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where:
*''n'' is the number of nodes in the graph
*''τ'' is the difference in activation time between the two robots
*''l'' is the length of the shorter of the labels of the robots

This solution is not ideal, since ''τ'' is an input parameter of the deterministic rendezvous problem and can therefore be arbitrarily large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dessmark|first1=A.|last2=Fraingnaud|first2=P.|last3=Kowalski|first3=D.|last4=Pelc|first4=A.|title=Deterministic rendezvous in graphs|journal=Algorithmica|date=2006|volume=46|issue=1|pages=69–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kowalski and Malinowski ===
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
In 2008, Kowalski and Malinowski presented a solution which solves the problem in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;O\left(n^{15}+l^3\right)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;ref name="Kowalski 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowalski|first1=D.|last2=Malinowski|first2=A.|title=How to meet in anonymous network|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|date=2008|volume=399|issue=1-2|pages=144–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a significant improvement, since this time complexity is not dependent on ''τ''. This solution has one major drawback, though. It makes use of ''backtracking'', where the robots must keep track of each edge that they have traversed. This is a drawback because it places assumptions on the structure of the graph (namely, how it is labeled), and the robots' sensory and memory capabilities.

=== Ta-Shma and Zwick ===
The solution presented by Ta-Shma and [[Uri Zwick|Zwick]] in 2014 solves the problem in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;O\left(n^{5}+l\right)&lt;/math&gt; time. In addition to the reduced time complexity (which doesn't rely on ''τ''), this solution also doesn't use backtracking. Instead, it uses the notion of [[graph traversal#Universal Traversal Sequences|universal traversal sequences]] to help solve the problem.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014" /&gt;

A universal traversal sequence is a sequence of instructions comprising a [[graph traversal]] for any [[regular graph]] with a set number of vertices and for any starting vertex.&lt;ref name="Aleliunas 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aleliunas|first1=R.|last2=Karp|first2=R.|last3=Lipton|first3=R.|last4=Lovász|first4=L.|last5=Rackoff|first5=C.|title=Random walks, universal traversal sequences, and the complexity of maze problems|journal=20th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1979)|date=1979|doi=10.1109/SFCS.1979.34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the robots may not be in a regular graph, a universal traversal sequence for ''n'' nodes and degree ''d'' is used, where ''d'' is the maximum degree of the graph. Any instructions in the chosen universal traversal sequence which specify that the robot travels to a neighbor of the current node which doesn't exist (i.e., the current node has degree &lt; ''d'') are ignored. By doing this, all nodes in the graph with degree less than ''d'' are treated as having enough self-loops to bring their total degree up to ''d'', effectively allowing the graph to be treated as regular for the purpose of universal traversals.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014" /&gt;

The basic idea of Ta-Shma and Zwick's solution is that if one of the robots completes a complete traversal of the graph while the other robot remains idle, or ''rests'', then the two robots are guaranteed to meet. Since the size of the graph is unknown, the robots run universal traversal sequences for increasing values of ''n'', while periodically resting. Whether a robot rests before or after a traversal depends upon the value of its label.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014" /&gt;

For example, one of the robots could run the sequence:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;U_10^{u_1}U_20^{u_2}U_40^{u_4}U_80^{u_8}...U_{2^i}0^{u_{2^i}}...&lt;/math&gt;
while the other robot runs the sequence:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;0^{u_1}U_10^{u_2}U_20^{u_4}U_40^{u_8}U_8...0^{u_{2^i}}U_{2^i}...&lt;/math&gt;
where U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a universal traversal sequence for a graph with ''i'' nodes, u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of steps in that universal traversal sequence, and 0&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; represents ''k'' steps where the robot rests. The universal traversal sequence for the size of the actual graph will be run by one robot while the other rests for the number of steps in that traversal. However, this only works if the two robots are activated at the same time.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014" /&gt;

To cover the case where the robots are activated at different times, the sequence to run will include rest periods of length u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; after each step (in the traversal and the rest period). For example, one of the robots would run the sequence:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sigma_10^{u_1-1}\sigma_20^{u_1-1}\sigma_30^{u_1-1}...\sigma_{u_1}0^{u_1-1}0^{2u_1}\pi_10^{u_2-1}\pi_20^{u_2-1}\pi_30^{u_2-1}...\pi_{u_2}0^{u_2-1}0^{2u_2}&lt;/math&gt;
where σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; step of U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and π&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; step of U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014" /&gt;

In order to formally present the sequence that each robot will run, some additional notation is needed. Let:
*σ&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 if ''b'' = 0
*σ&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; = σ if ''b'' = 1
*&lt;math&gt;\bar{L} = 1 - L&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma^{m_1..m_k}=\sigma_1^m...\sigma_k^m&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;D_k(\sigma_1...\sigma_m)=\sigma_10^k...\sigma_m0^k&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that one robot's label is 0 and that the other robot's label is 1, the sequence that each robot would run is:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;D_{u_1-1}((U_1U_1)^{L\bar{L}})D_{u_2-1}((U_2U_2)^{L\bar{L}})...D_{u_{2^k}-1}((U_{2^k}U_{2^k})^{L\bar{L}})...&lt;/math&gt;

The sub-sequence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_{u_i-1}((U_iU_i)^{L\bar{L}})&lt;/math&gt; is known as a ''block'' and can be rewritten as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_{u_i-1}((U_iU_i)^L(U_iU_i)^{\bar{L}})&lt;/math&gt;.

If σ = U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and m = u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the block can be further simplified to:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;(\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1}\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1})^L&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math display="block"&gt;(\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1}\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1})^{\bar{L}}&lt;/math&gt;
Both of the above lines are known as ''chunks''. One chunk consists of a universal traversal sequence with interleaved rest periods, while the other chunk is a rest period of length 2''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

If the robot's label is 0, then each block it runs is equal to:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;0^{2m^2}\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1}\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1}&lt;/math&gt;
If the label is 1, then each block it runs is equal to:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1}\sigma_10^{m-1}...\sigma_m0^{m-1}0^{2m^2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Analysis====
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
The sequence of instructions listed above will allow two robots with labels 0 and 1 to meet after O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2c&lt;/sup&gt;) time steps.&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014" /&gt;

Ta-Shma and Zwick show how to extend this solution to allow the robots to meet after only O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;) time steps and how to deal with arbitrary labels (which increases the time until the robots meet to O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;+''l'') time steps).&lt;ref name="Ta-Shma 2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1297">In [[mathematical analysis]], '''Dini continuity''' is a refinement of [[continuous function|continuity]]. Every Dini continuous function is continuous. Every [[Lipschitz continuous]] function is Dini continuous.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[compact space|compact]] subset of a metric space (such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;), and let &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a function from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into itself.  The [[modulus of continuity]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(t) = \sup_{d(x,y)\le t} d(f(x),f(y)). &lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called '''Dini-continuous''' if

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \frac{\omega_f(t)}{t}\,dt &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

An equivalent condition is that, for any &lt;math&gt;\theta \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty \omega_f(\theta^i a) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric space#Bounded and totally bounded spaces|diameter]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">The '''driver scheduling problem''' (DSP) is type of problem in [[operations research]] and [[theoretical computer science]].

The DSP consists of selecting a set of duties (assignments) for the drivers or pilots of vehicles (e.g., buses, trains, boats, or planes) involved in the transportation of passengers or goods.&lt;ref name="VoßDaduna2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voß|first1=Stefan|last2=Daduna|first2=Joachim R.|title=Computer Aided Scheduling of Public Transport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsvzwUiUBIsC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540422433|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salvendy2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salvendy|first=Gavriel|title=Handbook of Industrial Engineering: Technology and Operations Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjY3IZ9Unv0C&amp;pg=PA813|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2001-05-25|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471330578|pages=813–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This very complex problem involves several constraints related to labour and company rules and also different evaluation criteria and objectives. Being able to solve this problem efficiently can have a great impact on costs and quality of service for public transportation companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borndörfer|first=Ralf|author2=Martin Grötschel | author2-link = Martin Grötschel |author3=Marc E. Pfetsch |title=Public transport to the fORe|journal=OR/MS Today|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2|pages=30–40|url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-4-06/frtransport.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large number of different rules that a feasible duty might be required to satisfy, such as
*Minimum and maximum stretch duration
*Minimum and maximum break duration
*Minimum and maximum work duration
*Minimum and maximum total duration
*Maximum extra work duration
*Maximum number of vehicle changes
*Minimum driving duration of a particular vehicle
[[Operations research]] has provided [[optimization]] models and [[algorithm]]s that lead to efficient solutions for this problem. Among the most common models proposed to solve the DSP are the [[Set covering|Set Covering]] and Set Partitioning Models (SPP/SCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lourenço|first=H.R. |author2=Paixão, J.P. |author3=Portugal, R.|title=Driver Scheduling Problem Modelling|journal=Public Transport: Planning and Operations|year=2009|volume=1|issue=2|pages=103–120|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12469-008-0007-0|doi=10.1007/s12469-008-0007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lourenço|first=H.R. |author2=Paixão, J.P. |author3=Portugal, R.|title=The crew-scheduling module in the GIST system|journal=Economic Working Papers Series, Department of Economics and Business, Universitat Pompeu Fabra|year=2001|volume=547|url=http://www.econ.upf.edu/en/research/onepaper.php?id=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the SPP model, each work piece (task) is covered by only one duty. In the SCP model, it is possible to have more than one duty covering a given work piece.
In both models, the set of work pieces that needs to be covered is laid out in rows, and the set of previously defined feasible duties available for covering specific work pieces is arranged in columns. The DSP resolution, based on either of these models, is the selection of the set of feasible duties that guarantees that there is one (SPP) or more (SCP) duties covering each work piece while minimizing the total cost of the final schedule.

'''Experimental mathematics''' is an approach to mathematics in which computation is used to investigate mathematical objects and identify properties and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Mathworld|urlname=ExperimentalMathematics|title=Experimental Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined as "that branch of mathematics that concerns itself ultimately with the codification and transmission of insights within the mathematical community through the use of experimental (in either the Galilean, Baconian, Aristotelian or Kantian sense) exploration of conjectures and more informal beliefs and a careful analysis of the data acquired in this pursuit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldweb.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/vault/expmath/expmath/html/node16.html Experimental Mathematics: A Discussion] by J. Borwein, P. Borwein, R. Girgensohn and S. Parnes&lt;/ref&gt;

As expressed by [[Paul Halmos]]: "Mathematics is not a [[deductive science]]—that's a cliché. When you try to prove a theorem, you don't just list the [[Premise|hypotheses]], and then start to reason. What you do is [[trial and error]], experimentation, guesswork. You want to find out what the facts are, and what you do is in that respect similar to what a laboratory technician does."&lt;ref&gt;''I Want to be a Mathematician: An Automathography'' (1985), p. 321 (in 2013 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mathematicians have always practised experimental mathematics. Existing records of early mathematics, such as [[Babylonian mathematics]], typically consist of lists of numerical examples illustrating algebraic identities. However, modern mathematics, beginning in the 17th century, developed a tradition of publishing results in a final, formal and abstract presentation. The numerical examples that may have led a mathematician to originally formulate a general theorem were not published, and were generally forgotten.

Experimental mathematics as a separate area of study re-emerged in the twentieth century, when the invention of the electronic computer vastly increased the range of feasible calculations, with a speed and precision far greater than anything available to previous generations of mathematicians. A significant milestone and achievement of experimental mathematics was the discovery in 1995 of the [[Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula]] for the binary digits of π. This formula was discovered not by formal reasoning, but instead
by numerical searches on a computer; only afterwards was a rigorous proof found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/pi-quest.pdf The Quest for Pi] by [[David H. Bailey]], [[Jonathan Borwein|Jonathan M. Borwein]], [[Peter Borwein|Peter B. Borwein]] and [[Simon Plouffe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives and uses==
The objectives of experimental mathematics are "to generate understanding and insight; to generate and confirm or confront conjectures; and generally to make mathematics more tangible, lively and fun for both the professional researcher and the novice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mathematics by Experiment: Plausible Reasoning in the 21st Century|last= Borwein|first= Jonathan |author2=Bailey, David|year= 2004|publisher= A.K. Peters|isbn= 1-56881-211-6|pages=''vii''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Suggesting approaches for formal proof.
#Replacing lengthy hand derivations with computer-based derivations.
#Confirming analytically derived results.

==Tools and techniques==
Experimental mathematics makes use of [[numerical methods]] to calculate approximate values for integrals and infinite series. [[Arbitrary precision arithmetic]] is often used to establish these values to a high degree of precision – typically 100 significant figures or more. [[Integer relation algorithm]]s are then used to search for relations between these values and mathematical constants. Working with high precision values reduces the possibility of mistaking a [[mathematical coincidence]] for a true relation. A formal proof of a conjectured relation will then be sought – it is often easier to find a formal proof once the form of a conjectured relation is known.

If a counterexample is being sought or a large-scale proof by exhaustion is being attempted, [[distributed computing]] techniques may be used to divide the calculations between multiple computers.

Frequent use is made of general [[mathematical software]] such as [[Mathematica]], although domain-specific software is also written for attacks on problems that require high efficiency. Experimental mathematics software usually includes [[error detection and correction]] mechanisms, integrity checks and redundant calculations designed to minimise the possibility of results being invalidated by a hardware or software error.

==Applications and examples==
Applications and examples of experimental mathematics include:

*Searching for a counterexample to a conjecture
**Roger Frye used experimental mathematics techniques to find the smallest counterexample to [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]].
**The [[ZetaGrid]] project was set up to search for a counterexample to the [[Riemann hypothesis]].
**Tomás Oliveira e Silva&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tomás|last=Silva|website=Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro|title=Computational verification of the 3x+1 conjecture|url=http://sweet.ua.pt/tos/3x+1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318045112/http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/3x+1.html|archivedate=18 March 2013|date=28 December 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; searched for a counterexample to the [[Collatz conjecture]].
*Finding new examples of numbers or objects with particular properties
**The [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] is searching for new [[Mersenne prime]]s.
**The [[distributed.net]]'s OGR project is searching for optimal [[Golomb ruler]]s.
**The [[Riesel Sieve]] project is searching for the smallest [[Riesel number]].
**The [[Seventeen or Bust]]  project is searching for the smallest [[Sierpinski number]].
*Finding serendipitous numerical patterns
**[[Edward Lorenz]] found the [[Lorenz attractor]], an early example of a chaotic [[dynamical system]], by investigating anomalous behaviours in a numerical weather model.
**The [[Ulam spiral]] was discovered by accident.
**The pattern in the [[Ulam number]]s was discovered by accident.
**[[Mitchell Feigenbaum]]'s discovery of the [[Feigenbaum constant]] was based initially on numerical observations, followed by a rigorous proof.
*Use of computer programs to check a large but finite number of cases to complete a [[computer-assisted proof|computer-assisted]] [[proof by exhaustion]]
**[[Thomas Callister Hales|Thomas Hales]]'s proof of the [[Kepler conjecture]].
**Various proofs of the [[four colour theorem]].
**[[Clement Lam]]'s proof of the non-existence of a [[projective plane|finite projective plane]] of order 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clement W. H. Lam |title=The Search for a Finite Projective Plane of Order 10 |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=98 |issue=4 |year=1991 |pages=305–318 |url=http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/lam/ |doi=10.2307/2323798}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Gary McGuire proved a minimum uniquely solvable [[Sudoku]] requires 17 clues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=arXiv|first1=Emerging Technology from the|title=Mathematicians Solve Minimum Sudoku Problem|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/426554/mathematicians-solve-minimum-sudoku-problem/|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Symbolic validation (via [[computer algebra]]) of conjectures to motivate the search for an analytical proof
**Solutions to a special case of the quantum [[three-body problem]] known as the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]] were found standard quantum chemistry basis sets before realizing they all lead to the same unique analytical solution in terms of a ''generalization'' of the [[Lambert W function]].  Related to this work is the isolation of a previously unknown link between gravity theory and quantum mechanics in lower dimensions (see [[Quantum gravity#The dilaton|quantum gravity]] and references therein).
**In the realm of relativistic [[N-body problem|many-bodied mechanics]], namely the [[t-symmetry|time-symmetric]] [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]]: the equivalence between an advanced [[Liénard–Wiechert potential]] of particle ''j'' acting on particle ''i'' and  the corresponding potential for particle ''i'' acting on particle ''j'' was demonstrated exhaustively to order &lt;math&gt; 1/c^{10} &lt;/math&gt; before being proved mathematically.  The Wheeler-Feynman theory has regained interest because of [[quantum nonlocality]].
**In the realm of linear optics, verification of the series expansion of the [[Slowly varying envelope approximation|envelope]] of the electric field for [[Ultrashort pulse#Wave packet propagation in nonisotropic media|ultrashort light pulses travelling in non isotropic media]].  Previous expansions had been incomplete: the outcome revealed an extra term vindicated by experiment.
*Evaluation of [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]], [[infinite product]]s and [[integral]]s (also see [[symbolic integration]]), typically by carrying out a high precision numerical calculation, and then using an [[integer relation algorithm]] (such as the [[Inverse Symbolic Calculator]]) to find a linear combination of mathematical constants that matches this value. For example, the following identity was first conjectured by Enrico Au-Yeung, a student of [[Jonathan Borwein]] using computer search and [[PSLQ algorithm]] in 1993:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bailey, David |title=New Math Formulas Discovered With Supercomputers |journal=NAS News |year=1997 |volume=2 |issue=24 |url=https://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Gridpoints/PDF/nasnews_V02_N24_1997.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{k}\right)^2 = \frac{17\pi^4}{360}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

*Visual investigations
**In [[Indra's Pearls (book)|Indra's Pearls]], [[David Mumford]] and others investigated various properties of [[Möbius transformation]] and [[Schottky group]] using computer generated images of the groups which: ''furnished convincing evidence for many conjectures and lures to further exploration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mumford | first = David |author2=Series, Caroline |author3=Wright, David |title = Indra's Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein | publisher = Cambridge | date = 2002 | isbn = 0-521-35253-3 |pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plausible but false examples==
{{main| mathematical coincidence}}

Some plausible relations hold to a high degree of accuracy, but are still not true. One example is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{0}^{\infty}\cos(2x)\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\cos\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\mathrm{d}x = \frac{\pi}{8}.&lt;/math&gt;

The two sides of this expression actually differ after the 42nd decimal place.&lt;ref name=bailey&gt;David H. Bailey and Jonathan M. Borwein, [http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/math-future.pdf Future Prospects for Computer-Assisted Mathematics], December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is that the maximum [[Height of a polynomial|height]] (maximum absolute value of coefficients) of all the factors of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 appears to be the same as the height of the ''n''th [[cyclotomic polynomial]]. This was shown by computer to be true for ''n'' &lt; 10000 and was expected to be true for all ''n''. However, a larger computer search showed that this equality fails to hold for ''n'' = 14235, when the height of the ''n''th cyclotomic polynomial is 2, but maximum height of the factors is 3.&lt;ref&gt;The height of Φ&lt;sub&gt;4745&lt;/sub&gt; is 3 and 14235 = 3 x 4745. See Sloane sequences {{OEIS2C|id=A137979}} and {{OEIS2C|id=A160338}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''fixed-point index''' is a concept in [[topological]] [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] theory, and in particular [[Nielsen theory]]. The fixed-point index can be thought of as a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] measurement for fixed points.

The index can be easily defined in the setting of [[complex analysis]]: Let ''f''(''z'') be a [[holomorphic map]]ping on the complex plane, and let ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a fixed point of ''f''. Then the function ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z'' is holomorphic, and has an isolated zero at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. We define the fixed point index of ''f'' at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, denoted ''i''(''f'', ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), to be the multiplicity of the zero of the function ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z'' at the point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

In real Euclidean space, the fixed-point index is defined as follows: If ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an isolated fixed point of ''f'', then let ''g'' be the function defined by

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \frac{x - f(x)}{|| x - f(x) ||}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then ''g'' has an isolated singularity at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and maps the boundary of some deleted neighborhood of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the unit sphere. We define ''i''(''f'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to be the [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer]] [[Degree of a continuous mapping|degree]] of the mapping induced by ''g'' on some suitably chosen small sphere around ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;A. Katok and B. Hasselblatt(1995), Introduction to the modern theory of dynamical systems, Cambridge University Press, Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lefschetz–Hopf theorem==
The importance of the fixed-point index is largely due to its role in the [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz]]–[[Heinz Hopf|Hopf]] theorem, which states:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in \mathrm{Fix}(f)} i(f,x) = \Lambda_f,&lt;/math&gt;

where Fix(''f'') is the set of fixed points of ''f'', and ''Λ''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Lefschetz number]] of ''f''.

Since the quantity on the left-hand side of the above is clearly zero when ''f'' has no fixed points, the Lefschetz–Hopf theorem trivially implies the [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20982">In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[harmonic analysis]], the '''fractional Fourier transform''' ('''FRFT''') is a family of [[linear transformation]]s generalizing the [[Fourier transform]]. It can be thought of as the Fourier transform to the ''n''-th power, where ''n'' need not be an [[integer]] &amp;mdash; thus, it can transform a function to any ''intermediate'' domain between time and [[frequency]]. Its applications range from [[filter design]] and [[signal analysis]] to [[phase retrieval]] and [[pattern recognition]].

The FRFT can be used to define fractional [[convolution]], [[correlation]], and other operations, and can also be further generalized into the [[linear canonical transformation]] (LCT).  An early definition of the FRFT was introduced by [[Edward Condon|Condon]],&lt;ref&gt;E. U. Condon, "Immersion of the Fourier transform in a continuous group of functional transformations", ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA''  '''23''',  (1937) 158–164. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1076889/pdf/pnas01779-0028.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; by solving for the [[Green's function]] for phase-space rotations, and also by Namias,&lt;ref&gt;V. Namias, "The fractional order Fourier transform and its application to quantum mechanics," ''J. Inst. Appl. Math.'' '''25''', 241&amp;ndash;265 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; generalizing work of [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]]&lt;ref&gt;N. Wiener, "Hermitian Polynomials and Fourier Analysis",  ''J. Mathematics and Physics'' '''8''' (1929) 70-73.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Hermite polynomials]].

However, it was not widely recognized in signal processing until it was independently reintroduced around 1993 by several groups.&lt;ref&gt;Luís B. Almeida, "The fractional Fourier transform and time-frequency representations," ''IEEE Trans. Signal Process.'' '''42''' (11), 3084&amp;ndash;3091 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been a surge of interest in extending Shannon's sampling theorem&lt;ref&gt;Ran Tao, Bing Deng, Wei-Qiang Zhang and Yue Wang, "Sampling and sampling rate conversion of band limited signals in the fractional Fourier transform domain," ''IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing'', '''56''' (1), 158&amp;ndash;171 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bhandari and P. Marziliano, "Sampling and reconstruction of sparse signals in fractional Fourier domain," ''IEEE Signal Processing Letters'', '''17''' (3), 221&amp;ndash;224 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; for signals which are band-limited in the Fractional Fourier domain.

A completely different meaning for "fractional Fourier transform" was introduced by Bailey and Swartztrauber&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Bailey and P. N. Swarztrauber, "The fractional Fourier transform and applications," ''[[SIAM Review]]'' '''33''', 389-404 (1991).  (Note that this article refers to the chirp-z transform variant, not the FRFT.)&lt;/ref&gt; as essentially another name for a [[z-transform]], and in particular for the case that corresponds to a [[discrete Fourier transform]] shifted by a fractional amount in frequency space (multiplying the input by a linear [[chirp]]) and evaluating at a fractional set of frequency points (e.g. considering only a small portion of the spectrum).  (Such transforms can be evaluated efficiently by [[Bluestein's FFT algorithm]].)  This terminology has fallen out of use in most of the technical literature, however, in preference to the FRFT.   The remainder of this article describes the FRFT.

==Introduction==
The continuous [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of a function {{nowrap|ƒ: '''R''' → '''C'''}} is a [[unitary operator]] of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that maps the function ƒ to its frequential version ƒ̂ (all expressions are taken in the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sense, rather than pointwise):

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\ e^{- 2\pi i x \xi}\,\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;

and ƒ is determined by ƒ̂ via the inverse transform &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi)\ e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,\mathrm{d}\xi, &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Let us study its [[iterated function|''n''-th iterated]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; defined by 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{n}[f] = \mathcal{F}[\mathcal{F}^{n-1}[f]]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-n} = (\mathcal{F}^{-1})^n&lt;/math&gt; when ''n'' is a non-negative integer, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{0}[f] = f&lt;/math&gt;. Their sequence is finite since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-periodic [[automorphism]]: for every function ƒ, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^4 [f] = f&lt;/math&gt;.

More precisely, let us introduce the '''parity operator''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; that inverts &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}[f]\colon x \mapsto f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following properties hold:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^0 = \mathrm{Id}, \qquad \mathcal{F}^1 = \mathcal{F}, \qquad \mathcal{F}^2 = \mathcal{P}, \qquad \mathcal{F}^4 = \mathrm{Id}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^3 = \mathcal{F}^{-1} = \mathcal{P} \circ \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F} \circ \mathcal{P}.&lt;/math&gt;

The FrFT provides a family of linear transforms that further extends this definition to handle non-integer powers {{math|''n''  {{=}} 2''α''/''π''}}  of the FT.

==Definition==

Note: some authors write the transform in terms of the "order {{mvar|a}}" instead of the "angle {{mvar|α}}", in which case the {{mvar|α}} is usually {{mvar|a}} times {{math|''π''/2}}. Although these two forms are equivalent, one must be careful about which definition the author uses.

For any [[real number|real]] {{mvar|α}}, the {{mvar|α}}-angle fractional Fourier transform of a function ƒ is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha (u)&lt;/math&gt; and defined by
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation =  
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha[f](u) = 
\sqrt{1-i\cot(\alpha)} e^{i \pi \cot(\alpha) u^2} 
\int_{-\infty}^\infty 
e^{-i2\pi \left(\csc(\alpha) u x - \frac{\cot(\alpha)}{2} x^2\right)}
f(x)\, \mathrm{d}x
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}

Formally, this formula is only valid when the input function is in a sufficiently nice space (such as [[Lp space|L1]] or Schwartz space), and is defined via a density argument, in a way similar to that of the ordinary [[Fourier transform]] (see article), in the general case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.univie.ac.at/nuhag-php/bibtex/open_files/13586_Missbauer_Diplom_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{mvar|α}} is an integer multiple of π, then the [[cotangent]] and [[cosecant]] functions above diverge.  However, this can be handled by taking the [[limit of a function|limit]], and leads to a [[Dirac delta function]] in the integrand.  More directly, since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^2(f)=f(-t)~, ~~\mathcal{F}_{\alpha} ~ (f) &lt;/math&gt; 
must be simply {{math|''f''(''t'')}} or {{math|''f''(−''t'')}} for  {{mvar|α}}  an [[Even and odd numbers|even or odd]] multiple of {{mvar|π}} respectively.

For  {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''π''/2}}, this becomes precisely the definition of the continuous Fourier transform, and for  {{math|''α'' {{=}} −''π''/2}} it is the definition of the inverse continuous Fourier transform.

The FrFT argument {{mvar|u}}  is neither a spatial one {{mvar|x}}  nor a frequency {{mvar|ξ}}. We will see why it can be interpreted as linear combination of both coordinates {{math|(''x'',''ξ'')}}. When we want to distinguish the {{mvar|α}}-angular fractional domain, we will let &lt;math&gt;x_a&lt;/math&gt; denote the argument of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remark:''' with the angular frequency ω convention instead of the frequency one, the FrFT formula is the [[Mehler kernel]],
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha(f)(\omega) = 
\sqrt{\frac{1-i\cot(\alpha)}{2\pi}} 
e^{i \cot(\alpha) \omega^2/2} 
\int_{-\infty}^\infty 
e^{-i\csc(\alpha) \omega t + i \cot(\alpha) t^2/2}
f(t)\, dt~. 
&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===
The {{math|''α''}}-th order fractional Fourier transform operator, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, has the properties:

* '''Additivity.''' For any real angles {{math|''α, β''}},
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\alpha+\beta} = \mathcal{F}_\alpha \circ \mathcal{F}_\beta = \mathcal{F}_\beta \circ \mathcal{F}_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Linearity.'''
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha \left [\sum\nolimits_k b_kf_k(u)  \right ]=\sum\nolimits_k b_k\mathcal{F}_\alpha \left [f_k(u) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Integer Orders.''' If {{math|''α''}} is an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;\pi / 2&lt;/math&gt;, then:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha = \mathcal{F}_{\frac{k\pi}{2}} = \mathcal{F}^k = (\mathcal{F})^k&lt;/math&gt;
:Moreover, it has following relation
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}^2 &amp;= \mathcal{P} &amp;&amp; \mathcal{P}[f(u)]=f(-u)\\
\mathcal{F}^3 &amp;= \mathcal{F}^{-1} = (\mathcal{F})^{-1} \\ 
\mathcal{F}^4 &amp;= \mathcal{F}^0 = \mathcal{I} \\
\mathcal{F}^i &amp;= \mathcal{F}^j &amp;&amp; i \equiv j \mod 4
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Inverse.'''
::&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{F}_\alpha)^{-1}=\mathcal{F}_{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Commutativity.'''
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_1}\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_2}=\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_2}\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Associativity'''
::&lt;math&gt; \left (\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_1}\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_2} \right )\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_3} = \mathcal{F}_{\alpha_1} \left (\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_2}\mathcal{F}_{\alpha_3} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Unitarity'''
::&lt;math&gt;\int f^*(u)g(u)du=\int f_\alpha^*(u)g_\alpha(u)du&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Time Reversal.'''
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{P}\mathcal{F}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha[f(-u)]=f_\alpha(-u)&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Transform of a shifted function'''
:Define the shift and the phase shift operators as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SH}(u_0)[f(u)]=f(u+u_0)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{PH}(v_0)[f(u)]=e^{j2\pi v_0u}f(u)&lt;/math&gt;
:Then
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_\alpha \mathcal{SH}(u_0) &amp;= e^{j\pi u_0^2 \sin\alpha \cos\alpha} \mathcal{PH}(u_0\sin\alpha) \mathcal{SH}(u_0\cos\alpha) F_\alpha \\
\mathcal{F}_\alpha [f(u+u_0)] &amp;=e^{j\pi u_0^2 \sin\alpha \cos\alpha}  e^{j2\pi uu_0 \sin\alpha} f_\alpha (u+u_0 \cos\alpha)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
{{see also|Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction: The clock and shift matrices}}

* '''Transform of a scaled function'''
:Define the scaling and chirp multiplication operators as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;M(M)[f(u)]=|M|^{-\frac{1}{2}} f \left (\tfrac{u}{M} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Q(q)[f(u)]=e^{-j\pi qu^2 } f(u)&lt;/math&gt;
:Then, 
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_\alpha  M(M) &amp;= Q \left (-\cot \left (\frac{1-\cos^2 \alpha'}{\cos^2 \alpha}\alpha \right ) \right)\times M \left (\frac{\sin \alpha}{M\sin \alpha'} \right )\mathcal{F}_{\alpha'} \\ [6pt]
\mathcal{F}_\alpha \left [|M|^{-\frac{1}{2}} f \left (\tfrac{u}{M} \right)  \right ] &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1-j \cot\alpha}{1-jM^2  \cot\alpha}} e^{j\pi u^2\cot \left (\frac{1-\cos^2 \alpha'}{\cos^2 \alpha}\alpha \right )} \times f_a \left (\frac{Mu \sin\alpha'}{\sin\alpha} \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Notice that the fractional Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;f(u/M)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed as a scaled version of &lt;math&gt;f_\alpha (u)&lt;/math&gt;. Rather, the fractional Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;f(u/M)&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a scaled and chirp modulated version of &lt;math&gt;f_{\alpha'}(u)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha\neq\alpha'&lt;/math&gt; is a different order.

===Fractional kernel===
The FrFT is an [[integral transform]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_\alpha f (u) = \int K_\alpha (u, x) f(x)\, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
where the α-angle kernel is
:&lt;math&gt;K_\alpha (u, x) = \begin{cases}\sqrt{1-i\cot(\alpha)} \exp \left(i \pi (\cot(\alpha)(x^2+ u^2) -2 \csc(\alpha) u x) \right) &amp; \mbox{if } \alpha \mbox{ is not a multiple of }\pi, \\
\delta (u - x) &amp; \mbox{if } \alpha \mbox{ is a multiple of } 2\pi, \\
\delta (u + x) &amp; \mbox{if } \alpha+\pi \mbox{ is a multiple of } 2\pi, \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Here again the special cases are consistent with the limit behavior when  {{mvar|α}}  approaches a multiple of {{mvar|π}}.

The FrFT has the same properties as its kernels :
* symmetry: &lt;math&gt;K_\alpha~(u, u')=K_\alpha ~(u', u)&lt;/math&gt;
* inverse: &lt;math&gt;K_\alpha^{-1} (u, u') = K_\alpha^* (u, u') = K_{-\alpha} (u', u) &lt;/math&gt;
* additivity: &lt;math&gt;K_{\alpha+\beta} (u,u') = \int K_\alpha (u, u'') K_\beta (u'', u')\,\mathrm{d}u''.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Related transforms ===
There also exist related fractional generalizations of similar transforms such as the [[discrete Fourier transform]].
The '''discrete fractional Fourier transform''' is defined by [[Zeev zalevsky|Zeev Zalevsky]] in
{{Harv|Candan|Kutay|Ozaktas|2000}} and
{{Harv|Ozaktas|Zalevsky|Kutay|2001|loc=Chapter 6}}. A quantum algorithm to implement a version of the discrete fractional Fourier transform 
in subpolynomial time is described by Somma.&lt;ref&gt;Rolando D. Somma, "Quantum simulations of one dimensional quantum systems," 
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 16, No. 13&amp;14, pp. 1125–1168, 2016. URL: http://www.rintonpress.com/xxqic16/qic-16-1314/1125-1168.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractional wavelet transform (FRWT):&lt;ref&gt;J. Shi, N.-T. Zhang, and X.-P. Liu, "A novel fractional wavelet transform and its applications," Sci. China Inf. Sci. vol. 55, no. 6, pp. 1270-1279, June 2012. URL: http://www.springerlink.com/content/q01np2848m388647/&lt;/ref&gt; A generalization of the classical wavelet transform (WT) in the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domains. The FRWT is proposed in order to rectify the limitations of the WT and the FRFT. This transform not only inherits the advantages of multiresolution analysis of the WT, but also has the capability of signal representations in the fractional domain which is similar to the FRFT. Compared with the existing FRWT, the FRWT (defined by Shi, Zhang, and Liu 2012) can offer signal representations in the time-fractional-frequency plane.

See also the [[chirplet transform]] for a related generalization of the [[Fourier transform]].

===Generalizations===
The Fourier transform is essentially [[bosonic]]; it works because it is consistent with the superposition principle and related interference patterns.  There is also a [[fermionic]] Fourier transform.&lt;ref name = "xyz"&gt;Hendrik De Bie, ''Fourier transform and related integral transforms in superspace (2008)'', 
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0805.1918&lt;/ref&gt;  These have been generalized into a [[supersymmetric]] FRFT, and a supersymmetric [[Radon transform]].&lt;ref name = "xyz" /&gt;  There is also a fractional Radon transform, a [[time-frequency analysis|symplectic]] FRFT, and a symplectic [[wavelet transform]].&lt;ref&gt;Hong-yi Fan and Li-yun Hu, ''Optical transformation from chirplet to fractional Fourier transformation kernel (2009)'', http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0902.1800 
&lt;/ref&gt;  Because [[quantum circuit]]s are based on [[unitary operation]]s, they are useful for computing [[integral transform]]s as the latter are unitary operators on a [[function space]].  A quantum circuit has been designed which implements the FRFT.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Klappenecker and Martin Roetteler, ''Engineering Functional Quantum Algorithms (2002)'', http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208130&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
{{further|Linear canonical transformation}}
[[File:Rect turning into a sinc.webm|thumb|A rect function turns into a sinc function as the order of the fractional Fourier transform becomes 1]]
The usual interpretation of the Fourier transform is as a transformation of a time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the interpretation of the inverse Fourier transform is as a transformation of a frequency domain signal into a time domain signal. Apparently, fractional Fourier transforms can transform a signal (either in the time domain or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the [[time-frequency domain]]. This perspective is generalized by the [[linear canonical transformation]], which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time-frequency domain other than rotation.

Take the below figure as an example. If the signal in the time domain is rectangular (as below), it will become a [[sinc function]] in the frequency domain. But if we apply the fractional Fourier transform to the rectangular signal, the transformation output will be in the domain between time and frequency.

[[Image:FracFT Rec by stevencys.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Fractional Fourier transform]]

Actually, fractional Fourier transform is a rotation operation on the time frequency distribution. From the definition above, for ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, there will be no change after applying fractional Fourier transform, and for ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''π''/2, fractional Fourier transform becomes a Fourier transform, which rotates the time frequency distribution with&amp;nbsp;''π''/2. For other value of&amp;nbsp;''α'', fractional Fourier transform rotates the time frequency distribution according to α. The following figure shows the results of the fractional Fourier transform with different values of&amp;nbsp;''α''.

[[Image:FracFT Rotate by stevencys.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Time/frequency distribution of fractional Fourier transform]]

== Application ==

Fractional Fourier transform can be used in time frequency analysis and [[Digital signal processing|DSP]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Sejdić, I. Djurović, LJ. Stanković, “Fractional Fourier transform as a signal processing tool: An overview of recent developments”, Signal Processing, vol. 91, no. 6, pp. 1351–1369, June 2011. doi:10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.10.008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but with the help of the fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we can get the desired signal.

Fractional Fourier transforms are also used to design optical systems and optimize holographic storage efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;N. C. Pégard and J. W. Fleischer, "Optimizing holographic data storage using a fractional Fourier transform", Opt. Lett. 36, 2551–2553 (2011) [http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-36-13-2551].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FracFT App by stevencys.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Fractional Fourier transform in DSP]]
Thus, using just truncation in the time domain, or equivalently [[low-pass filter]]s in the frequency domain, one can cut out any [[convex set]] in time–frequency space; just using time domain or frequency domain methods without fractional Fourier transforms only allow cutting out rectangles parallel to the axes.

In [[mathematics]], and in particular, in the mathematical background of [[string theory]], the '''Goddard–Thorn theorem''' (also called the '''no-ghost theorem''') is a theorem describing properties of a functor that quantizes [[bosonic strings]]. It is named after [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]] and [[Charles Thorn]].

The name "no-ghost theorem" stems from the fact that in the original statement of the theorem, the natural [[inner product]] induced on the output vector space is positive definite. Thus, there were no so-called [[Ghosts (physics)|ghosts]] ([[Pauli–Villars ghost]]s), or vectors of negative norm. The name "no-ghost theorem" is also a word play on the [[no-go theorem]] of quantum mechanics.

== Formalism ==
There are two naturally isomorphic functors that are typically used to quantize bosonic strings.  In both cases, one starts with positive-energy representations of the [[Virasoro algebra]] of central charge 26, equipped with Virasoro-invariant bilinear forms, and ends up with vector spaces equipped with bilinear forms.  Here, "Virasoro-invariant" means ''L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is adjoint to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;−''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all integers ''n''.

The first functor historically is "old canonical quantization", and it is given by taking the quotient of the weight 1 primary subspace by the radical of the bilinear form.  Here, "primary subspace" is the set of vectors annihilated by ''L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all strictly positive ''n'', and "weight 1" means ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; acts by identity.  A second, naturally isomorphic functor, is given by degree 1 BRST cohomology.  Older treatments of BRST cohomology often have a shift in the degree due to a change in choice of BRST charge, so one may see degree −1/2 cohomology in papers and texts from before 1995.  A proof that the functors are naturally isomorphic can be found in Section 4.4 of Polchinski's ''String Theory'' text.

The Goddard–Thorn theorem amounts to the assertion that this quantization functor more or less cancels the addition of two free bosons, as conjectured by Lovelace in 1971.  Lovelace's precise claim was that at critical dimension 26, Virasoro-type Ward identities cancel two full sets of oscillators.  Mathematically, this is the following claim:

Let ''V'' be a unitarizable Virasoro representation of central charge 24 with Virasoro-invariant bilinear form, and let π&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; be the irreducible module of the '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt; Heisenberg Lie algebra attached to a nonzero vector λ in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then the image of ''V'' ⊗ π&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; under quantization is canonically isomorphic to the subspace of V on which ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; acts by 1-(λ,λ).

The no-ghost property follows immediately, since the positive-definite Hermitian structure of ''V'' is transferred to the image under quantization.

==Applications==
The bosonic string quantization functors described here can be applied to any conformal vertex algebra of central charge 26, and the output naturally has a Lie algebra structure.  The Goddard–Thorn theorem can then be applied to concretely describe the Lie algebra in terms of the input vertex algebra.

Perhaps the most spectacular case of this application is Borcherds's proof of the [[Monstrous Moonshine]] conjecture, where the unitarizable Virasoro representation is the [[Monster vertex algebra]] (also called "Moonshine module") constructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman.  By taking a tensor product with the vertex algebra attached to a rank 2 hyperbolic lattice, and applying quantization, one obtains the [[monster Lie algebra]], which is a [[generalized Kac–Moody algebra]] graded by the lattice.  By using the Goddard–Thorn theorem, Borcherds showed that the homogeneous pieces of the Lie algebra are naturally isomorphic to graded pieces of the Moonshine module, as representations of the [[monster simple group]].

Earlier applications include Frenkel's determination of upper bounds on the root multiplicities of the Kac-Moody Lie algebra whose Dynkin diagram is the [[Leech lattice]], and Borcherds's construction of a generalized Kac-Moody Lie algebra that contains Frenkel's Lie algebra and saturates Frenkel's 1/∆ bound.

In [[control theory]] and in particular when studying the properties of a [[linear time-invariant]] system in [[state space]] form, the '''Hautus lemma''', named after [http://www.win.tue.nl/~wscomalo/ Malo Hautus], can prove to be a powerful tool. This result appeared first in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belevitch|first=V.|title=Classical Control Theory|year=1968|publisher=Holden–Day|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popov|first=V. M.|title=Hyperstability of Control Systems|year=1973|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it can be found in most textbooks on control theory.

==The main result==
There exist multiple forms of the lemma.
===Hautus Lemma for controllability===
The Hautus lemma for controllability says that given a square matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\in M_n(\Re)&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\in M_{n\times m}(\Re)&lt;/math&gt; the following are equivalent:
# The pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; is [[controllable]]
# For all &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}[\lambda \mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}]=n&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; that are eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}[\lambda \mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}]=n&lt;/math&gt;

===Hautus Lemma for stabilizability===
The Hautus lemma for stabilizability says that given a square matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\in M_n(\Re)&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\in M_{n\times m}(\Re)&lt;/math&gt; the following are equivalent:
# The pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; is [[stabilizable]]
# For all &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; that are eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and for which &lt;math&gt;\Re(\lambda)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}[\lambda \mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}]=n&lt;/math&gt;
===Hautus Lemma for observability===

'''Camillo Herbert Grötzsch''' (21 May 1902 – 15 May 1993) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]]. He was born in [[Döbeln]] and died in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. Grötzsch worked in [[graph theory]]. He was the discoverer and eponym of the [[Grötzsch graph]], a [[triangle-free graph]] that requires four colors in any [[graph coloring]], and [[Grötzsch's theorem]], the result that every triangle-free [[planar graph]] requires at most three colors. He also introduced the concept of a [[quasiconformal mapping]]. He was one of [[Paul Koebe]]'s students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1451">In [[signal processing]], the '''high frequency content measure''' is a simple measure, taken across a signal [[spectrum]] (usually a [[STFT]] spectrum), that can be used to characterize the amount of high-frequency content in the signal.  The magnitudes of the spectral bins are added together, but multiplying each magnitude by the bin "position" (proportional to the frequency).  Thus if ''X''(''k'') is a discrete spectrum with ''N'' unique points, its high frequency content measure is:

: &lt;math&gt; 
\mathrm{HFC} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} i|X(i)|
&lt;/math&gt; 

In contrast to perceptual measures, this is not based on any evidence about its relevance to [[human hearing]]. Despite that, it can be useful for some applications, such as [[onset detection]].

The measure has close similarities to the [[spectral centroid]] measure, being essentially the same calculation but without normalization according to overall magnitude.

{{Expert needed|Mathematics|date=June 2009}}

In mathematics, especially ([[Higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]], '''higher-dimensional algebra''' is the study of [[Categorification|categorified]] structures. It has applications in nonabelian [[algebraic topology]], and generalizes [[abstract algebra]].

==Higher-dimensional categories==

{{main article|Category theory#Higher-dimensional categories}}

A first step towards defining [[higher dimensional]] algebras is the concept of [[2-category]] of [[higher category theory]], followed by the more 'geometric' concept of   [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fiore/1/fiorefolding.pdf double category].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |first = R. |last = Brown |first2 = J.-L. |last2 = Loday
 |title = Homotopical excision, and Hurewicz theorems, for ''n''-cubes of spaces
 |journal = [[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]]
 |volume = 54 |issue = 1 |pages = 176–192
 |year = 1987
 |doi = 10.1112/plms/s3-54.1.176
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |first = M.A. |last = Batanin
 |title = Monoidal Globular Categories As a Natural Environment for the Theory of Weak ''n''-Categories
 |journal = [[Advances in Mathematics]]
 |volume = 136 |issue = 1 |pages = 39–103

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A higher level concept is thus defined as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of categories, or super-category, which generalises to higher dimensions the notion of [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &amp;ndash; regarded as any structure which is an interpretation of [[Lawvere]]'s axioms of the ''[[elementary theory of abstract categories]]'' (ETAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawvere | first1 = F. W. | year = 1964 | title = An Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets | url = http://myyn.org/m/article/william-francis-lawvere/ | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 52| pages = 1506–1511 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.52.6.1506 | pmc = 300477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawvere, F. W.: 1966, The Category of Categories as a Foundation for Mathematics., in ''Proc. Conf. Categorical Algebra &amp;ndash; La Jolla''., Eilenberg, S. et al., eds. Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg and New York., pp. 1&amp;ndash;20. http://myyn.org/m/article/william-francis-lawvere/&lt;/ref&gt; Ll.

,&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=420&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawvere | first1 = F. W. | year = 1969b | title = Adjointness in Foundations | url = http://myyn.org/m/article/william-francis-lawvere/ | journal = Dialectica | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 281–295 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1969.tb01194.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a supercategory and also a [[functor category|super-category]], can be regarded as natural extensions of the concepts of [[multicategory|meta-category]],&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/AxiomsOfMetacategoriesAndSupercategories.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[multicategory]], and [[Turán graph|multi-graph, ''k''-partite graph]], or [[colored graph]] (see a [[color figure]], and also its definition in [[graph theory]]).

Supercategories were first introduced in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Supercategories3.html  Supercategory theory @ PlanetMath]&lt;/ref&gt; and were subsequently developed for applications in [[theoretical physics]] (especially [[quantum field theory]] and [[topological quantum field theory]]) and [[mathematical biology]] or [[mathematical biology|mathematical biophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/MathematicalBiologyAndTheoreticalBiophysics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pathways in HDA involve: [[bicategories]], homomorphisms of bicategories, [[variable categories]] (''aka'', indexed, or [[parametrized categories]]), [[topoi]], effective descent, and enriched and [[internal categories]].

==Double groupoids==
{{Main|double groupoid}}
In '''higher-dimensional algebra''' ('''HDA'''), a double groupoid is a generalisation of a one-dimensional [[groupoid]] to two dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |first=R. |last=Brown |first2=C.B. |last2=Spencer
 |title=Double groupoids and crossed modules
 |journal=Cahiers Top. Géom. Diff.
 |volume=17 |pages=343–362
 |year=1976
 |doi=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter groupoid can be considered as a special case of a category with all invertible arrows, or [[morphism]]s.

[[Double groupoid]]s are often used to capture information about [[geometrical]] objects such as [[n-dimensional space|higher-dimensional manifolds]] (or [[List of manifolds|''n''-dimensional manifolds]]).&lt;ref name="bangor"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, an [[List of manifolds|''n''-dimensional manifold]] is a space that locally looks like an [[n-dimensional Euclidean space|''n''-dimensional Euclidean space]], but whose global structure may be [[non-Euclidean]].

Double groupoids were first introduced by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] in 1976, in ref.&lt;ref name="bangor" /&gt; and were further developed towards applications in [[Non-abelian group|nonabelian]] [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/NAAT.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html ''Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology'' book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604050453/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |date=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=249 Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Higher homotopy groupoids of filtered spaces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related, 'dual' concept is that of a double [[Lie algebroid|algebroid]], and the more general concept of [[R-algebroid]].

==Nonabelian algebraic topology==
Many of the higher dimensional algebraic structures are [[noncommutative]] and, therefore, their study is a very significant part of nonabelian [[category theory]], and also of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT)&lt;ref name="bangor_a"&gt;*{{cite book |first=R. |last=Brown |first2=P.J. |last2=Higgins |first3=R. |last3=Sivera |title=Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology |url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |publisher= |volume=1 |year=2008 |isbn= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604050453/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }} ([http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-t/partI010604.pdf Downloadable PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ems-ph.org/pdf/catalog.pdf Ronald Brown, Philip Higgins, Rafael Sivera, ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids'', in '''Tracts in Mathematics''' vol. '''15''' (2010), European Mathematical Society, 670 pages, {{ISBN|978-3-03719-083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which generalises to higher dimensions ideas coming from the [[fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407275 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology'' by Ronald Brown. 15 Jul 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Such algebraic structures in dimensions greater than 1 develop the nonabelian character of the fundamental group, and they are in a precise sense ''‘more nonabelian than the groups' ''.&lt;ref name="bangor_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/06/nonabelian_algebraic_topology.html ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology'' posted by John Baez&lt;/ref&gt; These noncommutative, or more specifically, [[Non-abelian group|nonabelian]] structures reflect more accurately the geometrical complications of higher dimensions than the known homology and [[homotopy groups]] commonly encountered in classical [[algebraic topology]].
An important part of nonabelian algebraic topology is concerned with the properties and applications of [[homotopy group]]oids and [[filtered space]]s. Noncommutative [[double groupoid]]s and double [[Lie algebroid|algebroid]]s are only the first examples of such higher dimensional structures that are nonabelian. The new methods of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT) ''``can be applied to determine [[homotopy invariant]]s of spaces, and [[homotopy classification]] of maps, in cases which include some classical results, and allow results not available by classical methods"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=374 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered Spaces, Crossed Complexes and Cubical Homotopy groupoids'', by Ronald Brown, Bangor University, UK, Philip J. Higgins, Durham University, UK Rafael Sivera, University of Valencia, Spain&lt;/ref&gt; Cubical omega-groupoids, higher [[homotopy group]]oids, [[crossed module]]s, [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics|crossed complexes]] and [[Galois group]]oids are key concepts in developing applications related to homotopy of filtered spaces, higher dimensional space structures, the construction of the [[fundamental group]]oid of a topos E in the general theory of topoi, and also in their physical applications in nonabelian quantum theories, and recent developments in [[quantum gravity]], as well as categorical and [[topological dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/92r13230n3381746/ | doi=10.1007/s10516-007-9012-1 | volume=17 | title=A Non-Abelian, Categorical Ontology of Spacetimes and Quantum Gravity | year=2007 | journal=Axiomathes | pages=353–408 | last1 = Baianu | first1 = I. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of such applications include the generalisations of [[noncommutative geometry]] formalizations of the [[noncommutative standard model]]s ''via'' fundamental double groupoids and [[spacetime]] structures even more general than [[topos|topoi]] or the lower-dimensional [[noncommutative spacetime]]s encountered in several [[topological quantum field theories]] and noncommutative geometry theories of quantum gravity.

A fundamental result in NAAT is the generalised, higher homotopy [[van Kampen theorem]] proven by R. Brown which states that ``''the homotopy type of a topological space can be computed by a suitable [[colimit]] or [[homotopy colimit]] over homotopy types of its pieces''''. A related example is that of van Kampen theorems for categories of [[covering morphism]]s in [[lextensive categories]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brown and George Janelidze, van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories, ''J. Pure Appl. Algebra''. '''119''':255–263, (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of generalisations of the van Kampen theorem include statements for [[2-category|2-categories]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050720094804/http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz [[Marta Bunge]] and Stephen Lack. Van Kampen theorems for 2-categories and toposes&lt;/ref&gt; and a topos of topoi [http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz].
Important results in HDA are also the extensions of the [[Galois theory]] in categories and [[variable categories]], or indexed/`parametrized' categories.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/gug14u1141214743/ | doi=10.1007/BF00872989 | volume=1 | title=Galois theory in variable categories | year=1993 | journal=Applied Categorical Structures | pages=103–110 | last1 = Janelidze | first1 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt; The [[Joyal–Tierney representation theorem]] for topoi is also a generalisation of the Galois theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Joyal | first1 = Andres | last2 = Tierney | first2 = Myles | year = 1984| title = An extension of the Galois theory of Grothendieck | url = | isbn=0-8218-2312-4 |publisher=American Mathematical Society | volume = 309 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, indexing by bicategories in the sense of Benabou one also includes here the [[Joyal–Tierney theory]].&lt;ref&gt;'''MSC'''(1991): 18D30,11R32,18D35,18D05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Theoretical physics===
In [[quantum field theory]], there exist [[quantum category|quantum categories]].&lt;ref name="planetmath"&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/QuantumCategory.html Quantum Categories of Quantum Groupoids&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AssociativityIsomorphism.html Rigid Monoidal Categories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quantum double groupoid]]s.&lt;ref name="theoreticalatlas.wordpress"&gt;http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/ March 18, 2009. A Note on Quantum Groupoids, posted by Jeffrey Morton under C*-algebras, deformation theory, groupoids, noncommutative geometry, quantization&lt;/ref&gt;/ One can consider [[quantum double groupoids]] to be [[fundamental group]]oids defined via a [[2-functor]], which allows one to think about the physically interesting case of [[quantum fundamental groupoid]]s (QFGs) in terms of the [[bicategory]] '''Span(Groupoids)''', and then constructing 2-[[Hilbert space]]s and 2-[[linear map]]s for manifolds and [[cobordism]]s. At the next step, one obtains [[cobordism]]s with corners via [[natural transformation]]s of such 2-functors. A claim was then made that, with the [[gauge group]] [[SU(2)]], "''the extended [[TQFT]], or ETQFT,  gives a theory equivalent to the [[Ponzano–Regge model]] of [[quantum gravity]]''";&lt;ref name="theoreticalatlas.wordpress" /&gt; similarly, the [[Turaev–Viro model]] would be then obtained with [[representation (mathematics)|representation]]s of SU&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(2). Therefore, one can describe the [[state space]] of a gauge theory – or many kinds of [[quantum field theories]] (QFTs) and local quantum physics, in terms of the [[transformation groupoid]]s given by symmetries, as for example in the case of a gauge theory, by the [[gauge transformation]]s acting on states that are, in this case, connections. In the case of symmetries related to [[quantum group]]s, one would obtain structures that are representation categories of [[quantum groupoid]]s,&lt;ref name="planetmath" /&gt; instead of the 2-[[vector space]]s that are representation categories of groupoids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2137">In [[homological algebra]], the '''horseshoe lemma''', also called the '''simultaneous resolution theorem''', is a statement relating [[projective resolution|resolution]]s of two objects &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt; to resolutions of
extensions of &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt;.  It says that if an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt;, then a resolution of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be built up [[mathematical induction|inductively]] with the ''n''th item in the resolution equal to the [[coproduct]] of the ''n''th items in the resolutions of &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt;.  The name of the lemma comes from the shape of the diagram illustrating the lemma's hypothesis.

==Formal statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[abelian category]] with [[projective object|enough projectives]].  If

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Horseshoe lemma.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

is a [[commutative diagram|diagram]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that the column is [[exact sequence|exact]] and the
rows are projective resolutions of &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt; respectively, then
it can be completed to a commutative diagram

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Horseshoe lemma conclusion.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

where all columns are exact, the middle row is a projective resolution
of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P_n=P'_n\oplus P''_n&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an
abelian category with [[injective object|enough injectives]], the [[opposite category|dual]] statement also holds.

The lemma can be proved inductively.  At each stage of the induction, the properties of projective objects are used to define maps in a projective resolution of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the [[snake lemma]] is invoked to show that the simultaneous resolution constructed so far has exact rows.

In [[graph theory]], a connected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is '''''k''-edge-connected''' if it remains [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] whenever fewer than ''k'' edges are removed.

The '''edge-connectivity''' of a graph is the largest ''k'' for which the graph is ''k''-edge-connected.

Edge connectivity and the [[graph enumeration|enumeration]] of ''k''-edge-connected graphs was studied by [[Camille Jordan]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
[[File:2-edge connected graph.svg|thumb|A 2-edge-connected graph]]
Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary graph.
If [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] &lt;math&gt;G' = (V, E \setminus X)&lt;/math&gt; is connected for all &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq E&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;|X| &lt; k&lt;/math&gt;, then ''G'' is ''k''-edge-connected.
The edge connectivity of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum value ''k'' such that ''G'' is ''k''-edge-connected. The smallest set ''X'' whose removal disconnects ''G'' is a [[minimum cut]] in ''G''.

The edge connectivity version of [[Menger's theorem]] provides an alternative and equivalent characterization, in terms of edge-disjoint paths in the graph. If and only if every two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of ''G'' form the endpoints of ''k'' paths, no two of which share an edge with each other, then ''G'' is ''k''-edge-connected. In one direction this is easy: if a system of paths like this exists, then every set ''X'' of fewer than ''k'' edges is disjoint from at least one of the paths, and the pair of vertices remains connected to each other even after ''X'' is deleted. In the other direction, the existence of a system of paths for each pair of vertices in a graph that cannot be disconnected by the removal of few edges can be proven using the [[max-flow min-cut theorem]] from the theory of [[Flow network|network flows]].

==Related concepts==
Minimum [[degree (graph theory)|vertex degree]] gives a trivial upper bound on edge-connectivity.  That is, if a graph &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; is ''k''-edge-connected then it is necessary that ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;δ(''G''), where δ(''G'') is the minimum degree of any vertex ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''. Obviously, deleting all edges incident to a vertex, ''v'',  would then disconnect ''v'' from the graph.

Edge connectivity is the dual concept to [[girth (graph theory)|girth]], the length of the shortest cycle in a graph, in the sense that the girth of a [[planar graph]] is the edge connectivity of its [[dual graph]], and vice versa. These concepts are unified in [[matroid theory]] by the [[matroid girth|girth of a matroid]], the size of the smallest dependent set in the matroid. For a [[graphic matroid]], the matroid girth equals the girth of the underlying graph, while for a co-graphic matroid it equals the edge connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The 2-edge-connected graphs can also be characterized by the absence of [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridges]], by the existence of an [[ear decomposition]], or by [[Robbins' theorem]] according to which these are exactly the graphs that have a [[strong orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Computational aspects ==
There is a polynomial-time algorithm to determine the largest ''k'' for which a graph ''G'' is ''k''-edge-connected. A simple algorithm would, for every pair ''(u,v)'', determine the [[Maximum flow problem|maximum flow]] from ''u'' to ''v'' with the capacity of all edges in ''G'' set to 1 for both directions. A graph is ''k''-edge-connected if and only if the maximum flow from ''u'' to ''v'' is at least ''k'' for any pair ''(u,v)'', so ''k'' is the least ''u-v''-flow among all ''(u,v)''.

If ''n'' is the number of vertices in the graph, this simple algorithm would perform &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; iterations of the Maximum flow problem, which can be solved in &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; time. Hence the complexity of the simple algorithm described above is &lt;math&gt;O(n^5)&lt;/math&gt; in total.

An improved algorithm will solve the maximum flow problem for every pair ''(u,v)'' where ''u'' is arbitrarily fixed while ''v'' varies
over all vertices. This reduces the complexity to &lt;math&gt;O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt; and is sound since, if a [[Cut_(graph_theory)|cut]] of capacity less than ''k'' exists,
it is bound to separate ''u'' from some other vertex. It can be further improved by an algorithm of Gabow that runs in worst case &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; time. &lt;ref&gt; Harold N. Gabow. A matroid approach to finding edge connectivity and packing arborescences. ''J. Comput. Syst. Sci.'', 50(2):259–273, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karger–Stein variant of [[Karger's algorithm]] provides a faster [[randomized algorithm]] for determining the connectivity, with expected runtime &lt;math&gt;O(n^2\log^3 n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Karger | first1 = David R. | authorlink1 = David Karger| last2 = Stein | first2 = Clifford| authorlink2 = Clifford Stein | doi = 10.1145/234533.234534 | title = A new approach to the minimum cut problem | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 601 | year = 1996 | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~cs2035/courses/ieor6614.S09/Contraction.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related problem: finding the minimum ''k''-edge-connected spanning subgraph of ''G'' (that is: select as few as possible edges in ''G'' that your selection is ''k''-edge-connected) is NP-hard for &lt;math&gt;k\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;M.R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15574">[[Probability theory]] routinely uses results from other fields of mathematics (mostly, analysis). The opposite cases, collected below, are relatively rare; however, probability theory is used systematically in [[combinatorics]] via the [[probabilistic method]]. They are particularly used for [[non-constructive]] proofs.

==Analysis==
* [[Normal number]]s exist. Moreover, [[Computable number|computable]] normal numbers [[Normal number#Properties and examples|exist]]. These non-probabilistic existence theorems follow from probabilistic results: (a) a number chosen at random (uniformly on (0,1)) is normal almost surely (which follows easily from the [[strong law of large numbers]]); (b) some probabilistic inequalities behind the strong law. The existence of a normal number follows from (a) immediately. The proof of the existence of computable normal numbers, based on (b), involves additional arguments. All known proofs use probabilistic arguments.
* [[Dvoretzky's theorem]] which states that high-dimensional convex bodies have ball-like slices is proved probabilistically. No deterministic construction is known, even for many specific bodies.
* The diameter of the [[Banach–Mazur compactum]] was calculated using a probabilistic construction. No deterministic construction is known.
* The original proof that the [[Hausdorff–Young inequality]] cannot be extended to &lt;math&gt;p &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; is probabilistic. The proof of the de Leeuw–Kahane–Katznelson theorem (which is a stronger claim) is partially probabilistic.&lt;ref&gt;Karel de Leeuw, Yitzhak Katznelson and Jean-Pierre Kahane, Sur les coefficients de Fourier des fonctions continues. (French)  C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Sér. A–B 285:16  (1977), A1001–A1003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first construction of a Salem set was probabilistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salem | first1 = Raphaël | year = 1951 | title = On singular monotonic functions whose spectrum has a given Hausdorff dimension | url = | journal = Ark.

* Every continuous function on a compact interval can be uniformly approximated by polynomials, which is the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]]. A [[Bernstein polynomial#Proof|probabilistic proof]] uses the [[weak law of large numbers]]. Non-probabilistic proofs were available earlier.
* Existence of a nowhere differentiable continuous function follows easily from properties of [[Wiener process]]. A [[Weierstrass function|non-probabilistic proof]] was available earlier.
* [[Stirling's formula]] was first discovered by [[Abraham de Moivre]] in his `[[The Doctrine of Chances]]' (with a constant identified later by Stirling) in order to be used in probability theory. Several probabilistic proofs of Stirling's formula (and related results) were found in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Blyth|first1=Colin R.|last2=Pathak|first2=Pramod K.

* The only bounded harmonic functions defined on the whole plane are constant functions by [[Potential theory#Inequalities|Liouville's theorem]].

[[File:Berlin-Uhr-1650-1705.gif|thumb|upright|Clock displaying time from 16:50 to 17:05 (04:50 pm to 05:05 pm) in time lapse.]]
[[File:Berlin Kurfürstendamm 113714a.jpg|thumb|upright|The clock at its original location in May 1979]]
The '''''Mengenlehreuhr''''' ([[German language|German]] for "[[set theory|Set Theory]] Clock") or '''Berlin-Uhr''' ("[[Berlin]] Clock") is the first public clock in the world that tells the time by means of illuminated, coloured fields, for which it entered the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' upon its installation on 17 June 1975. Commissioned by the [[Senate of Berlin]] and designed by [[Dieter Binninger]], the original full-sized Mengenlehreuhr was originally located at the [[Kurfürstendamm]] on the corner with Uhlandstraße. After the Senate decommissioned it in 1995, the clock was relocated to a site in Budapester Straße in front of [[Europa-Center]], where it stands today.

==Telling the time==
The Mengenlehreuhr consists of 24 lights which are divided into one circular blinking yellow light on top to denote the seconds, two top rows denoting the hours and two bottom rows denoting the minutes.

The clock is read from the top row to the bottom. The top row of four red fields denote five full hours each, alongside the second row, also of four red fields, which denote one full hour each, displaying the hour value in [[24-hour clock|24-hour format]]. The third row consists of eleven yellow-and-red fields, which denote five full minutes each (the red ones also denoting 15, 30 and 45 minutes past), and the bottom row has another four yellow fields, which mark one full minute each. The round yellow light on top blinks to denote even- (when lit) or odd-numbered (when unlit) seconds.

Given the photo of the clock at the top of the article as an example, two fields are lit in the first row (five hours multiplied by two, i.e. ten hours), but no fields are lit in the second row; therefore the hour value is 10. Six fields are lit in the third row (five minutes multiplied by six, i.e. thirty minutes), while the bottom row has one field on (plus one minute). Hence, the lights of the clock altogether tell the time as 10:31.

== ''Kryptos'' ==
This clock may be the key to the unsolved section of ''[[Kryptos]]'', a sculpture at the CIA headquarters. After revealing that part of the deciphered text of the sculpture, in positions 64-69, reads "BERLIN", the sculptor, [[Jim Sanborn]], gave ''[[The New York Times]]'' another clue in November 2014, that letters 70–74 in part 4 of the sculpture's code, which read "MZFPK", will become "CLOCK" when decoded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Clue to ‘Kryptos’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/21/science/new-clue-to-kryptos.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a direct reference to the Berlin Clock.  Sanborn further stated that in order to solve section 4, "You'd better delve into that particular clock".&lt;ref name="berlinclock"&gt;{{cite web|agency=New York Times|title=Sculptor Offers Another Clue in 24-Year-Old Mystery at C.I.A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/us/another-kryptos-clue-is-offered-in-a-24-year-old-mystery-at-the-cia.html|last=Schwartz|first=John|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Sanborn also said that, "There are several really interesting clocks in Berlin."

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], a '''mixture''' is a probabilistic combination of two or more probability distributions. The concept arises mostly in two contexts:
:* A mixture defining a new [[probability distribution]] from some existing ones, as in a [[mixture distribution]] or a [[compound distribution]]. Here a major problem often is to derive the properties of the resulting distribution.
:* A mixture used as a [[statistical model]] such as is often used for [[statistical classification]]. The model may represent the population from which observations arise as a [[mixture distribution|mixture]] of several components, and the problem is that of a [[mixture model]], in which the task is to infer from which of a ''discrete'' set of sub-populations each observation originated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6557">In [[philosophical]] [[ontology]], '''ontic''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄν}}, genitive {{lang|grc|ὄντος}}: "of that which is") is physical, real, or factual existence.&lt;br&gt;

==Overview==
"Ontic" describes what is there, as opposed to the nature or properties of that being. To illustrate:

*[[Roger Bacon]], observing that all languages are built upon a common grammar, stated that they share a foundation of ontically anchored linguistic structures.
*[[Martin Heidegger]] posited the concept of ''Sorge'', or caring, as the fundamental concept of the [[intentionality|intentional being]], and presupposed an ontological significance that distinguishes [[ontology|ontological]] being from mere "thinghood" of an ontic being. He uses the [[German language|German]] word "[[Dasein]]" for a being that is capable of ontology, that is, [[recursivity|recursively]] comprehending [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of the very fact of its own Being. For Heidegger, "ontical" signifies concrete, specific realities, whereas "ontological" signifies deeper underlying structures of reality. Ontological objects or subjects have an ontical dimension, but they also include aspects of being like self-awareness, evolutionary vestiges, future potentialities, and networks of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontico-Ontological Distinction|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679516_ss1-33|publisher=Blackwell Reference|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Michael|title=The Ontological and the Ontic|url=http://mikejohnduff.blogspot.com/2007/08/ontological.html|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nicolai Hartmann]] distinguishes among ontology, ontics, and metaphysics: (i) ontology concerns the categorical analysis of entities by means of the knowledge categories able to classify them, (ii) ontics refers to a pre-categorical and pre-objectual connection which is best expressed in the relation to transcendent acts, and (iii) metaphysics is that part of ontics or that part of ontology which concerns the residue of being that cannot be rationalized further according to categories.

== Philosophy of science ==
[[Harald Atmanspacher]] writes extensively about the philosophy of science, especially as it relates to [[Chaos theory]], [[determinism]], [[Causality|causation]], and [[stochastic process|stochasticity]]. He explains that "''ontic'' states describe all properties of a physical system exhaustively. ('Exhaustive' in this context means that an ''ontic'' state is 'precisely the way it is,' without any reference to [[epistemic]] knowledge or ignorance.)"{{ref|autonumber}}

In an earlier paper, Atmanspacher portrays the difference between an [[epistemic]] perspective of a [[system]], and an ontic perspective:

:Philosophical [[discourse]] traditionally distinguishes between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] and generally enforces this distinction by keeping the two subject areas separated. However, the relationship between the two areas is of central importance to [[physics]] and [[philosophy of physics]]. For instance, many [[measurement]]-related problems force us to consider both our [[knowledge]] of the [[Classical mechanics|states]] and [[observables]] of a [[system]] ([[epistemic perspective]]) and its states and observables, independent of such knowledge (ontic perspective). This applies to [[quantum|quantum systems]] in particular.{{ref|autonumber}}

== Critical realism ==
{{noref-section|date=August 2018}}
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] [[Roy Bhaskar]], who is closely associated with the philosophical [[Cultural movement|movement]] of [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] writes:
:"I differentiate the 'ontic' ('ontical' etc.) from the 'ontological'. I employ the former to refer to

:# whatever pertains to being generally, rather than some distinctively philosophical (or scientific) theory of it (ontology), so that in this sense, that of the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', we can speak of the ontic presuppositions of a work of art, a [[joke]] or a strike as much as a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]; and, within this [[rubric]], to
:# the [[intransitive]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of some specific, [[historically determinate]], [[scientific investigation]] (or set of such investigations), the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

:"The ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always specified, and only identified, by its relation, as the intransitive object(s) of some or other (denumerable set of) particular transitive process(es) of enquiry. It is cognitive process-, and level-specific; whereas the ontological (like the ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not."{{ref|autonumber}}

[[Ruth Groff]] offers this expansion of Bhaskar's note above:
:"'ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' is an abstract way of denoting the [[object-domain]] of a particular [[scientific]] area, field, or inquiry. E.g.: [[molecules]] feature in the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry. He's just saying that the scientific undertaking ITSELF is not one of the objects of said, most narrowly construed, immediate object-domain. So [[chemistry]] itself is not part of the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry."

[[File:Perpendicular-coloured.svg|thumb|right|220px|The line segments AB and CD are orthogonal to each other.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''orthogonality''' is the generalization of the notion of [[perpendicularity]] to the [[linear algebra]] of [[bilinear form]]s.  Two elements ''u'' and ''v'' of a [[vector space]] with bilinear form ''B'' are '''orthogonal''' when {{nowrap|1=''B''(''u'', ''v'') = 0}}.  Depending on the bilinear form, the vector space may contain nonzero self-orthogonal vectors. In the case of [[function space]]s, families of [[orthogonal functions]] are used to form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

By extension, orthogonality is also used to refer to the separation of specific features of a system. The term also has specialized meanings in other fields including art and chemistry.

==Etymology==

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ὀρθός}}'' (''orthos''), meaning "upright", and ''{{lang|grc|γωνία}}'' (''gonia''), meaning "angle".
The ancient Greek ὀρθογώνιον ''orthogōnion'' (&lt; ὀρθός ''orthos'' 'upright'&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%29rqos&amp;la=greek#lexicon ''s.v.'' ὀρθός]&lt;/ref&gt; + γωνία ''gōnia'' 'angle'&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=gwni%2Fa&amp;la=greek#lexicon ''s.v.'' γωνία]&lt;/ref&gt;) and classical Latin ''orthogonium'' originally denoted a [[rectangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%29rqog%2Fwnion&amp;la=greek#lexicon ''s.v.'' ὀρθογώνιον]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they came to mean a [[right triangle]].  In the 12th century, the post-classical Latin word ''orthogonalis'' came to mean a right angle or something related to a right angle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third Edition, September 2004, ''s.v.'' orthogonal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
*In [[geometry]], two [[Euclidean vector]]s are '''orthogonal''' if they are [[perpendicular]], ''i.e.'', they form a [[right angle]].
*Two [[vector space|vectors]], ''x'' and ''y'', in an [[inner product space]], ''V'', are ''orthogonal'' if their inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Orthogonal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This relationship is denoted &lt;math&gt;x \perp y&lt;/math&gt;.
*Two [[Linear subspace|vector subspaces]], ''A'' and ''B'', of an inner product space ''V'', are called '''orthogonal subspaces''' if each vector in ''A'' is orthogonal to each vector in ''B''.  The largest subspace of ''V'' that is orthogonal to a given subspace is its [[orthogonal complement]].
*Given a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'' and its dual ''M''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, an element ''m''′ of ''M''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and an element ''m'' of ''M'' are ''orthogonal'' if their [[natural pairing]] is zero, i.e. {{nowrap|1={{langle}}''m''′, ''m''{{rangle}} = 0}}. Two sets {{nowrap|''S''′ ⊆ ''M''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''S'' ⊆ ''M''}} are orthogonal if each element of ''S''′ is orthogonal to each element of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Bourbaki |title=Algebra I |section=ch. II §2.4 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[term rewriting system]] is said to be [[orthogonality (term rewriting)|orthogonal]] if it is left-linear and is non-ambiguous. Orthogonal term rewriting systems are [[confluence (term rewriting)|confluent]].

A set of vectors in an inner product space is called '''pairwise orthogonal''' if each pairing of them is orthogonal. Such a set is called an '''orthogonal set'''.

In certain cases, the word ''normal'' is used to mean ''orthogonal'', particularly in the geometric sense as in the [[surface normal|normal to a surface]]. For example, the ''y''-axis is normal to the curve {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} at the origin.  However, ''normal'' may also refer to the magnitude of a vector. In particular, a set is called [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]] (orthogonal plus normal) if it is an orthogonal set of [[unit vector]]s. As a result, use of the term ''normal'' to mean "orthogonal" is often avoided. The word "normal" also has a different meaning in [[probability]] and [[statistics]].

A vector space with a [[bilinear form]] generalizes the case of an inner product. When the bilinear form applied to two vectors results in zero, then they are '''orthogonal'''. The case of a [[pseudo-Euclidean space|pseudo-Euclidean plane]] uses the term [[hyperbolic orthogonality]]. In the diagram, axes x′ and t′ are hyperbolic-orthogonal for any given ''ϕ''.

===Euclidean vector spaces===
In [[Euclidean space]], two vectors are orthogonal [[if and only if]] their [[dot product]] is zero, i.e. they make an angle of 90° (π/2 [[radian]]s), or one of the vectors is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trefethen, Lloyd N. |author2=Bau, David |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Numerical linear algebra|publisher=SIAM|year=1997|isbn=978-0-89871-361-9|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bj-Lu6zjWbEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence orthogonality of vectors is an extension of the concept of [[perpendicular]] vectors to spaces of any dimension.

The [[orthogonal complement]] of a subspace is the space of all vectors that are orthogonal to every vector in the subspace.  In a three-dimensional Euclidean vector space, the orthogonal complement of a [[line (geometry)|line]] through the origin is the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] through the origin perpendicular to it, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="R. Penrose 2007 417–419"&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books|pages=417–419| year=2007 | isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the geometric concept two planes being perpendicular does not correspond to the orthogonal complement, since in three dimensions a pair of vectors, one from each of a pair of perpendicular planes, might meet at any angle.

In four-dimensional Euclidean space, the orthogonal complement of a line is a [[hyperplane]] and vice versa, and that of a plane is a plane.&lt;ref name="R. Penrose 2007 417–419"/&gt;

===Orthogonal functions===
{{Main|Orthogonal functions}}
By using [[integral calculus]], it is common to use the following to define the [[inner product]] of two [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ''f'' and ''g'' with respect to a nonnegative [[weight function]] ''w'' over an interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f, g\rangle_w = \int_a^b f(x)g(x)w(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

In simple cases, {{nowrap|1=''w''(''x'') = 1}}.

We say that functions ''f'' and ''g'' are '''orthogonal''' if their inner product (equivalently, the value of this integral) is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f, g\rangle_w = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Orthogonality of two functions with respect to one inner product does not imply orthogonality with respect to another inner product.

We write the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with respect to this inner product as
:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_w = \sqrt{\langle f, f\rangle_w}&lt;/math&gt;

The members of a set of functions {{nowrap|1={''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''i'' = 1, 2, 3, ...}{{null}}}} are ''orthogonal'' with respect to ''w'' on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} if
:&lt;math&gt;\langle f_i, f_j \rangle_w=0\quad i \ne j.&lt;/math&gt;
The members of such a set of functions are ''orthonormal'' with respect to ''w'' on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} if
:&lt;math&gt;\langle f_i, f_j \rangle_w=\delta_{i,j},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{i,j}=\left\{\begin{matrix}1, &amp; &amp; i=j \\ 0, &amp; &amp; i\neq j\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Kronecker delta]].
In other words, every pair of them (excluding pairing of a function with itself) is orthogonal, and the norm of each is 1. See in particular the  [[orthogonal polynomials]].

===Examples===
* The vectors (1, 3, 2)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, (3, −1, 0)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, (1, 3, −5)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;  are orthogonal to each other, since (1)(3) + (3)(−1) + (2)(0) = 0, (3)(1) + (−1)(3) + (0)(−5) = 0, and (1)(1) + (3)(3) + (2)(−5) = 0.
* The vectors (1, 0, 1, 0, ...)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and (0, 1, 0, 1, ...)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; are orthogonal to each other. The dot product of these vectors is 0. We can then make the generalization to consider the vectors in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_k = \sum_{i=0\atop ai+k &lt; n}^{n/a} \mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;

:for some positive integer ''a'', and for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''a'' − 1}}, these vectors are orthogonal, for example {{nowrap|(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{nowrap|(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{nowrap|(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} are orthogonal.

* The functions {{nowrap|2''t'' + 3}} and {{nowrap|45''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 9''t'' − 17}} are orthogonal with respect to a unit weight function on the interval from −1 to 1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 \left(2t+3\right)\left(45t^2+9t-17\right)\,dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* The functions 1, sin(''nx''), cos(''nx'') : ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ... are orthogonal with respect to [[Riemann integration]] on the intervals {{nowrap|[0, 2π]}}, {{nowrap|[−π, π]}}, or any other closed interval of length 2π. This fact is a central one in [[Fourier series]].

====Orthogonal polynomials====
* Various polynomial sequences named for [[mathematician]]s of the past are sequences of [[orthogonal polynomials]]. In particular:
**The [[Hermite polynomials]] are orthogonal with respect to the [[Gaussian distribution]] with zero mean value.
**The [[Legendre polynomials]] are orthogonal with respect to the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] on the interval {{nowrap|[−1, 1]}}.
**The [[Laguerre polynomials]] are orthogonal with respect to the [[exponential distribution]]. Somewhat more general Laguerre polynomial sequences are orthogonal with respect to [[gamma distribution]]s.
**The [[Chebyshev polynomials]] of the first kind are orthogonal with respect to the measure &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{1-x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
**The Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are orthogonal with respect to the [[Wigner semicircle distribution]].

====Orthogonal states in quantum mechanics====
* In [[quantum mechanics]], a sufficient (but not necessary) condition that two [[eigenstates]] of a [[Hermitian operator]], &lt;math&gt; \psi_m &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \psi_n &lt;/math&gt;, are orthogonal is that they correspond to different eigenvalues. This means, in [[Dirac notation]], that &lt;math&gt; \langle \psi_m | \psi_n \rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \psi_m &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \psi_n &lt;/math&gt; correspond to different eigenvalues. This follows from the fact that [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger's equation]] is a [[Sturm–Liouville theory|Sturm–Liouville]] equation (in Schrödinger's formulation) or that observables are given by hermitian operators (in Heisenberg's formulation).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Art==
In art, the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] (imaginary) lines pointing to the [[vanishing point]] are referred to as "orthogonal lines".

The term "orthogonal line" often has a quite different meaning in the literature of modern art criticism. Many works by painters such as [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Burgoyne Diller]] are noted for their exclusive use of "orthogonal lines" — not, however, with reference to perspective, but rather referring to lines that are straight and exclusively horizontal or vertical, forming right angles where they intersect. For example, an essay at the [[Web site]] of the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] states that "Mondrian ... dedicated his entire oeuvre to the investigation of the balance between orthogonal lines and primary colours." [http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_texto_print497.html]

==Computer science==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Motorola 68000]] --&gt;
Orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Scott, ''Programming Language Pragmatics'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; This usage was introduced by [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden|Van Wijngaarden]] in the design of [[Algol 68]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The number of independent primitive concepts has been minimized in order that the language be easy to describe, to learn, and to implement. On the other hand, these concepts have been applied “orthogonally” in order to maximize the expressive power of the language while trying to avoid deleterious superfluities.&lt;ref&gt;1968, Adriaan van Wijngaarden et al., Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 68, section 0.1.2, Orthogonal design&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the [[separation of concerns]] and [[Information Hiding#Encapsulation|encapsulation]], and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.

An [[instruction set]] is said to be '''[[orthogonal instruction set|orthogonal]]''' if it lacks redundancy (i.e., there is only a single instruction that can be used to accomplish a given task)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Null, Linda  |author2=Lobur, Julia |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The essentials of computer organization and architecture|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|edition=2nd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7637-3769-6|page=257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGPHAl9GE-IC&amp;pg=PA257}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is designed such that instructions can use any [[processor register|register]] in any [[addressing mode]]. This terminology results from considering an instruction as a vector whose components are the instruction fields.  One field identifies the registers to be operated upon and another specifies the addressing mode. An [[orthogonal instruction set]] uniquely encodes all combinations of registers and addressing modes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Communications==
In communications, multiple-access schemes are orthogonal when an ideal receiver can completely reject arbitrarily strong unwanted signals from the desired signal using different [[basis function]]s. One such scheme is [[time division multiple access|TDMA]], where the orthogonal basis functions are nonoverlapping rectangular pulses ("time slots").

Another scheme is [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM), which refers to the use, by a single transmitter, of a set of frequency multiplexed signals with the exact minimum frequency spacing needed to make them orthogonal so that they do not interfere with each other.  Well known examples include ('''a''', '''g''', and '''n''') versions of [[802.11]] [[Wi-Fi]]; [[WiMAX]]; [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]], [[DVB-T]], the terrestrial digital TV broadcast system used in most of the world outside North America; and DMT (Discrete Multi Tone), the standard form of [[ADSL]].

In OFDM, the [[subcarrier]] frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that crosstalk between the subchannels is eliminated and intercarrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver. In conventional FDM, a separate filter for each subchannel is required.

==Statistics, econometrics, and economics==
When performing statistical analysis, [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] that affect a particular [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]] are said to be orthogonal if they are uncorrelated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes |author1=Athanasios Papoulis |author2=S. Unnikrishna Pillai |year=2002 |pages=211 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-366011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the covariance forms an inner product. In this case the same results are obtained for the effect of any of the independent variables upon the dependent variable, regardless of whether one models the effects of the variables  individually with [[simple linear regression|simple regression]] or simultaneously with [[multiple regression]]. If [[correlation]] is present, the factors are not orthogonal and different results are obtained by the two methods. This usage arises from the fact that if centered by subtracting the [[expected value]] (the mean), uncorrelated variables are orthogonal in the geometric sense discussed above, both as observed data (i.e., vectors) and as random variables (i.e., density functions).
One [[econometrics|econometric]] formalism that is alternative to the [[maximum likelihood]] framework, the [[Generalized Method of Moments]], relies on orthogonality conditions. In particular, the [[Ordinary Least Squares]] estimator may be easily derived from an orthogonality condition between the explanatory variables and model residuals.

==Taxonomy==
In [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], an orthogonal classification is one in which no item is a member of more than one group, that is, the classifications are mutually exclusive.

==Combinatorics==
In [[combinatorics]], two ''n''×''n'' [[Latin squares]] are said to be orthogonal if their [[superimposition]] yields all possible ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; combinations of entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hedayat, A.|title=Orthogonal arrays: theory and applications|publisher=Springer|year=1999|isbn=978-0-387-98766-8|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrUYlIbI2mEC&amp;pg=PA168|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry and biochemistry==
In [[organic synthesis|synthetic organic chemistry]] orthogonal [[protecting group|protection]] is a strategy allowing the deprotection of [[functional group]]s independently of each other. In chemistry and biochemistry, an orthogonal interaction occurs when there are two pairs of substances and each substance can interact with their respective partner, but does not interact with either substance of the other pair. For example, [[DNA]] has two orthogonal pairs: cytosine and guanine form a base-pair, and adenine and thymine form another base-pair, but other base-pair combinations are strongly disfavored. As a chemical example, tetrazine reacts with transcyclooctene and azide reacts with cyclooctyne without any cross-reaction, so these are mutually orthogonal reactions, and so, can be performed simultaneously and selectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/anie.201104389|title = Bioorthogonal Reaction Pairs Enable Simultaneous, Selective, Multi-Target Imaging|year = 2012|last1 = Karver|first1 = Mark R.|last2 = Hilderbrand|first2 = Scott A.|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume = 51|issue = 4|pages = 920–2|pmc=3304098|pmid=22162316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bioorthogonal chemistry]] refers to chemical reactions occurring inside living systems without reacting with naturally present cellular components. In [[supramolecular chemistry]] the notion of orthogonality refers to the possibility of two or more supramolecular, often [[non-covalent]], interactions being compatible; reversibly forming without interference from the other.

In [[analytical chemistry]], analyses are "orthogonal" if they make a measurement or identification in completely different ways, thus increasing the reliability of the measurement.  This is often required as a part of a [[new drug application]].

==System reliability==
In the field of system reliability orthogonal redundancy is that form of redundancy where the form of backup device or method is completely different from the prone to error device or method. The failure mode of an orthogonally redundant back-up device or method does not intersect with and is completely different from the failure mode of the device or method in need of redundancy to safeguard the total system against catastrophic failure.

==Neuroscience==
In [[neuroscience]], a sensory map in the brain which has overlapping stimulus coding (e.g. location and quality) is called an orthogonal map.

==Gaming==
In board games such as [[chess]] which feature a grid of squares, 'orthogonal' is used to mean "in the same row/'rank' or column/'file'".  This is the counterpart to squares which are "diagonally adjacent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=chessvariants.org chess glossary|url=http://www.chessvariants.org/misc.dir/coreglossary.html#orthogonal_direction}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient Chinese board game [[Go (game)|Go]] a player can capture the stones of an opponent by occupying all orthogonally-adjacent points.

==Other examples==
Stereo vinyl records encode both the left and right stereo channels in a single groove.  The V-shaped groove in the vinyl has walls that are 90 degrees to each other, with variations in each wall separately encoding one of the two analogue channels that make up the stereo signal.  The cartridge senses the motion of the stylus following the groove in two orthogonal directions: 45 degrees from vertical to either side.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustration, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umu37m0qUiE YouTube].&lt;/ref&gt;  A pure horizontal motion corresponds to a mono signal, equivalent to a stereo signal in which both channels carry identical (in-phase) signals.

Post-Newtonian formalism is a calculational tool that expresses [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's (nonlinear) equations of gravity]] in terms of the lowest-order deviations from [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. This allows approximations to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s equations to be made in the case of weak fields. Higher-order terms can be added to increase accuracy, but for strong fields, sometimes it is preferable to solve the complete equations numerically. Some of these post-Newtonian approximations are expansions in a small parameter, which is the ratio of the velocity of the matter forming the gravitational field to the [[speed of light]], which in this case is better called the [[speed of gravity]]. In the limit, when the fundamental speed of gravity becomes infinite, the [[post-Newtonian expansion]] reduces to Newton's law of [[gravity]].

The '''parameterized post-Newtonian formalism''' or '''PPN formalism''', is a version of this formulation that explicitly details the parameters in which a general theory of gravity can differ from Newtonian gravity.  It is used as a tool to compare Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity in the limit in which the [[gravitational field]] is weak and generated by objects moving slowly compared to the speed of light. In general, PPN formalism can be applied to all metric theories of gravitation in which all bodies satisfy the Einstein [[equivalence principle]] (EEP). The speed of light remains constant in PPN formalism and it assumes that the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] is always symmetric.

==History==
The earliest parameterizations of the post-Newtonian approximation were performed by Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] in 1922. However, they dealt solely with the vacuum gravitational field outside an isolated spherical body. Dr. [[Ken Nordtvedt]] (1968, 1969) expanded this to include seven parameters. [[Clifford Martin Will]] (1971) introduced a stressed, continuous matter description of celestial bodies.

The versions described here are based on [[Wei-Tou Ni]] (1972), Will and Nordtvedt (1972), [[Charles W. Misner]] et al. (1973) (see [[Gravitation (book)|''Gravitation'' (book)]]), and Will (1981, 1993) and have ten parameters.

==Beta-delta notation==

Ten '''post-Newtonian parameters''' completely characterize the weak-field behavior of the theory. The formalism has been a valuable tool in [[tests of general relativity]]. In the notation of Will (1971), Ni (1972) and Misner et al. (1973) they have the following values:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; ||How much space curvature &lt;math&gt;g_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is produced by unit rest mass ?
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; ||How much [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearity]] is there in the [[Superposition principle|superposition]] law for gravity &lt;math&gt;g_{00}&lt;/math&gt; ?
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; ||How much gravity is produced by unit [[kinetic energy]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac12\rho_0v^2&lt;/math&gt; ?
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; ||How much gravity is produced by unit [[gravitational potential]] energy &lt;math&gt;\rho_0/U&lt;/math&gt; ?
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\beta_3&lt;/math&gt; ||How much gravity is produced by unit internal energy &lt;math&gt;\rho_0\Pi&lt;/math&gt; ?
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\beta_4&lt;/math&gt; ||How much gravity is produced by unit pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; ?
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; ||Difference between radial and transverse kinetic energy on gravity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; ||Difference between radial and transverse stress on gravity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta_1&lt;/math&gt; ||How much dragging of [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames]] &lt;math&gt;g_{0j}&lt;/math&gt; is produced by unit [[momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\rho_0v&lt;/math&gt; ?
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta_2&lt;/math&gt; ||Difference between radial and transverse momentum on dragging of inertial frames
|}
&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the 4 by 4 symmetric metric tensor with indexes &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; going from 0 to 3. Below, an index of 0 will indicate the time direction and indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (going from 1 to 3) will indicate spatial directions.

In Einstein's theory, the values of these parameters are chosen (1) to fit Newton's Law of gravity in the limit of velocities and mass approaching zero, (2) to ensure [[conservation of energy]], [[Conservation of mass|mass]], [[Conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[Conservation of Angular Momentum|angular momentum]], and (3) to make the equations independent of the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].  In this notation, general relativity has PPN parameters
&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\beta=\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta_3=\beta_4=\Delta_1=\Delta_2=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\zeta=\eta=0&lt;/math&gt;

==Alpha-zeta notation==

In the more recent notation of Will &amp; Nordtvedt (1972) and Will (1981, 1993, 2006) a different set of ten PPN parameters is used.

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\beta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1=7\Delta_1+\Delta_2-4\gamma-4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_2=\Delta_2+\zeta-1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_3=4\beta_1-2\gamma-2-\zeta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_1=\zeta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_2=2\beta+2\beta_2-3\gamma-1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_3=\beta_3-1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_4=\beta_4-\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from &lt;math&gt;3\eta=12\beta-3\gamma-9+10\xi-3\alpha_1+2\alpha_2-2\zeta_1-\zeta_2&lt;/math&gt;

The meaning of these is that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_3&lt;/math&gt; measure the extent of preferred frame effects. &lt;math&gt;\zeta_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\zeta_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\zeta_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\zeta_4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_3&lt;/math&gt; measure the failure of conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum.

In this notation, general relativity has PPN parameters
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\beta=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha_3=\zeta_1=\zeta_2=\zeta_3=\zeta_4=\xi=0&lt;/math&gt;

The mathematical relationship between the metric, metric potentials and PPN parameters for this notation is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}g_{00} = -1+2U-2\beta U^2-2\xi\Phi_W+(2\gamma+2+\alpha_3+\zeta_1-2\xi)\Phi_1 +2(3\gamma-2\beta+1+\zeta_2+\xi)\Phi_2 \\ \ +2(1+\zeta_3)\Phi_3+2(3\gamma+3\zeta_4-2\xi)\Phi_4-(\zeta_1-2\xi)A-(\alpha_1-\alpha_2-\alpha_3)w^2U \\ \ -\alpha_2w^iw^jU_{ij}+(2\alpha_3-\alpha_1)w^iV_i+O(\epsilon^3) \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{0i}=-\textstyle\frac12(4\gamma+3+\alpha_1-\alpha_2+\zeta_1-2\xi)V_i-\textstyle\frac12(1+\alpha_2-\zeta_1+2\xi)W_i
-\textstyle\frac12(\alpha_1-2\alpha_2)w^iU-\alpha_2w^jU_{ij}+O(\epsilon^{\frac52})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}=(1+2\gamma U)\delta_{ij}+O(\epsilon^2)&lt;/math&gt;
 
where repeated indexes are summed.  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is on the order of potentials such as &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the square magnitude of the coordinate velocities of matter, etc. &lt;math&gt;w^i&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector of the PPN coordinate system relative to the mean rest-frame of the universe. &lt;math&gt;w^2=\delta_{ij}w^iw^j&lt;/math&gt; is the square magnitude of that velocity. &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;i=j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

There are ten metric potentials, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_W&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_4&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt;, one for each PPN parameter to ensure a unique solution. 10 linear equations in 10 unknowns are solved by inverting a 10 by 10 matrix. These metric potentials have forms such as:
:&lt;math&gt;U(\mathbf{x},t)=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
which is simply another way of writing the Newtonian gravitational potential,
:&lt;math&gt;U_{ij}=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)(x-x')_i(x-x')_j\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_W=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)\rho(\mathbf{x}'',t)(x-x')_i\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3}\left({(x'-x'')^i\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}-{(x-x'')^i\over|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}''|}\right)d^3x'd^3x''&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)\left(\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}',t)\cdot(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')\right)^2\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_1=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}',t)^2\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_2=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)U(\mathbf{x}',t)\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_3=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)\Pi(\mathbf{x}',t)\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_4=\int{p(\mathbf{x}',t)\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_i=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)v(\mathbf{x}',t)_i\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W_i=\int{\rho(\mathbf{x}',t)\left(\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}',t)\cdot(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')\right)(x-x')_i\over|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3}d^3x'&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of rest mass, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit rest mass, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure as measured in a local freely falling frame momentarily comoving with the matter, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate velocity of the matter.

Stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid takes form
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00}=\rho(1+\Pi+\mathbf{v}^2+2U)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T^{0i}=\rho(1+\Pi+\mathbf{v}^2+2U+p/\rho)v^i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T^{ij}=\rho(1+\Pi+\mathbf{v}^2+2U+p/\rho)v^iv^j+p\delta^{ij}(1-2\gamma U)&lt;/math&gt;

==How to apply PPN==

Examples of the process of applying PPN formalism to alternative theories of gravity can be found in Will (1981, 1993). It is a nine step process:

*Step 1: Identify the variables, which may include: (a) dynamical gravitational variables such as the metric &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, vector field &lt;math&gt;K_\mu&lt;/math&gt;, tensor field &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and so on; (b) prior-geometrical variables such as a flat background metric &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, cosmic time function &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and so on; (c) matter and non-gravitational field variables.
*Step 2: Set the cosmological boundary conditions. Assume a homogeneous isotropic cosmology, with isotropic coordinates in the rest frame of the universe. A complete cosmological solution may or may not be needed. Call the results &lt;math&gt;g^{(0)}_{\mu\nu} = \operatorname{diag}(-c_0,c_1,c_1,c_1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K^{(0)}_\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B^{(0)}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Step 3: Get new variables from &lt;math&gt;h_{\mu\nu}=g_{\mu\nu}-g^{(0)}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\phi-\phi_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_\mu-K^{(0)}_\mu&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu\nu}-B^{(0)}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; if needed.
*Step 4: Substitute these forms into the field equations, keeping only such terms as are necessary to obtain a final consistent solution for &lt;math&gt;h_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. Substitute the perfect fluid stress tensor for the matter sources.
*Step 5: Solve for &lt;math&gt;h_{00}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;O(2)&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming this tends to zero far from the system, one obtains the form &lt;math&gt;h_{00}=2\alpha U&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the Newtonian gravitational potential and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; may be a complicated function including the gravitational "constant" &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The Newtonian metric has the form &lt;math&gt;g_{00}=-c_0+2\alpha U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{0j}=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}c_1&lt;/math&gt;. Work in units where the gravitational "constant" measured today far from gravitating matter is unity so set &lt;math&gt;G_{\mathrm{today}} = \alpha/c_0 c_1=1&lt;/math&gt;.
*Step 6: From linearized versions of the field equations solve for &lt;math&gt;h_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;O(2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_{0j}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;O(3)&lt;/math&gt;.
*Step 7: Solve for &lt;math&gt;h_{00}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;O(4)&lt;/math&gt;. This is the messiest step, involving all the nonlinearities in the field equations. The stress–energy tensor must also be expanded to sufficient order.
*Step 8: Convert to local quasi-Cartesian coordinates and to standard PPN gauge.
*Step 9: By comparing the result for &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; with the equations presented in [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism#Alpha-zeta notation|PPN with alpha-zeta parameters]], read off the PPN parameter values.

==Comparisons between theories of gravity==
{{main | Alternatives to general relativity#PPN parameters for a range of theories}}

A table comparing PPN parameters for 23 theories of gravity can be found in [[Alternatives to general relativity#PPN parameters for a range of theories]].

Most metric theories of gravity can be lumped into categories. [[Scalar theories of gravitation]] include conformally flat theories and stratified theories with time-orthogonal space slices.

In conformally flat theories such as [[Nordström's theory of gravitation]] the metric is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}=f\boldsymbol{\eta}&lt;/math&gt; and for this metric &lt;math&gt;\gamma=-1&lt;/math&gt;, which violently disagrees with observations. In stratified theories such as [[Yilmaz theory of gravitation]] the metric is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}=f_1\mathbf{d}t \otimes \mathbf{d} t +f_2\boldsymbol{\eta}&lt;/math&gt; and for this metric &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1=-4(\gamma+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which also disagrees violently with observations.

Another class of theories is the quasilinear theories such as [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation]]. For these &lt;math&gt;\xi=\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  The relative magnitudes of the harmonics of the Earth's tides depend on &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, and measurements show that quasilinear theories disagree with observations of Earth's tides.

Another class of metric theories is the [[bimetric theory]]. For all of these &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero. From the precession of the solar spin we know that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2 &lt; 4\times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt;, and that effectively rules out bimetric theories.

Another class of metric theories is the [[scalar-tensor theory|scalar tensor theories]], such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]]. For all of these, &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\textstyle\frac{1+\omega}{2+\omega}&lt;/math&gt;. The limit of &lt;math&gt;\gamma-1&lt;2.3\times10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; would have to be very large, so these theories are looking less and less likely as experimental accuracy improves.

The final main class of metric theories is the vector-tensor theories. For all of these the gravitational "constant" varies with time and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero. Lunar laser ranging experiments tightly constrain the variation of the gravitational "constant" with time and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2 &lt; 4\times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt;, so these theories are also looking unlikely.

There are some metric theories of gravity that do not fit into the above categories, but they have similar problems.

[[Image:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|350px|&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function from [[domain of a function|domain]] '''''X''''' to [[codomain]] '''''Y'''''. The yellow oval inside '''''Y''''' is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes "range" refers to the image and sometimes to the codomain.]]

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[naive set theory]], the '''range''' of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] refers to either the ''[[codomain]]'' or the ''[[image (mathematics)|image]]'' of the function, depending upon usage.  Modern usage almost always uses ''range'' to mean ''image''.

The codomain of a function is some arbitrary super-set of image.  In [[real analysis]], it is the [[real number]]s.  In [[complex analysis]], it is the [[complex number]]s.

The image of a function is the set of all outputs of the function.  The image is always a subset of the codomain.

==Distinguishing between the two uses==

As the term "range" can have different meanings, it is considered a good practice to define it the first time it is used in a textbook or article.

Older books, when they use the word "range", tend to use it to mean what is now called the [[codomain]].&lt;ref&gt;Hungerford 1974, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Childs 1990, page 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  More modern books, if they use the word "range" at all, generally use it to mean what is now called the [[image (mathematics)|image]].&lt;ref&gt;Dummit and Foote 2004, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid any confusion, a number of modern books don't use the word "range" at all.&lt;ref&gt;Rudin 1991, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the two different usages, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; as it is used in [[real analysis]], that is, as a function that inputs a [[real number]] and outputs its square.  In this case, its codomain is the set of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, but its image is the set of non-negative real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is never negative if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is real.  For this function, if we use "range" to mean ''codomain'', it refers to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  When we use "range" to mean ''image'', it refers to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example where the range equals the codomain, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x&lt;/math&gt;, which inputs a real number and outputs its double.  For this function, the codomain and the image are the same (the function is a [[Surjective function|surjection]]), so the word range is unambiguous; it is the set of all real numbers.

==Formal definition==

When "range" is used to mean "codomain", the image of a function ''f'' is already implicitly defined. It is (by definition of image) the (maybe trivial) subset of the "range" which equals {''y'' | there exists an ''x'' in the domain of ''f'' such that ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}.

When "range" is used to mean "image", the range of a function ''f'' is by definition {''y'' | there exists an ''x'' in the domain of ''f'' such that ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}.  In this case, the codomain of ''f'' must not be specified, because any codomain which contains this image as a (maybe trivial) subset will work.

In both cases, image ''f'' ⊆ range ''f'' ⊆ codomain ''f'', with at least one of the containments being equality.

==Biography==
Downey earned a bachelor's degree at the [[University of Queensland]] in 1978, and then went on to graduate school at [[Monash University]], earning a doctorate in 1982 under the supervision of [[John Crossley (mathematician)|John Crossley]].&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~downey/cv.pdf Curriculum vitae], retrieved 19 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vuw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Rodney Graham Downey|id=59295}}&lt;/ref&gt; After holding teaching and visiting positions at the [[Monash University, Caulfield campus|Chisholm Institute of Technology]], [[Western Illinois University]], the [[National University of Singapore]], and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], he came to New Zealand in 1986 as a lecturer at Victoria University. He was promoted to reader in 1991, and was given a personal chair at Victoria in 1995.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cf"/&gt;

Downey was president of the [[New Zealand Mathematical Society]] from 2001 to 2003.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=President's report 2001–2002|first=Rod|last=Downey|journal=Newsletter of the New Zealand Mathematical Society|volume=87|date=April 2003|url=http://nzmathsoc.org.nz/downloads/newsletters/NZMSnews87_Apr2003.pdf|pages=4–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Downey is the co-author of three books:
*''Parameterized Complexity'' (with [[Michael Fellows]], Springer, 1999)

He is currently{{when|date=March 2018}} the Chief Scientist at the [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]] (also known as Cal-(IT)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD).

==Biography==
Graham was born in [[Taft, California]]. In 1962, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[mathematics]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and began working at [[Bell Labs]] and later [[AT&amp;T Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/mis_09_magical_day.pdf |author=Larry Rabiner |title=Ron Graham – A Biographical Retrospective |date=4 Feb 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was director of information sciences in AT&amp;T Labs, but retired from AT&amp;T in 1999 after 37 years.

His 1977 paper considered a problem in Ramsey theory, and gave a [[large number]] as an upper bound for its solution. This number has since become well known as the largest number ever used in a mathematical proof (was listed as such in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''), and is now known as [[Graham's number]], although it has since then been surpassed by even larger numbers such as [[TREE(3)]].

Graham popularized the concept of the [[Erdős number]], named after the highly prolific Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] (1913–1996). A scientist's Erdős number is the minimum number of coauthored publications away from a publication with Erdős. Graham's Erdős number is 1. He co-authored almost 30 papers with Erdős, and was also a good friend. Erdős often stayed with Graham, and allowed him to look after his mathematical papers and even his income. Graham and Erdős visited the young mathematician [[Jon Folkman]] when he was hospitalized with brain cancer.&lt;ref name="Erdos"&gt;{{citation|title=[[The man who loved only numbers|The man who loved only numbers: the story of Paul Erdős and the search for mathematical truth]]| first=Paul|last=Hoffman|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7868-6362-4|pages=109{{ndash}}110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1993 and 1994 Graham served as the president of the American Mathematical Society. Graham was also featured in ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not]]'' for being not only "one of the world's foremost mathematicians", but also "a highly skilled trampolinist and juggler", and past president of the [[International Jugglers' Association]].

[[Image:ronald graham couple with erdos 1986.jpg|right|thumb|Ronald Graham, his wife [[Fan Chung]], and [[Paul Erdős]], Japan 1986]]

He has published about 320 papers and five books, including ''[[Concrete Mathematics]]'' with [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Oren Patashnik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/ron/papers/papers.html |title=Papers of Ron Graham |first=Steve |last=Butler |date=23 July 2008 |website=[[University of California, San Diego|UCSD Mathematics]] |accessdate=2 July 2014 |authorlink1=Steve Butler (mathematician)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is married to Fan Chung Graham (known professionally as [[Fan Chung]]), who is the Akamai Professor in Internet Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego.

==Awards and honors==
In 2003, Graham won the American Mathematical Society's annual [[Leroy P. Steele Prizes|Steele Prize]] for Lifetime Achievement. The prize was awarded on January 16 that year, at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. In 1999 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. Graham has won many other prizes over the years; he was one of the laureates of the prestigious [[Pólya Prize (SIAM)|Pólya Prize]] the first year it was ever awarded, and among the first to win the [[Euler Medal]]. The [[Mathematical Association of America]] has also awarded him both the [[L. R. Ford|Lester R. Ford]] prize which was "...established in 1964 to recognize authors of articles of expository excellence published in ''The American Mathematical Monthly''...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maa.org/Awards/ford.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702012306/http://www.maa.org/awards/ford.html |archivedate=2 July 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2014 |title=The Mathematical Association of America's The Paul R.

==Career==
His research is in the fields of [[cryptography]], [[random sequence]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[information theory]]. He proposed a test of algorithmic randomness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/RES/RANDTEST.HTM#Kak71|title=Randomness Tests: A Literature Survey|website=Ciphersbyritter.com|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a type of instantaneously trained neural networks (INNs) (which he and his students have called "CC4 network" and others have called "Kak neural networks"). He was the first to formulate the discrete and the number theoretic [[Hilbert transform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. The discrete Hilbert transform. Proc. IEEE, vol. 58, pp. 585-586, April 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S.The number theoretic Hilbert transform.

{{quote|...machines fall short on two counts as compared to brains. Firstly, unlike brains, machines do not self-organize in a recursive manner. Secondly, machines are based on classical logic, whereas Nature's intelligence may depend on quantum mechanics.

[Further], if machines with consciousness are created, they would be living machines, that is, variations on life forms as we know them. Second, the material world is not causally closed, and consciousness influences its evolution. Matter and minds complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/v6i42_kak.html|title=ACM Ubiquity|website=Acm.org|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Kak neural network==
The Kak neural network, also called the CC4 network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shortt, A. et al|title=Optical implementation of the Kak neural network|journal=Information Sciences|volume=171|date=2005|pages=273-287|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1063588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an [[Instantaneously trained neural networks|instantaneously trained neural network]] that creates a new "hidden neuron" for each training sample, achieving immediate training for [[binary data]].

Kak's three-stage protocol is a protocol for [[quantum cryptography]] suggested by Kak.&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. A Three-Stage Quantum Cryptography Protocol. ''Foundations of Physics Letters'' 19 (2006), 293-296. [https://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CR/0603046 Trusted certificates in quantum cryptography]&lt;/ref&gt;  This method consists of random rotations of the polarization by both parties. In principle, this method can be used for continuous, unbreakable encryption of data if single photons are used.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y. et al, Embedded security framework for integrated classical and quantum cryptography in optical burst switching networks. ''Security and Communication Networks.''  2 (2009) 546-554.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic polarization rotation scheme has been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121004093506.htm|title=Multi-photon approach in quantum cryptography implemented|website=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-stage protocol has been proposed as a solution to get around the requirement of expensive single-photon sources and receivers in other quantum cryptography protocols.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, L. et al.

==Indological publications==
Kak's writings concerning the astronomy of the [[Vedic period]] in his book ''The Astronomical Code of the [[Rig-Veda|Rigveda]]'' support the "[[Indigenous Aryans]]" theory, questioning mainstream views on the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] and the nature of early Indian science. While Kak's interpretation has been included in recent overviews of astronomy in the Vedic period in India&lt;ref&gt;In [[Govind Chandra Pande]], "The Dawn of Indian Civilization". CSC, New Delhi, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and the West,&lt;ref&gt;In S. Wolpert (ed.), "Encyclopedia of India." Scribner's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; his chronology and astronomical calculations have been discredited by several Indologists, such as [[Michael Witzel]],&lt;ref name="Witzel"&gt;{{Citation | last = Witzel | first = Michael | author-link =  | year = 2001 | title = Autochthonous Aryans?

===Archaeoastronomy - ''The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda''===
''The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda''{{refn|group=note|New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, 1994; revised and enlarged edition, New Delhi: [[Munshiram Manoharlal]], 2000; second revised edition 2016}} claims regularities in the organization of the [[Rigveda]], connecting the structure to certain numbers in the [[astronomy]]-based ritual of the five-layered ''[[Vedi (altar)|vedi]]'' (Vedic fire altar). Kak arranges the number of hymns in each book of the Rigveda as follows, and compares the arrangement to the ''vedi'':
&lt;poem&gt;[[Mandala 10|RV 10]]:191  [[Mandala 9|RV 9]]:114
[[Mandala 7|RV 7]] :104     [[Mandala 8|RV 8]]: 92
[[Mandala 5|RV 5]] : 87      [[Mandala 6|RV 6]]: 75
[[Mandala 3|RV 3]] : 62      [[Mandala 4|RV 4]]: 58
[[Mandala 2|RV 2]] : 43      [[Mandala 1|RV 1]]:191&lt;/poem&gt;
He then computes various sums and subtractions within the diagram, finding numbers related to the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and the [[sidereal period]]s of various planets. 

Kak's [[archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] claims have the effect of significantly extending the [[Vedic period]], postulating the arrival of Indo-Aryan speakers to the 7th millennium BC. This claim is in contradiction with mainstream Indology and historical linguistics&lt;ref name = "Witzel" /&gt; and science historians&lt;ref name="listserv.linguistlist.org"/&gt;

While [[Klaus Klostermaier]] has stated that "Subhash Kak, with his 'decoding of the Rigveda' has opened up an entirely new approach to the study of Vedic cosmology from an empirical astronomical/mathematical viewpoint,"&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism, Second Edition. State University of New York Press, 1995, pp. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars like Meera Nanda have said that Kak's "method is breathtakingly ad hoc and reads like [[numerology]] 101."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Rutgers University Press | isbn = 978-0-8135-3358-2 | last = Nanda | first = Meera | title = Prophets facing backward: postmodern critiques of science and Hindu nationalism in India | year = 2003 | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kak's method depends on the structure of the Rigveda as redacted by the [[shakha]]s in the late [[Brahmana]] period, well within the Indian [[Iron Age]], when it was organized into [[mandala]]s ("books"). According to Witzel, this leaves Kak's approach attempt to date the text flawed, because this process of redaction took place long after the composition of the individual hymns during the ''samhita prose'' period.&lt;ref name= "Witzel" /&gt; 

Kak prepared the section on archaeoastronomical sites in India for the thematic study on ''Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy in the context of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention'' prepared for [[UNESCO]] by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)]] and the [[International Astronomical Union|International Astronomical Union (IAU)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kak | first = Subhash | author-link = | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive | editor2-last = Cotte | editor2-first = Michel | editor-link = Clive Ruggles | editor2-link = | title = Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy in the context of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention: A Thematic Study | place = Paris | publisher = ICOMOS / IAU | year = 2010 | chapter = India | pages = 99–107 | url = http://openarchive.icomos.org/267/ | isbn = 978-2-918086-07-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''In Search of the Cradle of Civilization''===
Kak co-authored ''[[In Search of the Cradle of Civilization]]'' (1995) participating in the controversy in the [[politics of India]] around the "indigenous Aryans" theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]], [[The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture]]: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate. Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronology espoused in this book is based on the archaeoastronomical readings obtained by correlating textual references and archaeological remains.

===''Ashvamedha''===
Kak's book ''The Asvamedha: The Rite and Its Logic'' (2002) provides an interpretation of the Vedic ''[[Ashvamedha|aśvamedhá]]'' ([[horse sacrifice]]) rite.&lt;ref&gt;The Asvamedha: The Rite and Its Logic, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, (2002) {{ISBN|81-208-1877-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the details of this rite are connected to the [[Agnicayana]] ritual.

==Philosophy==
In the books ''The Nature of Physical Reality'' and ''Mind and Self'' and other publications,&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. Observability and computability in physics. Quantum Matter 3: 172-176 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Kak argues that there are limits to the extent the world is computable. His "philosophy of [[recursionism]]" is expounded in his books ''The Gods Within'', ''The Architecture of Knowledge'', and ''The Prajna Sutra''.

Kak claimed to be the first to have used the term "quantum neural computing",&lt;ref&gt;In Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics 94: 259-313 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; taking a [[Quantum mind]] position.
He sees the brain as a machine that reduces the infinite possibilities of a "quantum-like universal consciousness", which is a consequence of the "recursive nature of reality".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl H. Pribram]] and Robert King (eds.), Learning and Self-Organization, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996, 185-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Architecture of Knowledge'', Kak talks about  [[quantum mechanics]], [[neuroscience]], [[computers]], and [[consciousness]]. The book is one of the twenty planned monographs in the multi-volume series on the [[Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy and Culture]] under the general editorship of Professor [[D. P. Chattopadhyaya]]. The book provides philosophical connections to contemporary science that reach back not only to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] but also to the [[India]]n tradition. &lt;!-- The chapters in the book are: --&gt;

The book seeks to find a consistent framework for knowledge in logic, purpose, and awareness, and sees science as representation and transformation of machines, of reality, and of life. Reality is seen in different layers, and

&lt;blockquote&gt;with the dual aspects of purposive and reflexive behaviour in each layer, we see parallels in the structures in quantum theory, neuroscience, and computers. The overarching unity is provided by human consciousness. As conscious subjects, we examine the universe through the agency of our minds. In our strivings to describe the outer world using formal knowledge, shadows of the architecture of the inner world are also unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;''The Architecture of Knowledge''(2004),  {{ISBN|81-87586-12-5}} (page 299)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, he has spoken of two kinds of consciousness that he calls big-C and little-C, where big-C represents phenomenal consciousness associated with awareness, whereas little-C are those aspects of consciousness that relate to cognitive tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06257.pdf|title=Kak, S. The Limits of Machine Consciousness. 2017|website=Arxiv.org|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that machines will be able to emulate little-C quite effectively.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In many applications, one needs to calculate the [[derivative|rate of change]] of a [[volume integral|volume]] or [[surface integral]] whose domain of [[integral|integration]], as well as the [[integrand]], are [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of a particular parameter. In physical applications, that parameter is frequently [[time]] ''t''.

==Introduction==
The rate of change of one-dimensional integrals with sufficiently [[smooth function|smooth]] integrands, is governed by this [[Differentiation under the integral sign|extension]] of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{a\left( t\right) }^{b\left( t\right) }f\left( t,x\right) dx=  \int_{a\left( t\right) }^{b\left( t\right) }\frac{\partial f\left( t,x\right) }{\partial t}dx+f\left( t,b\left( t\right) \right) b^{\prime }\left( t\right) -f\left( t,a\left( t\right) \right) a^{\prime }\left( t\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[calculus of moving surfaces]]&lt;ref name="Grinfeld1" &gt;Grinfeld, P. (2010). "Hamiltonian Dynamic Equations for Fluid Films". Studies in Applied Mathematics. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9590.2010.00485.x}}. {{ISSN|0022-2526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provides analogous [[formulas]] for volume integrals over [[Euclidean space|Euclidean domains]], and surface integrals over [[differential geometry of surfaces]], curved surfaces, including integrals over curved surfaces with moving contour [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]].

==Volume integrals==

Let ''t'' be a time-like [[parameter]] and consider a time-dependent [[Domain of a function|domain]] &amp;Omega; with a smooth [[Surface (topology)|surface]] boundary ''S''. Let ''F'' be a time-dependent [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] field defined in the interior of &amp;Omega;. Then the rate of change of the [[integral]] &lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega F \, d\Omega &lt;/math&gt;

is governed by the following law:&lt;ref name="Grinfeld1" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \int_\Omega F \, d\Omega =\int_\Omega \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} \, d\Omega + \int_S  CF \, dS&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the [[The Calculus of Moving Surfaces|velocity of the interface]]. The velocity of the interface ''C'' is the fundamental concept in the [[calculus of moving surfaces]]. In the above equation, ''C'' must be expressed with respect to the exterior [[Surface normal|normal]]. This law can be considered as the generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].

==Surface integrals==

A related law governs the [[Derivative|rate of change]] of the [[surface integral]]

: &lt;math&gt; \int_S F \, dS &lt;/math&gt;

The law reads

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt } \int_S F \, dS = \int_S \frac{\delta F}{\delta t} \, dS - \int_S CB^\alpha_\alpha F \, dS&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;{\delta}/{\delta} t&lt;/math&gt;-[[derivative]] is the fundamental [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] in the [[calculus of moving surfaces]], originally proposed by [[Jacques Hadamard]]. &lt;math&gt;B^\alpha _\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of the [[Curvature#Mean curvature|mean curvature tensor]]. In this law, ''C'' need not be expression with respect to the exterior normal, as long as the choice of the normal is consistent for ''C'' and &lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The first term in the above equation captures the rate of change in ''F'' while the second corrects for expanding or shrinking area. The fact that mean curvature represents the rate of change in area follows from applying the above equation to &lt;math&gt;F\equiv 1&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\int_S \, dS &lt;/math&gt; is area:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \int_S  \, dS = -\int_S CB^\alpha_\alpha \, dS&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation shows that mean curvature &lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be appropriately called the ''shape gradient'' of area. An evolution governed by

:&lt;math&gt;C\equiv B^\alpha_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

is the popular [[mean curvature flow]] and represents [[steepest descent]] with respect to area. Note that for a [[sphere]] of radius ''R'', 
&lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\alpha = -2/R&lt;/math&gt;, and for a [[circle]] of radius ''R'', 
&lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\alpha = -1/R&lt;/math&gt;
with respect to the exterior normal.

==Surface integrals with moving contour boundaries==
[[Image:SurfaceIntegralLawExplained.png|400px|right|thumb|Illustration for the law for surface integrals with a moving contour. Change in area comes from two sources:
expansion by curvature &lt;math&gt;CB^\alpha_\alpha dt&lt;/math&gt; and expansion by annexation &lt;math&gt;cdt&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Suppose that ''S'' is a moving surface with a moving contour &amp;gamma;. Suppose that the velocity of the contour &amp;gamma; with respect to ''S'' is ''c''. Then the rate of change of the time dependent integral:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_S F \, dS&lt;/math&gt;

is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \int_S F \, dS = \int_S \frac{\delta F}{\delta t} \, dS - \int_S CB_\alpha^\alpha F \, dS + \int_\gamma  c \, d\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

The last term captures the change in area due to annexation, as the figure on the right illustrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4468">The discipline of [[combinatorial topology]] used combinatorial concepts in [[topology]] and in the early 20th century this turned into the field of [[algebraic topology]].

In 1978 the situation was reversed — methods from algebraic topology were used to solve a problem in [[combinatorics]] – when [[László Lovász]] proved the [[Kneser graph|Kneser conjecture]], thus beginning the new study of '''topological combinatorics'''. Lovász's proof used the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]] and this theorem retains a prominent role in this new field. This theorem has many equivalent versions and analogs and has been used in the study of [[fair division]] problems.

In another application of [[Homology (mathematics)|homological]] methods to [[graph theory]]  Lovász proved both the undirected and directed versions of a conjecture of [[András Frank]]: Given a [[k-connected graph]] ''G'', ''k'' points &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_k \in V(G)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''k'' positive integers &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k&lt;/math&gt; that sum up to &lt;math&gt;|V(G)|&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a partition &lt;math&gt;\{V_1,\ldots,V_k\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V(G)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;v_i \in V_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|V_i|=n_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; spans a connected subgraph.

In 1987 the [[necklace splitting problem]] was solved by [[Noga Alon]] using the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. It has also been used to study [[Computational complexity theory|complexity problems]] in [[decision tree|linear decision tree algorithms]] and the [[Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture]]. Other areas include [[Poset topology|topology of partially ordered sets]] and [[bruhat order]]s.

Additionally, methods from [[differential topology]] now have a combinatorial analog in [[discrete Morse theory]].

In [[model theory]], a '''transfer principle''' states that all statements of some language that are true for some structure are true for another structure. One of the first examples was [[algebraic geometry and analytic geometry#The Lefschetz principle|the Lefschetz principle]], which states that any sentence in the [[first-order logic|first-order language]] of [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] that is true for the [[complex number]]s is also true for any [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic (algebra) |characteristic 0]].

==History==
An incipient form of a transfer principle was described by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] under the name of "the [[Law of Continuity]]".&lt;ref name="Keisler2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keisler|first1=H. Jerome|title=Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach|url=http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html|page=902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here [[infinitesimal]]s are expected to have the "same" properties as [[appreciable number]]s.  Similar tendencies are found in [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], who used infinitesimals to define both the [[continuous function|continuity of functions]] (in [[Cours d'Analyse]]) and a form of the [[Dirac delta function]].&lt;ref name="Keisler2000"/&gt;{{rp|903}}

In 1955, [[Jerzy Łoś]] proved the transfer principle for any [[hyperreal number]] system.  Its most common use is in  [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]] of the [[hyperreal number]]s, where the transfer principle  states that any sentence expressible in a certain formal language that is true of [[real number]]s is also true of hyperreal numbers.

==Transfer principle for the hyperreals==
The transfer principle concerns the logical relation between the properties of the real numbers R, and the properties of a  larger field denoted *R called the [[hyperreal number]]s.  The field *R includes, in particular, infinitesimal ("infinitely small") numbers, providing a rigorous mathematical realisation of a project initiated by Leibniz.

The idea is to express  analysis over R in a suitable language of mathematical logic, and then point out that this language applies equally well to *R.  This turns out to be possible because at the set-theoretic level, the propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to [[internal set]]s rather than to all sets. As [[Abraham Robinson|Robinson]] put it, ''the sentences of [the theory] are interpreted in *R in [[Leon Henkin|Henkin]]'s sense.''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, A. The metaphysics of the calculus, in Problems in the Philosophy of Mathematics, ed. Lakatos (Amsterdam: North Holland), pp. 28–46, 1967. Reprinted in the 1979 Collected Works. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem to the effect that each proposition valid over R, is also valid over *R, is called the transfer principle.

There are several different versions of the transfer principle, depending on what model of non-standard mathematics is being used. 
In terms of model theory, the transfer principle states that a map from a standard model to a non-standard model is an [[elementary equivalence|elementary embedding]] (an embedding preserving the [[truth value]]s of all statements in a language), or sometimes a ''bounded'' elementary embedding (similar, but only for statements with bounded quantifiers).

The transfer principle appears to lead to contradictions if it is not handled correctly.
For example, since the hyperreal numbers form a non-[[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] [[ordered field]] and the reals form an Archimedean ordered field, the property of being Archimedean ("every positive real is larger than 1/''n'' for some positive integer ''n''") seems at first sight not to satisfy the transfer principle. The statement "every positive hyperreal is larger than 1/''n'' for some positive integer ''n''" is false; however
the correct interpretation is "every positive hyperreal is larger than 1/''n'' for some positive [[hyperinteger]] ''n''". In other words, the hyperreals appear to be Archimedean to an internal observer living in the non-standard universe, but appear
to be non-Archimedean to an external observer outside the universe.

A freshman-level accessible formulation of the transfer principle is [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Keisler's]] book ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''.

===Example===
Every real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;x \geq \lfloor x \rfloor ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \,\cdot\, \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor and ceiling functions|integer part]] function.  By a typical application of the transfer principle, every hyperreal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;x \geq {}^{*}\! \lfloor x \rfloor ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{}^{*}\! \lfloor \,\cdot\, \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the natural extension of the integer part function.  If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, then the [[hyperinteger]] &lt;math&gt;{}^{*}\! \lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, as well.

== Generalizations of the concept of number ==
Historically, the concept of [[number]] has been repeatedly generalized.  The addition of [[0 (number)|0]] to the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; was a major intellectual accomplishment in its time.  The addition of negative integers to form &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; already constituted a departure from the realm of immediate experience to the realm of mathematical models.  The further extension, the rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, is more familiar to a layperson than their completion &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, partly because the reals do not correspond to any physical reality (in the sense of measurement and computation) different from that represented by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the notion of an irrational number is meaningless to even the most powerful floating-point computer.  The necessity for such an extension stems not from physical observation but rather from the internal requirements of mathematical coherence.  The infinitesimals entered mathematical discourse at a time when such a notion was required by mathematical developments at the time, namely the emergence of what became known as the [[calculus|infinitesimal calculus]].  As already mentioned above, the mathematical justification for this latest extension was delayed by three centuries.  [[Howard Jerome Keisler|Keisler]] wrote:
:"In discussing the real line we remarked that we have no way of knowing what a line in physical space is really like. It might be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither.  However, in applications of the calculus, it is helpful to imagine a line in physical space as a hyperreal line."

The [[consistency|self-consistent]] development of the hyperreals turned out to be possible if every true [[first-order logic]] statement that uses basic arithmetic (the [[natural number]]s, plus, times, comparison) and quantifies only over the real numbers was assumed to be true in a reinterpreted form if we presume that it quantifies over hyperreal numbers. For example, we can state that for every real number there is another number greater than it:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \quad \exists y \in\mathbb{R}\quad   x &lt; y. &lt;/math&gt;

The same will then also hold for hyperreals:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in {}^\star\mathbb{R} \quad \exists y \in {}^\star\mathbb{R}\quad  x &lt; y. &lt;/math&gt;

Another example is the statement that if you add 1 to a number you get a bigger number:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \quad x &lt; x+1 &lt;/math&gt;

which will also hold for hyperreals:

: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in {}^\star\mathbb{R} \quad  x &lt; x+1. &lt;/math&gt;

The correct general statement that formulates these equivalences is called the transfer principle.  Note that, in many formulas in analysis, quantification is over higher-order objects such as functions and sets, which makes the transfer principle somewhat more subtle than the above examples suggest.

== Differences between R and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;R==

The transfer principle however doesn't mean that '''R''' and *'''R''' have identical behavior. For instance, in *'''R''' there exists an element ''&amp;omega;'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1+1&lt;\omega, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

but there is no such number in '''R'''. This is possible because the nonexistence of this number cannot be expressed as a first order statement of the above type. A hyperreal number like ''&amp;omega;'' is called infinitely large; the reciprocals of the infinitely large numbers are the infinitesimals.

The hyperreals *'''R''' form an [[ordered field]] containing the reals '''R''' as a subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a standard [[metric space]], but by virtue of their order they carry an order [[topology]].

== Constructions of the hyperreals ==

The hyperreals can be developed either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence of at least one infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an [[ultrafilter]], but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed. [[Vladimir Kanovei]] and Shelah&lt;ref name=kanovei2003&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kanovei|first1=Vladimir| last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon| title=A definable nonstandard model of the reals| url=http://shelah.logic.at/files/825.pdf| journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=69|year=2004| pages=159–164 | doi=10.2178/jsl/1080938834|arxiv=math/0311165}}&lt;/ref&gt; give a construction of a definable, countably saturated elementary extension of the structure consisting of the reals and all finitary relations on it.

In its most general form, transfer is a bounded [[elementary equivalence|elementary embedding]] between structures.

== Statement ==

The [[ordered field]] &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' of [[nonstandard real number]]s properly includes the [[real number|real]] field '''R'''.  Like all ordered fields that properly include '''R''', this field is non-Archimedean.   It means that some members ''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' are [[infinitesimal]], i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt; \underbrace{\left|x\right|+\cdots+\left|x\right|}_{n \text{ terms}} &lt; 1 \text{ for every finite cardinal number } n.&lt;/math&gt;

The only infinitesimal in ''R'' is 0.  Some other members of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''', the reciprocals ''y'' of the nonzero infinitesimals, are infinite, i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{n\text{ terms}}&lt;\left|y\right|
\text{ for every finite cardinal number } n.&lt;/math&gt;

The underlying set of the field &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' is the image of '''R''' under a mapping ''A''&amp;nbsp;{{mapsto}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' from subsets ''A'' of '''R''' to subsets of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''.  In every case

: &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq {^*\!A}, &lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if ''A'' is finite.  Sets of the form &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' for some &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,\subseteq\,\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''standard''' subsets of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''.  The standard sets belong to a much larger class of subsets of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' called '''internal''' sets.  Similarly each function

: &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

extends to a function

: &lt;math&gt; {^*\! f} : {^*\!A} \rightarrow {^*\mathbb{R}};&lt;/math&gt;

these are called '''standard functions''', and belong to the much larger class of '''internal functions'''.  Sets and functions that are not internal are '''external'''.

The importance of these concepts stems from their role in the following proposition and is illustrated by the examples that follow it.

The '''transfer principle:'''

* Suppose a proposition that is true of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' can be expressed via functions of finitely many variables (e.g. (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;{{mapsto}}&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''), relations among finitely many variables (e.g. ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''), finitary logical connectives such as '''and''', '''or''', '''not''', '''if...then...''', and the quantifiers

:: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\text{ and }\exists x\in\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

: For example, one such proposition is

:: &lt;math&gt; \forall x\in\mathbb{R} \ \exists y\in\mathbb{R} \ x+y=0.&lt;/math&gt;

: Such a proposition is true in '''R''' if and only if it is true in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' when the quantifier

:: &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in {^*\!\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;

: replaces

:: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;

: and similarly for &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;.

* Suppose a proposition otherwise expressible as simply as those considered above mentions some particular sets &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,\subseteq\,\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  Such a proposition is true in '''R''' if and only if it is true in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' with each such "''A''" replaced by the corresponding &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''A''.  Here are two examples:
:* The set
::: &lt;math&gt; [0,1]^\ast = \{\,x\in\mathbb{R}:0\leq x\leq 1\,\}^\ast&lt;/math&gt;
:: must be
::: &lt;math&gt; \{\,x \in {^*\mathbb{R}} : 0 \le x \le 1 \,\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: including not only members of '''R''' between 0 and 1 inclusive, but also members of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' between 0 and 1 that differ from those by infinitesimals.  To see this, observe that the sentence
::: &lt;math&gt; \forall x\in\mathbb{R} \ (x\in [0,1] \text{ if and only if } 0\leq x \leq 1)&lt;/math&gt;
:: is true in '''R''', and apply the transfer principle.
:* The set &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''N''' must have no upper bound in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' (since the sentence expressing the non-existence of an upper bound of '''N''' in '''R''' is simple enough for the transfer principle to apply to it) and must contain ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 if it contains ''n'', but must not contain anything between ''n'' and ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  Members of
::: &lt;math&gt; {^*\mathbb{N}} \setminus \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;
:: are "infinite integers".)
* Suppose a proposition otherwise expressible as simply as those considered above contains the quantifier
:: &lt;math&gt; \forall A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\dots\text{ or }\exists A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\dots\ .&lt;/math&gt;
: Such a proposition is true in '''R''' if and only if it is true in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' after the changes specified above and the replacement of the quantifiers with
:: &lt;math&gt; [\forall \text{ internal } A\subseteq{^*\mathbb{R}}\dots] &lt;/math&gt;
: and
:: &lt;math&gt; [\exists \text{ internal } A\subseteq{^*\mathbb{R}}\dots]\ .&lt;/math&gt;

==Three examples==
The appropriate setting for the hyperreal transfer principle is the world of ''internal'' entities.  Thus, the well-ordering property of the natural numbers by transfer yields the fact that every internal subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a least element. In this section internal sets are discussed in more detail.
* Every nonempty ''internal'' subset of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' that has an upper bound in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' has a least upper bound in &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''.  Consequently the set of all infinitesimals is external.
** The well-ordering principle implies every nonempty ''internal'' subset of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''N''' has a smallest member.  Consequently the set
::: &lt;math&gt; {^*\mathbb{N}} \setminus \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:: of all infinite integers is external.
* If ''n'' is an infinite integer, then the set {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} (which is not standard) must be internal.  To prove this, first observe that the following is trivially true:
::: &lt;math&gt; \forall n\in\mathbb{N} \ \exists A\subseteq\mathbb{N} \ \forall x\in\mathbb{N} \ [x\in A \text{ iff } x \leq n].&lt;/math&gt;
:: Consequently
::: &lt;math&gt; \forall n \in {^*\mathbb{N}} \ \exists \text{ internal } A \subseteq {^*\mathbb{N}} \ \forall x \in {^*\mathbb{N}} \ [x\in A \text{ iff } x\leq n].&lt;/math&gt;
* As with internal sets, so with internal functions: Replace
:: &lt;math&gt; \forall f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \dots &lt;/math&gt;
: with
:: &lt;math&gt; \forall\text{ internal } f: {^*\!A}\rightarrow {^*\mathbb{R}} \dots&lt;/math&gt;
: when applying the transfer principle, and similarly with &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;.
: For example: If ''n'' is an infinite integer, then the complement of the image of any internal [[one-to-one function]] ''&amp;fnof;'' from the infinite set {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} into {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3} has exactly three members by the transfer principle.  Because of the infiniteness of the domain, the complements of the images of one-to-one functions from the former set to the latter come in many sizes, but most of these functions are external.

: This last example motivates an important definition: A '''*-finite''' (pronounced '''star-finite''') subset of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' is one that can be placed in ''internal'' one-to-one correspondence with {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} for some ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''N'''.

In [[mathematics]], '''Tychonoff's theorem''' states that the product of any collection of [[compact space|compact]] [[topological space]]s is compact with respect to the [[product topology]]. The theorem is named after [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov]] (whose surname sometimes is transcribed ''Tychonoff''), who proved it first in 1930 for powers of the closed [[unit interval]] and in 1935 stated the full theorem along with the remark that its proof was the same as for the special case. The earliest known published proof is contained in a 1937 paper of [[Eduard Čech]].

Several texts identify Tychonoff's theorem as the single most important result in general topology [e.g. Willard, p.&amp;nbsp;120]; others allow it to share this honor with [[Urysohn's lemma]].

== Topological definitions ==

The theorem depends crucially upon the precise definitions of [[compact space|compactness]] and of the [[product topology]]; in fact, Tychonoff's 1935 paper defines the product topology for the first time. Conversely, part  of its importance is to give confidence that these particular definitions are the most useful (i.e. most well-behaved) ones.

Indeed, the Heine–Borel definition of compactness—that every covering of a space by open sets admits a finite subcovering—is relatively recent. More popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries was the Bolzano–Weierstrass criterion that every sequence admits a convergent subsequence, now called [[sequentially compact|sequential compactness]]. These conditions are equivalent for [[metrizable space]]s, but neither one implies the other in the class of all topological spaces.

It is almost trivial to prove that the product of two sequentially compact spaces is sequentially compact—one passes to a subsequence for the first component and then a subsubsequence for the second component. An only slightly more elaborate "diagonalization" argument establishes the sequential compactness of a countable product of sequentially compact spaces. However, the product of [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] many copies of the closed unit interval (with its usual topology) fails to be sequentially compact with respect to the product topology, even though it is compact by Tychonoff's theorem (e.g., see {{harvnb|Wilansky|1970|page=134}}).

This is a critical failure: if ''X'' is a [[completely regular]] [[Hausdorff space]], there is a natural embedding from ''X'' into [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''C''(''X'',[0,1])&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''C''(''X'',[0,1]) is the set of continuous maps from ''X'' to [0,1]. The compactness of [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''C''(''X'',[0,1])&lt;/sup&gt; thus shows that every completely regular Hausdorff space embeds in a compact Hausdorff space (or, can be "compactified".) This construction is the [[Stone–Čech compactification]]. Conversely, all subspaces of compact Hausdorff spaces are completely regular Hausdorff, so this characterizes the completely regular Hausdorff spaces as those that can be compactified. Such spaces are now called [[Tychonoff space]]s.

== Applications ==

Tychonoff's theorem has been used to prove many other mathematical theorems. These include theorems about compactness of certain spaces such as the [[Banach–Alaoglu theorem]] on the weak-* compactness of the unit ball of the [[dual space]] of a [[normed vector space]], and the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] characterizing the sequences of functions in which every subsequence has a [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] subsequence. They also include statements less obviously related to compactness, such as the [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (graph theory)|De Bruijn–Erdős theorem]] stating that every [[critical graph|minimal ''k''-chromatic graph]] is finite, and the [[Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem]] providing a topological characterization of [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]].

As a rule of thumb, any sort of construction that takes as input a fairly general object (often of an algebraic, or topological-algebraic nature) and outputs a compact space is likely to use Tychonoff: e.g., the [[Gelfand representation|Gelfand space]] of maximal ideals of a commutative [[C* algebra]], the [[Stone space]] of maximal ideals of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and the [[Berkovich spectrum]] of a commutative [[Banach ring]].

== Proofs of Tychonoff's theorem ==

1) Tychonoff's 1930 proof used the concept of a [[complete accumulation point]].

2) The theorem is a quick corollary of the [[Alexander subbase theorem]].

More modern proofs have been motivated by the following considerations: the approach to compactness via convergence of subsequences leads to a simple and transparent proof in the case of countable index sets. However, the approach to convergence in a topological space using sequences is sufficient when the space satisfies the first axiom of countability (as metrizable spaces do), but generally not otherwise. However, the product of uncountably many metrizable spaces, each with at least two points, fails to be first countable. So it is natural to hope that a suitable notion of convergence in arbitrary spaces will lead to a compactness criterion generalizing sequential compactness in metrizable spaces that will be as easily applied to deduce the compactness of products. This has turned out to be the case.

3) The theory of convergence via filters, due to [[Henri Cartan]] and developed by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] in 1937, leads to the following criterion: assuming the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a space is compact if and only if each [[ultrafilter]] on the space converges. With this in hand, the proof becomes easy: the (filter generated by the) image of an ultrafilter on the product space under any projection map is an ultrafilter on the factor space, which therefore converges, to at least one ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. One then shows that the original ultrafilter converges to ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''). In his textbook, [[James Munkres|Munkres]] gives a reworking of the Cartan–Bourbaki proof that does not explicitly use any filter-theoretic language or preliminaries.

4) Similarly, the [[Moore-Smith sequence|Moore–Smith]] theory of convergence via nets, as supplemented by Kelley's notion of a [[Net (mathematics)|universal net]], leads to the criterion that a space is compact if and only if each universal net on the space converges. This criterion leads to a proof (Kelley, 1950) of Tychonoff's theorem, which is, word for word, identical to the Cartan/Bourbaki proof using filters, save for the repeated substitution of "universal net" for "ultrafilter base".

5) A proof using nets but not universal nets was given in 1992 by Paul Chernoff.

== Tychonoff's theorem and the axiom of choice ==

All of the above proofs use the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) in some way. For instance, the third proof uses that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter (i.e., a maximal filter), and this is seen by invoking [[Zorn's lemma]]. Zorn's lemma is also used to prove Kelley's theorem, that every net has a universal subnet. In fact these uses of AC are essential: in 1950 Kelley proved that Tychonoff's theorem implies the axiom of choice in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|'''ZF''']]. Note that one formulation of AC is that the Cartesian product of a family of nonempty sets is nonempty; but since the empty set is most certainly compact, the proof cannot proceed along such straightforward lines. Thus Tychonoff's theorem joins several other basic theorems (e.g. that every nonzero vector space has a basis) in being ''equivalent'' to AC.

On the other hand, the statement that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter does not imply AC. Indeed, it is not hard to see that it is equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] (BPI), a well-known intermediate point between the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and the ZF theory augmented by the axiom of choice (ZFC). A first glance at the second proof of Tychnoff may suggest that the proof uses no more than (BPI), in contradiction to the above. However, the spaces in which every convergent filter has a unique limit are precisely the Hausdorff spaces. In general we must select, for each element of the index set, an element of the nonempty set of limits of the projected ultrafilter base, and of course this uses AC. However, it also shows that the compactness of the product of compact Hausdorff spaces can be proved using (BPI), and in fact the converse also holds. Studying the ''strength'' of Tychonoff's theorem for various restricted classes of spaces is an active area in [[set-theoretic topology]].

The analogue of Tychonoff's theorem in [[pointless topology]] does not require any form of the axiom of choice.

== Proof of the axiom of choice from Tychonoff's theorem ==

To prove that Tychonoff's theorem in its general version implies the axiom of choice, we establish that every infinite [[cartesian product]] of non-empty sets is nonempty. The trickiest part of the proof is introducing the right topology. The right topology, as it turns out, is the [[cofinite topology]] with a small twist. It turns out that every set given this topology automatically becomes a compact space. Once we have this fact, Tychonoff's theorem can be applied; we then use the [[finite intersection property]] (FIP) definition of compactness. The proof itself (due to [[J. L. Kelley]]) follows:

Let {''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''} be an indexed family of nonempty sets, for ''i'' ranging in ''I'' (where ''I'' is an arbitrary indexing set). We wish to show that the cartesian product of these sets is nonempty. Now, for each ''i'', take ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the index ''i'' itself tacked on (renaming the indices using the [[disjoint union]] if necessary, we may assume that ''i'' is not a member of ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', so simply take ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∪ {''i''}).

Now define the cartesian product

:&lt;math&gt;X = \prod_{i \in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;

along with the natural projection maps ''π&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' which take a member of ''X'' to its ''i''th term.

We give each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' the topology whose open sets are the cofinite subsets of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', plus the empty set (the cofinite topology) ''and'' the singleton {''i''}.
This makes ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' compact, and by Tychonoff's theorem, ''X'' is also compact (in the product topology). The projection maps are continuous; all the ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''s are closed, being complements of the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] open set {''i''} in ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. So the inverse images π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') are closed subsets of ''X''. We note that

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} A_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} \pi_i^{-1}(A_i) &lt;/math&gt;

and prove that these inverse images are nonempty and have the FIP. Let ''i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''i&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' be a finite collection of indices in ''I''. Then the ''finite'' product ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' × ... × ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''
is non-empty (only finitely many choices here, so AC is not needed); it merely consists of ''N''-tuples. Let  ''a'' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') be such an ''N''-tuple. We extend ''a'' to the whole index set: take ''a'' to the function ''f'' defined by ''f''(''j'') = ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' if ''j'' = ''i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''f''(''j'') = ''j'' otherwise. ''This step is where the addition of the extra point to each space is crucial'', for it allows us to define ''f'' for everything outside of the ''N''-tuple in a precise way without choices (we can already choose, by construction, ''j'' from ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ). π''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''(''f'') = ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is obviously an element of each ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' so that ''f'' is in each inverse image; thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{k = 1}^N \pi_{i_k}^{-1}(A_{i_k}) \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

By the FIP definition of compactness, the entire intersection over ''I'' must be nonempty, and the proof is complete.

In the case of [[simply typed lambda calculus]], a type has an inhabitant if and only if its [[Curry-Howard|corresponding]] proposition is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] of minimal implicative logic.

A '''vanishing point''' is a [[point (geometry)|point]] on the [[projection plane|image plane]] of a [[graphical perspective|perspective drawing]] where the two-dimensional [[perspective projection]]s (or drawings) of mutually [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines in three-dimensional space appear to converge.  When the set of parallel lines is [[perpendicular]] to a [[picture plane]], the construction is known as one-point perspective, and their vanishing point corresponds to the [[station point|oculus]], or "eye point", from which the image should be viewed for correct perspective geometry.&lt;ref name=KA&gt;[[Kirsti Andersen]] (2007) ''Geometry of an Art'', p. xxx, Springer, {{ISBN|0-387-25961-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional linear drawings use objects with one to three sets of parallels, defining one to three vanishing points.{{Views}}

== Vector notation ==

[[File:Vanishing Point.jpg|thumb|A 2D construction of perspective viewing, showing the formation of a vanishing point|left]]

The vanishing point may also be referred to as the "direction point", as lines having the same directional vector, say ''D'', will have the same vanishing point. Mathematically, let {{math|''q'' ≡ (''x'', ''y'', ''f'')}} be a point lying on the image plane, where {{mvar|f}} is the focal length (of the camera associated with the image), and let {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ({{sfrac|''x''|''h''}}, {{sfrac|''y''|''h''}}, {{sfrac|''f''|''h''}})}} be the unit vector associated with {{math|''q''}}, where {{math|''h'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''f''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. If we consider a straight line in space {{math|''S''}} with the unit vector {{math|'''n'''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ (''n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''n&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''n&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} and its vanishing point {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the unit vector associated with {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to  {{math|'''n'''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, assuming both are assumed to point towards the image plane.&lt;ref name="Using Vanishing Points"&gt;B. Caprile, V. Torre [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00127813] "Using Vanishing Points for Camera Calibration", International Journal of Computer Vision, Volume 4, Issue 2, pp. 127-139, March 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

When the image plane is parallel to two world-coordinate axes, lines parallel to the axis which is cut by this image plane will have images that meet at a single vanishing point. Lines parallel to the other two axes will not form vanishing points as they are parallel to the image plane. This is one-point perspective. Similarly, when the image plane intersects two world-coordinate axes, lines parallel to those planes will meet form two vanishing points in the picture plane. This is called two-point perspective. In three-point perspective the image plane intersects the {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} axes and therefore lines parallel to these axes intersect, resulting in three different vanishing points.

==Theorem==
The '''vanishing point theorem''' is the principal theorem in the science of perspective. It says that the image in a picture plane {{math|''π''}} of a line {{math|''L''}} in space, not parallel to the picture, is determined by its [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] with {{math|''π''}} and its vanishing point. Some authors have used the phrase, "the image of a line includes its vanishing point". [[Guidobaldo del Monte]] gave several verifications, and [[Humphry Ditton]] called the result the "main and Great Proposition".&lt;ref&gt;H. Ditton (1712) ''Treatise on Perspective'', p 45&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brook Taylor]] wrote the first book in English on perspective in 1714, which introduced the term "vanishing point" and was the first to fully explain the geometry of multipoint perspective, and historian [[Kirsti Andersen]] compiled these observations.&lt;ref name=KA/&gt;{{rp|244–6}} She notes, in terms of [[projective geometry]], the vanishing point is the image of the [[point at infinity]] associated with {{math|''L''}}, as the [[sightline]] from {{math|''O''}} through the vanishing point is parallel to {{math|''L''}}.

==Vanishing line==
As a vanishing point originates in a line, so a vanishing line originates in a plane {{math|''α''}} that is not parallel to the picture {{math|''π''}}.  Given the eye point {{math|''O''}}, and {{math|''β''}} the plane parallel to {{math|''α''}} and lying on {{math|''O''}}, then the '''vanishing line of {{math|''α''}}''' is {{math|''β'' ∩ ''π''}}. For example, when {{math|''α''}} is the ground plane and {{math|''β''}} is the horizon plane, then the vanishing line of {{math|''α''}} is the [[horizon|horizon line]] {{math|''β'' ∩ ''π''}}. Anderson notes, "Only one particular vanishing line occurs, often referred to as the "horizon".&lt;ref name=KA/&gt;{{rp|249, 503–6}}

To put it simply, the vanishing line of some plane, say {{math|''α''}}, is obtained by the intersection of the image plane with another plane, say {{math|''β''}}, parallel to the plane of interest ({{math|''α''}}), passing through the camera center. For different sets of lines parallel to this plane {{math|''α''}}, their respective vanishing points will lie on this vanishing line. The horizon line is a theoretical line that represents the eye level of the observer. If the object is below the horizon line, its vanishing lines angle up to the horizon line. If the object is above, they slope down. All vanishing lines end at the horizon line.

Projections of two sets of parallel lines lying in some plane {{math|''π&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}} appear to converge, i.e. the vanishing point associated with that pair,  on a horizon line, or vanishing line {{math|''H''}} formed by the intersection of the image plane with the plane parallel to {{math|''π&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and passing through the pinhole. 
Proof: Consider the ground plane {{math|''π''}}, as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''c''}} which is, for the sake of simplicity, orthogonal to the image plane. Also, consider a line {{math|''L''}} that lies in the plane {{math|''π''}}, which is defined by the equation {{math|''ax'' + ''bz'' {{=}} d}}.
Using perspective pinhole projections, a point on {{math|''L''}} projected on the image plane will have coordinates defined as,
:{{math|''x′'' {{=}} ''f''·{{sfrac|''x''|''z''}} {{=}} ''f''·{{sfrac|''d'' − ''bz''|''az''}}}}
:{{math|''y′'' {{=}} ''f''·{{sfrac|''y''|''z''}} {{=}} ''f''·{{sfrac|''c''|''z''}}}}
This is the parametric representation of the image {{math|''L′''}} of the line {{math|''L''}} with {{math|''z''}} as the parameter. When {{math|''z'' → −∞}} it stops at the point {{math|(''x′'',''y′'') {{=}} (−{{sfrac|''fb''|''a''}},0)}} on the {{math|''x′''}} axis of the image plane. This is the vanishing point corresponding to all parallel lines with slope {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} in the plane {{math|''π''}}. All vanishing points associated with different lines with different slopes belonging to plane {{math|''π''}} will lie on the {{math|''x′''}} axis, which in this case is the horizon line.

2. Let {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} be three mutually orthogonal straight lines in space and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ (''x&lt;sub&gt;A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f'')}}, {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ (''x&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f'')}}, {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ (''x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f'')}} be the three corresponding vanishing points respectively. If we know the coordinates of one of these points, say {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the direction of a straight line on the image plane, which passes through a second point, say {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, we can compute the coordinates of both {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;}} &lt;ref name="Using Vanishing Points " /&gt;

3. Let {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} be three mutually orthogonal straight lines in space and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ (''x&lt;sub&gt;A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f'')}}, {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ (''x&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f'')}}, {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ (''x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f'')}} be the three corresponding vanishing points respectively. The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices in the three vanishing points is the intersection of the optical axis and the image plane.&lt;ref name="Using Vanishing Points " /&gt;

==Curvilinear and reverse perspective==
A [[curvilinear perspective]] is a drawing with either 4 or 5 vanishing points. In 5-point perspective the vanishing points are mapped into a circle with 4 vanishing points at the cardinal headings N, W, S, E and one at the circle's origin.

A [[reverse perspective]] is a drawing with vanishing points that are placed outside the painting with the illusion that they are "in front of" the painting.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Detection of vanishing points==

Several methods for vanishing point detection make use of the line segments detected in images. Other techniques involve considering the intensity gradients of the image pixels directly.

There are significantly large numbers of vanishing points present in an image. Therefore, the aim is to detect the vanishing points that correspond to the principal directions of a scene. This is generally achieved in two steps. The first step, called the accumulation step, as the name suggests, clusters the line segments with the assumption that a cluster will share a common vanishing point. The next step finds the principal clusters present in the scene and therefore it is called the search step.

In the '''accumulation step''', the image is mapped onto a bounded space called the accumulator space. The accumulator space is partitioned into units called cells. Barnard &lt;ref&gt;S.T. Barnard 'Interpreting Perspective Images", Artificial Intelligence 21, 1983, pp. 435 - 462&lt;/ref&gt; assumed this space to be a [[Gaussian_surface#Spherical_surface|Gaussian sphere]] centered on the optical center of the camera as an accumulator space. A line segment on the image corresponds to a great circle on this sphere, and the vanishing point in the image is mapped to a point. The Gaussian sphere has accumulator cells that increase when a great circle passes through them, i.e. in the image a line segment intersects the vanishing point. Several modifications have been made since, but one of the most efficient techniques was using the Hough Transform, mapping the parameters of the line segment to the bounded space. Cascaded Hough Transforms have been applied for multiple vanishing points.

The process of mapping from the image to the bounded spaces causes the loss of the actual distances between line segments and points.

In the '''search step''', the accumulator cell with the maximum number of line segments passing through it is found. This is followed by removal of those line segments, and the search step is repeated until this count goes below a certain threshold. As more computing power is now available, points corresponding to two or three mutually orthogonal directions can be found.

==Applications of vanishing points==
{{cross_ratio_metrology_example.svg}}
# Camera calibration: The vanishing points of an image contain important information for camera calibration. Various calibration techniques have been introduced using the properties of vanishing points to find intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters.&lt;ref name="Metric Rectification "&gt;D. Liebowitz and A. Zisserman  "Metric Rectification for perspective images of planes" ,IEEE Conf. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, June 1998, Santa Barbara, CA, pp. 482 -488&lt;/ref&gt;
# 3D reconstruction: A man-made environment has two main characteristics – several lines in the scene are parallel, and a number of edges present are orthogonal. Vanishing points aid in comprehending the environment. Using sets of parallel lines in the plane, the orientation of the plane can be calculated using vanishing points. Torre &lt;ref&gt;R.T. Collins, and R. Weiss "Vanishing Point Calculation as a Statistical Inference on the Unit Sphere" Proceedings of ICCV3, December, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and Coelho   &lt;ref&gt;C. Coelho, M. Straforani, M. Campani " Using Geometrical Rules and a priori Knowledge for the Understanding of Indoor Scenes" Proceedings BMVC90, p.229-234 Oxford, September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; performed extensive investigation in the use of vanishing points to implement a full system. With the assumption that the environment consists of objects with only parallel or perpendicular sides, also called Lego-land, using vanishing points constructed in a single image of the scene they recovered the 3D geometry of the scene. Similar ideas are also used in the field of robotics, mainly in navigation and autonomous vehicles, and in areas concerned with object detection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">In mathematics, a '''vertex cycle cover''' (commonly called simply '''cycle cover''') of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' is a set of [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s which are [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraphs]] of ''G'' and contain all vertices of ''G''. 

If the cycles of the cover have no vertices in common, the cover is called '''vertex-disjoint''' or sometimes simply '''disjoint cycle cover'''. In this case the set of the cycles constitutes a [[spanning subgraph]] of ''G''. A disjoint cycle cover of an undirected graph (if it exists) can be found in [[polynomial time]] by transforming the problem into a problem of finding a [[perfect matching]] in a larger graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[David Eppstein]]|url=https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/8570|title=Partition a graph into node-disjoint cycles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

If the cycles of the cover have no edges in common, the cover is called '''edge-disjoint''' or simply '''disjoint cycle cover'''.

Similar definitions exist for [[Directed graph|digraphs]], in terms of directed cycles. Finding a vertex-disjoint cycle cover of a directed graph can also be performed in [[polynomial time]] by a similar reduction to [[perfect matching]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f13/recitation/rec1016.txt (problem 1)&lt;/ref&gt;. However, adding the condition that each cycle should have length at least 3 makes the problem [[NP-hard]]&lt;ref&gt;Garey and Johnson, [[Computers and intractability]], GT13&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Properties and applications==

===Permanent===
The [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] of a [[(0,1)-matrix]] is equal to the number of vertex-disjoint cycle covers of a [[directed graph]] with this [[adjacency matrix]]. This fact is used in a simplified proof showing that computing the permanent is [[sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Dor, Amir and Halevi, Shai. (1993). "[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/ben-dor95zeroone.html Zero-one permanent is ''#P''-complete, a simpler proof]". ''Proceedings of the 2nd Israel Symposium on the Theory and Computing Systems'', 108-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimal disjoint cycle covers===
The problems of finding a vertex disjoint and edge disjoint cycle covers with minimal number of cycles are [[NP-complete]]. The problems are not in [[complexity class]] [[APX]]. The variants for digraphs are not in APX either.&lt;ref&gt;''Complexity and Approximation: Combinatorial Optimization Problems and Their Approximability Properties'' (1999) {{ISBN|3-540-65431-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yxxw90d9AuMC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;lpg=PA378&amp;dq=%22MINIMUM+VERTEX+DISJOINT+CYCLE+COVER%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=WFlivBK1UQ&amp;sig=3WsL9wDKdf3FvvahLzXvwthBZJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA379,M1 p.378, 379], citing {{citation

'''ZetaGrid''' was at one time the largest [[distributed computing]] project designed to explore [[Root of a function|root]]s of the [[Riemann zeta function]], checking over one billion roots a day.

Roots of the zeta function are of particular interest in mathematics, since the presence of even a single one that is out of line with the rest would disprove the [[Riemann hypothesis]], with far-reaching consequences for all of mathematics. So far, every single one of them has failed to provide a counterexample to the Riemann hypothesis.

The project ended in November 2005 due to instability of hosting provider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-dc.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10430 Zeta Finished - Free-DC Forum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over  10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; first zeroes were checked.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Pegg Jr. [http://www.mathpuzzle.com/MAA/28-Ten%20Trillion%20Zeta%20Zeroes/mathgames_10_18_04.html ''«Ten Trillion Zeta Zeros»'']&lt;/ref&gt; After the results have been analyzed, the project administrator has stated that they will be posted on the [[American Mathematical Society]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/ Mathematics of Computation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
