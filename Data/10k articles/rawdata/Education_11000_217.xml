The '''70:20:10 Model for Learning and Development''' (also written as 70-20-10 or 70/20/10) is a [[Training and development|learning and development]] model that corresponds to a proportional breakdown of how people learn effectively; based on a survey asking nearly 200 executives to self-report how they believed they learned.&lt;ref name="Lombardo"&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Lombardo|first1= Michael M|last2= Eichinger|first2= Robert W|title= The Career Architect Development Planner|year= 1996|edition= 1st|location= Minneapolis|publisher= Lominger|page= iv
|isbn= 0-9655712-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this survey respondents reported the following learning tendencies:

* 70% from challenging assignments 
* 20% from developmental relationships 
* 10% from coursework and training 
Lombardo and Eichinger expressed their rationale behind the 70:20:10 model this way in ''The Career Architect Development Planner'':&lt;ref name=Lombardo /&gt;

''“Development generally begins with a realization of current or future need and the motivation to do something about it. This might come from feedback, a mistake, watching other people’s reactions, failing or not being up to a task – in other words, from experience. The odds are that development will be about 70% from on-the-job experiences - working on tasks and problems; about 20% from feedback and working around good and bad examples of the need; and 10% from courses and reading.”''

== Criticisms ==

Criticisms of the hypothesis include:
* A lack of empirical supporting data &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deakinprime.com/media/47821/002978_dpw_70-20-10wp_v01_fa.pdf|title=Demystifying 70:20:10|last2=Valerie|first2=Madsen|date=|website=Deakin Prime|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=Kajewski|first1=Kelly|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The use of perfectly even numbers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thalheimer|first1=Will|title=People remember 10%, 20%...Oh Really?|url=http://www.willatworklearning.com/2006/05/people_remember.html|website=Will At Work Learning|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The nature of the survey (i.e. Asking already successful managers to reflect on their experiences.) &lt;ref name=Jefferson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jefferson|first1=Andrew|last2=Roy|first2=Pollock|title=70:20:10: Where Is the Evidence?|url=https://www.td.org/Publications/Blogs/Science-of-Learning-Blog/2014/07/70-20-10-Where-Is-the-Evidence|website=Association for Talent Development|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The model may not reflect the changes in the market instigated by online technologies. For example, it does not reflect the recent focus on informal learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trainingindustry.com/wiki/entries/the-702010-model-for-learning-and-development.aspx|title=The 70:20:10 Model for Learning and Development {{!}} Training Industry|last=|first=|date=2017-09-28|website=www.trainingindustry.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 70:20:10 model is not prescriptive. Author and learning &amp; development professional Andy Jefferson asserts it "is neither a scientific fact nor a recipe for how best to develop people." &lt;ref name=Jefferson /&gt;

'''Additional Mathematics''' is a [[UK]] qualification [[pilot scheme]] in its final year of [[implementation]] for a [[GCSE]] level qualification in [[mathematics]] which is applied to a range of problems set out in a different format to the standard Mathematics GCSE. This has been formed because of the standard [[secondary schools]] in [[England]] offering two GCSE qualifications in [[Science]] and [[English language|English]] but only one in Mathematics and as Mathematics is also a core [[Course (education)|subject]] it needs to be viewed on the same level as the other two core subjects (Science and English.)

== Additional Mathematics in Singapore ==
In Singapore, Additional Mathematics is an optional subject offered to pupils in Secondary School who have an aptitude in Mathematics and are in Normal (Academic) stream or Express stream. The syllabus covered is slightly more in depth as compared to Mathematics. Additional Mathematics is also a prerequisite for students who are intending to offer H2 Mathematics and [[Further Mathematics|H2 Further Mathematics]] at [[Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] if they choose to enter a [[Junior college (Singapore)|Junior college]] after Secondary School. Students without Additional Mathematics at the 'O' level will usually offer H1 Mathematics instead.  

Format for Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate Education (GCE) Ordinary Level (Express stream Additional Mathematics paper) is as follows:

Paper 1 (Duration 2 Hours)
A variety of compulsory questions are being set, with a mark weighting from 1 Mark to maximum mark of 7. The total weighting of the paper is 80 marks and constitutes to 44% of the O Level Additional Mathematics grade.  

Paper 2 (Duration 2 Hours 30 Minutes)
A variety of compulsory questions are set. One of the questions would be a plotting question where one is required to plot a given graph on to a piece of graph paper. This can be either tested in Paper 1 or Paper 2. The total weighting of the paper is 100 marks and  constitutes to 56% of the O Level Additional Mathematics grade.

A variety of topics are tested - Differentiation,  Integration, Advanced Trigonometry, Binomial Expansion, Surds, Indices, Plane Geometry and many more.

==GCSE Additional Mathematics in Northern Ireland==
In [[Northern Ireland]], Additional Mathematics was offered as a GCSE subject by the local examination board, CCEA. There were two examination papers: one which tested topics in Pure Mathematics and one which tested topics in Mechanics and Statistics. It was discontinued in 2014 and replaced with GCSE Further Mathematics.

==Further Pure Maths IGCSE==
Starting from 2012, Edexcel and AQA have started a new course, now that Additional Maths has been abolished, which is an IGCSE in Further Maths. Edexcel and AQA both offer completely different courses, Edexcel including the calculation of solids formed through integration, AQA not touching on integration. AQA's syllabus mainly offers further algebra, with the factor theorem and more complex algebra such as algebraic fractions as well as differentiation up to and including the calculation of normals to a curve. AQA's syllabus also includes a lot of matrices work, which is an AS Further Mathematics topic. AQA's syllabus is much more famous than Edexcel's, mainly for its controversial decision to award an A* with Distinction(A^), a grade higher than the maximum possible grade in any Level 2 qualification; it is known colloquially as a Super A* or A**.

==Additional Mathematics in Malaysia==
In [[Malaysia]], Additional Mathematics is offered as an elective to upper secondary students studying within the [[Education in Malaysia|public education system]]. This subject is included in the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]] examination.
Science stream students are required to apply Additional Mathematics as one of the subjects in the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]] examination. Additional Mathematics is an optional subject for students who are from arts or commerce streams. Additional Mathematics in Malaysia which is commonly known as Add Maths covers various topics including function, differentiation, integration, indices and logarithms, statistics, index numbers, trigonometric functions, solution of triangles, linear programming, permutations and combinations, linear law, vectors, quadratic equation and function, simultaneous equation, geometry coordinate, circular measure, progression, probability and probability distribution, and motion along a straight line.

Format for Additional Mathematics Exam based on the Malaysia Certificate of Education is as follows:

Paper 1 (Duration 2 Hours) A total of 25 questions tested based on the student's knowledge to grasp on the concepts and formulas learned during their 2 years of learning. Each questions contains at least 2 subsets of questions with marks ranging from 2 - 5 marks.The total weighting of the paper is 80 marks and constitutes to 44% of the grade. 

Paper 2 (Duration 2 hours 30 minutes) Questions are categorised into 3 sections: A, B and C. Section A contains 6 questions that are compulsory to be answered. Section B contains 5 questions which students are given the choice to answer 4 questions out of 5 of them. Section C contains 4 questions where students are only required to answer 2 out of 4 of the given questions. This paper tests the student's ability to apply various concepts and formulas in real-life situations.The total weighting of the paper is 100 marks and constitutes to 56% of the grade.

==Additional Mathematics in Mauritius==
In [[Mauritius]], Additional Mathematics, more commonly referred to as Add Maths, is offered  in secondary school as an optional subject in the Arts Streams and it is a compulsory subject in the Science, Technical and Economics Stream. This subject is included in the [[University of Cambridge International Examinations]].
Topics that are covered in the Additional Mathematics syllabus include [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[quadratic equation]]s, [[Derivative|differentiation]] and [[Integral|integration]] ([[calculus]]).

==Additional Mathematics in Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]], the syllabus of HKCEE additional mathematics covered two main topics, algebra and calculus. In [[algebra]], some topics are [[mathematical induction]], [[binomial theorem]], [[trigonometry]], [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]. In [[calculus]], [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]], [[integral|integration]], and 2D-[[vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]]. After the replacement of the new syllabus, i.e. the module 2 of mathematics, some new topics are added: [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and [[determinant]], and an introduction to the [[Euler's number]].

==Secretary of State==
[[File:Alex Padilla official.jpg|thumb|upright|Padilla's first SOS photo]]
California places a two-term limit on its constitutional officers, and incumbent [[Debra Bowen]], a fellow Democrat, was unable to run for reelection to the position of Secretary of State, the state's top elections official. On April 11, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/11/local/la-me-pc-padilla-candidate-20130411 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Patrick |last=McGreevy |title=Sen.

This was the world's first International Clean Ganga Program held outside India to educate NRI's about the importance of river Ganga and its cleanliness drive. In 2016 itself she has performed Ganga Avatran in Varanasi, lucknow and Kanpur and won hearts of many audiences. Shri [[Uma Bharti]] (Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation) has appreciated Arushi's efforts to educate people about importance of Ganga. Shri [[Sushma Swaraj]] (Minister of External Affairs) has also appreciated Arushi for her contribution to this noble cause.

'''Sparsh Ganga Campaign''' 
Arushi is also an active promoter of her own "Sparsh Ganga Campaign ". This Campaign was started in 2009 by her father Dr Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank to promote awareness among people to save and clean River Ganga. Today thousand of people are connected with this campaign to promote Ganga awareness. Recently Govt of India  recognized volunteers of Sparsh Ganga Campaign as "Ganga Heroes".&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.livehindustan.com/uttarakhand/roorki/story-need-to-plant-trees-to-save-human-life-arushi-2057783.html]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[ http://www.chauthakhambhanews.com/स्पर्श-गंगा-के-कार्यकर्त/]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg74JBZVfTM] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42426">'''AuthorAID''' is the name given to a number of initiatives that provide support to researchers from developing countries in preparing academic articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Phyllis Freeman and [http://www.tufts.edu/med/phfm/faculty/robbins-anthony.htm Anthony Robbins], co-editors of the ''[http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jphp/index.html Journal of Public Health Policy (JPHP)]'', first suggested the name and concept in 2004 and published "Closing the ‘publishing gap’ between rich and poor" about AuthorAID on the [[Science and Development Network]] (SciDev.Net),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/] Science and Development Network&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman P, Robbins A.

Development aid programs of international organizations, industrial countries, and charitable foundations have invested in strengthening research capacity in developing countries to help those countries solve their own problems. Scientists from developing countries, however, remain under-represented as authors in the published scientific literature.&lt;ref name=Paraje05&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paraje G, Sadana R, Karam G |title=Public health.

== The publishing gap ==
{{split|The publishing gap|date=November 2016}}

Scientific research is conducted all over the world, and increasingly in developing countries. In an effort to help countries solve problems and speed development, development aid has been invested in research capacity, notably by Sweden&lt;ref name="sida.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sida.se/sida/jsp/sida.jsp?d%3D121%26a%3D1521%26language%3Den_US |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427103542/http://www.sida.se/sida/jsp/sida.jsp?d=121&amp;a=1521&amp;language=en_US |archivedate=2008-04-27 |df= }} Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-1-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313024911/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-1-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |archivedate=2008-03-13 }} International Development Research Centre&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this research must be available through publication to be useful in economic development and to other researchers. Yet only an extremely small fraction of the scientific literature is written by developing world authors, even in fields such as health and environmental studies, where it is universally recognized that the world’s dominant problems manifest themselves in developing regions.&lt;ref name=Paraje05/&gt;

An analysis, published in ''Science'' in 2005, of 4061 health-related journals from 1992 to 2001 showed a growing gap in scientific publications between low-income countries and the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Paraje05/&gt; Similarly, Athula Sumathipala and her colleagues found under-representation of developing world authors in leading medical journals such as the ''BMJ'', ''Lancet'', ''New England Journal of Medicine'', ''Annals of Internal Medicine'', and ''JAMA'', in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sumathipala A, Siribaddana S, Patel V |title=Under-representation of developing countries in the research literature: ethical issues arising from a survey of five leading medical journals |journal=BMC Med Ethics |volume=5 |pages=E5 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15461820 |pmc=524359 |doi=10.1186/1472-6939-5-5 |url=http://biomedicentral.com/1472-6939/5/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes of under-representation ===

There is no single cause of the under-representation of developing world authors. Bias exists on the part of both editors and reviewers who choose what to publish. Frank Gannon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embo.org/about_embo/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513040407/http://www.embo.org/about_embo/bio.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }} Frank Gannon&lt;/ref&gt; writing as the editor of ''EMBO Reports'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/embor/index.html] ''EMBO Reports''&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out one worrisome source of bias against researchers from developing countries. He suggested that editors and reviewers discriminate "by judging colleagues on their work address" noting that "[t]he address of the first or last authors is not always a neutral piece of information when assessing a paper."&lt;ref&gt;Gannon F. [http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n5/full/7400972.html Address bias (editorial).] ''EMBO Reports'' 2007; 8(5):421. Accessed 22 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in publication priorities between developed and developing countries are not always a sign of bias. The editors of a guide to publishing in the addiction sciences noted that "US research is primarily (and legitimately) oriented towards that country’s own social and economic priorities, which do not necessarily apply to cultures in the developing world. The problem of US dominance is thus not only one of maldistribution of opportunity."&lt;ref name="parint.org"&gt;Barbor TF, Stenius K, Savva S (editors). [http://www.parint.org/isajewebsite/isajebook/isajewebbook.htm Publishing addiction science: a guide for the perplexed.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511181214/http://www.parint.org/isajewebsite/isajebook/isajewebbook.htm |date=May 11, 2008 }} International Society of Addiction Journal Editors/World Health Organization. Accessed 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers, analyzing the issues of science information transfer from a sociolinguistic and sociopolitical standpoint, consider this cultural dominance to reflect an "Anglo-American English language hegemony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aalbers MB |title=Creative destruction through the Anglo-American hegemony: a non-Anglo-American view on publications, referees and language |journal=Area |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=319–22 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.0004-0894.2004.00229.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is further compounded by variations in the quality of the feedback peer reviewers are able to provide about the language and writing, since this advice does not always help to make the writing better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guyatt GH, Brian Haynes R |title=Preparing reports for publication and responding to reviewers' comments |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=900–6 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16895811 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2006.05.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shashok K |title=Content and communication: How can peer review provide helpful feedback about the writing? |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=8|pages=3 |year=2008 |pmid=18237378 |pmc=2268697 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-8-3 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/8/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in English, overwhelmingly the language of scientific publication, constitutes a problem that can make it difficult for non-native English speakers (NNS) to "compete on an equal research basis."&lt;ref name=Gosden92&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gosden H |title=Research writing and NNSs: from the Editors |journal=Journal of Second Language Writing |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=123–39 |year=1992 |doi=10.1016/1060-3743(92)90012-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s Gosden surveyed editors if biology, chemistry and physics journals to identify aspects of manuscripts "which may seriously detract attention from judgment of a paper’s essential merits." He found that journal editors reported several problems encountered by NNS researchers, including inadequate knowledge of the unwritten "rules of the publication game" (for instance, failure to cite sufficient references to earlier research and unfamiliarity with the argumentation style or scientific level of the journal.)&lt;ref name=Gosden92/&gt;

The editors of the addiction sciences publishing guide mentioned above noted that international publishing requires technical skill to follow the instructions to authors, and is "an acquired competence in social communication."&lt;ref name="parint.org"/&gt; They warned that "if the formalities are not followed, even a study containing strong and original findings might immediately be turned down." One potential obstacle to acceptance is that "many English-speaking editors and reviewers (in the same way as many French, German, or Swedish speaking editors) will have a rather strict idea of what constitutes good language."&lt;ref name="parint.org"/&gt;

=== The problem as encountered by authors ===

Freeman and Robbins, when developing the AuthorAID concept, summarized what they learned about the problems faced by authors in developing countries as: 
* Uncertainty about which journals may be suitable for a submission
* Unfamiliarity with editorial conventions
* Persistent pressure to write in English
* Conflicts with collaborators about authorship and author order
* Lack of scientific and statistical tools to analyze data as required by journals
* Editors’ and publishers’ inattention to development problems and developing country topics.&lt;ref name=Freeman06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman P, Robbins A |title=The publishing gap between rich and poor: the focus of AuthorAID |journal=J Public Health Policy |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=196–203 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16961198 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jphp.3200071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editors and other research publication experts might help researchers overcome linguistic challenges and cultural differences, and help them understand the procedural, ethical, and technical intricacies of academic publication. Freeman and Robbins reported that in developing world research institutions there are simply too few editor/scientist mentors (well-published authors or experienced editors) available to assist in disseminating the work of emerging research talent whose findings might be brought to bear on the world’s major problems.&lt;ref name=Freeman06/&gt;

=== The problem as seen by journal editors ===

Editors of international journals reported to Freeman and Robbins that they sometimes reject submissions from developing country authors even when the content shows merit.&lt;ref name=Freeman06/&gt; Some noted that despite investment in research capacity in developing countries, many manuscripts reflect inadequate attention to research design and analysis. Conflicting priorities and lack of resources to provide substantive editing have also been discussed as a potential source of bias by members of the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wame.org] World Association of Medical Editors&lt;/ref&gt; Editors in WAME who work with researchers as well as those who tend the gates at journals noted that the chances of acceptance may be lower for manuscripts needing more rather than less editing work.&lt;ref&gt;Value of technical editing. WAME listserve discussion, March 2–8, 2005. http://www.wame.org/resources/wame-listserve-discussions/value-of-technical-editing/. Accessed 21 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

At smaller journals in particular, manuscripts are likely to be rejected if they seem to require more editing than the editors or publisher can afford to provide. Another potential source of bias is perceived narrowness of scope: some editors lament the paucity of submissions sufficiently broad in scope to warrant international dissemination. Manuscripts that report research on a local or regional topic are often rejected by international journals before the editors have carefully scrutinized the research design and data collection.

Journal editors from the Forum of African Medical Editors (FAME)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tdr/networking/fame/default.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514164523/http://www.who.int/tdr/networking/fame/default.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }} Forum of African Medical Editors&lt;/ref&gt; and the Eastern Mediterranean Association of Medical Editors (EMAME),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emro.who.int/EMAME/index.htm] Eastern Mediterranean Association of Medical Editors&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are supported by the [[World Health Organization]], report they do most of the editorial tasks themselves, and have little time to assist authors with substantial revisions. Lack of editorial staff to help authors may prolong the review process or result in rejection of manuscripts whose research findings could be applied to solving practical problems or to further research.&lt;ref name=Freeman06/&gt;

=== The problem as viewed by publishers ===

The tradition of intensive editing in many fields and at many scholarly journals and publishing houses (see [[academic publishing]]) has given way to commercial imperatives to produce at lower cost more "content" that can be repackaged and resold or licensed to others to generate additional revenue. To reduce costs, publishers have pushed greater editorial responsibility upon authors. Journals proliferate, but editorial resources are often strained, leading to a propensity to accept manuscripts that require less work. This may impose an additional burden on readers trying to understand the published articles.

Research institutions in wealthy countries have responded to this new publishing environment. Where no in-house editorial service exists, elite institutions often buy editorial help for their researchers from freelance editors or specialized firms. Few, if any, developing world institutions have in-house editorial services or external editors.

In some models of [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] publishing the [[Author-pays model|author pays]] the publisher a "manuscript processing fee," which contributes little revenue to invest in editing. These fees tend to exclude less affluent authors from the start. However, not all models of open access publishing require financial support from authors, and some open access publishers waive their fees when payment would represent a hardship for authors.

== History ==

The editors of the ''Journal of Public Health Policy (JPHP)'' first presented the AuthorAID idea, provisionally named EditAID, at a meeting of the World Federation of Public Health Associations in Brighton, England in April 2004. Public health professionals from the federation’s 69 national associations expressed interest in the AuthorAID concept. Some wanted to benefit from mentoring and others offered to help scientists with less writing experience.

The second public presentation of AuthorAID took place in Mexico in November 2004 at the [[Global Forum for Health Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalforumhealth.org/Site/000__Home.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820021857/http://www.globalforumhealth.org/Site/000__Home.php |archivedate=2007-08-20 |df= }} Global Forum for Health Research&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed AuthorAID’s developers to reach a group closer to the intended users, i.e., researchers from developing countries plus national and international agencies that invest in research. Robbins and Jerry Spiegel, a Canadian colleague from the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccghr.ca/] Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research&lt;/ref&gt; talked to the forum about the potential benefits of AuthorAID.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman P, Spiegel J, Robbins A, Neufeld V.

In 2006, AuthorAID experiments started to take shape. Certain central elements remain constant across the experiments. AuthorAID is not commercial, relying exclusively on volunteer scientific and editorial mentors to help developing world authors. All AuthorAID projects match mentors (senior scientists with editorial experience often in or near retirement, or experienced science editors) with researchers seeking help to present their work. Mentors forswear authorship, agreeing to accept acknowledgment from the researchers whom they assist. Together the mentors and authors work on a manuscript via the internet or e-mail (unless they are able to meet in person) through to publication.

The [[European Association of Science Editors]] (EASE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ease.org.uk] European Association of Science Editors&lt;/ref&gt; invited a presentation of AuthorAID at its 2006 Annual Meeting in Kraków, Poland and subsequently endorsed the concept. Short descriptions of AuthorAID have been published in the journals of both CSE&lt;ref&gt;Ameh E.

== AuthorAID at INASP ==

The [[International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications]] (INASP), an international development charity based in Oxford, UK, has run a funded AuthorAID program called AuthorAID at INASP since January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inasp.info/file/413/authoraidinasp.html AuthorAID at INASP: A systematic approach to increasing the capacity of developing country researchers to publish and communicate their work] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521233258/http://www.inasp.info/file/413/authoraidinasp.html |date=2008-05-21 }} Accessed 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Following the independent evaluation of the pilot phase from 2007 to 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inasp.info/media/www/documents/AuthorAID-evaluation-2010.pdf AuthorAID: Evaluation of Pilot Phase 2007-2009]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the program was extended until the end of 2012.

AuthorAID at INASP is funded by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (Sida), the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]] (NORAD), and the UK's [[Department for International Development]] (DFID).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authoraid.info/about About AuthorAID] Accessed 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; AuthorAID at INASP is not connected to the other AuthorAID programs. Instead, it is an integral part of INASP's Programme for the Enhancement of Research Information,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inasp.info/file/3a1a5782ece736a02e3751a49b0cf507/perii-publishing-support.html PERii: Publishing Support] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705031716/http://www.inasp.info/file/3a1a5782ece736a02e3751a49b0cf507/perii-publishing-support.html |date=2012-07-05 }} Accessed 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120208121702/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/Project/60601/Default.aspx Information on PERii on the DFID website] Accessed 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which facilitates the availability, accessibility, creation, and uptake of research in developing countries.

The AuthorAID in the Eastern Mediterranean [http://www.authoraidem.org website] was inaugurarated in late October 2012.

Experienced volunteer editors who contribute their time to AAEM are located in several countries and edit research manuscripts at no cost to the authors. In Iran, the project has provided manuscript editing combined with training in writing, revising, good scientific English style, appropriate referencing and citation, and research publication ethics. Sets of AAEM advice developed for authors and editors cover aspects of technical editing such as abbreviations, reference formats and identifying sources of materials, as well as aspects of research writing and publication such as plagiarism, self-plagiarism, appropriate secondary publication and choosing the most appropriate journal. While the next on-site phase of AAEM is being planned, its volunteers continue to provide manuscript editing support via email for researchers in the Eastern Mediterranean region.

The '''California Institute of the Arts''' ('''CalArts''') is a private university in [[Santa Clarita, California]]. It was incorporated in 1961 as the first degree-granting institution of higher learning in the United States created specifically for students of both the [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing art]]s. It offers [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees among six schools: Art; Critical Studies; Dance; Film/Video; Music; and Theater.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/academics&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was first envisioned by many benefactors in the early 1960s, staffed by a diverse array of professionals (including [[Nelbert Chouinard|Nelbert Murphy Chouinard]], a founder of [[Chouinard Art Institute]], [[Walt Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen, Thornton Ladd and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rushkoff | first = Douglas | title =Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | year = 1995 | page = 102| isbn = 0-345-39774-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students develop their own work, over which they retain control and copyright, in a workshop atmosphere.

As of 2017, the school has a 27.5% acceptance rate.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/about/institute/facts-and-figures&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[US News &amp; World Report]] has CalArts ranked #9 of "Best Graduate Fine Arts Programs." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-fine-arts-schools/fine-arts-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CalArts was originally formed in 1961, as a merger of the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (founded 1921) and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music (founded 1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://calarts.edu/about/history | title=CalArts: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the formerly existing institutions were going through financial difficulties around the same time, and the founder of the Art Institute, Nelbert Chouinard, was mortally ill. The professional relationship between Madame Chouinard and Walt Disney began in 1929 when Disney had no money and Madame Chouinard agreed to train Disney's first animators on a pay-later basis. It was through the vision of Disney, who discovered and trained many of his studio artists at Chouinard (including [[Mary Blair]], [[Maurice Noble]] and some of the [[Nine Old Men]], among others), that the merger of the two institutions was coordinated; the process continued after his death in 1966.&lt;ref name="RootsLAT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-29/entertainment/ca-100_1_robert-perine-calarts-herbert-blau |title=The Roots of CalArts | accessdate=18 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=April 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining him were his brother [[Roy O. Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects), of the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. The original board of trustess at CalArts included  [[Harrison Price]], [[Retlaw Enterprises| Royal Clark]], Robert W. Corrigan,  [[Roy E. Disney]], [[Roy O. Disney]], film producer Z. Wayne Griffin, [[H. R. Haldeman]], Ralph Hetzel (then vice-president of [[Motion Picture Association of America]]), [[Chuck Jones]], Ronald Miller, [[Millard Sheets]], attorney Maynard Toll, bank executive G. Robert Truex Jr. , [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Meredith Willson]], Peter McBean and Scott Newhall (descendants of [[Henry Newhall]]),  and the wives of [[Roswell Gilpatric]], J.L. Hurschler, Richard R. Von Hagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/tn6902b.htm| title=Program: CalArts Groundbreaking }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Alumni Association was founded as a nonprofit organization and was governed by a 12-member board of directors to serve the best interests of the institute and its programs. Members included leading professional artists and musicians, who contributed their knowledge, experience and skill to strengthen the institute. The 12 founding board of directors members were [[Mary Costa]], [[Edith Head]], [[Gale Storm]], [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], [[Tony Duquette]], [[Harold Grieve]], [[John Hench]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Marty Paich]], [[Nelson Riddle]] and [[Millard Sheets]].

The ground-breaking for CalArts' current campus took place May 3, 1969. However, construction of the new campus was hampered by torrential rains, labor troubles and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|earthquake in 1971]]. CalArts moved to its present campus in the [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] section of the city of [[Santa Clarita, California]] in November 1971. From the beginning, CalArts was plagued by the tensions between its art and trade school functions as well as between the non-commercial aspirations of the students and faculty and the conservative interests of the Disney family and trustees. The founding board of trustees originally planned on creating CalArts as a school in an entertainment complex, a destination like Disneyland, and a feeder school for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://clancco.com/wp/2007/01/intervview_sergio-muoz-sarmiento_cal-arts_law/| title=Interview with Tom Lawson, Dean of CalArts School of Art, January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model is exemplified in the 1941 Disney film [[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]. In an ironic turn of fate, they appointed Dr. Robert W. Corrigan as the first president of the Institute.

Corrigan, former dean of the School of Arts at [[New York University]] fired almost all the artists and teachers from Chouinard in his attempt to remake CalArts into his personal vision. [[Herbert Blau]] was hired as the Institute's provost and dean of the School of Theater and Dance. Subsequently, Blau was instrumental in hiring a number of professionals like [[Mel Powell]] (dean of the School of Music), [[Paul Brach]] (dean of the School of Art), [[Alexander Mackendrick]] (dean of the School of Film/Video), sociologist [[Maurice R. Stein]] (dean of Critical Studies), and [[Richard Farson]] (dean of the School of Design; now integrated in the Art school as the Graphic Design program), as well as other influential program heads and teachers such as Stephan von Huene, [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Bella Lewitzky]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[Jules Engel]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Max Kozloff]], [[Miriam Shapiro]], [[Douglas Huebler]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Norman M. Klein]] and [[Nam June Paik]]  most of whom largely came from a [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and [[avant-garde]] side of the art world. The fundamental principles established at the Institute by Blau and the late Corrigan included ideas like “no technique in advance of need,” and that a curriculum should be cyclical rather than sequential, returning to root principles at regular intervals, and that “we’re a community of artists here, some of us called faculty and some called students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.robertbenedetti.com/AwardSpeech.htm | title=Robert Benedetti-Acceptance speech for athe career achievement award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan held his position until 1972, when he was replaced by William S. Lund, a Disney son-in-law. Within a month of Lund's tenure as president, 55 of CalArts' 325 faculty and staff were fired. Structured schedules were introduced. Classes were trimmed back and, within a year, the Institute was operating on budget. Some credit Lund with saving CalArts. Others see his tenure as the end of an idealistic experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-15/entertainment/ca-1889_1_walt-disney/2 |title=A Tradition of Tradition-Be-Damned  | accessdate=17 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Wharton | date=April 15, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Robert Fitzpatrick (art executive)|Robert J. Fitzpatrick]] was appointed new president of CalArts. Holding this position for 12 years, in 1987
Fitzpatrick resigned as president to head [[Euro Disney S.C.A|Euro Disney]] in Paris. Nicholas England, former dean of the School of Music, was appointed acting president. One year later, [[Steven Lavine]], associate director for arts and humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation, was named new president.

On June 24, 2015 Steven D. Lavine announced he would step down as President of the California Institute of the Arts in May 2017, after an unprecedented 29-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-calarts-column-20150624-story.html|title=CalArts President Steven D. Lavine to Step Down in Spring of 2017|last=|first=|date=2014-06-24|website=|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concluding a search with over 500 candidates, the CalArts Board of Directors announced on December 13, 2016 that Ravi S. Rajan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://president.calarts.edu|title=Introducing the next President at CalArts — Ravi Rajan|website=Introducing the next President at CalArts|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean of the School of the Arts at the [[State University of New York at Purchase]] was unanimously elected as President, to begin in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-ravi-rajan-calarts-20161213-story.html|title=CalArts names Ravi Rajan president, the first Asian American to be named to the post|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the summer of 1987, CalArts became the host of the state-funded [[California State Summer School for the Arts]] (CSSSA) program. It began as a program to nurture talented high school students in the fields of [[animation]], [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[music]], [[theatre arts]], and [[visual arts]]. CalArts expanded on the concept by creating the [[Community Arts Partnership]] in 1990. While CSSSA is open to qualifying California students, CAP, as it is commonly known, is a service provided to students living within underprivileged communities in the Los Angeles County school system. Many CalArts faculty and students mentor the high school students in both programs.

In 1994, [[Herb Alpert]], a professional musician and admirer of the Institute, established the [[Alpert Awards in the Arts]] in collaboration with CalArts and his nonprofit the Herb Alpert Foundation. While the foundation provides the award for winning recipients, the school's faculty in the fields film/new media, visual arts, theatre, dance, and music select artists in their field to nominate an individual artist who is recognized for their innovation in their given medium. Recipients of this award are required to stay for a week as visiting artists at CalArts and mentor students studying their metier. In 2008, CalArts renamed the School of Music in his name, courtesy of a $15 million donation.

Over the years, the school has also developed on-campus, interdisciplinary laboratories, such as the [[Center for Experiments in Art, Information, and Technology]], [[Center for Integrated Media]], [[Center for New Performance at CalArts]], and the Cotsen Center for Puppetry and the Arts.

==Academics==
CalArts offers degree programs in [[music]], [[art]], [[Contemporary dance|dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[animation]], [[Experimental theatre|theater]], [[puppetry]], and [[creative writing|writing]].  Students receive intensive professional training in the area of their career purpose without being cast into a rigid pattern. Its focus is in [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], [[contemporary art]], and the Institute's stated mission is to develop professional artists of tomorrow- artists who will change their field.  With these goals in place, the Institute encourages students to recognize the complexity of political, social and aesthetic questions and to respond to them with informed, independent judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alpertawards.org/about/calarts | title=CalArts Statement }} for {{cite web | url=http://www.alpertawards.org/ | title=The Alpert Award in the Arts }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission===
Every school within the Institute requires that applicants send in an [[artist's statement]], along with a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] or [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]] (depending on the Program) in order to be considered for admission. The school does not review an applicant's [[SAT]] scores without consent of the applicant, and does not consider an applicant's [[GPA]] as part of the admission process.

In a 2016 interview, design program faculty member Michael Worthington was asked "'''What kinds of students do best at CalArts?''', to which he responded, ''Energetic, enthusiastic, self-motivated, fast learners, idiosyncratic aesthetes, verbal and visual adventurers, risk takers, those who are smart and vocal with a critical eye for their own work and the work of others. Having technical, formal and typographical skills helps, but we can teach those things. Raw intelligence and criticality and an adventurous side matter more at the start. Above all, the students that do best are those that are committed to design and who are willing to put the time and energy into their own development and learning.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://motionographer.com/2016/02/18/school-profile-calarts/ |title=School Profile: CalArts | accessdate=21 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conception and foundation===
The initial concept behind CalArts' interdisciplinary approach came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s idea of [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("total artwork"), which Disney himself was fond of and explored in a variety of forms, beginning with his own studio, then later in the incorporation of CalArts. He began with the classic Disney film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), where animators, dancers, composers, and artists alike collaborated. In 1952, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] was founded, where Disney integrated artists from his animation studio and elsewhere, as well as formally trained engineers and achieved creative critical mass in the development of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. He believed that the same concept that developed WDI, could also be applied to a university setting, where art students of different mediums would be exposed to and explore a wide range of creative directions. Disney himself has stated of his memorial school:

{{cquote|If you keep busy, your work might lead you into paths you might not expect. I’ve always operated like the [[The Three Princes of Serendip|princes of Serendip]], who went on quests not knowing what they would find.  That happens in science; some of our most important discoveries have come from scientists who were searching for something else. What young artists need is a school where they can learn a variety of skills, a place where there is cross-pollination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calarts.edu/~alumni/reunion/Images/Current_Insert.pdf |title=CalArts 30th Anniversary speech |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarkable thing that’s taking place in almost every field of endeavor is an accelerating rate of dynamic growth and change. The arts, which have historically symbolized the advance of human progress, must match this growth if they are going to maintain their value in and influence on society.  The talents of musicians, the self-expression of the actor, and the techniques and applications of fine and commercial artist are being use more and more in today's business-not by themselves but rather, in close association with each other. What we must have, then, is a completely new approach to training in the arts-an entirely new educational concept which will properly prepare artists and give them the vital tools so necessary for working in, and drawing from, every field of creativity and performance. I like the workshop idea, with students being able to drop in and learn all kinds of arts. A school should offer a kind of cross-pollination that would develop the best in its students. That is the direction I would like CalArts to take. It shouldn’t be a school where studies are rigid and narrow. Students should be able to study the whole spectrum of the arts.  Perhaps a musician would find he is more talented in arts; and vice versa. There is an urgent need for a professional school which will not only give its students thorough training in a specific field, but will also allow the widest possible range of artistic growth and expression. To meet this need is exactly why California Institute of the Arts has been created, and why we all believe so strongly in its importance. Students will be able to take anything - art, drama, music, dance, writing. They'll graduate with a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts, and if they want a Bachelor of Arts they can go to other colleges and acquire a few more credits. The student body of CalArts shouldn't be over two thousand, and as many as possible should reside on campus. There should be some allowance for those who are talented, yet are not students; they should be able to express themselves without worrying about grades. There will be a lot of scholarships at CalArts. Those who can pay will pay; those who can't will get scholarships. We don't want any dilettantes at CalArts. We want people with talent. That will be the one factor in getting into CalArts: talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030707181300/http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archivedate= 2003-07-07 | title="What about an Integrated School?

==Facilities==

===Walt Disney Modular Theatre===
The Walt Disney Modular Theatre is an indoor performance space located within the California Institute of the Arts.

Funded by Lillian Disney, who lent support to Walt's venture into education, her gift to the school to remodel a campus theater and rename it the Walt Disney Modular Theatre in 1993. The modular theater is based on a concept suggested by [[Antonin Artaud]], who asserted that the ideal theater could be reconfigured for each and every new performance or play. When [[Walt Disney]] founded his Institute of the Arts, he requested suggestions from leaders in various artistic fields as to what would be the ideal tools for advancing the study and practice of their medium. One of the overwhelmingly popular suggestions from the theater community was a modular theater as suggested by Artaud. Disney had the Modular Theatre incorporated as the central performance space of his Institute. It was the first of its kind constructed, and remains one of only five in the world.

The chief feature of the theater is a segmented floor, divided into 348 4'x4' square platforms, each mounted on its own independent pneumatic pistons, allowing the floor to be reconfigured into whatever shape is desired. The theater is also composed of segmented pieces, so that walls can also be easily reconfigured, creating a virtually limitless number of possibilities in design. The theater is two stories tall from floor to ceiling—the [[pneumatic]] pistons reach another story down into the CalArts library, where they are a dominating architectural feature. There are doors on all sides of the theater so that the audience can be made to enter from whatever direction the artists choose. The theater can be divided into several playing spaces, the audience can be separated into several sections, and any combination of levels and directions can be used. The theater can also be configured into an environmental space, with the audience moving through multiple locations in the course of a show, or being presented with a virtual environment rather than one in which they are separate from the performance.

The Walt Disney Modular Theater is employed year-round by students and faculty at the CalArts, primarily those in the schools of Theater, Dance, and Music. Though the idea of modular theater has fallen out of fashion, in favor of environmental theater and the resurgence of [[proscenium]] spectacle theater, the theater remains in use, run by the Technical Direction Department, including both students and faculty.

It was designed by Fisher Dachs Associates, a collaboration between the Dean of the Theater School, [[Herbert Blau]], lighting designer [[Jules Fisher]], and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects).

===A113===

A113 is an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] that has been inserted into several animated television shows and feature films as a homage to a classroom at CalArts.

===Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall===
{{main|REDCAT}}

In 2003, CalArts established a performance theater in downtown Los Angeles called REDCAT, the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall. The Center for New Performance, the professional producing arm of the CalArts Theater School, brings works to the space from both student and professional artists and musicians.

===Wild Beast===

In fall 2009, the Institute opened an on-campus music pavilion, known as the "Wild Beast". The {{convert|3200|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, free-standing structure serves as a space for classrooms and combined indoor-outdoor performance space. CalArts' President Steven Lavine has stated, “The core demand is that our Herb Alpert School of Music has doubled in size in the last decade; when we have guest artists, there is no place for them to perform&amp;mdash;And the second reason was to allow enough space for the general public to attend [...]”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/02/calarts-is-addi.html |title=CalArts is adding a Wild Beast to its menagerie | accessdate=19 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Baldessari Art Studio Building===
In 2013, CalArts opened its John Baldessari Art Studio Building, which cost $3.1 million to build and features approximately 7,000 square feet of space—much of it used as studio space for art students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;David Ng (November 29, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127,0,7368564.story#ixzz2mLsg6Nv6 CalArts names new art studio building after John Baldessari]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206093355/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127%2C0%2C7368564.story |date=February 6, 2014 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception and cultural influence==

In 2011, [[Newsweek]]/The Daily Beast listed CalArts as the top school for arts-minded students. The ranking was not aimed to assess the country's best art school, but rather to assess campuses that offer an exceptional artistic atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Ziemba |first=Christine N.|title=Newsweek/Daily Beast Ranks CalArts as Nation’s Most ‘Artistic’ College|url=http://blog.calarts.edu/2011/08/30/newsweekdaily-beast-ranks-calarts-as-nations-most-artistic-college/|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=CalArts 24700|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng|first=David|title=CalArts named top school for arts-minded students|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/09/calarts-named-top-arts-school-in-new-ranking.html|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, during the groundbreaking ceremony of the Valencia campus, as [[Lillian Disney]] turned over the first shovel full of soil, director [[Bob Clampett]] stood behind her mugging for the flashing cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sito|first=Tom|title=Walt’s Jalopy: Animator Training through the Decades |url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/walt-s-jalopy-animator-training-through-decades|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several students who attended CalArts' animation programs in the 1970s eventually found work at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], and several of those went on to successful careers at Disney, [[Pixar]], and other animation studios.  In March 2014, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine highlighted the success of CalArts' 1970s animation alumni and briefly profiled several (including [[Jerry Rees]], [[John Lasseter]], [[Tim Burton]], [[John Musker]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]], [[Henry Selick]] and [[Nancy Beiman]]) in an article illustrated with a group portrait taken by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] inside classroom [[A113]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kashner|first=Sam|title=The Class That Roared|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/calarts-animation-1970s-tim-burton|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighties, a group of CalArts animation students contacted animation director [[Ralph Bakshi]]. As he was in the process of moving to New York, they persuaded him to stay in Los Angeles to continue to produce [[adult animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wharton|first=David|title=Ralph Bakshi Works Still Getting People Animated  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-27/entertainment/ca-6468_1_ralph-bakshi-works|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 27, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi then got the production rights to the cartoon character [[Mighty Mouse]]. By Bakshi's request, [[Tom Minton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]] then went to the CalArts campus to recruit the best talent from what was the recent group of graduates. They hired [[Jeff Pidgeon]], [[Rich Moore]], Carole Holiday, [[Andrew Stanton]] and Nate Kanfer to work on the then-new ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Scott|title=Q&amp;A: Toon Titan John Kricfalusi Hails Mighty Mouse Rebirth  |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/01/john-kricfalusi/ |newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Craig "Spike" Decker of [[Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation]] commented on the work of independent animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] stating that Hertzfeldt demonstrated good instincts coupled with his lack of interest in the world of commerce. In making a comparison, Decker made a reference to CalArts stating: "A lot of animators come out of CalArts — they could be so prolific, but then they're owned by Disney or someone, and they're painting the fins on the Little Mermaid. You'll never see their full potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timberg|first=Scott|title=Don Hertzfeldt is the most inventive underground animator in America. Will he ever make his peace with Hollywood? |url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/articles-e.html|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=New Times L.A. |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, members of the band [[Sonic Youth]], remarked in an interview with [[VH1]] about the band [[Liars (band)|Liars]], of which Angus Andrew and Julian Gross are CalArts luminaries. Moore's initial remarks were: "There's this whole world of young people who [think] everything's allowed. What Liars are doing right now is completely crazy. I saw them the other night and it was really great. It's really out-there". Gordon then stated "I'm not so crazy about the way [the Liars' They Were Wrong, So We Drowned] sounds. It's like 'how lo-fi can we make it?' But I think the content is really good". In reference to CalArts and Gordon's statement, Moore lastly remarked "They're art kids. They came out of CalArts and that's the kind of sensibility you have when you come out of these sort of places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bottomley |first=C. |title=Sonic Youth: Medicine For Your Ear |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |accessdate=9 March 2015 |newspaper=VH1.com |date=May 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508163128/http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |archivedate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' op-ed piece "The Kids Aren’t All Right: Is over-education killing young artists?", published in 2005, curator [[Aaron Rose]] wrote about an observed trend he recognized in Los Angeles's most esteemed art schools and their MFA programs, including CalArts. He uses the example of Supersonic, "a large exhibition […] that features the work of MFA students from esteemed area programs like CalArts, Art Center, UCLA, etc." In his observation of the showcase he examined, "[...] the work left me mostly empty and with a few exceptions seemed like nothing more than a rehash of conceptual ideas that were mined years ago." He went on to state that "these institutions are staffed with amazing talents (Mike Kelley and John Baldessari among them). Legions of creative young people flock to our city [Los Angeles] every year to work alongside their heroes and develop their talents with hopes of making it as an artist." He goes on to further state "What happens too often in these situations, though, is that we find young artists simply emulating their instructors, rather than finding and honing their own aesthetics and points of view about the world, society, themselves. In the beginnings of an artist’s career, the power in his or her work should lie not in their technique or knowledge of art history or theory or business acumen, but in what one has to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Aaron|title=The Kids Aren’t All Right  |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-10-27/news/the-kids-aren-t-all-right/?showFullText=true |accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist Amanda Charchian was asked in an interview what she disliked about going to art school. In her response, she noted, "Most of my teachers came from the 1970′s CalArts conceptual art world, so they had us deconstruct everything we did in terms of the material being the message ([[Truth to materials]]). So if I used marble it had to be about social class, ancient sculpture, heaviness, etc. There was this idea that there’s nothing in the work that couldn’t relate to why you made it. Intuition was never enough of a reason."&lt;ref&gt;Kathan, Emma. [http://www.psychicgloss.com/articles/205 "Interview with Artist Amanda Charchian"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107183857/http://www.psychicgloss.com/articles/205 |date=January 7, 2015 }}, ''Psychic Gloss Magazine'' Retrieved on 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

CalArts graduates have joined or started successful pop bands, including: [[The Belle Brigade]], [[The Weirdos]], [[Bedroom Walls]], Beelzabubba, [[Dawn of Midi]], [[The Rippingtons]], [[Fitz and The Tantrums]], [[Fol Chen]], [[London After Midnight (band)|London After Midnight]], [[No Doubt]], [[Mission of Burma]], Radio Vago, [[Oingo Boingo]], Secret Circuit, [[Liars (band)|Liars]], [[The Mae Shi]], [[Ozomatli]], and Jack Ruby.

Today, CalArts is recognized alongside [[Black Mountain College]] and the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] as one of the truly successful experiments in American arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620044408/http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archivedate=June 20, 2006 |title="CalArts @ Moma", CalArts F/V website |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pixar University===
'''Pixar University''' is an in-house professional-development program within Pixar that expands the concept of employee education by broadening its focus from skills training to a more general fine-arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hempel|first=Jessi|title=Pixar University: Thinking Outside The Mouse|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pixar-University-Thinking-Outside-The-Mouse-2611923.php|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=SF Gate|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the educational model of CalArts. The program offers more than 110 courses: a complete film-making curriculum, classes on painting, drawing, sculpting and creative writing, which usually last four to sixteen weeks. These classes are available not only for animators, but everyone, from the security guard to cafeteria chef.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=William C. |title=How Pixar Adds a New School of Thought to Disney |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/business/yourmoney/29pixar.html?ei=5090&amp;en=1579be4d45b9f9bb&amp;ex=1296190800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=NY Times|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this setting, employees are allowed to miss work for a full slate in classes (about 14 per week) to raise the level of the best, cross-train, and develop mastery in whatever subjects may interest them. The vision behind the university is for employees to try new things, work together better and test new ideas, but one of the most important benefits from the program is to build morale, spirit and communication among employees. The dean of Pixar University, Randy S. Nelson, explains: "We've made the leap from an idea-centered business to a people-centered business. Instead of developing ideas, we develop people. Instead of investing in ideas, we invest in people. We're trying to create a culture of learning, filled with lifelong learners. It's no trick for talented people to be interesting, but it's a gift to be interested. We want an organization filled with interested people.".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Title IX Complaint===
On August 29, 2014 a freshman student identified as Regina filed a Title IX complaint against CalArts, regarding CalArts' improper response to her reported rape by a classmate. According to [[Aljazeera]], the CalArts administration questioned the victim, "...ask[ing] her questions about her drinking habits, how often she partied, the length of her dress, how oral rape was even possible, whether she climaxed and whether climaxing was an issue when she'd been with her alleged rapist before."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was subjected to retaliation from friends of the perpetrator. The student filed a complaint against CalArts with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which was dismissed. The perpetrator was suspended for a year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Claire|title=CalArts to alleged rape victim: How long was your dress?|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2014/10/14/calarts-sexual-assault.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Aljazeera America|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students walked out of their classes and protested in solidarity with the victim on October 23, later initiating a student-led meeting to discuss the issue of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Song|first=Jason|title=CalArts students protest school's handling of rape allegations |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-calarts-protest-rape-20141023-story.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jahad|first=Shirley|title=CalArts students protest handling of rape cases |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/10/24/47627/calarts-students-protest-handling-of-rape-cases/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heddaya|first=Mostafa|title=After Walkout, CalArts Students Organize Against Administration |url=http://hyperallergic.com/158304/after-walkout-calarts-students-organize-against-administration/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Hyperallergic|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7049">'''Community indicators''' are "measurements that provide information about past and current trends and assist planners and community leaders in making decisions that affect future outcomes". They provide insight into the overall direction of a community: whether it is improving, declining, or staying the same, or is some mix of all three.

In essence, indicators are measurements that reflect the interplay between social, environmental, and economic factors affecting a region’s or community’s [[Quality of life|well-being]]. Community indicators projects typically are conducted by [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]] within a community, although in some cases they are initiated by the public sector.

== History of community indicators ==
Community indicators are a localized response to the perceived invalidity of the traditional predominantly economic indicators, such as GDP, that are used for measuring human progress. This invalidity takes two forms. First, economic indicators account for all money transactions as beneficial for quality of life, whereas some of these can be seen as decidedly negative (e.g., money spent on environmental cleanup of pollution that could have been prevented). Secondly, strictly economic indicators do not count the value of non-monetary activity, such as homemaker and volunteer work and non-cash public assistance, which are decidedly positive for the quality of life of many families (Journal article by David Swain, Danielle Hollar; International Journal of Public Administration, Vol. 26, 2003).

A communities level approach to this apparent invalidity is based on the evidence of a social group whose members reside in a specific locality, share government, and often have a common culture and history. Community indicators are not a new concept; they have been in use since 1910, when the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] initiated the development of local surveys for measuring industrial, educational, recreational, and other factors. The processes used by the Sage Foundation are similar to those that reemerged during the 1990s. But the difference today is the use of indicators to consider the full spectrum of a community’s well-being, not just isolated factors. Nowadays, indicators are used by many constituencies within a [[community]]. After a decade of renewed attention to community indicators, they now represent a valuable mechanism to improve monitoring and evaluation in planning.

Russell Sage Foundation employed “over two thousand local surveys taken on education, recreation, [[public health]], crime, and general social conditions” to assess social conditions. The first survey was conducted in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. (In the late 1990s, Pittsburgh again embraced indicators, with its Sustainable Pittsburgh Goals and Indicators Project.) Many of the surveys used
by the Sage Foundation were conducted by nonprofit organizations, such as [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]] and citizen committees. These surveys yielded social trends indicators and were popular until [[Great Depression|the Great Depression]] and World War II, when economic measures such as the [[gross domestic product]] or [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] indicators took greater precedence

== Community information systems objectives ==
'''Community information systems''' ('''CIS''') bring together a wide range of community indicators — [[social]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] data and information around objectives:
* Monitoring the health, social well-being and sustainability of communities through the management of Quality of Life indicators;
* Bringing together government performance indicators and community targeted indicators into a single solution;
* Widening the use of data by citizens and public officials to support decision-making, improve policy and target resources;

The '''Digital Library for Dutch Literature''' (Dutch: '''Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren''' or '''DBNL''') is a [[website]] (showing the abbreviation as '''dbnl''') about [[Dutch language]] and [[Dutch literature]]. The website contains thousands of literary texts, secondary literature and additional information, like biographies, portrayals etcetera, and hyperlinks. The DBNL is an initiative by the DBNL foundation that was founded in 1999 by the Society of Dutch Literature (Dutch: [[Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde]]). Building of the DNBL was made possible by donations, among others, from the [[Dutch Organization for Scientific Research]] (Dutch: [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]]) and the [[Nederlandse Taalunie]]. From 2008 to 2012, the editor was [[René van Stipriaan]].&lt;ref name="Somers, Maartje page 10"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2008/04/04/van-abel-spel-tot-achterhuis-11515719-a1145015 | title= Van abel spel tot Achterhuis: de basisbibliotheek - het Nederlands erfgoed in duizend sleutelteksten | work=[[NRC Handelsblad]], p. 10-14 | date=April 4, 2008 | accessdate=October 22, 2017 | author=Somers, Maartje|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is done by eight people in [[Leiden]] (as of 2013: The Hague), 20 students, and 50 people in the [[Philippines]] who scan and type the texts.&lt;ref name="Somers, Maartje page 10"/&gt;
{{Wikidata property|P723}}

==Basic library: 1,000 key texts==
The DBNL contains (or will contain in the near future), the complete so called [[Canon of Dutch Literature|"basic library" (Dutch: "basisbibliotheek") 1,000 deemed "key" texts]] of the Dutch and [[Flanders|Flemish]] cultural history.&lt;ref name="Somers, Maartje page 10"/&gt; The chairperson of the committee that selected the 1,000 key texts is [[Paul Schnabel]].&lt;ref name="Somers, Maartje page 10"/&gt; Nevertheless, some classic texts of [[Dutch literature]], like [[Gerard Reve]]'s 1947 novel ''The evenings'' (Dutch: ''[[De Avonden|De avonden]]'') and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]' 1966 novel ''[[Beyond Sleep]]'' (Dutch: ''[[Nooit meer slapen]]'') are missing because of copyright reasons.&lt;ref name="Somers, Maartje page 10"/&gt;

'''Dueling scars''' ({{lang-de|Schmisse}}) have been seen as a "'''badge of honour'''" since as early as 1825. Known variously as "'''''[[Mensur]]''''' scars", "'''the bragging scar'''", "'''smite'''", "'''''Schmitte'''''" or "''Renommierschmiss''", dueling scars were popular amongst [[upper-class]] [[Austria]]ns and [[Germany|Germans]] involved in [[academic fencing]] at the start of the 20th century. Being a practice amongst [[University|university students]], it was seen as a mark of their class and honour, due to the status of dueling societies at German and Austrian universities at the time, and is an early example of [[scarification]] in [[Europe|European society]].&lt;ref name="DeMello p 237"&gt;DeMello, Margo (2007). ''Encyclopedia of body adornment'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 237. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33695-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of [[duel]]ling and the associated scars was also present to some extent in the [[Military of Germany|German military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keener|first=Candace|title=Real Men Have Dueling Scars|url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/05/04/real-men-have-dueling-scars/|publisher=HowStuffWorks|date=May 4, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729063707/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/05/04/real-men-have-dueling-scars/|archivedate=July 29, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American tourists visiting Germany in the late 19th century were shocked to see the students, generally with their ''Studentcorps'', at major German universities such as [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], or [[University of Jena|Jena]] with facial scars – some older, some more recent, and some still wrapped in bandages.&lt;ref&gt;"Where students fight. Scarred Faces are common sights at Heidelburg." ''Daily Bulletin Supplement''. San Francisco. July 12, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport of [[academic fencing]] at the time was very different from modern [[fencing]] using specially developed swords. The so-called ''Mensurschläger'' (or simply ''Schläger'', "hitter") existed in two versions. The most common weapon is the Korbschläger with a basket-type guard. In some universities in the eastern part of Germany, the so-called Glockenschläger is in use which is equipped with a bell-shaped guard. The individual duels between students, known as ''[[Mensuren]]'', were somewhat ritualised. In some cases, protective clothing was worn, including padding on the arm and an eye guard.

The culture of dueling scars was mainly common to [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], to a lesser extent some [[central Europe]]an countries and briefly at places such as [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and some other elite universities. German military laws permitted men to wage duels of honor until World War I, and in 1933 the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] legalized the practice once more.

Within the duel, it was seen as ideal and a way of showing courage to be able to stand and take the blow, as opposed to inflicting the wound. In fact, the victor was seen as the person who could walk away from the duel with an obvious scar.&lt;ref name="scars"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elizabeth Austin|title=Marks of Mystery|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199907/marks-mystery|website=psychologytoday.com/|accessdate=2 December 2014|date=1 January 1999|quote="the true winner was he who walked away with a nice juicy scar"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was important to show one's duelling prowess, but also that one was capable of taking the wound that was inflicted.

== Social significance ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F024217-0003, Bonn, Dehler empfängt Prof. Silberman.jpg|thumb|[[Curt Silberman]] (right) in 1967 showing an old dueling scar on his cheek; left side vice-president of the [[Bundestag]] [[Thomas Dehler]].]]
As the scars were gained in this particular elite social context, associated with status and an academic institution, the scars showed that one had courage and also was "good husband material". The duelling scars, while obvious, were not so serious as to leave a person disfigured or bereft of facial features. The scars were even judged by [[Otto von Bismarck]] to be a sign of bravery, and men's courage could be judged "by the number of scars on their cheeks".&lt;ref&gt;"Duelling in Berlin" The Galveston Daily News November 9, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minority groups in Germany also indulged in the practice, some seeing it as an aid in their social situation, including some [[Jewish people|Jews]] who wore the scars with pride. In 1874, William Osler, then a medical student on a visit to Berlin, described "one hopeful young [[Spanish Americans|Spanish American]] of my acquaintance who has one half of his face – they are usually on the left half – laid out in the most irregular manner, the cicatrices running in all directions, enclosing areas of all shapes, the relics of fourteen duels." Some Jews in Germany saw the scars as a signifier of a socially healthy individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sander L. |last=Gilman|title=Making the Body Beautiful: A Cultural History of Aesthetic Surgery|year=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-07053-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vs09mB9QjTgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of the scars ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-K0108-0501-003,_Rudolf_Diels.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Rudolf Diels]], co-founder and head of the [[Gestapo]] in 1933 to 1934.]]
Because ''Mensur'' swords are wielded with one hand and most fencers are right-handed, ''Mensur'' scars were usually targeted to the left profile, so the right profile appeared untouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAleer|first=Kevin|title=Dueling: The Cult of Honor in Fin-de-siècle Germany|year=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-03462-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experienced fencers, who had fought many bouts, often accumulated an array of scars. A duelist who died in 1877 "....fought no less than thirteen duels but had 137 scars on head, face and neck".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1877/03/18/archives/dueling-in-germany-the-bane-of-the-universities-burial-of-a-student.html "Dueling in Germany :The Bane of the Universities—Burial of a Student Victim to the Brutal Practice"] Daily Evening Bulletin, (San Francisco, CA) Saturday, March 31, 1877; Issue 149; col F&lt;/ref&gt;

The wounds were generally not that serious, "wounds causing, as a rule, but temporary inconvenience and leaving in their traces a perpetual witness of a fight well fought. The hurts, save when inflicted in the nose, lip or ear, are not even necessarily painful, and unless the injured man indulges too freely in drink, causing them to swell and get red, very bad scars can be avoided. The swords used are so razor-like that they cut without bruising, so that the lips of the wounds can be closely pressed, leaving no great disfigurement, such, for examples, as is brought about by the loss of an ear."&lt;ref&gt;"Scarred Dueling Heroes," St Louis Daily Globe August 15, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, students who did not fence would scar themselves with razors in imitation,&lt;ref name="DeMello p 237"/&gt; and some would pull apart their healing cuts to exacerbate the scars, although this was generally frowned upon.  Others paid doctors to slice their cheeks. The number and extremity of scars was reduced in more recent times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Dueling_Scar |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201175615/http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Dueling_Scar|title=Dueling Scar - BMEzine Encyclopedia |archivedate=February 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the custom of obtaining dueling scars started to die off after the [[World War II|Second World War]].

== Modern day ==
Roughly 300 fencing fraternities ([[Studentenverbindung|Studentenverbindungen]]) still exist today and most of them are grouped into umbrella organizations such as the [[German Student Corps|Corps]], [[Landsmannschaft (Studentenverbindung)|Landsmannschaft]] or the {{ill|Deutsche Burschenschaft|de}} (DB) in the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and several other European nations. Their traditions still include [[Mensur|academic fencing]] and dueling scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joseph Robinson|title=Student Societies|url=http://www.pickelhauben.net/articles/Students.htm|website=pickelhauben.net|accessdate=2 December 2014|date=19 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuiken|first1=Alwin|title=Schlagende Verbindungen: Die den Kopf hinhalten|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/schlagende-verbindungen-die-den-kopf-hinhalten-12653226.html?printPagedArticle=true|accessdate=22 March 2018|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=2013-11-08|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Cliff Missen and Michael McNulty founded WiderNet to "provide training and research in low-cost, high impact uses of information technologies in developing countries".&lt;ref name=WiderNetHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widernet.org/whoweare/history |title=WiderNet: Our History}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missen developed the idea after studying at the [[University of Jos]] in Jos, Plateau State, [[Nigeria]], the year before as a [[Fulbright Scholar]]. While studying and teaching in Nigeria through the program, Missen experienced first-hand frustrations the lack of Internet access caused. This frustration led to his vision of the WiderNet project with the objective of providing training and research in low-cost, high-impact uses of information technologies in developing countries.  

The WiderNet Project has shipped over 1,600 computers, 50,000 books, and more than 1,600 eGranary Digital Libraries to schools, clinics, and universities in [[Africa]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] since 2000.{{cn|date=December 2017}} They have also trained almost 5,000 people on topics including policy planning, enterprise management, technician training, and classroom technology.

In 2001 Cliff Missen invented the eGranary Digital Library. There are now eGranary installations in more than 1,600 schools, clinics, and universities in Africa, India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, and Haiti.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Objective ==

An eGranary Digital Library [[Web cache|caches]] educational resources via a local area network in order to reduce connectivity costs in Internet-scarce areas.  Most eGranary subscribers do not have an Internet connection, but those who do can open resources up to 5,000 times faster from the eGranary Digital Library.

The eGranary Digital Library contains an off-line collection of approximately 35 million educational resources from more than 2,500 Web sites and hundreds of CD-ROMs and fits on a 6[[terrabyte|TB]] [[hard drive]].&lt;ref name=news&gt;[http://newsblaze.com/story/20070718064841tsop.nb/topstory.html newsblaze] article ''Africa, India, Bangladesh, Azerbaijan, Haiti get eGranary Digital Library'' published 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection includes more than 60,000 books in their entirety, hundreds of full-text journals, and dozens of software applications.

Some of the documents in the eGranary Digital Library are in the [[public domain]], some carry a [[copyleft]] license, but most of them have been provided by their authors and publishers as a contribution to global education.  About 6% of the content in the eGranary Digital Library is not available on the public Internet; much of it typically requires a subscription or payment, but authors and publishers have agreed to provide it for free to people in low-bandwidth situations.

Any subscriber can include their own digital content in the eGranary Digital Library, making it a publishing platform for communication and collaboration.

== Included software ==

The eGranary Digital Library contains a built-in [[proxy server]] and [[search engine]] similar to the Internet at a speed that is otherwise not usually available to its users.  The proxy server allows users' Web requests to "play-through" to the Internet if a connection is available.

Since many patrons of the eGranary Digital Library are unfamiliar with using the Internet, WiderNet Project hires librarians worldwide to assist partners in locating specific resources.  The eGranary's interface includes a word search that [[Lucene]]  and [[Solr]] power; an [[OPAC|online public access catalog]] that [[VuFind]] funds, which contains over 60,000 records; and dozens of [[web portal|portals]] experts from around the world cooperatively develop.

Since 2010, the eGranary Digital Library includes interactive [[Web 2.0]] features in its Community Information Platform.  Thanks to a generous grant from the [[Intel Corporation]] in 2010, the Community Information Platform was developed to allow users to create and share their own content through technologies like built-in Web editors, [[LDAP]] security, [[Moodle]], [[WordPress]], [[MySQL]], [[PHP]], [[Drupal]], and others.  Subscribers can set up unlimited Web sites on their server and use free, built-in software to make Web pages, upload files and share local information with each other.

== Social contract ==

One of the guiding principles of the eGranary Digital Library is that the content must not be sold for profit.  The WiderNet Project pledges this to authors and publishers when seeking their permission and each subscriber institution signs a license agreement stating that they will make the content freely available to their patrons via their local area networks.

To build a reliable, self-sustaining service, the WiderNet Project has developed a business model that aims to cover ongoing program and development costs through grants, donations, sponsored training programs, and volunteers.  So far the organization has raised and spent over $1,200,000 in 15 years to develop, field test and promote the concept. Volunteers from around the world have put in more than 30,000 hours to assist with computer programming, collecting and organizing new resources, creating portals and curriculum, and building and distributing new libraries.

While grants and gifts fund the development of new features, subscribers buy eGranary drives at a highly subsidized rate, just enough to recover production costs without making a profit.  Subscribers cover the costs of basic librarianship; the costs of the purchase, testing, and preparation of the equipment; the transaction costs (like marketing, licensing, and accounting); and the costs of providing on-going technical support and software updates.

Several [[value-added reseller]]s integrate the eGranary Digital Library into their offerings.  Additionally, young entrepreneurs in developing countries have joined the WiderNet Project's Field Associate program, offering on-site installation and training in their countries.

Since they incur no bandwidth costs, some subscribers share their eGranary via [[wireless LAN|wireless networks]] to create free wireless public libraries, or knowledgespheres, in their communities.

==Contributors==

The eGranary Digital Library represents the collective efforts of thousands of authors, publishers, programmers, librarians, instructors and students around the globe.  Some of the many authors and publishers who have granted permission to distribute their works via the eGranary Digital Library include [[Wikipedia]], the [[Khan Academy]], TED, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]], [[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare]], [[UNESCO]], the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]], the [[Hesperian Foundation]], and the [[World Health Organization]].

==Research==

There are several research publications on the eGranary, mainly by two scholars and their colleagues, each representing different research foci. Cliff Missen and colleagues have written several articles focussing on the contribution of the eGranary to low-bandwidth settings, notably Africa. Their research includes an overview of how the eGranary can provide web pages and multimedia files to under-resourced areas and counter the challenges of low bandwidth, as well as be an experiment to create metadata through [[crowd sourcing|crowd cataloging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Missen|first1=Cliff|title=Internet in a box: The eGranary digital library serves scholars lacking Internet bandwidth|journal=New Review of Information Networking|date=2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=193–199|doi=10.1080/13614570600573367|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13614570600573367#}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miner|first1=Edward A.|last2=Missen|first2=Cliff|title="Internet in a Box": Augmenting Bandwidth with the eGranary Digital Library|journal=Africa Today|date=2005|volume=2|issue=52|pages=21–37|doi=10.1353/at.2006.0012|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/at/summary/v052/52.2miner.html|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maron|first1=Deborah|last2=Missen|first2=Cliff|last3=Greenberg|first3=Jane|title="Lo-Fi to Hi-Fi": A New Metadata Approach in the Third World with the eGranary Digital Library|journal=DCMI International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications|date=2014|pages=37–42|url=http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3713}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bonny Norton]] and colleagues at a rural community library in Uganda carry out another area of scholarly work on the eGranary. Their research discusses student and teacher library users’ identities in light of their use of the eGranary, which had been donated to the library. The eGranary gave the student users a new range of identities to choose from, and the identities of the students in charge of the eGranary evolved as they went from being newcomers to being expert users. The eGranary also opened up for future imagined identities, such as ones related to working with technology. Teachers were positive and developed their technological skills but also recognized some challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norton|first1=Bonny|editor1-last=Sanford|editor1-first=Kathy|editor2-last=Rogers|editor2-first=Theresa|editor3-last=Kendrick|editor3-first=Maureen|title=eGranary and digital identities of Ugandan Youth|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-4451-02-4|pages=111–127|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Bonny|last2=Williams|first2=Carrie-Jane|title=Digital identities, student investments and eGranary as a placed resource|journal=Language and Education|date=2012|volume=26|issue=4|pages=315–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Bonny|last2=Early|first2=Margaret|last3=Tembe|first3=Juliet|title=eGranary as a digital resource in Uganda: Preliminary findings|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Cultural Attitudes Towards Technology and Communication|date=2010|pages=35–41|url=http://www.educ.ubc.ca/faculty/norton/N,%20E,%20and%20T%20in%20CATAC%202010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in Malawi''' stresses academic preparation leading to access to secondary school and universities. However, few students go on to high school or university. The dropout rate is also very high particularly among primary school pupils.
{{TOC limit}}

==Primary education==
[[File:Schoolchildren in Malawi.jpg|thumb|right|Primary school students at an outdoor meeting in Malawi]]
Primarily schools are mostly in two categories of assisted (public) and unassisted (private) schools. Villages and hamlets throughout the country have such schools. By 1970, there were approximately 2,000 primary schools for 35 percent of primary school aged youth. About 12 percent of all primary school students attended private, predominantly church run schools. 

==Secondary school education==
Secondary education developed late in Malawi, because of little effort or neglect in secondary education during the colonial era. Malawi has five types of secondary schools. These include aided boarding schools, aided day schools, government boarding-secondary schools, government day secondary schools, and private secondary schools. Most secondary teachers are qualified and hold either degrees or diplomas.

In the curriculum, Agriculture is a compulsory subject for all students. Wood working, metal work, and technical drawing are encouraged for boys, and home economics is encouraged for girls. One of the biggest criticisms of secondary schools in Malawi is that they are too university-oriented and needs more technical skills taught. Most students immediately enter the workforce and need a different orientation. Therefore, Secondary schools do not produce as many graduates as the labor market demands. In fact, only one-fourth of Malawi's youth end up attending secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth Studies|last = Furlong|first = Andy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-415-56479-3|location = Abingdon, Oxon|pages = 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Public school system==
The government established free primary education for all children in 1994, which increased attendance rates, according to UNICEF.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/Malawi.htm "Malawi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006092319/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/TDA2001/malawi.htm |date=2008-10-06 }}. ''2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor''. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2002). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, the gross primary enrollment rate was 133.9 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 102.6 percent.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; In 1995, 62 percent of students entering primary school reached grade two, and 34 percent reached grade five.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; The dropout rate is higher among girls than boys.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

==Private school system==
Private schools have risen in Malawi and offer an alternative to public schools. Private schools include school like Phungu, Lilongwe Girls,Hossana private School and Sunnyside School. Some consolidates private schools are run by the Designated Schools Board.


===Charitable Foundation schools===
Many independent schools have been set up as charitable foundations in Malawi with a specific targeted pupil.  
====Jacaranda School====
The [[Jacaranda Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacarandafoundation.org|title=Jacaranda Foundation: Building Schools, Providing Education, Preventing AIDS in Malawi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by nanny Marie Da Silva, maintains the Jacaranda School. It is Malawi's only entirely free school for primary and secondary students. The vast majority of students of the Jacaranda School are orphaned by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as featured on 2008 [[CNN Heroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/02/14/dasilva/|title=CNN Heroes: Giving hope to orphans of AIDS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====St Patricks academy &amp; primary====


====The Joyce Banda Foundation====
The [[Joyce Banda Foundation]] is a foundation that runs schools for primary and secondary schools in Malawi.

====Raising Malawi Academy for Girls====
The [[Raising Malawi]] foundation is in the process of building a school aimed at female education in Malawi.

====The Legson Kayira Primary School and Community Center====

The [[Youth of Malawi]] foundation has built a solar-powered, [[rainwater harvesting]] primary school in the village of Chimphamba, in the Mchinji district of rural Malawi.

==University system==

University fees recently{{as of when?|date=August 2018}} increased sixfold to about £380 per year, more than double Malawi’s legal minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=David|title=Developing pharmacy in Malawi|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202748.article|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== The University of Southern Malawi also known as the Malawi University of Science and Technology===
The [[Malawi University of Science and Technology]] (MUST) was established on 17 December 2012 by the Malawi University of Science and Technology Act No. 31 of 2012 as the fourth Public University in Malawi. It was officially opened in the 2014 by Professor Peter Mutharika, LL.B(Hons), J.D.S.  It's situated in the prestigious shire highlands in Thyolo, Malawi. This institution is occupying a total plot area of {{convert|215,000 |m2|ha acre|abbr=on}} and has total building area of {{convert|46,000| m2|sqyd|abbr=on}}. The seating capacity of this university is 3000 but can accommodate about twice that seating capacity. Evidently, this University will hugely contribute the government of Malawi efforts to widening access to higher education.

Once fully operational, the University will have the Malawi Institute of Technology, Ndata School of Climate &amp; Earth Sciences, Academy of Medical Sciences and the Bingu School of Culture and Heritage. The Malawi Industrial Research and Technology Development Centre will be part of the MIT

=== University of Malawi ===
Malawi's first and largest tertiary educational institution is the [[University of Malawi]]. 
It was founded in 1964, and is separated into several campuses.

=== Mzuzu University ===
The university was founded in 1997 and is one of the principal universities of Malawi. The school is located in Mzuzu city in the northern region of the country.

=== Catholic University of Malawi ===
The university is located in Montfort campus in Chiladzulu District in Malawi.  It was established in 2004 and opened in 2006, with faculties of social science and education. It now additionally offers economics, Marketing, Business Administration and accounting.

==Teaching and education profession==
The Ministry of Education develops the curricula used in Malawi's schools and oversee teacher training. Teachers take both pedagogical and academic courses. Supervised practical teaching is expected before teaching independently. Most teachers begin as primary school teachers in a demonstration school adjacent to teacher training facilities. Later, block teaching is tried during which the teacher trainee tries teaching a class on their own for six weeks. Three types of lecturers educate potential teachers. Graduate teacher educators chair most departments, aided by diplomate and nondiplomate assistants.

===Primary teachers===
Malawi has four professional teaching Grades (PT) of primary school teachers. The PT4 teacher holds a Malawi School Certificate of Education(MSCE) which is four years of secondary school education, and a two-year Teachers Certificate. PT3 is obtained after going through interviews after serving for fours at PT4 Grade. PT2 and PT1 they are also obtained through interviews. However, PT2 is an administrative grade (Deputy Head teacher) while PT1 is reserved for the head teacher, primary education advisors and field supervisors.

===Secondary teachers===
Secondary school teachers are trained at the School of Education. This school awards three types of professional qualifications, which are: Diploma of Education, Bachelor of Education and the University Certificate of Education.

===University professors===
Malawi citizens who serve as professors constitute 30 percent of the university's faculty. In 1977, a total of 87 of the 199 working faculty or 87 percent were expatriates. While 27 percent of the professoriat were from Malawi and a further 48 percent were pursuing advanced degrees abroad. There is a need both to upgrade or develop personnel currently serving as professors and to train many more Malawians to fill these posts.

===Non-governmental organisations===
[[Tvind|DAPP]] Malawi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapp-malawi.org/|title=Welcome to DAPP Malawi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; operates 4 teacher training colleges to meet the need for more primary school teachers in rural areas.

'''''Elephant''''' is a 2003 [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] edited, written and directed by [[Gus Van Sant]]. It takes place in the fictional Watt High School, in the suburbs of [[Portland, Oregon]], and chronicles the events surrounding a school shooting, based in part on the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]]. The film begins a short time before the shooting occurs, following the lives of several characters both in and out of school, who are unaware of what is about to unfold. The film stars mostly new or non-professional actors, including [[John Robinson (American actor)|John Robinson]], [[Alex Frost]], and [[Eric Deulen]].

''Elephant'' is the second film in Van Sant's "[[Gus Van Sant#Death Trilogy|Death Trilogy]]"—the first is ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'' (2002) and the third ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'' (2005)—all three of which are based on actual events.

''Elephant'' was generally praised by critics and received the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], in which [[Patrice Chéreau]] was the head of the jury. The film was controversial for its subject matter and allegations of influence on the [[Red Lake shootings]].

==Plot==
Mr. McFarland is driving erratically down a residential street on the way to drop off his son John. John notices damage to the car and realizes that his father is drunk, so John instructs him to move to the passenger seat and let him drive.

Alex and Eric are bullied at school by the so-called [[Jock (subculture)|jocks]], one of whom diverts a teacher and throws a spitball at Alex during science class. Later, Alex and Eric are shown at home ordering weapons from a website and receiving a [[Bushmaster M4 Type Carbine|rifle]] in the mail. While Alex is taking a shower, Eric gets in with him. He claims that he has never been kissed, and the two kiss. The two formulate an attack plan. The next day, Alex and Eric prepare for the shooting, then make their way to school in silence in Alex's car.

After arriving at school, Alex and Eric encounter John outside and tell him to leave, as some "heavy shit's about to go down". Realizing what is about to happen, John attempts to warn others not to enter the school, to mixed effect as a few students listen to him but others, as well as a teacher, do not and enter into the building. He also tries to find an adult to get help from but cannot. The two gunmen then enter the school, and after their plans to blow up parts of the school with [[Improvised explosive device|propane bombs]] fail, begin [[spree killer|shooting indiscriminately]]. A friendly student named Elias photographs them entering the library where they open fire, shooting several students, including a bespectacled outcast named Michelle and presumably Elias.

Realizing that the gunfire is real, students now begin to panic, while teachers attempt to quickly evacuate the building; an African-American student named Benny silently walks the halls and helps some students escape to safety with aplomb while nearing Alex. John's father shows up and can offer no consolation to his devastated son as they see the school burning and hear gunshots and screams. The two boys separate, continuing their killing spree. Alex enters the bathroom where three popular girls named Brittany, Jordan and Nicole are, presumably shooting all three. The school principal, Mr. Luce, cornered by Eric in a hallway, begs Eric to lower his weapon and talk to him, but Eric yells, "I ain't putting ''shit'' down!" and fires at him. He does speak to Mr. Luce, however; while he is doing so, he turns without warning to see an approaching Benny and shoots and kills him before Benny could stop Eric's attack. Eric turns back to Luce and warns him to take heed of what's happened from bullied students and initially lets Mr. Luce go, before smiling evilly and changing his mind by firing several shots down the hall that strike and kill the principal.

Alex enters the cafeteria, which is strewn with overturned chairs, backpacks, several dead bodies, and numerous abandoned half-eaten lunches, and sits down. Alex picks up a cup from an abandoned lunch and casually drinks from it. Eric meets up with him, and they have a brief conversation, which ends when Alex shoots Eric in mid-sentence. Alex leaves the cafeteria, showing no emotion over shooting Eric, and discovers Carrie and Nathan in a freezer. He tauntingly recites "[[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]" to them to decide whom he should kill first. The film then cuts to credits leaving the ending ambiguous.

==Cast==
* [[Alex Frost]] as Alex, the more intelligent of the two killers, implied to be the one in charge. He is an accomplished but frustrated [[Piano|pianist]] and sketch artist. He and Eric kiss before the massacre, both citing the fact that they had never been kissed.
* Eric Deulen as Eric, a [[slacker]], Alex's friend, and the other killer. He is less intelligent than Alex, and Alex is obviously aware of this.  He is shot in the chest by Alex near the end of the film, while talking about whom he had killed earlier. 
* [[John Robinson (American actor)|John Robinson]] as John McFarland, Alex's friend who has trouble at school while managing his [[alcoholic]] father.  Alex warns him to stay away from the massacre. 
* [[Timothy Bottoms]] as Mr. McFarland, John's alcoholic father.
* [[Matt Malloy]] as Mr. Luce, the [[Principal (school)|principal]] of the school. Cornered by Eric, who briefly spares him, he is presumed dead after being shot several times.
* [[Elias McConnell]] as Elias, a [[photography]] student building his portfolio with portraits of other students.
* Nathan Tyson and Carrie Finklea as Nathan and Carrie, a popular [[lifeguard]]/[[American football|football player]] and his girlfriend. Alex taunts them with [[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]].  
* Kristen Hicks as Michelle, a [[nerdy]] girl ashamed of her body. The film follows her through the locker room and into the [[library]] where she assists. She is the first to die during the massacre.
* Brittany Mountain, Jordan Taylor, and Nicole George as Brittany, Jordan, and Nicole, three [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimic]] girls who talk incessantly, gripe about parents, and squabble with one another.
* Bennie Dixon as Benny, an athletic student who helps Acadia escape out of a window before approaching Eric. He is shot and presumed dead.
* Alicia Miles as Acadia, a close friend of John and a member of the [[Gay-Straight Alliance]]. She is assumed to have a [[panic disorder]] which causes her to freeze and break down in times of fear or stress. During the shooting, Benny discovers her standing still in a classroom and helps her escape from the school and the shooters.

==Production==
[[File:Blind men and elephant3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The title was inspired by the parable of the [[blind men and an elephant]].]]
The film began as a [[television film]] that Van Sant had intended to make about the [[Columbine High School massacre]]; eventually, the idea of a [[non-fiction|factual account]] was dropped.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

''Elephant'' was filmed in Van Sant's hometown, [[Portland, Oregon]], in late 2002, on the former campus of Whitaker Middle School (previously [[Adams High School (Portland, Oregon)|Adams High School]]). Whitaker was closed by the Portland Public Schools in 2001 due to structural problems and safety concerns with the school building. The Whitaker/Adams building, completed in 1969, was torn down in 2007.

The script was "written" to its final form during shooting, with cast members [[improvisation|improvising]] freely and collaborating in the direction of scenes.

[[JT LeRoy]] (a pen name for author [[Laura Albert]]) is credited as an associate producer for the film.

The title ''Elephant'' is a tribute to the 1989 [[BBC]] [[short film]] [[Elephant (1989 film)|of the same name]], directed by [[Alan Clarke]]. Van Sant originally believed Clarke's title referred to the parable of the [[blind men and an elephant]], in which several blind men try to describe an elephant, and each draws different conclusions based on which body part he touched, and Van Sant's film uses that interpretation, as the same general timeline is shown multiple times from multiple viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Bassett, ''The arc and the machine'', 2007, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Van Sant discovered Clarke's film referred to the phrase "[[elephant in the room]]" (the collective denial of some obvious problem).&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Bassett, ''The arc and the machine'', 2007, p.181&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, [[Gus Van Sant]] named [[Chantal Akerman]]'s film ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' (1975) an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Cinema/News/Chantal-Akerman-retour-sur-la-carriere-d-une-cineaste-discrete-3002285&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke's film ''Elephant'' reflects on [[sectarian violence]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. Van Sant's [[minimalism|minimalist]] style and use of tracking shots mirrors Clarke's film.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Dennis. [http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0436,lim,56529,20.html "Film"], ''Village Voice'', 31 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cowan, Noah.|url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/online_features/cannes2003.php |title=Cannes 2003|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawing of an elephant as well as an image of an elephant on a bed throw can be seen in Alex's room while he plays the piano.

==Release==
The film competed at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2003. Van Sant claimed audiences in attendance at Cannes argued over its quality, leading to altercations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/cannes-film-festival-boos-greet-the-sea-of-trees-1.3077215 |title=Cannes Film Festival: Boos greet The Sea of Trees |author=Thomson Reuters |date=16 May 2015 |accessdate=21 June 2017 |work=[[CBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Elephant'' premiered in [[North America]] at a benefit for the [[Outside In (organization)|Outside In]] youth shelter at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, in [[Portland, Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emanuellevy.com/review/elephant-van-sants-controversial-film/ |title=Elephant: Van Sant's Controversial Film |author=[[Emanuel Levy]] |date=3 September 2003 |accessdate=21 June 2017 |work=Emanuellevy.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  on Saturday, October 4, 2003, with several teenagers who appeared in the film in attendance. The film was released for incremental distribution by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] in 38 theaters in the United States, beginning October 24, 2003.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in a [[limited release]] in North America on October 24, 2003 in 6 theaters and grossed $93,356 with an average of $15,559 per theater ranking 36th at the box office. It ended up making $1,266,955 domestically and $8,745,067 elsewhere for a total of $10,012,022, above its $3 million budget.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo.com"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Elephant'' received mainly positive reviews from critics and has a score of 73% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 158 reviews with an average rating of 7.1 out of 10. The critical consensus states "''The movie's spare and unconventional style will divide viewers''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elephant/ |title=Elephant (2003) |accessdate=21 June 2017 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also has a score of 70 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 37 critics indicating "generally favourable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/elephant |title=Elephant |accessdate=21 June 2017 |work=[[Metacritic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] praised the film and gave it 4 out of 4 stars writing "Gus Van Sant's ''Elephant'' is a violent movie in the sense that many innocent people are shot dead. But it isn't violent in the way it presents those deaths. There is no pumped-up style, no lingering, no release, no climax. Just implacable, poker-faced, flat, uninflected death. Truffaut said it was hard to make an anti-war film because war was exciting even if you were against it. Van Sant has made an anti-violence film by draining violence of energy, purpose, glamor, reward and social context. It just happens. I doubt that ''Elephant'' will ever inspire anyone to copy what they see on the screen. Much more than the insipid message movies shown in social studies classes, it might inspire useful discussion and soul-searching among high school students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/elephant-2003 |title=ELEPHANT |date=7 November 2003 |author=Roger Ebert |work=Rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red Lake shootings controversy==
The [[Red Lake shootings]] that occurred in 2005 was briefly blamed on the film, as it was viewed by gunman [[Jeff Weise]] 17 days prior to the event.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, David. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/30/national/main683990.shtml "Red Lake Shooting Conspiracy?"], CBS/Associated Press, 30 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Weise said that he brought the film over to a friend's house and skipped ahead to parts that showed two students planning and carrying out a school massacre. Although they talked about the film afterwards, Weise said and did nothing to make anyone suspect what he was planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvotv3.com/Global/story.asp?S=3126813 |title="Suspected Red Lake shooter watched movie about a school attack" |accessdate=2007-04-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503084900/http://www.ktvotv3.com/Global/story.asp?S=3126813 |archivedate=May 3, 2007 |df= }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32698">{{about|the UK term|other uses|Religious school}}
A '''faith school''' is a [[school]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that teaches a general curriculum but which has a particular religious character or formal links with a religious organisation. The term is most commonly applied to [[state school|state-funded]] faith schools, although many independent schools also have religious characteristics.

There are various types of state-funded faith school, including [[Voluntary aided school|Voluntary Aided]] (VA) schools, [[Voluntary controlled school|Voluntary Controlled]] (VC) schools, and Faith [[Academy (English school)|Academies]].

Schools with a ''formal'' faith designation may give priority to applicants who are of the faith, and specific exemptions from Section 85 of the [[Equality Act 2010]] enable them to do that.&lt;ref name="dfe2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=equalityAct2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15|work=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, state-funded faith schools must admit other applicants if they cannot fill all of their places and must ensure that their admission arrangements comply with the School Admissions Code.&lt;ref name=dfe2011&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/b0066996/faith-schools/maintained|title=Faith schools: Maintained faith schools|publisher=Department for Education (2011-12-06)|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=admissionsCode&gt;{{cite web|title=School admissions code|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code|work=gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that legislation varies between the [[countries of the United Kingdom]] since education is a devolved matter.

==England==
The [[Education Act 1944]] introduced the requirement for daily prayers in all state-funded schools, but later acts changed this requirement to a daily "[[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective act of worship]]", the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]] being the most recent.  This also requires such acts of worship to be "wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character".&lt;ref name=CollectiveGuide&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101104032112/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/teachingandlearning/subjects/re/worship/ Collective worship]. www.teachernet.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "mainly" means that acts related to other faiths can be carried out providing the majority are Christian.&lt;ref name=CatholicEducation&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716190911/http://www.cesew.org.uk/standard.asp?id=4464 The Churches and Collective Worship in Schools]. Approved by the Churches’ Joint Education Policy Committee on 9 May 2006. Catholic Education Service&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent schools are exempt from this provision, so it has always been possible to have an independent (not state-funded) school with no act of worship or with acts of worship relating to non-Christian religions.  However, many schools that were originally church schools are now largely state funded, as are some Jewish schools. These are allowed to have acts of worship "in accordance with the beliefs of the religion or denomination specified for the school".&lt;ref name=CollectiveGuide/&gt; Until 1997, the UK funded only Christian or Jewish faith schools (Muslim schools existed but were privately funded), but the [[Blair ministry|1997–2007 Labour Government]] expanded this to other religions, and began using the term "faith school".&lt;ref name=GuardianNov2001&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/nov/14/schools.uk2 |publisher=The Guardian |date=14 November 2001 |title=Facts about Faith Schools |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Education in England]] includes various types of state-funded faith school, including [[Voluntary aided school|Voluntary Aided]] (VA) schools, [[Voluntary controlled school|Voluntary Controlled]] (VC) schools, and Faith [[Academy (English school)|Academies]].

The two main providers of faith schools in England are the [[Church of England]] and the [[Catholic Education Service]].&lt;ref name=coe&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/education/schools/ Schools and the Church of England: Church schools]. Cofe.anglican.org (2011-06-25). Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CES&gt;{{cite web|title=Catholic Education Service|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org.uk/|work=CES Website|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, about one third of the 20,000 state funded schools in England were faith schools,&lt;ref name=BBCDec2011&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15985615 BBC News 3 Dec 2011] Catholic faith schools in academy switch&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 7,000 in total, of which 68% were Church of England schools and 30% were [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|Roman Catholic]]. There were 42 [[Jews|Jewish]], 12 [[Muslim]], 3 [[Sikh]] and 1 [[Hindu]] faith schools.&lt;ref name=dfe2011/&gt;

Following the [[Academies Act 2010|2010 Academy Act]], many faith schools converted to [[Academy (English school)|Academy]] status, and are sometimes known as '''Faith Academies'''. Many [[Free school (England)|Free Schools]] have also been created with a religious designation, and these are also sometimes referred to as [[List of free schools in England which are formally designated as faith schools|Faith Academies]]. All academies can set pay and conditions for staff, and are not obliged to follow the National Curriculum.&lt;ref name=BBCDec2011/&gt;  However the Department for Education "will not approve any application where we have any concerns about [[creationism]] being taught as a valid [[scientific theory]], or about schools failing to teach [[Introduction to evolution|evolution]] adequately as part of their science curricula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/417375/free-schools-how-to-apply-feb-2015_final_-_updaed_25-03-2015.pdf |title=Free schools: how to apply |date=February 2015 |publisher=Department of Education |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/freeschools/freeschoolsfaqs/a0075656/free-schools-faqs-curriculum|title=Free Schools FAQs - curriculum|publisher=Department of Education|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary Aided and Voluntary Controlled faith schools follow the same [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] as state schools, with the exception of religious studies, where they are free to limit it to their own beliefs.

==Wales==

==Scotland==
Although schools existed in Scotland prior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], widespread public [[education in Scotland]] was pioneered by the [[Church of Scotland]], which handed over its parish schools to the state in 1872. Charitably funded [[Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholic]] schools were brought into the state system by the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1918]]. This introduced state funding of Catholic schools, which kept their distinct religious education, but access to schools by Catholic clergy and requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church were retained. The Catholic schools remain as "faith schools." The others are effectively secular and are known as "[[non-denominational]]" schools. The subject of religious education continues to be taught in these non-denominational institutions, as is required by [[Scots Law]].

In Scottish Catholic schools, employment of non-Catholics can be restricted by the Church; often, one of the requirements for Catholic applicants is to possess a certificate that has been signed by their parish priest, although each [[diocese]] has its own variation on the method of approval.&lt;ref name="lack"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2007-12-04|author=Gordon Cairns|title=My lack of faith stopped me being accepted|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,2221130,00.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Catholic applicants are not required to provide any religious documentation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Certain positions, such as headteachers, deputy heads, religious education teachers and guidance teachers are required to be Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name="lack"/&gt; Scottish faith schools have the practice of school-wide daily assembly/worship; some Catholic schools even have their own prayer. Whilst maintaining a strong Catholic ethos, Scottish Catholic schools have long welcomed pupils from other faith backgrounds, though they tend to give precedence to non-Catholics who come from religious families and a large number of Muslims also go to Catholic schools.

The Imam Muhammad Zakariya School, [[Dundee]] was the only Muslim school in the UK outside England, and was an independent school,&lt;ref name=amsDundee&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100409102936/http://www.ams-uk.org/about-us/members/26-dundee Association of Muslim Schools: Dundee]&lt;/ref&gt; until its closure in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4643080.stm | work=BBC News | title=Independent Muslim school to shut | date=24 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
In the early part of the 20th century, the majority of schools were owned and run by either the Catholic or Protestant churches.&lt;ref name=Bain&gt;[http://www.deni.gov.uk/review_of_education.pdf The Bain Report] (2006) Schools for the Future&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant schools were gradually transferred to state ownership under [[local government in Northern Ireland#Education and libraries|Education and Library Boards]] (ELBs) responsible to the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]], but with an Act of Parliament to ensure that the ethos of the schools conformed to this variety of Christianity, and giving the churches certain rights with respect to governance.&lt;ref name=Bain/&gt;

The Catholic schools are not owned by the state but by trustees, who are senior figures in the Church. However, all running costs are paid by the ELBs and all capital costs by the Department of Education.&lt;ref name=Bain/&gt; The employment of teachers is controlled by the [[Council for Catholic Maintained Schools]], who are the largest employer of teachers (8,500) in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=Bain/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCMS&gt;[http://www.onlineccms.com/ http://www.onlineccms.com/]. CCMS Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; The 547 Catholic schools teach 46% of the children of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=CatholicCommission&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation-ni.com/ Northern Ireland Commission for Catholic Education]. Catholiceducation-ni.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers are not required to be of the Catholic faith, but all those in Catholic primary schools must hold a Certificate in Religious Education.&lt;ref name=CCMS/&gt;

While the Protestant and Catholic schools were theoretically open to all, they were almost entirely of their own religious sectors, so starting in the 1980s, a number of so-called [[integrated education|integrated schools]] were established.&lt;ref name=Bain/&gt;

As of 2010, the great majority of schools in Northern Ireland are either Catholic or Protestant, with relatively few integrated, a situation called "benign [[apartheid]]" by [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]], the [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister of Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=BelfastTel&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/separate-schools-benign-apartheid-14978046.html [[Belfast Telegraph]] 15 October 2010] Separate schools "benign apartheid"&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of 2010 English school data by ''[[The Guardian]]'' found that state faith schools were not taking a fair share of the poorest pupils in their local areas, as indicated by free school meal entitlement. Not only was this so at the overall national level, but also in the postcode areas nearby the schools. This suggested selection by religion in England was leading to selection of children from more well-off families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/05/church-schools-shun-poorest-pupils |title=Church schools shun poorest pupils |author=Jessica Shepherd and Simon Rogers |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Frank Dobson]], to increase inclusivity and lessening social division, proposed an amendment to the Education Bill (for England and Wales) to limit the selection rights of faith schools by requiring them to offer at least a quarter of places to children whose parents belong to another or no religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Faith school rebels defeated|date=2002-02-07|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1803226.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was defeated in Parliament.

However, in October 2006, Bishop [[Kenneth William Stevenson|Kenneth Stevenson]], speaking on behalf of the [[Church of England]], said, "I want to make a specific commitment that all new Church of England schools should have at least 25% of places available to children with no requirement that they be from practising Christian families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2006-10-03|author=Alexandra Smith|title=Church promises school places to non-Christians|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,1886650,00.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment applies only to new schools, not existing ones.

In 2005, [[David Bell (British civil servant)|David Bell]], the head of the [[Office for Standards in Education]] said "Faith should not be blind. I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society. This growth in faith schools needs to be carefully but sensitively monitored by government to ensure that pupils receive an understanding of not only their own faith but of other faiths and the wider tenets of British society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic schools are threat to national identity|author=Tony Halpin|publisher=The Times|date=2005-01-18| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1445275,00.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised Islamic schools in particular, calling them a "threat to national identity".

Although not state schools, there are around 700 unregulated [[madrassas]] in Britain, attended by approximately 100,000 children of Muslim parents. Doctor [[Ghayasuddin Siddiqui]], the leader of the [[Muslim Parliament of Great Britain]], has called for them to be subject to government inspection following publication of a 2006 report that highlighted widespread physical and sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2006-03-22|author=Alexandra Smith|title=Call for national register of mosque schools|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,1736861,00.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, attempts to create the first secular school in Britain were blocked. Dr Paul Kelley, head of [[Monkseaton High School]] in Tyneside, proposed plans to eliminate the daily act of Christian worship and cause "a fundamental change in the relationship with the school and the established religion of the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,2175879,00.html|title=Crisis of faith in first secular school|first=Anushka|last= Asthana|author-link=Anushka Asthana|date=2007-09-23|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the Krishna-Avanti Hindu school in north-west London became the first school in the United Kingdom to make [[vegetarianism]] a condition of entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindu school is first to make vegetarianism a condition of entry|publisher=The Guardian|author=Polly Curtis|date=2007-11-29| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,2218801,00.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parents of pupils are expected to abstain from alcohol to prove they are followers of the faith.

In November 2007, the [[Jewish Free School]] in north London was found to be discriminating for giving preference to children with distant Jewish relations in its under-subscription criteria. Giving preference to children born to Jewish mothers is permitted as it is a religious rather than a race issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2007-11-28|author=Polly Curtis|title=Jewish school told to change admission rules|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,2218154,00.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the [[List of Committees of the United Kingdom Parliament|Commons Children, Schools and Families Select Committee]] raised concerns about the government's plans for expanding faith schooling.&lt;ref name="lipsett"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-01-02|author=Anthea Lipsett and agencies|title=
MPs to voice concerns over faith schools|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,2234164,00.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general secretary of the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]], Dr. Mary Bousted, said "Unless there are crucial changes in the way many faith schools run we fear divisions in society will be exacerbated. In our increasingly multi-faith and secular society it is hard to see why our taxes should be used to fund schools which discriminate against the majority of children and potential staff because they are not of the same faith".&lt;ref name="lipsett"/&gt;

Long standing opponents of faith schools include [[Humanists UK]] and [[National Secular Society]]. In 2008, the campaign group the [[Accord (coalition)|Accord Coalition]] was founded to ensure state funded schools teach about the broad range of beliefs in society; do not discriminate on religious grounds and are made suitable for all children, regardless of their or their parents’ religious or non-religious beliefs. The campaign, which seeks to reform the faith school sector, brings together a range of groups and individuals, including educationalists, civil rights activists and both the religious and non-religious.

In June 2013, the [[Fair Admissions Campaign]] was officially launched,&lt;ref name="BHA_FairAdmissions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Admissions Campaign|url=https://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/schools-and-education/faith-schools/fair-admissions-campaign/|publisher=British Humanist Association|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the campaign aims to abolish the selection of pupils based on their faith or that of their parents at state funded schools in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Ban faith-based school selection' demands new campaign|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22798206|accessdate=2 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has support from both religious and non-religious organizations at both the national and local level including the [[Accord Coalition]], the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the British Humanist Association, [[British Muslims for Secular Democracy]], ICoCo Foundation, the [[Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education]], [[Ekklesia (think tank)|Ekklesia]], the Hindu Academy, the Liberal Democrat Education Association, Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign, the [[Runnymede Trust]], the [[Socialist Educational Association]], the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]].&lt;ref name="BHA_FairAdmissions"/&gt;

In October 2013, the [[Theos (think tank)|Theos Think Tank]] published a research study on faith schools, titled ''More than an Educated Guess: Assessing the evidence'', which concluded that  there is evidence for the "faith schools effect boosting academic performance but concludes that this may reflect admissions policies rather than the ethos of the school."&lt;ref name=Bingham&gt;{{cite news|last=Bingham|first=John|title=Faith schools protests dragging children into ideological 'battleground'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10342489/Faith-schools-protests-dragging-children-into-ideological-battleground-bishop.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=8 October 2013|location=London|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Pritchard (bishop)|John Pritchard]], Chair of the Church of England's Education Board, welcomed the results of the study, stating that "I am pleased to see that this report recognises two very important facts. The first is that faith schools contribute successfully to community cohesion; they are culturally diverse and there is no evidence that there is any social division on racial or ethnic grounds. The second important fact acknowledged in the Theos report is that faith schools do not intentionally filter or skew admissions in a way which is designed to manipulate the system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bishop of Oxford welcomes report by think-tank Theos on faith schools|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2013/09/bishop-of-oxford-welcomes-report-by-think-tank-theos-on-faith-schools.aspx|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also stated that much "of the debate [about faith schools] is by nature ideological, revolving around the relative rights and responsibilities of parents, schools and government in a liberal and plural society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More than an Educated Guess: Assessing the evidence on faith schools|url=http://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/publications/2013/10/02/more-than-an-educated-guess-assessing-the-evidence-on-faith-schools|publisher=Theos Think Tank|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishop of Oxford]] concurred, stating that "children are being denied the chance to go to some of Britain’s best schools because antireligious campaigners have turned attempts to expand faith schools into an ideological battle-ground".&lt;ref name="Bingham"/&gt;  Responding to the report, [[British Humanist Association|BHA]] Chief Executive Andrew Copson commented, "Although the report masquerades as a new, impartial, survey of evidence surrounding "faith” schools, it is in fact more like apologetics for such schools. The report omits evidence, misrepresents evidence and even makes basic errors about types of school and types of data that undermine its claim to be taken seriously.

'''Gask''', or ''gasque'', is a kind of [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[student]] [[party]] which starts with a more or less formal dinner. The word is believed to have originated from the card game [[vira (game)|vira]], popular in the 19th century.

In some cities, gask is generally used to refer to a party with a formal dress code. Students at [[Stockholm University]] and the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] generally use the term gasque to refer to a gask where the dress code is a [[student boilersuit]].

In some cases, Gasque might also be the name of an actual building, often a building belonging to the [[Students' union|student union]] arranging the gasque, as in the case of [[Chalmers University of Technology]] in [[Gothenburg]].

Many universities also have thematic gasques, as well as slasques, which are less tidy gatherings.

The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/general-history-of-africa/ '''General History of Africa''' ('''GHA''')] is a two-phase project undertaken by [[UNESCO]] from 1964 to the present. The 1964 General Conference of UNESCO, during its 13th Session, instructed the Organization to undertake this initiative after the newly independent African Member States expressed a strong desire to reclaim their cultural identity, to rectify widespread ignorance about their Continent’s history, and to break free of discriminatory prejudices. '''Phase One,''' which began in 1964 and was completed in 1999, consisted of writing and publishing eight volumes which highlight the shared heritage of the peoples of [[Africa]]. '''Phase Two,''' which began in 2009, focuses on the elaboration of history curricula and [[pedagogical]] materials for primary and secondary schools on the basis of the eight volumes of the GHA. Phase Two also focuses on the promotion of the use and harmonization of the teaching of this collection in higher education institutions throughout the Continent. Phase Two also concerns the implementation of these materials in schools in Africa and the [[Diaspora]]. The objective of both Phase One and Phase Two of the project is to re-appropriate the interpretation and writing of African histories and to demonstrate the contribution of African cultures past and present to the history of humanity at large.

==History==

:"My own background, the experience I gained as a teacher and as chairman... taught me how necessary it was for the education of young people and for the information of the public at large to have a history book produced by scholars with inside knowledge of the problems and hopes of Africa and with the ability to apprehend the Continent in its entirety."
:: - [[Amadou Mahtar M'Bow]], former Director General of UNESCO (1974-1987)
&lt;br /&gt;
The project encompasses two of UNESCO’s key priorities- Africa and Education. Africa, in terms of a response to urgent development needs at the national level and to accompany the regional integration process; and education because this issue is a fundamental human right and the very basis of development and responsible citizenry. African peoples expressed their desire to “decolonize” the history of their Continent in order to deconstruct the traditional prejudices and clarify the truth of the African past. The project also takes into consideration modern teaching tools, such as internet resources and multimedia platforms, to ensure that learning is an interactive discovery process. Africa was never cut off from the rest of the world, and benefitted from mutual exchange and influences with Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. The slave trade, slavery, and colonization had a considerable impact on the fragmentation of the Continent. The African Diaspora that resulted contributed in a significant manner to the creation of new cultures and societies. The Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa aims to develop curriculum that highlights the African contribution to the progress of Humanity, African shared values, interaction with the rest of the world.

In this perspective, the creation of the [[African Union]] (AU) and the implementation of the [[NEPAD]] philosophy of developing Africa-led solutions to African challenges offered a new and favorable context for a political leadership committed to African regional integration and provided a mechanism for addressing history teaching within the continent as a whole.  Furthermore, the Action Plan of the Second Decade for [[Education in Africa]] (2006 to 2015), which emphasizes the strengthening of the links between education and culture and improving the quality of pedagogical content, constitutes an ideal framework for the implementation of the project.

Article 7 of the Charter of African Cultural Renaissance adopted in 2006 in Khartoum at the Heads of State Summit stipulates that:&lt;br /&gt;
 
:“African States commit themselves to work for African Renaissance. They agree on the need for reconstruction of the historical memory and conscience of Africa and the African Diaspora. They consider that the general History published by UNESCO constitutes a valid base for teaching the History of Africa and recommend its dissemination, including in African languages, as well as the publication of its abridged and simplified versions for wider audiences.”

==Phase One==
'''(1964–1999)''' Following their decolonization in the early 1960s, African countries expressed a strong desire to recover their ownership of their past and the production of knowledge regarding their heritage. The African member states of UNESCO were then called upon to re-affirm their cultural identities and reinforce the common aspiration to achieve African unity. Part of these efforts included combating certain preconceptions including the assumption that the lack of written sources made it difficult to engage in serious study or production of African history. The conventional reading of history also needed to be challenged in order to depict a more accurate picture of the African continent, of its cultural diversity, and its contribution to the general progress of humankind. Thus, at its 16th Session (1964), the General Conference of UNESCO invited the Director-General to undertake the elaboration of a General History of Africa. In this framework, the General History of Africa was written and published in eight volumes, with a main edition in English, French and Arabic. Additional publications have been produced in Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, German, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese. Furthermore, twelve studies and documents on related themes as well as an abridged version of the main edition in English, French, Kiswahili, Hausa and Fulfulde were published. This tremendous undertaking represented thirty five years of cooperation between three hundred and fifty experts from Africa and from the rest of the world.  This work involved some of the most eminent African scholars such as [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], [[Joseph Ki-Zerbo]], [[Theophile Obenga]], [[Ali Mazrui]], [[Gamal Mokhtar]], [[Bethwell A. Ogot]], etc.

The main preoccupation of Phase 1 was to provide a culturally relevant perspective based on an interdisciplinary approach with a focus on the history of ideas and civilizations, societies and institutions. To that end, it was envisaged to develop an African centered point of view using African sources, such as oral traditions, art forms and linguistics. It was decided as well to adopt a continental perspective of Africa as a whole avoiding the usual dichotomy between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. This shift in perspective is reflected by the significant number of renowned African scholars who contributed to this project as members of the International Scientific Committee, editors and authors.

To tackle this task, made all the more complex and difficult by the vast range of sources and the fact that documents were widely scattered, UNESCO had to proceed in stages. The first stages '''(1965 to 1969)''' consisted of gathering documentation and planning the work. Several meetings were held and campaigns were conducted in the field to collect oral traditions and establish regional documentation centers. In addition, several activities were undertaken: including the collection of unpublished manuscripts in Arabic and [[Ajami]] (manuscripts in African languages written with Arabic alphabet), the compilation of archival inventories and the preparation of a Guide to the Sources of the History of Africa, culled from the archives and libraries of a number of European and Asian countries and later published in nine volumes.

The second stage '''(1969 to 1971)''' was devoted to the deliberation of complex substantial and methodological questions raised by the compilation of the GHA. It was decided that the GHA should cover three million years of African history, in eight volumes, published in English, Arabic, French, and in African languages such as Kiswahili, Hausa, and Fulfulde.

The next stage '''(1971 to 1999)''' consisted of the drafting and publication. This began with the establishment of the International Scientific Committee to ensure the intellectual and scientific responsibility of the work and oversee the drafting and publication of the volumes. During this period, UNESCO organized scientific colloquia and symposia on topics related to the history of Africa most of which were overlooked by researchers. The results of these meetings were published in a series of books entitled “UNESCO Studies and Documents -The General History of Africa”. Twelve studies were published covering a wide range of subjects including: the Slave trade, relations between Africa and the Arab world, relations between Africa and the Indian Ocean,and the role of youth and women.

Bearing in mind that history teaching is instrumental in shaping peoples’ identities and in understanding the common ties underlying the cultural diversity in any region, and in order to implement one of the goals initially set for the General History of Africa by its initiators, UNESCO, in collaboration with the [[African Union Commission]], launched in March 2009,  Phase II of GHA entitled the “Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa” project.
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:General History of Africa Volumes.jpg|thumb|center|Eight volumes of the General History of Africa]]

==Phase Two==
'''(2009–present)''' In 2009 UNESCO launched the second phase of the project focusing on the implementation of the GHA entitled, the “Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa.” This phase, which constitutes a priority in the cooperation between UNESCO and the African Union, falls within the framework of the Action Plan of the Second Decade for Education in Africa (2006–2015). The Action Plan emphasizes the strengthening of the links between education and culture and improving the quality of pedagogical contents such as internet resources and audiovisual materials. It further corresponds to recommendations made following several meetings organized by UNESCO before and after the completion of the first phase of the GHA.

In order to successfully implement the second phase of the project, UNESCO has had to have the project validated by different African institutional and academic stakeholders including the Ministers of Education and various professional associations including historians, history teachers, pedagogues, et al. At the Ministers of Education of the COMEDAF meeting in November 2009, the African Ministers reaffirmed their support for the project and recalled the political leadership of the African Union on the Project. This continued cooperation between the Commission of the African Union and UNESCO has been necessary to facilitate the appropriation of the project.

'''Objectives:'''&lt;br /&gt;
“This project gives us a formidable opportunity to develop a pan-African vision that also highlights the contribution of African cultures and civilizations to humankind.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001882/188292e.pdf#xml=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=4D2ED2D9_2_24&amp;hits_rec=1&amp;hits_lng=eng|title= Address by Ms Irina Bokova Director-General of UNESCO on the occasion of the Regional Conference on the "Pedagogical Use of the General history of Africa"|publisher=UNESCO |date= 16 June 2010 |work= Address by Ms Irina Bokova Director-General of UNESCO on the occasion of the Regional Conference on the “Pedagogical Use of the General history of Africa” |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: - Irina Bokova, Director General of UNESCO June 16, 2010

[[File:Brochure Front Cover Image.jpg|thumb|The Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa Brochure]]

The main objective of Phase Two, entitled "The Pedagogical Use of the General History of Africa" is to contribute to the regenerating of the teaching of African history on the basis of the General History of Africa in African Union member States with the view to promote the African regional integration process. In particular, the project aims to:
* develop common content for use in African primary and secondary schools, for three different age groups (under 12, 13-16 and 17-19) as well as an historical atlas and an educational CD-Rom. The content could, if necessary, be adapted to local circumstances without changing the regional scope;
* improve teacher training in light of the latest findings in historical research and advances made in the methodology and methods of history teaching. A teachers’ guide will be elaborated and guidelines to reinforce initial and in-service training of primary and secondary school teachers will be defined.
* promote the teaching of and harmonize the use of the GHA in higher education institutions across the continent.

'''Implementation:'''&lt;br /&gt;
To implement the project, UNESCO established a ten-member Scientific Committee (SC) representing the five sub regions of the Continent, entrusted with the intellectual and scientific responsibility of the project. The committee members were designated by the Director General of UNESCO in February 2009 after a series of consultations held with different partners and stakeholders including: the African Union, the Africa Group of UNESCO, the donor country, the African Historian Association, the International Association of Historians, and members of the former International Scientific Committee established for the first phase of the Project. These members are:
Professor Alaa El-din Shaheen (Egypt), Professor Taieb El Bahloul (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Professor Sifiso Ndlovu (South Africa), Professor Amakobe Florida Karani (Kenya), Professor [[Adame Ba Konaré]] (Mali), Professor Jean Michel Mabeko-Tali (Congo), Professor Lily Mafela (Botswana), Professor Elikia M’bokolo (D.R. Congo), Professor Mamadou N’doye (Senegal), Professor Bahru Zewde (Ethiopia).

The aforementioned members were installed on February 24, 2009 in the framework of the Forum for African Regional and Sub-Regional Organizations to Support Cooperation between UNESCO and NEPAD (FORASUN) that took place in Tripoli (Libya) from February 20–24, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001839/183933e.pdf

'''''George Lazăr''''' is a cultural magazine published in Bârlad. The magazine was established on April 15, 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://turismbarlad.ro/en/history/|work=Regio|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Solomon Haliţă]]. The editorial committee included G. Constantinescu Râmniceanu, Gheorghe Ghibănescu, Gavril Onişor, V.G. Diaconescu and L. Apostolescu.

The main objective of the magazine was to cover subjects of interest for the teaching staff. However, besides pedagogy, the magazine also presented articles related to literature, science and culture. The name of the magazine evokes [[Gheorghe Lazăr]], the founder of the first Romanian language school in Bucharest. The magazine promoted the nationalism of [[Simion Bărnuțiu]] while he was professor at the [[University of Iaşi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.scribd.com/docs/35ksy3e0ozd2o.txt] Ion Oprea - Dorohoi, capitala ţării de sus în presa vremii 1874-2005 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/ziarele-de-ieri.html] Ziarele de ieri - Evenimentul, May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The pedagogical publicistic activity is continuated in Barlad by ”[[Tribuna pedagogică]]” magazin &lt;ref&gt; http://www.bcucluj.ro/re/catalogold/view2.php?g=http://www.bcucluj.ro/re/catalogold/cp/pdf/t/r/Tribuna%20pedagogica.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (from 1922 until 1923), and by the ”[[Îndrumări pedagogice]]” magazin (from 1931 until 1939).

'''Heather McHugh''' (born August 20, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[poet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/heather_mchugh|title=Heather McHugh - Poems, Biography, Quotes|website=famouspoetsandpoems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Heather McHugh, a poet, translator, educator and caregiver-respite provider, was born in [[San Diego, California]], to Canadian parents.  They raised McHugh in [[Gloucester Point, Virginia]]. There, her father directed the marine biological laboratory on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]]. She began writing poetry at age five and claims to have become an expert "eavesdropper" by the age of twelve.  At the age of seventeen, she entered [[Harvard University]].  One notable work was ''Hinge &amp; Sign: Poems 1968-1993'', which won the Bingham Poetry Prize of the Boston Book Review and the Pollack-Harvard Review Prize, and which was named by ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' a ''Notable Book of the Year''.  Another was "Glottal Stop: Poems by Paul Celan" which, with [[Nikolai B. Popov]], she co-translated and introduced; the book won the Griffin International Poetry Prize.

McHugh was elected a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1999.  She taught for some 40 years at American colleges and universities, including the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle; and she still takes some students through the low-residency [[Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers]].

In 2009, she was awarded the [[MacArthur Foundation]] "[[MacArthur Fellows Program|Genius Grant]]" for her work.&lt;ref name=lacitis&gt;{{citation |last=Lacitis |first=Erik |title=2 from Seattle win $500,000 "genius grants" | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=September 22, 2009 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009915541_webgeniusgrants22m.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011-2012, she started the non-profit CAREGIFTED ( http://caregifted.org ) to provide respite and tribute to long-term caregivers of the severely disabled and chronically ill.  For her work there she received notice from Encore.org's Purpose Prizes.

== Biography ==
{{cleanup|section|date=May 2009}}

McHugh has published eight books of poetry, one collection of critical essays, and four books of translation. She has received numerous awards and critical recognition in all of these areas, including several [[Pushcart Prize]]s, the Griffin Prize in poetry, and many others. Her poems resist contemporary identity politics. She also rejects categorization as a confessional poet, although she studied with [[Robert Lowell]] during the time when that described his work.

Her primary education included parochial school, where she credits a nun's emphasis on grammar as an early influence. When McHugh was a student at [[Yorktown High School (Virginia)|Yorktown High School]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], a teacher advised McHugh against applying to [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]], making her determined to get in. She arrived in Cambridge at age 17 and graduated with honors, receiving her B.A. from Harvard in 1970. She was a Fellow at Cummington Community for the Arts in 1970, and entered graduate school at the [[University of Denver]] in 1971, having already published a poem in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. She began teaching there, and received an [[Academy of American Poets]] prize in 1972. After earning her M.A. in 1972, McHugh received [[MacDowell Colony]] fellowships in 1973, 1974, and 1976. In 1974, she also received her first of three [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grants in poetry. McHugh was the poet-in-residence at [[Stephens College]] in [[Missouri]] between 1974 and 1976; she worked as an associate professor of English at the State University of New York at Binghamton between 1976 and 1982.

At 29, she completed a manuscript of poems titled ''Dangers'' (1976), that was a winner of [[Houghton Mifflin]] Co.'s New Poetry Series Competition, and was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1977. After a [[Yaddo]] Colony fellowship in 1980, her second book, titled ''A World of Difference: Poems'' (1981), was published by Houghton Mifflin. McHugh was 33. During this time, she was a visiting professor at [[Warren Wilson College]] in the M.F.A. Program for Writers in [[North Carolina]]; at [[Columbia University]] in New York between 1980 and 1981; and at the [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1982. During 1987, she was the Holloway Lecturer at the [[University of California in Berkeley]]. While the top journals published her poetry, some poems were also anthologized in prestigious collections, and top critics called her observations astute and noteworthy as well as courageous.

That same year ''World of Difference'' came out, her first book of translations was published. Her poetry translation of [[Jean Follain]]'s French work is titled ''D'après tout: Poems by Jean Follain'' (1981) and was published by Princeton University Press in the Lockhart Poetry in Translation series. In 1984, she became the Milliman Writer-In-Residence at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. The residency was initiated that same year, and McHugh filled the position until 2011 when she was appointed Pollock Professor of Creative Writing. During the 1980s, McHugh worked a great deal on translation, partly due to her alliance with her co-translator and husband at that time, who also taught at the University of Washington. Her translation work includes well-known international poets like [[Jean Follain|Follain]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], as well as [[Romania]]n Jewish poet of the Holocaust Paul Antschel, who wrote under the pseudonym [[Paul Celan]].  This latter translation, entitled ''Glottal Stop: Poems by Paul Celan'', would win the Griffin International Poetry Prize. (See reference below.)

Her skill in translating literature by Slavic writers became even more evident with the publication of ''Because the Sea Is Black: Poems of Blaga Dimitrova'' (1989) featuring the work of a [[Bulgaria]]n poet and novelist. [[Blaga Dimitrova|Dimitrova]], one of the best-loved writers in her homeland, became the first democratically elected vice-president of her country after the fall of communism. McHugh translated Dimitrova's poems for ''Wesleyan Poetry in Translation'' (published by the [[Wesleyan University Press]]) with her husband, Nikolai Popov, a scholar whom she married in 1987. Popov, an expert in Bulgarian and knowledgeable in the German and French languages, also helped to translate Celan's poetry, which was written in German.

In 1986, McHugh received a Bellagio grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. She published two more books of poetry during the 1980s: ''To the Quick'' (1987) and ''Shades'' (1988). In the late '80s, she also participated in an art project with Tom Phillips, resulting in a collectible book ''WHERE ARE THEY NOW?: The Class of Forty-Seven'' (1990). It consists of thirty images by Phillips which are interpreted in poems by McHugh and then further modified by Phillips. One of Phillips's images, "A Humument: A Treated Victorian Novel," from the collaboration is appropriately used on the cover of McHugh's essay collection ''Broken English: Poetry and Partiality'' (1993).

In 1994, ''Hinge &amp; Sign: Poems 1968-1993,'' a collection of 24 new poems and selected poems from her five earlier books, was published by the [[Wesleyan University Press]]. The book won both the Harvard Review/Daniel Pollock Prize in 1995 and Boston Book Review's Bingham Poetry Prize and was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]]. The New York Times Book Review chose this poetry collection as a "Notable Book of the Year." In 1996, after the book's publication, she received a Lila Wallace/Reader's Digest Writing Award.

In 1998 McHugh received the [[Folger Library]]'s O.B. Hardison Prize for a poet who excels in teaching. In 1999 she was elected a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]] and received the PEN/Voelker Award. During this year, her poetry was anthologized in The New Bread Loaf Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry, alongside poets laureate like [[Rita Dove]] and [[Robert Pinsky]], and other contemporaries like [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], [[Lucille Clifton]], [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]], [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], and [[Marilyn Hacker]]. McHugh also began to serve as a judge for numerous poetry competitions, including the National Poetry Series and the Laughlin Prize. She was a member of the Board of Directors for the Associated Writing Programs between 1981 and 1983. She served on the Literature Panel for the National Endowment for the Arts during 1983 and 1986. In 1991, she was the Coal-Royalty Chair at the [[University of Alabama]]. In 1992, McHugh was the Elliston Poet at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. In 1991, she was the visiting professor at the [[University of Iowa]] and, in 1994, at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].

She takes editing collections of younger poets seriously, and helped to select poems for ''Hammer and Blaze: a Gathering of Contemporary American Poets'' (2001), published by the University of Georgia Press, which she co-edited with Ellen Bryant Voigt. About her job guest editing ''Ploughshares'' in Spring 2001, McHugh writes, "The sheer syntactical elegance of many of these new poems suggests an instrumental refinement for which I'm grateful: I'm an old [[Richard Wilbur]]/[[Anthony Hecht]] fan, and have had reason now and then to regret, during my quarter century of teaching in M.F.A. programs, the relative unfashionability of rhetorical flourish."

At the end of 2001, McHugh's sixth collection of poetry, ''The Father of the Predicaments,'' was published by the Wesleyan University Press. That same year, McHugh, with Nikolai Popov, received the first International Griffin Poetry Prize in translation for ''Glottal Stop: 101 Poems by Paul Celan''. Her next poetry collection, ''Eyeshot,'' was published in (2003) by [[Wesleyan University Press]], and her latest collection, ''Upgraded to Serious,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/pages/browse/book.asp?bg=%7B0CDF6FE3-FA41-4779-B0F6-925EDCD9D0B5%7D|title=Copper Canyon Press: Upgraded to Serious by Heather McHugh|website=www.coppercanyonpress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2009 both by [[Copper Canyon Press]] in the US and by Anansi in Canada.

McHugh was a judge for the 2012 [[Griffin Poetry Prize]].

Henderson State University, was founded on March 23, 1890 as '''Arkadelphia Methodist College''' by '''Rev. John McLaughlin'''. John Mclaughlin was a veteran of the Confederate States Army.  After the Civil War, Rev. McLaughlin and his family settled in Arkadelphia and founded the '''Arkadelphia Methodist College''' in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkansasgravestones.org/view.php?id=54110|title=MCLAUGHLIN, REV (VETERAN CSA), JOHN - Clark County, Arkansas - JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, REV (VETERAN CSA) - Arkansas Gravestone Photos|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was renamed for Charles Christopher Henderson, a Trustee and prominent Arkadelphia businessman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain Charles C.

In 1911 the name was changed to '''Henderson-Brown College''' to honor Walter Brown. The state convention decided to close the institution down after thirty nine years of Methodist control and combine it with [[Hendrix College]] in [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]]. The student body, administration, and local population strongly disagreed with the idea and after negotiations with state lawmakers, Henderson-Brown was turned over to the state to prevent the merger. Then in 1929, the institution became known as '''Henderson State Teachers College'''. Hendrix was renamed Hendrix-Henderson College, and remained so for about two years before returning to Hendrix College.

After becoming a public institution, Henderson State Teachers College began to expand at a rate never envisioned while it was under Methodist control. Six major buildings were built during the Great Depression alone. After World War II, the enrollment nearly doubled to about 500 students. Graduate classes were first offered in 1951 through the University of Arkansas. In 1955, the school's first graduate degree program began. To reflect the change, the name was changed to '''Henderson State College''' in 1967 and again in 1975 to Henderson State University. Henderson has an excellent academic record. It has produced numerous Rhodes, Fulbright, and Rotary International scholars. It serves as Arkansas’s only member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges. Currently, degree programs are offered through the Matt Locke Ellis College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Business, the School of Education, and the Graduate School. Henderson has its own degree program in nursing, and it also provides the academic program for the Baptist School of Nursing. The university offers the state’s only four-year bachelor of science degree in aviation. The enrollment in the fall of 2012 was 3,773.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsu.edu/interior2.aspx?id=88 HSU History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106045843/http://www.hsu.edu/interior2.aspx?id=88 |date=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The HSU Yearbook is The Star, published continuously since 1904. The University newspaper is the Oracle, which has been published since 1908.

Glendell Jones Jr. was named Henderson State University’s 17th president on Tuesday, March 6, 2012 and officially assumed presidential duties on July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsu.edu/president/ President Glen Jones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106045826/http://www.hsu.edu/president/ |date=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Athletics ===
{{main|Henderson State Reddies}}
{{see also|Henderson State Reddies football}}

Upon its establishment in 1905, the Henderson State football team became known for wearing red jerseys. Absent a traditional nickname or mascot, the team was appropriately dubbed the "Reds." Eventually, the name shifted to "Reddies," and it stuck.

Henderson State University is an NCAA Division II school and competes in the [[Great American Conference]]. The school fields teams in Baseball, Basketball (Men and Women), Cross Country (Women), Football, Golf (Men and Women), Softball, Swimming (Men and Women), Tennis, and Volleyball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsusports.com|title=Henderson State Athletics|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions===
====Battle of the Ravine====
The Battle of the Ravine is a rivalry game between Henderson State University and Ouachita Baptist University. It is currently the oldest rivalry of any NCAA Division II institutions.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The first game was played on November 8, 1895 (Thanksgiving Day) and Ouachita College beat Arkadelphia Methodist College, 8–0. The next meeting did not occur until 1907 in the first sanctioned game of the series. The Reddies defeated Ouachita and went on to claim the Arkansas State Championship.

The Reddies went on to win the next six meetings and the game was played on Thanksgiving Day. Both teams also made the game their homecoming. The series was discontinued in 1951 after Henderson won, 54–0, and the pranks got out of control. The series resumed in 1963 with the Reddies, winning 28–13. The series continued until 1993 when Henderson State moved to the NCAA Division II Gulf South Conference. It continued again in 1996 when Ouachita Baptist University moved to the Lone Star Conference. OBU joined the GSC in 2000 and the two schools did not play each other in 2004 or 2005 as a result of schedule rotation. In total, the two schools have met 85 times. Henderson State currently leads the series, 41–39–6.

====Showband of Arkansas====
Considered one of the finest college marching bands in the country, the "Showband of Arkansas" consists of 150 winds, percussion, and auxiliary members. The mission of the "Showband of Arkansas" is to represent, foster and promote the "Reddie Spirit" through musical and visual performance. Composed of students from all academic disciplines, the "Showband of Arkansas" frequently performs as the feature band at high school marching contests, enjoys travel to exciting away-games and regularly thrills thousands of Reddie spectators at home football games. It is open to any student by audition, regardless of major.

Henderson State has eight fraternities as well as six sororities.

Fraternities:
*[[Alpha Phi Alpha]]
*[[Kappa Alpha Psi]]
*[[Kappa Sigma]]
*[[Omega Psi Phi]]
*[[Phi Beta Sigma]]

"'''Hooked on Monkey Fonics'''" is the twelfth episode of the [[South Park (season 3)|third season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on November 10, 1999. It features issues of [[homeschooling]] and [[phonics]], a method of teaching children to read. This is the final episode of [[South Park]] to feature the voice talents of [[Mary Kay Bergman]], who committed suicide the day after the episode aired. The final episode to use her dialogue was "[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]" which ended production shortly before her death.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-11-17/entertainment/9911_17_obit.bergman.poss_1_rita-vennari-voice-characters |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119112044/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-11-17/entertainment/9911_17_obit.bergman.poss_1_rita-vennari-voice-characters |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |title=Mary Kay Bergman, voiceover actress, dead |last=Lemmerman |first=Kristin |date=November 17, 1999 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

In preparation for a [[spelling bee]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] buys him a "Hooked on Monkey Fonics" system that features an actual live [[monkey]] playing the [[drums]] to keep with the beat of spelling and sounding out the words. After spelling a couple of words, Cartman believes he will have a chance to win the spelling bee. While at the spelling bee, the children face stiff competition from two [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswalds. Cartman asks the monkey to help him spell his word, ''chair'', but Phonics Monkey is [[masturbation|masturbating]], and Cartman misspells it as "C-H-A-R-E"; angered, he runs off to chase the monkey. In the final round, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is unable to spell his word, "''Kroxldyphivc''" (which in reality isn't an actual word), correctly and Rebecca and Mark are declared the champions. Although Kyle is annoyed at having been beaten, he ends up developing a crush on Rebecca.

Mark becomes intrigued by the interactions he sees between Cartman, Kyle, and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and begs his father to be allowed to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. His father objects due to how dangerous public schools can be, but reluctantly relents. At the school, Mark, placed in a largely protective [[hamster ball]] by his overpossesive/overprotective father, is tormented for his [[wiktionary:haughty|haughty]] attitude and superior knowledge, and ends up duct taped to a bench by the other boys. This prompts Mark's father to speak with the adults in Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails about the incident and the fact that Kyle has become smitten with Rebecca and should stop pursuing her. The adults are quick to dislike him as much as the kids dislike Mark; after learning that he does not drink beer but prefers [[wine coolers]], they proceed to duct tape Mark's father to one of the bar's benches.

After questioning Mark about why he has never been seen before and why he does not attend school like the other children, Cartman is introduced to the concept of home schooling. The idea of never having to go to school appeals to him greatly, and, using [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] condescending remarks towards him as an excuse, demands to be home schooled himself. To him, this involves a regimen of sleeping in and sitting in bed while snacking and watching [[television]], while his mother unsuccessfully attempts to get him to study. When Stan and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] come to visit to tell him about the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] Memorial Dance, Phonics Monkey kills Kenny.

Meanwhile, Kyle makes many efforts to make his feelings known to Rebecca, although several end up humorously unsuccessful. Ultimately he convinces her to explore the world of public schooling, and she agrees to go to the South Park dance with him. He also explains what love is to her and, out of curiosity, she asks Kyle if she can experiment a kiss with him, to which he agrees. After kissing him, Rebecca immediately changes when she agrees to Kyle's dance proposal ("You bet your sweet ass I'll go.")

At the dance, the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]] plays their song "[[Holy Diver (song)|Holy Diver]]". The boys of the school hatch a plan to [[duct tape]] Mark to the flagpole while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in sight, Mark is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister "into a [[slut]]." The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] breaks up the fight, with Mark warning Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) about the benefits of public schools - "...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves." Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion. Dio restarts and plays "Holy Diver" over the end credits, with Phonics Monkey joining in on drums.

==Cultural references==
The character of Rebecca is based on [[Rebecca Sealfon]] who won the 1997 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]]. She is one of the most well-known spelling bee winners, spelling her final word, "[[wiktionary:euonym|euonym]]," by screaming out each letter. She also displayed the odd habit of covering her mouth and whispering each letter before saying it, which was parodied in the episode as well.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spelling Bee Champs: Where Are They Now? |first=Jonann |last=Brady |newspaper= [[ABC News]]|date=1 June 2006|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2026770 |accessdate=9 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyle's speech to Rebecca about love parodies the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode "[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/05/ign-tvs-10-favorite-south-park-episodes&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle's love confession and kiss with Rebecca parodies a scene between Judah Ben-Hur and Esther in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.

==Reception==

When [[Ronnie James Dio]] was asked how he felt about ''South Park'''s parody of him, he said "I thought it was wonderful. I initially didn't want to let it be done because I felt that they were just going to crucify me [and] that I would end up being like [[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus|what they did]] to [[Rod Stewart]], and [[Chef Aid|what they did]] to [[Elton John]], and what they did to [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy]].  But they assured our office that they were real Dio fans and that I would like it.  So I thought to myself "Well if you want to be an American icon, you better let them do it".  And they did, and I was knocked out. It was funny. I thought they were more cruel to the drummer, if anything else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Dio |first=Ronnie James |subjectlink=Ronnie James Dio |interviewer=Danny Shipman |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75TCYuq0-Lw|title=Reality Check TV, episode #291|date=2002 |work=Reality Check TV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Draw Manga''''' is a series of instructional books on drawing [[manga]] published by Graphic-sha, by a variety of authors. Originally in Japanese for the Japanese market, many volumes have been translated into English and published in the United States. Of the wide range of manga-how-tos available for westerners, the series is seen as one of the more useful, both for its provenance and wide range of practical tips.{{ref|twoeasylessons}} The English-language volumes in the series were co-produced by Graphic-sha and two other Japanese companies, Japanime Co. Ltd. and Japan Publications Trading Co.

== List of books in the series ==
This is a list of books in the main ''HTDM'' set and other sets that relate to the main series.

Originally there were no volume numbers on the English versions, because the original [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version did not have them. Only volumes 1 - 8 were given numbers. With continued reprints and more books being released, all volumes gained a number. The dates given are the first printing. Several of these books have been discontinued, and are considered hard to find.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">'''José Manuel Nunes Salvador (José) Tribolet''' (born 20 December 1949) is a Portuguese engineer, and Professor of Information Systems at the [[Technical University of Lisbon]], Portugal, who became known for his work on [[speech coding]] late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Spanias, Andreas S. "Speech coding: A tutorial review." Proceedings of the IEEE 82.10 (1994): 1541-1582.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Tribolet received his 5-Year "Engenheiro" Degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] in 1971 at the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]], Lisboa, Portugal and in the United States at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] his MA in Electrical Engineering in 1974, and his [[Ph.D.]] in Computer Science in 1977. In 1998 he spent a sabbatical year as a Visiting Sloan Fellow at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]].&lt;ref name="JT-CV 2011"&gt;[http://www.taguspark.pt/documentos/CV_TRIBOLET_ABRIL_2011.pdf José Manuel Nunes Salvador Tribolet: Curriculum Vitae, 2011]. Retrieved September 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation in 1977 Tribolet started working as researcher at [[AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]] in Murray Hill, NJ. In 1979 back in Portugal he was appointed Full Professor of the Electrical Engineering Department at the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]] (Technical University of Lisbon). In 1998 he became Full Professor of Information Systems at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

In Lisbon he co-founded in 1980 INESC - Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, the first not-for-profit, non-state-owned contract based research organization of Portugal,  which he presides ever since. In 2012 he was Visiting Professor at the [[University of St. Gallen]].

Tribolet was awarded the IEEE ASSP 1979 Best Paper Award, and the IEEE ASSP 1984 Best Paper Award.&lt;ref name="JT-CV 2011"/&gt;

== Work ==
Tribolet's research interests are in the fields of "organizational modeling, business process engineering and information systems architecture."&lt;ref name=hicss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_44/Minitracks44/os-ode.pdf |title=Track: Organizational Systems and Technology Minitrack: Organizational Design and Engineering |date=February 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences]] |location=Honolulu |page=2 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tribolet (2007):

:"''Organizations are complex, dynamic systems. At any given moment, an organization is the result of the many interactions among its active components, which in turn affect the internal states of all and every such organizational components. The static and the dynamic behavior of an organization is thus the resultant of these interactions along time.''
:''None of this is news to the engineering world. Through modern science, mankind has learned to conceive, design, develop, build, operate and maintain very complex systems indeed, from spacecrafts to deep sea ships, from nuclear power stations to nano-robots for human surgery, from bio-devices to intelligent toys. It is time to pull together the vast amounts of know-how accumulated by mankind, in the social sciences and in the real-world of managerial experience, with the intellectual capital accumulated in the hard sciences and the real-world transformations induced by the ICT instrumentations of modern human environment.''
:''Dealing with Complex Dynamic Systems through “old-time common good sense” is simply “non-sense”, in today´s chaotic world. Enabling real-time “dynamic flight control” of a complex organization requires sound organizational engineering and real time monitoring and control of all the human and machine active elements that “are” the organization.''"&lt;ref name=EATIS2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eatis.org/eatis2007/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=54 |title=EATIS 2007 - Euro American Conference on Telematics and Information Systems - Invited Keynote Speakers |first=Hélio |last=Cabrita  |work=EATIS 2007 - Euro American Conference on Telematics and Information Systems - May 14–17th 2007 |publisher=Euro American Association on Telematics and Information Systems	 |location=Algarve, Portugal |accessdate=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It attracted large attention with the most famous painting depicting comedian [[Sturla Berg-Johansen]] with an [[Phallus|erect penis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristiansen|first=Sandra Marie|title=Sturla Berg Johansen pryder maleri med erigert penis|url=http://www.tv2.no/underholdning/gkn/sturla-berg-johansen-pryder-maleri-med-erigert-penis-3528670.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=tv2.no|date=26 June 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, ''"Homo ludens"'' valued at US$14.500, was sold to an anonymous buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Treborg|first=Ingrid Marie|title=Kaja Norum overrasket med penismaleri: – Sturla-bildet var selvfølgelig planlagt|url=http://www.tv2.no/underholdning/gkn/kaja-norum-overrasket-med-penismaleri-sturlabildet-var-selvfoelgelig-planlagt-3569914.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=tv2.no|date=28 August 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that the buyer was either hotel tycoon [[Petter Stordalen]] or business magnate [[Stein Erik Hagen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lunde|first=Mikael|title=Vil ikke ha Sturlas penis på veggen|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/06/29/kultur/odd_nerdrum/kaja_norum/kunst/sturla_berg-johansen/17114999/|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=Dagbladet.no|date=29 June 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it was later revealed that it was actually a gourmet restaurant in [[Oslo]] that had made the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lunder|first=Martine|title=Humordronning kjøpte omstridt bilde: - Alle skal få se naken-Sturla|url=http://www.vg.no/rampelys/artikkel.php?artid=10096569|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=vg.no|date=5 July 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2012 Norum opened her second exhibition, at the Gallery Soon in [[Son]] in [[Vestby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Christina|title=– Jeg er ikke særlig sjenert I dag åpner Kaja Norum en ny utstilling på Galleri Soon.|url=http://www.moss-avis.no/kultur/jeg-er-ikke-serlig-sjenert-1.7470455|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=Moss avis|date=4 August 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling===
Norum has done modeling for the magazines '' [[Det Nye]]'' and ''[[Alfa (magazine)|Alfa]]''.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; In January 2013 she appeared in the magazine ''Kamille'' doing nude photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bjørnstad|first=Guro|title=- Odd Nerdrum snakket alltid om at det skulle være "kjøttfullt"|url=http://www.kjendis.no/2013/01/02/kjendis/kaja_norum/kunst/odd_nerdrum/kropp/25051491/|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=Dagbladet.no|date=2 January 2013|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korean Council for University Education''' (KCUE) is a private association of four-year [[higher education| higher educational]] institutions in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] intended to promote cooperation between [[universities]] and represent their interests, particularly regarding university autonomy from state regulation, to the government. It is comparable in some respects to organizations such as the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AAC&amp;U), the German Rectors’ Conference (HRK), or the Japan Association of National Universities (JANU). The KCUE is unique, however, in that the presidents of all [[List of colleges and universities in South Korea|South Korean universities]], public and private, are required by law to hold membership.&lt;ref&gt;Government of the Republic of Korea, "[http://english.kcue.or.kr/Korean_Council_for_University_Education_Act.pdf Korean Council for University Education Act, Act No. 3727]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}," trans. Korean Council for University Education (1984), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The KCUE was founded in 1982 and legally consolidated in 1984 during the later period of [[authoritarian]] rule in South Korea. It was largely intended to placate growing demands from universities for greater [[autonomy]] from a centralized education system that was strictly regulated by the Ministry of Education. During the first several years of its existence, however, the KCUE had little semblance of autonomy from or influence over the authoritarian government at the time and was able to achieve few of its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Council for University Education, ''[http://www.kcue.or.kr/about/20history.php Hanguk Daehak Gyoyuk Hyeopuihoe 20 Nyeonsa]'' (Seoul: Seonmyeong Inswae, 2002), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the beginning of substantial [[democratization]] in South Korea in 1987-1988 and the subsequent, gradual [[liberalization]] of the higher education system, the KCUE was increasingly able to accomplish its original purposes and expand its functions, particularly in research and training of university staff. By the mid-1990s it had taken on significant responsibilities related to [[Educational accreditation| university evaluations]] and the [[university admissions]] system previously under the exclusive purview of the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Council for University Education, ''[http://www.kcue.or.kr/about/20history.php Hanguk Daehak Gyoyuk Hyeopuihoe 20 Nyeonsa]'' (Seoul: Seonmyeong Inswae, 2002), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

The KCUE is nominally controlled by a General Assembly composed of the presidents of all member universities. The General Assembly elects a ten to twenty-member Board of Trustees and a Chairman (currently [[Ewha Womans University]] President Bae Yong Lee) that make most executive decisions. The Board of Trustees elects a Secretary-General (currently [[Kyungpook National University]] Professor Chong Yul Park&lt;ref&gt;Baek Il-hyun, "[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2891684 Kyungpook's Prof. Park Has New Role]," ''Joongang Daily'', 30 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) that oversees day-to-day operations of the KCUE. The organization's activities are mainly funded by the Ministry of Education and mandatory membership fees from universities.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Council for University Education, "[http://english.kcue.or.kr/KCUE_Articles_of_Association.pdf Articles of Association]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}," trans. Korean Council for University Education (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

The main purposes of the KCUE are to support the development of South Korea’s higher education system by “promoting inter-institutional cooperation concerning major issues common to four-year universities and colleges” and represent the collective voice of universities to the government to “increase the autonomy, initiative, public accountability, and overall quality” of higher education.

===Research===

The KCUE’s Research Institute for Higher Education, formally established in 1985, conducts research as commissioned by its member universities or the government. It focuses on research regarding the [[Academic administration| management and administration of universities]], policy options for reform in South Korea’s university admissions system, financial support of universities from private and governmental sources, and the development of university [[Curriculum| curricula]] and teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Universities, "[http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/index.html Republic of Korea]," World Higher Education Database (2004), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's research is published, among other places, in the Korean language journal ''Daehak Gyoyuk'' (''Higher Education'') [http://magazine.kcue.or.kr/].

===University Faculty/Staff Training===
''See also'' :[[Membership Training in Korea]]

In order to improve the quality of leadership, instruction, and administration at member universities, the KCUE's Training Center for Higher Education, formally established in 1995 in a separate facility in [[Daegu]], South Korea, trains approximately 2,500 university administrators, faculty, and staff annually in areas of greatest need as requested by universities. The Center uses training seminars, conferences, and programs to disseminate updated research information on university education and administration from the KCUE and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Council for University Education, ''[http://www.kcue.or.kr/about/20history.php Hanguk Daehak Gyoyuk Hyeopuihoe 20 Nyeonsa]'' (Seoul: Seonmyeong Inswae, 2002), 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University Admissions===

Since the mid-1990s the Ministry of Education has gradually delegated much of its authority over the country's admissions process to the KCUE. In late 2004, it announced that the KCUE would decide admissions schedules and develop admissions rules.&lt;ref&gt;In-Chul Lee, "[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=040000&amp;biid=2004122932998 One Out of Every Four Universities and Colleges Will Shut Down]," 28 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More significantly, the transition team of incoming South Korean President [[Lee Myung-bak]] announced in January 2008 its intention to transfer most responsibilities regarding the university admissions system from the Ministry of Education to the KCUE, which would thus allow universities to decide admission criteria, such as whether to include interviews in admissions processes and how to weight the [[College Scholastic Ability Test]] in admissions decisions. Lee had made a promise during the [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential campaign]] to give universities greater autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Min-a, "[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2884734 Universities to Decide Who Gets In]," ''Joongang Daily'', 5 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2008010355938 Education Reform Plan to Come in February]," ''Dong-A Ilbo'', 3 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University Evaluations===

In addition to conducting research on accreditation and evaluation in higher education, the KCUE is one of the few formal, albeit voluntary mechanisms of evaluation or [[Educational accreditation| accreditation]] in the South Korean higher education system. It began conducting simple evaluations of its member universities in 1983 and more detailed evaluations beginning in 1994 that included separate assessments at the departmental and institutional level.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Educational Development Institute, "[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/37/41/38092541.pdf Country Background Report for Korea]," ''OECD Thematic Review of Tertiary Education'' (April 2006), 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic Records Verification===

In response to the widely reported scandals in late 2007 involving well-known university professors, government officials, and television personalities in South Korea that had [[Diploma mill| forged academic credentials]] from both domestic and international universities,&lt;ref&gt;Su-Hyun Lee, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/01/world/asia/01korea.html?_r=1&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=korea%20degree%20scandal&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin Revelations of False Credentials Shake South Korea]," ''New York Times'', 7 September 2007.,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Herskovitz and Jessica Kim, "[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070822.wkoreafraud0822/BNStory/International/ DJ, Actress and Even a Monk Guilty by Degree]," ''Globe and Mail'', 22 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the KCUE established its Academic Records Verification Service in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;AFP, "[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/sept/01/yehey/opinion/20070901opi8.html Fake Degree Probe Extends to S.

The Donation, Not Discrimination campaign, which carried the tag line "It's time to end the ban", was a campaign to end the [[National Blood Service]]'s [[discrimination]] against men who have had sex with other men, and women who have had sex with those men; the NBS would not allow them to [[blood donation|give blood]], a policy built upon the claim that gay men have a higher chance of carrying [[HIV]]. The campaign believed the lifetime ban to be discriminatory, and that it perpetuated the myth that [[AIDS]] is a “gay disease”. It argued that selection criteria should not be based on sexual orientation, but on participation in high-risk behaviour, and that the number of HIV infections through blood transfusion had been reduced in those countries where this is the case. The campaign ended in 2011 when the Department of Health lifted the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NUS welcomes lifting of gay blood ban|url=https://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/nus-welcomes-end-to-lifetime-gay-blood-ban-after-years-of-campaigning/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Putting the LGBT into FE===
This campaign has been running since 2007 and is to help students in [[further education]] (FE) who want to set up or develop their LGBT groups. The campaign find that participation and support in FE insututions to be limited or non existent and this is to change this.

==Annual Conference==

The NUS LGBT+ conference is an opportunity for LGBT students activists from across the UK to come together to set the direction for the campaign for the year ahead, to attend workshops and hear speakers, and to network with other LGBT students.

One of the key functions of the conference is to debate, pass policy which forms the basis of NUS LGBT+'s campaigning and to ammed the constitution of the campaign. All changes to policy and the constitution are submitted by LGBT students or societies, up to 5 for each, previous to the conference which are then compiled by the [[steering committee]].

At the conference there is the annual NUS LGBT Awards, which started in 2007, to help promote and support the societies which have done things that are considered to be above and beyond the standard.

Officers and committee members are elected at the annual conference by delegates.

=== National officers ===
National officers within the Campaign are elected paid officials who coordinate and fulfil the agenda of the Campaign.

There are two officers for the NUS LGBT+ Campaign, one woman's place which is and is only elected by self identifying women and open place which is open to anyone who identifies within the membership of the Campaign. The officers can only stand for two years before having to step down.

The first national officers were elected in 2000, after NUS Annual Conference voted to change the constitution in order for the positions to be created.

An '''official script''' is a [[writing system]] that is specifically designated to be official in the [[constitution]]s or other applicable [[law]]s of [[jurisdiction (area)|countries, states, and other jurisdictions]]. Akin to an [[official language]], an official script is much rarer. It is used primarily where an official language is in practice written with two or more scripts. As, in these languages, use of script often has [[culture|cultural]] or [[politics|political]] connotations, proclamation of an official script is sometimes criticised as having a goal of influencing culture or politics or both. Desired effects also may include easing [[education]], [[communication]] and some other aspects of life.

== List of official scripts ==
Below is a partial list of official scripts used in different countries. Those in ''italics'' are states that have [[State with limited recognition|limited international recognition]].

The '''Escuela Técnica Otto Krause''' is an educational institution located at the intersection of Paseo Colón Avenue and Chile Street, in the [[San Telmo]] section of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Named after its founder, the engineer [[Otto Krause]], son of German immigrants, the school was founded in 1897 and is the oldest technological school in the country.

The school currently has around 2000 students and operates a six-year programme.  The first three years (ciclo básico) provide a technical high-school programme for students who have completed their elementary education. Years four to six (ciclo superior) provide the equivalent of a technical college education in various branches of engineering technology.  On completion of their studies here students may go on to university to follow a six-year programme leading to a degree in engineering.

The present school building, which was inaugurated on May 24, 1909, was declared a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Monument]] in 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3637">'''PUBLIB''' is an [[Electronic mailing list|electronic discussion list]] devoted to issues relating to [[public library|public-library]] administration and use. It was founded in December 1992 by Jean Armour Polly (then of NYSERNET, Inc., now a librarian in upstate New York) and the late John Iliff. PUBLIB is currently managed by volunteers Sara Weissman and Karen G. Schneider. Housed on the NYSERNET server until March 1997, and then on the UC Berkeley SunSITE until May 2005, [http://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/PubLib_Overview.html PUBLIB] is now hosted by WebJunction, a service of [[OCLC]].

For several years, PUBLIB had a subset, PUBLIB-Net, focused on Internet use in public libraries. Because the Internet has become well integrated into library services, support for PUBLIB-Net as a separate list ended in 2000.

PUBLIB is oriented toward public [[librarian]]s and public library managers and directors. Subscribers also include library trustees, members of library friends' groups, library-science students and faculty, library journalists, and advocates of librarianship. On June 13, 2010, PUBLIB had 9,684 subscribers in 14 countries, according to data gathered by WebJunction's administrative software.

PUBLIB's subscribers discuss library use and management, library technology, the mission of the library, librarianship as a profession, and library ethics. Operational questions are posed and answered (Hill, p.&amp;nbsp;34). Postings of library jobs are accepted and encouraged. Friday of each week is devoted to library anecdotes and humor.

Only subscribers may post to PUBLIB. Instructions for subscribing may be found on PUBLIB's [http://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/PubLib_Overview.html general information page] managed by OCLC.

Authors in the field of [[library and information science]] occasionally tap PUBLIB as a resource. One such author described PUBLIB as "a good cross-section of librarians engaged in public services, administration, technical support, and related responsibilities" (Sager, p.&amp;nbsp;73).

Postings from February 1993 to the present have been archived and can be [http://listserv.oclclists.org/scripts/wa.exe?A0=Publib browsed and searched].

'''PUBLIB mascot and social activities'''

The unofficial mascot of PUBLIB is the gadfly, representing the questioning and advocacy that are characteristic of its subscribers. Mary Jane Anderson wrote a pithy response to John N. Berry III editorial about PUBLIB. It is here: http://listserv.oclclists.org/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9702&amp;L=Publib&amp;P=R15904&amp;1=Publib&amp;9=A&amp;J=on&amp;K=2&amp;d=No+Match%3BMatch%3BMatches&amp;z=4

PUBLIB participants have gathered informally off the list, either online through personal email messages, through personal visits while traveling, or at library conferences such as those held by the [[Public Library Association]] and the [[American Library Association]].

'''Best of PUBLIB'''

In June 2009, Robert Balliot set up a blog which reproduces postings from PUBLIB. He called it [http://bestofpublib.wordpress.com/ '''Best of PUBLIB'''].  The posts are grouped by topic, and there is a listing of topics in the left hand column.{'''Note:''' Latest post is June 2014.}

[[File:Portrait of Ram Gopal LCCN2004662942.jpg|thumb|Ram Gopal, photograph by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1938.]]
'''Bissano Ram Gopal''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (20 November 1912&lt;ref&gt;His passport gives his year of birth as 1917, but his contemporaries insisted it must have been closer to 1912 – [https://www.theguardian.com/india/story/0,12559,1061626,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; – 12 October 2003) was an Indian dancer and choreographer who performed mostly as a soloist and toured extensively throughout his lengthy career. A modernist, he blended the classical Indian dance with balletic choreography,&lt;ref name=guard2003/&gt; and along with [[Uday Shankar]] was among the first to showcase [[Indian classical dance]] in the West starting in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; Polish critic [[Tadeusz Zelenski]] called him "the [[Vaslav Nijinsky|Nijinsky]] of India".

As a choreographer, he is most known for his productions, ''Legend of the Taj Mahal'', ''Dance of the Setting Sun'' and ''Dances of India''.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; He is also noted for "Radha-Krishna", his collaboration with British&lt;ref&gt;Markova her life and art by Anton Dolin W.H. Allen london 1955&lt;/ref&gt; ballerina Dame [[Alicia Markova]], in 1960.&lt;ref name=nytjack/&gt;

==Early life and training==
Gopal was born in [[Bangalore, India]].  He was named Bissano, being born on 20 November ( Bees = 20 in [[Hindi]] ). He had a Burmese mother and a [[Rajput]] father who was a barrister.&lt;ref name=guard2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Ram Gopal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1444926/Ram-Gopal.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in a mansion called Torquay Castle. His grandmother was a well known dancer. Drawn to dance early on in his life, he learned [[Kathakali]] from Guru Kunju Kurup and Chandu Panickar. Once he danced at the annual garden party of the [[Maharajah of Mysore]] without his father's permission, but the Maharaja persuaded his father to allow him receive further dance training.&lt;ref name=deccan&gt;{{cite news |title=Ram Gopal: the legend |author=Leela Ramanathan |url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/nov02/at4.asp |work=[[Deccan Herald]] |date=26 October 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505104959/http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/nov02/at4.asp |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in this early forties, he discovered Guru [[Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai]] of [[Pandanallur style]] under whom he started learning Bharatanatyam, followed by Muthukumaran Pillai.,&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news |title=Ambassador of Indian dance  |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2003/10/24/stories/2003102401720500.htm |website=[[The Hindu]] |date=24 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he also learned [[Kathak]] from Sohanlal and Bowri Prasad and even [[Manipuri dance]], all of which he assimilated into his choreographies in the coming decades.&lt;ref name=deccan/&gt;

==Career==
He was invited to the United States by [[La Meri]], an American dancer who specialised in non-Western forms of dance to tour with her through Asia in the 1930s. He made his solo debut in New York City on 1 May 1938, at the [[46th Street Theatre]].&lt;ref name=nytjack&gt;{{cite news |title=Ram Gopal, Dancer Who Opened Western Eyes to India, Dies|author=Jack Anderson|authorlink=Jack Anderson (dance critic)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/15/obituaries/15GOPA.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he was invited to Paris, where he went with Kathak dancer, Sohanlal.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt; and in the same year he made his London debut at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] to immediate fame and went on to meet not just Queen Mary, but also made friends with leading figures of the ballet.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; He returned to India with Ensa during the World War II.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; After the War, he returned and noted dancer, Nijinsky came to "inspect him" in 1948.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

He toured extensively as a soloist and with his company both before and after World War II, and soon his production were known for their costumes, staging and lighting.&lt;ref name=guard2003/&gt; He appeared at the New York Golden Anniversary International Dance Festival at NYC's City Center in 1948 where he represented India, the [[Jacob's Pillow]] Dance Festival in the [[Berkshires]] in 1954 and [[Edinburgh Festival]]s in 1956.&lt;ref name=nytjack/&gt; He collaborated with ballerina Dame [[Alicia Markova]] to create a duet "Radha-Krishna" in 1960, based on [[Hindu mythology]], in which she danced as [[Radha]], while he danced as [[Krishna]]. Today their collaboration is commemorated at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] where her bronze bust stands next to his full-length portrait by [[Feliks Topolski]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytjack/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/914347/Ram-Gopal Ram Gopal] [[Britannica.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years, he also danced with [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]] in Bangalore, and toured with [[Kumudini Lakhia]].&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; Another successful dance partnership was with the young and talented Tara Chaudhri whom Ram was very fond of. Dance critic, Cyril Beaumont editor of "Dance Journal", wrote about his dancing, "what impresses one most about Ram Gopal's dancing is the manner in which he is able to assimilate the characteristics of the four schools of technique so completely different in style, costume and mood."&lt;ref name=deccan/&gt;

He also danced in the Mumbai school run by the Austrian expressionist dancer [[Hilde Holger]], with whom he remained friends and collaborated with her in their experimental dance style pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hildeholger.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114194324/http://www.hildeholger.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 November 2006 |title=Hilde Holger: Central European Expressionist Dancer |publisher=hildeholger.com |date=2007 |access-date=18 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kay Ambrose book published in 1950, ''"Classical Dances and Costumes of India,"'' the book is introduced by Ram Gopal, with foreword by Arnold Haskell containing 53 Illustrations from Photographs and many Drawings by the Author. In this introduction is included a letter Ram Gopal wrote Kay Ambrose from Bangalore, his birthplace in February 1942. The book has many photo's and illustration of Ram Gopal performing these classical dances.

He published ''Indian Dancing'' in 1951, and his autobiography ''Rhythms in the Heavens'' in 1957.,&lt;ref name=exp&gt;{{cite news |title=Classical dancer Ram Gopal dies in London |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/33522/ |work=[[Indian Express]] |date=16 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he also opened two dance schools for a short while, first in Bangalore before moving to England and later "Academy of Indian Dance and Music" in London in 1962. In his later years he lived in London, Venice and the South of France.&lt;ref name=nytjack/&gt;

The French filmmaker Claude Lamorisse made two films about him: "Aum Shiva" and "Ram".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/140054?view=credit BFI | Film &amp; TV Database | AUM SHIVA (1970)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He received an [[Order of the British Empire]] ([[OBE]]) for services to dance in 1999,&lt;ref name=guard2003&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Ram Gopal: Classical Indian dancer who introduced the west to the ethos and discipline of his homeland's traditional art|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/13/guardianobituaries.india |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of Sangeet Natak Akademi fellows|Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship]], by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama in 1990.&lt;ref name=exp/&gt;

[[File:South Africa (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|Location of South Africa]]

'''Rankings of universities in South Africa''' are largely based on international [[College and university rankings|university ranking]]s, since there are no South African rankings as of yet.

These international university rankings indicate that [[List of universities in South Africa|South Africa's university system]] is the strongest on the continent: it is home to five of the six highest ranked African universities,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urapcenter.org/2013/region.php?rcode=AF&lt;/ref&gt; including the two campuses consistently ranked as academically strongest in Africa, [[University of Cape Town]] and [[University of the Witwatersrand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/world-ranking/region/africa |title=World Rankings - Africa 2013-14 |work=University Ranings |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are situated in South Africa's two most prominent cities ([[Cape Town]] and [[Johannesburg]], respectively).

==Highly cited international university rankings==
In part because of the inherent difficulty of ranking complex educational institutions, there are an expanding number of competing international university ranking schemes, each with a different emphasis. Four of the most prominent are the Times Higher Education World University Rankings (most widely accepted), The Centre for World University rankings (CWUR),QS World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU, sometimes referred to as the "Shanghai Rankings").

===Times Higher Education World University Rankings===
The 2018 edition of the Times Higher Education (''THE'') World University Rankings ranked the top South African universities as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/locations/ZA/sort_by/scores_overall/sort_order/asc/cols/stats], Times Higher Education World University Rankings, accessed 14 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business-oriented rankings==
Several international rankings schemes focus on the placement of graduates in business settings.

===Times Higher Education Alma Mater Index===
This is another ''THE'' ranking which aims to measure the real world success of a University's alumni by ranking Universities according to the number of their graduates that are currently CEOs of Fortune Global 500 companies. The global number one for 2017 is by a considerable margin, Harvard University. The only African University that appears on the Global top 100 is the University of the Witwatersrand. The 2017 South African rankings are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/alma-mater-index-global-executives-2013/2007032.article |title=THE Alma Mater Index:Global Executives 2013 |work=University Rankings |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tredence-Emerging Global Employability University Ranking===
This is a global ranking of universities by the perceived quality of their graduates by top employers around the world. The only African university in the top 150 is the University of the Witwatersrand. The 2013 ranking is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emerging.fr/rank_en.html |title=Global Employability University Ranking 2013 |work=University Ranings |publisher=Emerging |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional context on South African higher educational institutions==

===2010 Centre for Higher Education Transformation report===
A 2010 report by Centre for Higher Education Transformation identified 3 different university clusters in South Africa, grouped according to function.
The input variables used to group universities were:
* Percentage of headcount enrolment in science, engineering and technology
* Masters and doctoral enrolments
* Student to staff ratios
* Permanent staff with doctoral degrees
* Private and government income
* Student fee income

The output variables were:
* Student success rates
* Graduation rates
* Weighted research output units per permanent staff member
The Red cluster constitutes the top research-intensive universities. The Blue cluster consists of institutions focused primarily on technical training, while the Green cluster includes institutions which show characteristics of both missions. The clusters are:&lt;ref name="uwn"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen |last=McGregor |title=SOUTH AFRICA: New university clusters emerge |url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100523104119724 |work=University World News |date=23 May 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because of the interrelationship between indexing and abstract services and the literature that they document, tools such as ''Religious and Theological Abstracts'' (1958-, Myerstown, PA), ''[[Religion Index One]]'' (1949-, Evanston, IL), and ''[[The Catholic Periodical and Literature Index]]'' (1930-, Catholic Library Association) often become de facto standards against which many librarians measure their collections. If a journal is indexed by one of these services, it becomes important on the grounds that the index service provides access points to the information contained in the articles themselves.&lt;ref name=owens97/&gt;{{rp|74}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A guide to library research stated that "religion has its primary indexes in ''[[Religion Index One]]'', ''[[Religion Index Two]]'', ''Religious and Theological Abstracts'', and a few other such titles."&lt;ref name=mann93&gt;{{cite book |title=Library research models: A guide to classification, cataloging, and computers

'''[[Secondary education]] in [[Denmark]]''' (in [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''ungdomsuddannelse'', "youth education") usually takes two to four years and is attended by students between the ages of 15 and 19. Secondary education is not compulsory, but usually free of charge, and students have a wide range of programmes to choose from. Some education programmes are academically oriented, the most common being the ''[[Gymnasium (Denmark)|Gymnasium]]''. Others are more practically oriented, training students for jobs as e.g. [[artisan]]s or [[clerk (position)|clerk]]s through a combination of instruction in [[vocational school]]s and [[apprenticeship]].

== Gymnasium ==
{{main|Gymnasium (Denmark)|l1=Gymnasium}}
The Gymnasium has its origin in the cathedral and monastery schools established by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the early [[Middle Ages]], and seven of the schools established in the 12th and 13th centuries still exist today. The medieval schools had, broadly speaking, only one purpose: to educate the servants of the Catholic Church by teaching them to read, write, and speak [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]'s official implementation in 1536, the schools were taken over by the [[King of Denmark|Crown]]; their primary purpose remained preparing students for theological studies, only now it was for the benefit of the [[Protestant Church]].

This educational base remained nearly unchanged until 1809, when the old Clergyman's School was transformed, in accordance with the spirit of the time, into a [[humanism|humanistic]] Civil Servant's School, the purpose of which was to "foster true humanity" through immersion in the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Latin]] cultures combined with some teaching of natural science and modern languages.

In 1871, the scientific and technical development of the 19th century led to a division of the education curriculum into two lines: the [[language]]s and the mathematics-science line. This division remained the backbone of the structure of the Gymnasium until the year 2005, when a major reform of the Gymnasium was enacted. Today, each Gymnasium offers a selection of lines decided by each individual Gymnasium. These typically include various linguistic, scientific, and creative lines, as well as combined-subject lines.

In 1903, the languages line was divided into a classical line, preserving extensive teaching in Latin and Greek, and a modern languages line, in which Latin and Greek were replaced by [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]]. At the same time, the three-year course of the Gymnasium was directly connected with the [[Danish Folkeskole Education|municipal school]] through the establishment of the ''mellemskole'' ("[[middle school]]", grades 6-9), later to be replaced by the ''realskole''.

According to the latest reform, the Gymnasium still offers three years of general upper secondary education in two lines. The division of the two lines into three branches each has however been replaced by a more flexible system, under which each of the lines contains a core curriculum of obligatory subjects and a number of optional subjects which can be taken at two levels.

== Higher Preparatory Examination ==
{{main|Higher Preparatory Examination}}
The Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) was introduced in 1967 in a political climate that was characterised by a desire to extend educational possibilities to new groups in society. Originally, it was the idea to create a two-year course aimed specifically at prospective candidates for teacher training.  There was however a concern that this concept might result in an educational cul-de-sac. So the course design was changed into an alternative route to further and [[higher education]].

The students that were entering the new HF-programmes were mainly adults. But from the start, the HF also appealed to young people who for social or personal reasons had not followed the straight route via the [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|Gymnasium]] to higher education.

The HF is thus the "sweeper" of the general upper secondary education level. In the Gymnasium, there is still an overrepresentation of middle class children (40% male/60% female), whereas the HF recruits its predominantly female students from a broader base of society (30% male/70% female).

== Higher Commercial Examination Programme ==
{{main|Higher Commercial Examination Programme}}
The Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX) started in 1888 on a private initiative at [[Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College|Niels Brock's Business College]] in [[Copenhagen]] with a structure, which can mostly be found in the course today. The range of subjects comprised both commercial and general subjects.

In 1920, the [[Rigsdag]] (the parliament of the time) adopted the first business college act, which i.a. entitled the Niels Brock Business College to call itself a "higher business school". This act introduced supervision of the activities of the business colleges, and the HHX became a State-controlled examination.  In 1927, the first ministerial orders were issued regarding the content of the teaching which in all essentials dealt with the existing teaching.

The course was managed by the Ministry of Trade until 1965, when the responsibility was transferred to the Ministry of Education.

The HHX did not originally qualify for admission to universities and other higher education institutions in the university sector. The universities did not consider the general part of the programme sufficient. It was not until 1972, that the HHX was given the status of a university entrance examination in connection with a revision of the content, along with the introduction of more rigorous admission requirements.  At the beginning of the 1970s, about half of the Danish business colleges offered the programme. By 1982, the course was offered at all Danish business colleges.

== Higher Technical Examination Programme ==
{{main|Higher Technical Examination Programme}}
The Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) was established on an experimental basis in 1982. The reason for its establishment was a desire to contribute to a broader supply of education and training possibilities following the EFG-basic courses and a desire to create a new and relevant way of access to higher education in the technical area. In this context, it was of importance that fewer and fewer skilled workers continued at the engineering colleges, whereas the number of general upper secondary graduates increased significantly.

Another reason for establishing the HTX-programme on an experimental basis was the need to strengthen the status of the technical schools. Broad education and training possibilities at the schools were to provide a broader and qualitatively better recruitment.

In 1982, the HTX-experiment was carried out at the technical schools in [[Sønderborg]], [[Aalborg]], and [[Copenhagen]]. The pilot period lasted until the spring of 1988, after which the programme was evaluated and made permanent after minor adjustments had been made to the individual subjects. On the same occasion, the HTX-examination was granted the status of a university entrance examination, and the graduates were now in principle placed on an equal footing with those of the [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|Gymnasium]], the [[Higher Preparatory Examination (HF)|HF]] and the [[Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX)|HHX]] programmes as far as access to higher education was concerned.

== Vocational secondary education ==
{{main|Vocational secondary education in Denmark}}
This section deals with the vocational education and training and basic social and health education programmes.

[[Apprenticeship]] training in a well-organised form originates in the guilds of the Middle Ages. Each trade had its own guild in each town. The guilds fixed the duration of the training of apprentices, their wages and working conditions and the disciplines they were to learn. It was furthermore the guilds which held the journeymen's tests.

=== Basic social and health education ===
The basic social- and health-education programmes (SOSU) were introduced in 1991, and the basic education programme for educator assistants was introduced in 1997. These programmes form part of the vocational upper secondary education system in Denmark.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6761">'''Shevah Mofet''' ({{lang-he|שבח מופת}}; also '''Shevach Moffet''') is a high school on [[HaMasger Street]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. It was established in 1946 as a vocational school. Since the 1990s, new programs were inaugurated to meet the needs of the Russian immigrant population in Israel.

==History==
The school was originally called Shevah, named after a British World War II pilot, who was the uncle of one of the founders of the school.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Founded in 1945, it was the second Hebrew high school in Tel Aviv, after [[Herzliya Hebrew High School|Gymnasia Herzliya]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} It was founded on the ruins of the Mount Hope farm,&lt;ref&gt;Tel Aviv municipality http://tel-aviv.millenium.org.il/NR/exeres/747CE319-2E55-49F6-9DED-1B9C50FF0476,frameless.htm&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Clorinda S. Minor]] and others. The buildings is a design by the architect [[Genia Averbuch]]. 

Shevah was initially a vocational school teaching trades such as cabinet making, electricity, mechanics and sheet metal works. As the demand for such schools declined, it became an academic high school.&lt;ref name="mandel prologue"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dialogue from the Heart of Confusion: Intercultural Encounter at the Shevach-Moffet School (prologue)|author=Mandel Foundation|isbn=978-965-07-1603-5|publisher=[[Keter Books]]|year=2008|location=[[Israel]]|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, with the onset of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, Shevah introduced a new educational approach to help Russian youngsters from falling behind due to the [[language barrier]]. Intensive Hebrew language classes were organized based on proficiency in Hebrew rather than age, and a program for parents was developed that included Hebrew language studies, Jewish history and culture.&lt;ref name="mandel prologue" /&gt;

In the 1990s,  Yakov Mazganov, a Russian professor employed as a  security guard at the school, founded Mofet, a night school for Russian immigrants that operated in the Shevah building after school hours. In turn, this attracted more Russian [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s and former professors to teach, as they couldn't find a job anywhere else, due to their lack of Hebrew knowledge. Eventually a decision was made to merge Shevah and Mofet and the Russian teachers started teaching in the regular school, which became known as Shevah-Mofet. While classes at the night school often went on in Russian, all classes in the day school were taught exclusively in Hebrew. Mofet is an acronym containing the words Mathematics and Physics, but also means ''excellence''.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gorbachev Shevah.jpg|thumb|right|300px|From left to right: [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Shimon Peres]], then school principal Avi Benbenishti]] --&gt;

This gave the school a reputation of being one of the best, but also discouraged attendance from many non-Russian students, who did not want to be part of a Russian-speaking high school in Hebrew-speaking Israel. The school was nicknamed 'Little Russia' by many.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} 

In 1995, the southern Tel Aviv school's team made a sensation by winning the first place on the team competition in Mathematics, hosted by [[Technion]]. Later, A Shevah student won a silver medal at an international junior software engineering olympics in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] on August 21, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3440742,00.html|title=Accomplishments for Israelis in Software Engineering Olympics|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2008-04-06|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; several students won medals on the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] including the gold medal by Lev Buhovsky in 1996 and several silver and bronze medals on the [[Asian Physics Olympiad|Asian]] and the [[International Physics Olympiad|International]] Physics Olympiads.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Shevah Mofet has attracted many Russian visitors, notably figures such as [[Sergei Brin]], one of the creators of [[Google]], and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the former Soviet president.

On June 1, 2001, an Arab [[suicide bomber]] killed 21 Israeli teenagers in the Tel Aviv "Dolphi" discothèque. Seven of the victims were from the Shevah Mofet high school, with more injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/6/Tel-Aviv%20suicide%20bombing%20at%20the%20Dolphin%20disco%20-%201- Tel-Aviv suicide bombing at the Dolphin disco June 1, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombing created an international outrage, but also caused many Jewish communities worldwide to donate money to Shevah Mofet. This helped improve the financial situation of the school and create a new library and cafeteria.

In November 2002, it was discovered that the school cafeteria served expired, or otherwise bad food products. It created a citywide scandal, where the media (newspapers such as [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] and [[Maariv]]) was involved, as well as the health ministry. Despite this, the cafeteria was still operating and employing the same workers in a repeat check-up in August 2003.&lt;ref name="cafeteria"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2997538,00.html|title=Cafeterias in Tel Aviv Schools - Cockroaches, Poisoning and Filth|publisher=[[Ynet]]|date=2004-10-31|author=Zlikovich, Moran|accessdate=2008-04-06|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
For many years, Shevah Mofet was a 6-year school organized into a junior-high school (grades 7–9), and a secondary school (grades 10–12). In 2007–08 however, a new organization was introduced, and the school was split into 3 two-grade sub-sections.

The secondary school has five departments, each focusing on a specific subject. In order of introduction, they are: computers, business administration, robotics, electronics, and Biotechnology. Each department has one classes, for a total of 5 classes per year.

==Notable alumni==
*[[Artem Dolgopyat]] (born 1997), Israeli artistic gymnast (second in world championships)
*[[Yuri Burda]] (born 1988), PhD mathematician (2004 and 2005 [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] bronze medalist)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Special Education Department''' is a [[Ministry (government department)|department]] of [[Government of Punjab, Pakistan]]. The department meets the [[Special education]] requirements of the disabled children especially, hearing impaired, visually impaired, mentally retarded and physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/644828/special-education-children-with-disabilities-need-inclusive-schools/ Special education: ‘Children with disabilities need inclusive schools’ – The Express Tribun&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983-84, the Directorate of Special Education Punjab was established in the Education Department. In 2003, the Special Education Department was established as an independent administrative department.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.punjab.gov.pk/provincialdepartments&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
At the time of independence, there were only two institutions, one for the Hearing Impaired at Lahore and the other for the Blind at Bahawalpur, functioning under the control of Education Department. A few institutions for the Hearing Impaired children and Visually Impaired children were also being run by the private sector organizations in the Province. Inspectorate of Schools for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind was established under the Education Department during 1962. It was given status of Deaf, Dumb and Blind Wing, headed by a Deputy Director during 1968. These institutions were nationalized in 1975 under Martial Law Regulation MLR-118. The Education Department took over these institutions and initiated various schemes for construction of buildings and to staff them with trained teachers. Directorate of Special Education Punjab was given the status of an attached department of the Education Department during 1983-84. Special Education Department was established as an independent administrative department during 2003-04. Prior to establishment of an independent department of Special Education Department there were 51 institutions in the Province with an enrollment of 4265, which has now risen to 248 catering almost 28850 special children, including 20 institutions of special education devolved from Federal Government as a result of 18th Constitutional Amendment. Presently, special institutions are functioning at every Tehsil and Town Level.

[[New Zealand]] provides [[Education in New Zealand#Student loans|student loans and allowances]] to tertiary students who satisfy the funding criteria. Full-time students can claim loans for both fees and living costs while part-time students can only claim training institution fees.

A non-refundable means-tested student allowance for living expenses can be claimed by students who are over 24 years old or whose parents have a low income. This criterion has caused anger among student bodies who point out that it excludes many self-sufficient adults from help due to parental income levels, and also that by age 24 most people have completed tertiary education.

==Loan composition==
The student loan comprises three parts:
*'''Compulsory fees''' – covers tuition fees and various levies. These are paid to the tertiary institution directly.
*'''Course-related costs''' – covers stationery, textbooks, equipment, etc. and voluntary student association fees. The borrower is allowed up to $1000 per year in course-related fees, which they can claim over the year. These are paid into the borrower's bank account.
*'''Living costs''' – covers rent, food, services, etc. The maximum payment for living costs is $175.96 per week, plus any student allowance received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studylink.govt.nz/financing-study/student-loan/living-costs.html|title=Living costs|publisher=Ministry of Social Development|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is adjusted every year in April to account for inflation.

==New loans==
There is a debt eligibility check for new loan applications. It is not possible  to borrow through the Student Loan Scheme if you have $500 or more in default at the time of your application, and at least some portion of that amount has been overdue for a year or more. This applies to all new student loan applications received by StudyLink on or after 7 February 2013 and includes all unpaid repayment obligations, late payment interest, penalties and amounts under installment arrangement.

==Repayment==
While the borrower is a resident of New Zealand, loans are repaid at a rate of 12 cents for every whole dollar of taxable income earned over the repayment threshold of $19,448 per annum ($374 per week), and no interest is charged&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ird.govt.nz/studentloans/working/employed/student-loan-repayments-employed.html|title=Paying off your student loan if you're employed (Working in New Zealand)|website=Inland Revenue|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Loan recipients who leave New Zealand accumulate interest after 184 days (about 6 months) abroad, and are assessed on their loan balance for repayment purposes, with a minimum annual payment being required.&lt;ref name="IRD overseas loans"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ird.govt.nz/studentloans/overseas/long-trip/ | title=I'm going overseas for 6 months or more | publisher=IRD | accessdate=8 January 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108064654/http://www.ird.govt.nz/studentloans/overseas/long-trip/ | archivedate=8 January 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loan repayments can be suspended on request for those on no/low income overseas, however interest still accumulates.

For borrowers in New Zealand with more than one job, it is possible to apply for a student loan special deduction rate for secondary earnings if you earn less than the pay period repayment threshold from your main job.

Student loans are written off in the event of the borrower dying; their estate is only obliged to pay any outstanding loan repayments up to the date of the borrower's death.

==History==
The loan system has been changed and modified significantly since its inception in 1992. Initially it provided bulk payments to students and charged lower than market interest rates from initial drawdown. This led some students to use this money for investment purposes, benefiting them but leading to a widespread perception of student excesses.

===Changes under the Labour Government===
In 2001 a growing debt mountain caused the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] to stop interest payments while students studied. Then in 2005 they rode to election on the promise of stopping interest for all those remaining in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="NZUSA"/&gt;

From 2001, all full-time students were made exempt from interest while studying, and from 2006 all borrowers resident in New Zealand have been exempted from interest. (Technically interest is applied to all loans, but written off if the borrower is resident in New Zealand.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ird.govt.nz/studentloans/owing/interest/sl-interest-index.html | title=Interest and other charges | publisher=IRD | accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2007, the Government introduced a three-year 'loan repayment holiday' for those overseas. In practice this is a uniform extension of the previous ability to waive repayments until a later date. As before, interest accumulates during this period.

===Changes under the National Government===
The [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] initially opposed the interest free loans policy, but after it lost the 2005 election, in early 2008 said it would keep interest off student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/246571/Nats-U-turn-on-interest-free-student-loans | title=Nats U-turn on interest free student loans | work=The Dominion Post | date=31 January 2008 | accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was elected to government in the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 general election]], the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] has kept interest off student loans, but has introduced a number of changes designed to make students repay their loans faster, and introduced penalties for loan defaulters.

From 1 April 2009, voluntary student loan repayments above $500 in a tax year were awarded at 10% bonus.&lt;ref name="Voluntary repayment bonus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ird.govt.nz/studentloans/payments/voluntary/bonus/ | title=Former voluntary repayment bonus | publisher=Inland Revenue Department | accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to increase the repayment rate of borrowers, information sharing between Government departments was introduced in 2010.&lt;ref name="Border changes slated"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11141305 | title=Changes to student loans slated | work=The New Zealand Herald | author=Davison, Isaac |date=17 October 2013 | accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1 April 2012, the maximum time for a repayment holiday was reduced from 3 years to 1 year.&lt;ref name="IRD overseas loans" /&gt;

From 1 April 2012, access to student loans was cut for people over 55.

From 1 April 2013, the repayment rate for student loan deductions increased from 10% to 12%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/8136194/Student-allowance-cuts-to-go-ahead | title=Student allowance cuts to go ahead | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=2 January 2014 | accessdate=8 January 2015 | author=Fletcher, Kelsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the voluntary repayment bonus was abolished.&lt;ref name="Voluntary repayment bonus"/&gt; (Student allowances were also restricted to four years worth of study.) The changes which came into effect in 2013 were introduced because the Government said it wanted to shift its investment from student support to supporting universities. Changes also raised the minimum mandatory repayments for people earning more than $367 a week. The University Students Association criticised the changes, saying people choosing to pay back loans quickly would no longer be rewarded, and repayment thresholds were too low, at about 34 % below the median weekly income. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10868809 | title=Dismay at new student loan rules | work=Herald on Sunday | date=3 March 2013 | accessdate=8 January 2015 | author=Weekes, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes were criticised by Labour Party Tertiary Education Spokesperson, [[Grant Robertson]], who said they would "dampen demand" for tertiary education and drive graduates overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/6853057/Student-loan-repayments-hiked-allowances-restricted | title=Student loan repayments hiked, allowances restricted | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=3 May 2012 | accessdate=9 January 2015 | author=Hartevelt, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Government announced that the student loan defaulters could be arrested at New Zealand's border. It was an effort to recover $430 million of defaulted student loan debt, "80 per cent of which is owed by overseas borrowers". The move was criticised by NZUSA, who said the policy would be ineffectual, and could potentially create "student loan refugees" .&lt;ref name="Border changes slated"/&gt;

===Student debt levels===
Average student loan balances have increased substantially over time. For instance, a 2007 survey by the [[New Zealand Union of Students' Associations]] found that the average student debt was over NZ$28,000, up 54% from 2004.&lt;ref name="NZUSA"&gt;[http://www.students.org.nz/index.php?dc_ac=3&amp;dc_prms=filelist,viewfile,430 Student debt reaches $10b – a millstone, not a milestone], NZUSA press release, 9 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, the average annual income (before tax) of New Zealanders aged 15 or more was nearly NZ$35,000.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/E5C757DE-23F3-419D-BDD2-41E46227BDDF/21020/nzisjune07qtralltables.xls New Zealand Income Survey: June 2007 quarter - tables] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126232043/http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/E5C757DE-23F3-419D-BDD2-41E46227BDDF/21020/nzisjune07qtralltables.xls |date=2007-11-26 }}, [[Statistics New Zealand]], 4 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The total student debt reached $5 billion in 2002 and then $10 billion in 2008, and has been growing by approximately $1 billion annually.&lt;ref name="NZUSA"/&gt; As of December 2014 student loan debt was $14.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/sl-scheme/sl-quarterly-report-dec14.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040139/http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/sl-scheme/sl-quarterly-report-dec14.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While student debt has increased, the number of students enrolled in tertiary education has generally declined in recent years. In January 2017 it was estimated 731,800 people, with an average balance of $21,000 had outstanding student loans representing a total of $15.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/personal-finance/news/article.cfm?c_id=12&amp;objectid=11787574 | title=Student loan debt 'balloons' by 37 per cent, with average student owing $21,000 | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=24 January 2017 | accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The History Teacher''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal]] concerned with the teaching of history in schools, colleges, and universities. It began in 1940 at the History Department at the [[University of Notre Dame]] as the '''''Quarterly Bulletin of the Teachers' History Club'''''.{{sfn|SHE homepage}}  Nuns attending the graduate history program in the summer edited and mimeographed the bulletin.  Each issue ran 20-50 pages, with informal teaching tips, evaluations of textbooks, and short thematic essays by Notre Dame professors. Its 110 subscribers were mostly teachers at [[Catholic school|Catholic high schools]] in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest.]]{{sfn|Weber|2012|p=338}}

In 1967 Notre Dame history Professor Leon Bernard transformed the bulletin into a national quarterly journal under the current title. He brought in a national advisory board of eminent scholars. It included only one professor based in a school of education and only one from a Catholic school. The circulation climbed to 3000. In 1972 Professor Eugene L. Asher brought it to coordinating faculty members at the Department of History at [[California State University, Long Beach]],{{sfn|SHE homepage}} and built a large staff and attracted essays from prominent scholars. The emphasis shifted from [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] to [[Higher education in the United States|college]] teachers. Asher set up the Society for History Education as official publisher outside the university [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], and it was the vehicle for applying for major federal grants for conferences. The subscriber base reached 4000.  Meanwhile, the [[American Historical Association]] waxed hot and cold, with many of its leaders hostile to the idea of promoting undergraduate teaching (as opposed to graduate level teaching). It gave no help.{{sfn|Weber|2012|pp=339—342}}

The journal has articles on history teaching primarily at the undergraduate  level, as well as historiography covering a full range of historical topics.  It reviews textbooks and monographs of value in undergraduate education.

'''''Top of the Form''''' was a [[BBC]] radio and television quiz show for teams from secondary schools in the United Kingdom which ran for 38 years, from 1948 to 1986.

The programme began on Saturday 1 May 1948, as a radio series, at 7.30pm on the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]]. It progressed to become a TV series from 1962 to 1975. A decision to stop the programme was announced on 28 September 1986 and the last broadcast was on Tuesday 2 December. The producer, Graham Frost, was reported to have said it had been cancelled because the competitive nature of the show jarred with modern educational philosophy.

===Television===
The programme was first aired on TV in two special experiments the first on 25 April 1953, featuring Sheffield High School (girls) v. Marylebone Grammar School (boys) &lt;ref&gt;{{UKGameshow|Television_Top_of_the_Form|Television Top of the Form}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A second TV broadcast was performed in 1954 featuring Lady Margaret High School for Girls (Cardiff) v Solihull School for Boys. The programme fully migrated to TV later. It ran from 1962 to 1975, and was called ''Television Top of the Form''. It began on Monday 12 November 1962, when the Controller of BBC1 was [[Stuart Hood]] (Scottish).

The questions were set by polymath and author Boswell Taylor on behalf of BBC TV and he was assisted by the BBC's Mary Craig who doubled as the scorer and electronic score board operator. In order to set appropriate questions the selected contestants from each school filled in a questionnaire listing their interests, books recently read and favourite music. The teams from co-ed schools usually included two girls and two boys.

Compared to many television quiz shows in recent years, ''Top of the Form'' had a resolutely grandiose outlook; nothing would ever be ''dumbed down''. Consequently, on Monday 18 June 1973 it had its first bilingual competition, with Paris v London. In the same year there was UK v Australia, in the ''Transworld Top Team''. The competition on Monday 25 March 1974 was all in the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] language.

In 1975 the TV version moved to 4.10–4.35pm on Sundays, then from 3.55–4.20, with the last final on 9 August 1975. One of the producers of the TV version was Bill Wright, who would later devise ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' in the early 1970s.

==Theme==
The tune ''Marching Strings'' (composition credited to "Marshall Ross", a pseudonym of [[Ray Martin (orchestra leader)|Ray Martin]]) was the theme for many years, though for the last few series, [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]]'s recording of [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' was used. Earlier, [[Debussy]]'s ''Golliwog's Cakewalk'', from his ''[[Children's Corner]]'' suite, had introduced the radio series.

==Producers==
Producers have included:
* [[Paul Mayhew-Archer]] (1970s), later to produce BBC radio comedy
* [[Griff Rhys Jones]]

==Contestants==
The series tended to feature [[grammar school]]s; in later years, as these schools became less numerous, [[comprehensive school]]s sometimes featured, but less often, and there was an increasing dominance by [[independent school (UK)|independent schools]].

However, as comprehensive schools were becoming more commonplace under the [[Harold Wilson]] government, the autumn 1967 TV series of ''Top of the Form'' featured only comprehensive schools.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', 21 September 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University City of Bogotá''' ({{lang-es|Ciudad Universitaria de Bogotá}}, ''CUB''), also known as the White City ({{lang-es|Ciudad Blanca}}), is the [[Flagship university|flagship]] campus of the [[National University of Colombia]], located near [[Teusaquillo]], in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].  It is the largest university campus in Colombia, with an overall area of {{convert|1200000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} and a constructed area of {{convert|308541|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, giving it ample green areas, open spaces, and pedestrian paths.  Amongst its buildings are seventeen that have been declared national monuments; these constitute a cross section of the last 60 years of Colombian [[architecture]].

The University City Rafael Uribe began when [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]], in his first term of office as president of the country, envisioned the National University of Colombia as a modern, evolutionary, and experimental infrastructure including a balance of science and arts. The University City in Bogotá of [[National University of Colombia]] may be viewed as an example of the architectonic expression of the modernization of the State from 1930 to the present time.

[[File:EscueladebellasartesUNAL.jpg|thumb|right|School of Beaux Arts, University City, Bogotá]] By virtue of law 68, enacted in 1935, it was made the National University of Colombia, an independent organization which opened education to a wider cross section of the population. This new broader view of education, the educational and administrative structure of the University City of Bogotá, its place in the state and its architecture had to reflect, in their respective scopes, the spirit of modernization on which the country was based. The state granted lands to the future university which were west of the city at the time, intending to stimulate the urban development of that zone. This plan succeeded to the point that, in 2006, the National University in its campus of Bogotá is considered both central and easily accessible.

To design the university, which had until then distributed academic functions across scattered locations throughout [[Bogotá]] and to different governmental organizations, the national government invited architect [[Fritz Karsen]], expert in university subjects, and the architect [[Leopold Rother]] to come assist them. Karsen defined and integrated an academic structure in an ellipse form from which radiated the five great academic divisions and his respective dependencies. The scheme was translated by Rother into the proposed space distribution for the in a "[[puristic cubism]]" style, but with some characteristics of the seat of the famous school of [[Bauhaus]], in [[Dessau]] (Germany), with a prismatic volumetry, white and austere.

[[File:PlazaCheoSantanderUNAL.JPG|thumb|right|Central Square, University City, Bogotá]] The space distribution offered the concept of "campus" for the first time in Colombia, where all the required buildings are scattered through green zones for relaxation, integrated with one another and connected by footpaths through the campus and two roads around the perimeter. Architects the Office of National Buildings of the Public Work Ministry, the Colombian organization in charge of the design and construction of the national administrative buildings, assisted Karsen and Rother in designing the campus.

[[File:Museodearteun.jpg|right|thumb|Art Museum, University City, Bogotá]] The composition of plants and facades with tendency to the asymmetry, the handling of new materials and new constructive techniques are, in synthesis, the elements that served as foundation the design. The constructions of the University City followed, in general terms, although the symmetrical composition in the space distribution of some buildings and the use of traditional constructive systems in others is well known. The use of stucco and white paint earned the campus the name of "White City".

The work of architect [[Leopold Rother]] is remarkable in that, in addition to participating in the initial planning stages of the campus, designed several specific buildings: the stage Alfonso Lopez (1937), the administrative offices (1937), porters' lodges at the entrances of streets 26 and 45 (1937), faculty housing (1939), research laboratories (1940), the engineering building, in conjunction with Bruno Violi (1940), and the press (1945). Rother stayed in the country as a teacher and influenced several generations of architects formed in the newly created Faculty of Architecture of the University. Of the initial buildings, the set of veterinary medicine and the faculty of architecture, both designed by Erik Lange and Ernesto Blumenthal (1938), the faculty of Alberto Wills Ferro (1940) and the student residences of Julio Bonilla are due to Silver's emphasis (1939 and 1940) and have been declared National Monuments.

The University City, in its design and construction, has furthered acceptance of modern architectonic language and its condition of paradigm and is considered one of the ten most important works of the century, in Colombia.
