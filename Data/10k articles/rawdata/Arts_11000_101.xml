The year '''1944 in film''' involved some significant events, including the wholesome, award-winning ''[[Going My Way]]'' plus popular murder mysteries such as ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' and ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]''.

==Events==

==Top-grossing films (U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;''Box Office Digest'', March 1945, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;==
Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to "normal" business at each theater. For example, ''[[Going My Way]]'' performed at a massive 264% while ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' was a hit at 173%. This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.

'''André Godard''' (21 January 1881 &amp;ndash; 31 July 1965) was an [[archeologist|archaeologist]], [[architect]] and historian of French and Middle Eastern Art. He served as the director of the Iranian Archeological Service for many years.

==Life==
Godard was born in Chaumont. A graduate of the [[École des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts of Paris]], he studied Middle Eastern archaeology, particularly that of Iran, and later became known for designing the [[National Museum of Iran]], where he was appointed inaugural director in 1936. He was also instrumental in the design of [[Tehran University]] campus.

He made his first trip to the Middle East in 1910 with Henri Violle. Together, they began to excavate the ancient ruins of [[Samarrah|Samarra]], located in modern-day Iraq. The ruins were fully excavated a few years later by German-born archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]]. Godard returned to his architectural studies in 1912, focusing on Islamic architecture of [[Egypt]].

After World War I, Godard married Yeda Reuilly. The Delegation of French Archaeology in Afghanistan was subsequently founded in 1922, so Godard and his new wife accompanied the organization to not-yet-excavated regions. They consequently studied Bâmiyân, which was later permitted to be exhibited at the central Buddhist shrine of the [[Guimet Museum]], in 1925.

In 1928, Godard was granted the directorship of Iranian Archeological Services, by the authority of [[Reza Shah]]. The IAS was intended to mark the end of French monopoly over excavation in Iran. As such, Godard focused on the politics of conservation, and held the title of Director from 1928-1953, then again from 1956-1960. Reza Shah also appointed him director of the [[National Museum of Iran]] (Muze-ye Irân-e Bāstān).

During his tenure, Godard was responsible for the restoration of major historic monuments of Iran, such as the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan|Friday Mosque]], the [[Imam Mosque Isfahan|Shah Mosque]], and [[Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque|Mosque of Sheikh Lutfallah]] of Isfahan among others. Using his directorships, he organized large excavations of [[Luristan bronze|bronzes of Luristan]], [[Persepolis]] and [[Isfahan]]. He was also instrumental, together with fellow architect [[Maxime Siroux]], in the design of the [[National Library of Iran]], [[Tomb of Hafez]], and [[Central Pardis]], the main campus of the University of Tehran.&lt;ref name="iranica-godard"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=15 December 2001|first1=Ève|last1=Gran-Aymerich|first2=Mina|last2=Marefat|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/godard|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=10 January 2016|title=GODARD, ANDRÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II Godard opposed the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] of France and when the Vichy diplomatic representatives were expelled from Tehran in 1942, helped form the Free France Committee and later become the official diplomatic representative of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|provisional government]] in Tehran.&lt;ref name="iranica-iran-france"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=15 December 2000|first=Marie-Louise|last=Chaumont|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/france-iv-relations-with-persia-since-1918|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=10 January 2016|title=FRANCE iv. RELATIONS WITH PERSIA SINCE 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period his wife Yedda organized an information radio program on [[Free France]] which was broadcast on the Persian radio.&lt;ref name="iranica-godard" /&gt;

Godard returned to Paris in 1960, where he continued to write on Iranian art. He died in [[Paris]] on 31 July 1965.

'''Bijago art''' or '''Bidyogo art''' is [[African art|African]] [[tribal art]] produced by the natives of the [[Bijagos Islands]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Bidyogo.html Bidyogo Information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119063727/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Bidyogo.html |date=2012-11-19 }}, Arts&amp;Life in Africa Online, [[University of Iowa]]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes many artifacts for daily use and ritual practices, following a traditional iconography that is unique to their culture, but shows variations from island to island.&lt;ref&gt;Gordts, Andre, La Statuaire traditionelle Bidjogo, Arts d'Afrique Noir, XVIII, summer 1976, pp.6-21&lt;/ref&gt; Such art pieces are known as Bidyogo art and their unique aesthetics make Bidyogo art distinctive from all other African tribal art with the exception of the nearby [[Baga people]] who share some of the iconography (and are considered a "related tribe" by Bacquart)."&lt;ref name="BacquartJeanBaptiste"&gt;Bacquart, Jean-Baptiste, The Tribal Arts of Africa, 1998, Thames and Hudson editors. p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shrine pieces==
Among the most striking Bidyogo art pieces are the portable ancestor shrines ("iran") that can either be realistic or abstract.&lt;ref name="BacquartJeanBaptiste" /&gt;

==Zoomorphic masks for coming-of-age rituals==
Zoomorphic masks representing cows ("vaca-bruta"), sharks, stingrays and, occasionally, other local animals are worn in adult initiation rituals ("fanado") mostly by boys, but occasionally by women.&lt;ref name="GalloisDuquette"&gt;Gallois Duquette, Danielle, "Dynamique de l'Art Bidjogo," IICT, Lisbon, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ritual paraphernalia==
Traditionally-decorated artifacts are also produced for "fanado" coming-of-age ceremonies (wood masks, spears, shields, headgear, bracelets), Girls are also given stylized dolls to learn about child-caring.&lt;ref name="GalloisDuquette" /&gt;

==Daily use objects==
The Bissagos produce unique objects for daily activities (fishing, agriculture) and personal use (stools, basketry, foodware) and boats.&lt;ref name="GalloisDuquette" /&gt;

==Architecture==
Though most Bidyogo hut dwellings show no remarkable artistry, so have their walls painted in bright colors with traditional symbols and patterns; occasionally doors are also painted with human or animal figures.&lt;ref name="GalloisDuquette" /&gt;

==Pieces for the tourist trade==
Some of the village artists carve for ritual use as well as for the tourist trade, which can thus enable visitors to acquire etnographically interesting pieces.&lt;ref name="GalloisDuquette" /&gt;

'''Bogosav Živković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Богосав Живковић}}; 3 March 1920 – 28 October 2005) was a prominent [[Serbs|Serbian]] sculptor and painter of [[Naïve art|Naïve]] and [[Outsider art]].

== Biography ==
Bogosav Živković was born in [[Leskovac]], near [[Lazarevac]], in 1920. As a young man, he was trained in the craft of [[leather-working|leather working]], and was taught how to sew leather jackets decorated with floral and geometric borders.&lt;ref&gt;М. Бошковић; М. Маширевић, ''Самоуки ликовни уметници у Србији'', Торино, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor health, he gave up working with leather in 1945 and moved to [[Belgrade]], where he found a job as a [[doorman (profession)|door attendant]]. He created his first sculpture in 1957, and held his first independent exhibition in 1960. He was soon recognized globally as an important leader in naïve and marginal art. His work is often categorized as [[Outsider art|Art Brut]], and has been the central subject of exhibitions in major museums in Europe, as well as in North America and South America. He died in [[Belgrade]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="krstic1"&gt;N. Krstić, ''Outsider Art in Serbia'', monograph, MNMA, Јагодина, 2014, pp. 74–81&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and work ==
Much of Živković's work was inspired by a seminal dream. In his dream, he saw a large serpent moving swiftly across a meadow, leaving a slimy track behind. With its tail, the serpent caught a stranger dressed in a monk's cowl and robe. The intensity of the dream led Živković to carve his visions in wood in order to gain a sense of release from his nightmare. To express himself, Živković used the natural shape of the trunk with or without branches, then smaller and thinner parts of branches, even ivy roots. Natural protuberances and hollows, various gnarls, and the mere mass of the matter inspired the artist to create the most diverse forms.&lt;ref name="oto1"&gt;[[Oto Bihalji-Merin|Ото Бихаљи-Мерин]], ''Снови и трауме у дрвету'', Београд, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[chisel]] followed the natural configuration of the wood, thus liberating, [[cutting]], [[trim (sewing)|trim]]ming and [[shape|shaping]] [[anthropomorphic]] and [[zoomorphic]] figures, and less frequently animal or architectural shapes. He mostly carved in [[relief]], which he used to cover his [[columns|monumental columns]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Krstić, ''Outsiders'', catalogue, МНМУ, Јагодина, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oto Bihalji-Merin]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Oto Bihalji-Merin|Ото Бихаљи-Мерин]]; Небојша Бато Томашевић, ''Енциклопедија наивне уметности света'', Београд, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Thevos, [[Roger Cardinal]], and others wrote about his work.&lt;ref name="oto1"/&gt;

== Exhibitions and awards ==
A great number of his [[monumental sculpture]]s are in galleries and museums. Some, such as ''My Home'' and ''Dreams and Thought'', are in the [[museum|collection]] of the Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), in [[Jagodina]].&lt;ref&gt;Љ. Којић, ''Богосав Живковић'', МНМУ, Јагодина, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Magic Garden'', in his native village, is a temple of his art with many sculptures – in stone and wood, reliefs of carved objects, coloured accessory edifices, etc. – which bears best witness to his work.&lt;ref name="krstic1"/&gt;

Živković had a number of independent and group exhibitions worldwide.&lt;ref name="krstic1"/&gt; He has had solo exhibitions in Belgrade, Vienna, Paris, Warsaw, Stockholm, Munich and Amsterdam. Among his awards are Grand Prix at the Second Biennial of Yugoslav Naïve Art in 1983 and Award for Entire Artistic Work in 1991, MNMA, Jagodina, Serbia.&lt;ref name="krstic1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2942">Jewish theatre artists have long influenced and co-created British theatre. In 2012, British theatre critic Michael Billington claimed that “modern theatre" is heavily dependent "on Jewish writers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billington|first1=Michael|title=J is for Jewish Dramatists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/14/jewish-dramatists-modern-drama|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A significant proportion of British theatre artists, such as Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Peter Brook, Mike Leigh, Steven Berkoff, Patrick Marber, Nicholas Hytner, Sam Mendes, Jonathan Miller, Ryan Craig, Julia Pascal, Nina Raine, Diane Samuels, Shellley Silas or Gail Louw (see the [[List of British Jewish entertainers]]), are of Jewish cultural heritage, and thus ‘differently’ cultured. As Peter Lawson argues, Israel Zangwill's dramatization of his novel ''Children of the Ghetto'' (1899) is the first notable British-Jewish play, focused on immigration to the East End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson, Peter, |editor1-last=in Baskin|editor1-first=Judith, R.|title=Judaism &amp; Jewish Culture|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=592-593}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that there is a British-Jewish theatre emphasises the specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks shaping Jewish-inflected theatre artists in Britain. Many of the Anglo-Jewish theatre or British-Jewish practitioners grew up in specifically Jewish environments (e.g.: Pinter, Kops, Wesker, Berkoff) to parents who were immigrants or first-generation British citizens. In these homes, Yiddish was often spoken and Hebrew read, different foods were cooked, different body languages seen, and the patterns of speech (often found in Pinter, Kops or Berkoff) were not quite British. British-Jewish theatre is shaped by specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks, such as the role of still prevalent stereotypes and low-level anti-Semitism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pascal|first1=Julia|title=Time to bury Fagin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/17/jewish-stereotypes-fagin-shylock|website=The Guardian: Opinion|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the controversies around the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2282">[[File:Lunda kyrka int07.jpg|thumb|Baptismal font attributed to Calcarius in [[Lunda Church, Uppland|Lunda Church]], [[Uppland]] (Sweden).]]
'''Calcarius''' ([[floruit|fl.]] second quarter of the 13th century) was an artist working in late [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style on [[Gotland]] (present-day Sweden).

==Works==
There exist no written sources about Calcarius and the name is a label, chosen in the 20th century by art historian [[Johnny Roosval]]. It is derived from the fact that this artist was the first to cut sculptures from [[limestone]] rather than [[sandstone]] on a systematic basis on Gotland.&lt;ref name=romanskkonst&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Karlsson|editor-first= Lennart|date= 1995|title= Den romanska konsten|url= |location= Lund|publisher= Signum|pages= 214-219|isbn=91-87896-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the workshop of Calcarius around 20 [[baptismal font]]s are attributed in the [[Baltic region]]. Only two of them are on Gotland (in [[Fole Church|Fole]] and [[Buttle Church]]), indicating that the workshop worked on an export market. The rest can be found in [[Ångermanland]] ([[Nora Church, Ångermanland|Nora]] and [[Selånger Church]]), [[Medelpad]] ([[Stöde Church]]), [[Hälsingland]] ([[Njutånger Church]]), [[Uppland]] ([[Vidbo Church|Vidbo]] and [[Lunda Church, Uppland|Lunda Church]]), [[Östergötland]] ([[Gistad Church]]), [[Scania]] ([[Borrby Church]]), [[Öland]] ([[Bredsättra Church|Bredsättra]], [[Runsten Church|Runsten]] and [[Ventlinge Church]]) and [[Bohuslän]] ([[Tossene Church]]) (all in Sweden), as well as in churches in [[Vestfold]] in present-day Norway, [[Falster]] in present-day Denmark and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in present-day Germany. In addition, the workshop created sculptures for church buildings on Gotland. These include [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] and/or [[tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] on [[Havdhem Church|Havdhem]], [[Tingstäde Church|Tingstäde]], [[Fole Church|Fole]], [[Linde Church|Linde]] and [[Levide Church]]. A single sculpture in [[Visby Cathedral]] has also been attributed to the workshop of Calcarius.&lt;ref name=romanskkonst/&gt;

The object called by the museum '''Casket with Scenes of Romances''' (catalogued as Walters 71264) is a French Gothic [[ivory]] casket made in [[Paris]] between 1330 and 1350, and now in the [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The casket is 4&amp;nbsp;5/8 inches high, 9&amp;nbsp;15/16 inches wide and 5&amp;nbsp;1/16 inches deep (11.8 × 25.2 × 12.9&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters&lt;/ref&gt;

The casket is one of the relatively few surviving [[Gothic art|Gothic]] ivory caskets decorated with a variety of themes from courtly literature, called '''composite caskets''' for that reason. There are at least eight known surviving examples (and numerous fragments), of which two more are also discussed in this article: firstly a casket in the [[British Museum]] with an almost identical set of scenes,&lt;ref&gt;British Museum P&amp;E 1856,0623.166, see Robinson, 216 and [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/i/ivory_casket.aspx Ivory casket with scenes from the Romances] in the Highlights on the website&lt;/ref&gt; and one in the [[Cluny Museum]] in Paris, which shares many scenes, but diverges in others.&lt;ref name = Carns&gt;Carns p.69. Both Carns and the Victoria and Albert Museum cite "eight", others "at least eight".&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period, Paris was the main European centre of ivory carving, producing large numbers of religious and secular objects, including small [[diptych]]s with religious scenes that used the same [[relief]] technique; these and smaller secular objects such as mirror-cases are more common than these caskets,&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 202; Gardner's, 364; the Courtauld database records large numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; or larger religious statues like the ''[[Virgin and Child from the Sainte-Chapelle]]'' of the 1260s. The composite caskets differ slightly from each other, but are sufficiently similar to suggest they all originated from one Paris workshop, or group of workshops, around 1330 to 1350.&lt;ref name= Carns/&gt;

This casket may well have been a gift of courtship or upon marriage, and was probably intended for an aristocratic female owner, to keep her jewels and other valuables in. The carved scenes were possibly originally painted; as the paint on Gothic ivories tended to peel in places, it was very often removed by later dealers and collectors. The unusually large size of the piece allows a wide range of the repertoire of popular scenes from different literary sources in French Gothic art to be shown, which display a variety of medieval attitudes to love and the role of women: "Themes such as lust and chastity, folly and wisdom are juxtaposed in a series of non-connected scenes".&lt;ref name="Robinson, 216"&gt;Robinson, 216&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan L. Smith]] has proposed that composite caskets express the power of love.&lt;ref name= Carns/&gt;&lt;ref name= Smith&gt;Smith pp. 168-186. Smith focuses on one of examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum but indicates her ideas apply to the whole group.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Walters casket is first recorded in England in 1757, and was bought by [[Henry Walters]] in 1923. The iron mounts are modern, probably 19th century.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

==Iconography==
The lid shows scenes of the '''Castle of love and knights jousting''' and the sides show other scenes from [[Medieval French literature|French medieval romances]]. The themes of the lid are related to the 13th-century ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'' by [[Guillaume de Lorris]] and  [[Jean de Meung]]. The ''Siege of the Castle of Love'' (or "Assault on" etc.), at the left on the lid, is a fanciful scene of courtly romance, where knights attack a castle defended by ladies and a cupid, with both sides throwing roses as missiles. This subject does not, as is sometimes claimed, appear in the ''Roman de la Rose'',&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, 266-267&lt;/ref&gt; and first appears in art not long before the date of the casket, as one of few secular scenes in the [[illuminated manuscript]] known as the [[Peterborough Psalter]] of 1299–1328.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 216; the MS is in the [[Royal Library of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]], as MS 9961-62, with the miniature on folio 91v.&lt;/ref&gt; But such a scene was staged and acted out by "many gentlemen and twelve of the fairest and gayest ladies of [[Padua]]" as part of a festival at [[Treviso]] in 1214, a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, 255&lt;/ref&gt;  In the center knights joust in front of ladies.

The scene at right has differing interpretations: either the victor, whose shield carried three roses, receives a bouquet of roses from a lady as prize,&lt;ref&gt;So Gardner's, 364&lt;/ref&gt; or, more likely, the tournament continues, now between the ladies, fighting with flowers, and the knights using "oak branches".&lt;ref&gt;So the Courtauld database: "Scene 3: Mock Tournament; lady and knight on horseback; ladies jousting with stems of flowers; men jousting with oak branches; couples watching from the castle battlements; portcullis."&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the only scene on the lid that differs in the British Museum and Paris caskets, where the siege of the castle continues in the section at furthest right. A variation of this set of scenes has examples in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Château de Boulogne-sur-Mer]], [[Walker Art Gallery]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]: in the latter (17.190.173) there is an elopement scene at left, then the two central sections are the tournament, with the attack on the Castle of Love behind the elopement at left, and in the last section on the right.&lt;ref&gt;See Gothic Ivories database, search on "Castle of Love"&lt;/ref&gt;

The front of the casket has, from the left: [[Aristotle]] teaching [[Alexander the Great]], [[Aristotle#Phyllis|Phyllis riding Aristotle]], watched by Alexander from a window, and at the right, old people arriving at the [[Fountain of Youth]], and young naked people in it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ANUsJaysHWAC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=Walters+Gothic+ivory+casket&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QjiDT_y-K8HU0QXThfH1Bg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Walters%20Gothic%20ivory%20casket&amp;f=false ''William and Henry Walters: The Reticent Collectors''], by William R. Johnston, Walters Art Gallery, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Phyllis riding Aristotle'' is the "quintessential image from the [[Power of Women]] topos", which was beginning its long career in art at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The Fountain of Youth is a regularly occurring scene, of Eastern origin, that shows old people being carried to a miraculous spring which immediately turns them into beautiful young people,&lt;ref name="Robinson, 216"/&gt; one of the relatively few scenes in medieval art where figures are not just "naked" but "nude".&lt;ref&gt;Using [[Kenneth Clark]]'s famous comment in ''The Nude''&lt;/ref&gt;  All three scenes are the same in the British Museum casket, and the Walters also has a side from a French casket of similar date but less high-quality carving, showing the first two of these scenes, but changing the last (Walters 71196, shown below). The Walters also has mirror-cases with other examples of the ''Siege of the Castle of Love'' and the ''Fountain of Youth''.
[[File:French - Casket with Scenes of Romances - Walters 71264 - Back.jpg|thumb|Walters, back side, with Arthurian scenes]]

The rear side of the casket contains scenes from [[Arthurian romance]] described in the [[Courtauld Institute]] database of Gothic ivories as: "[[Gawain]] in armour fighting the lion; [[Lancelot]] crossing the sword bridge, with spears falling from the sky; [[Gawain]] on the perilous bed; bed on wheels and with bells; lion; shield with a lion's paw; spears falling from the sky; the three maidens at the Château Merveil".&lt;ref&gt;Courtauld&lt;/ref&gt; The sword bridge features in ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]], and the perilous bed in his ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''. Both the Walters and British Museum caskets have the same scenes and compositions here, which both depart from the literary sources by having the rain of swords falling not only on Gawain on the bed, but also on Lancelot on the bridge, suggesting that the ivory-carver's or designer's contact with the literature was indirect.&lt;ref name="Robinson, 216"/&gt;

The two ends show other Arthurian scenes: the adulterous lovers [[Tristan and Iseult]] are spied upon by Iseult's husband King [[Mark of Cornwall]], hiding in a tree; his face can be seen reflected in the pool below, which they see, enabling them to switch to innocent conversation. This end also has a scene with a wounded [[unicorn]], a maiden and a man with holding a spear which has been run through the unicorn, in a version of the subject of ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' where the maiden has been used to lure the unicorn to his death.&lt;ref name="Robinson, 216"/&gt;  The other end has a scene with [[Galahad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4339">'''Clandestine literature''', also called "underground literature", refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self-publishing works, often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location. Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications (as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing).

Examples of clandestine literature include the [[Samizdat]] literature of Soviet dissidents; the [[Aljamiado]] literature of [[Al-Andalus]] Spain;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baralt|first=Luce López|title=Islam in Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present|year=1992|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004094604|pages=171–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[nushu]] writing of some upper-class women in [[Hunan]], China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Xing Lu |author2=Wenshan Jia |author3=D. Ray Heisey |title=Chinese Communication Studies: Contexts and Comparisons|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9781567506563|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clandestine publications were plentiful during the [[French Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clandestine E-Texts from the Eighteenth Century|url=http://www.vc.unipmn.it/~mori/e-texts/|publisher=University of Turin-Vercelli|accessdate=October 20, 2012|author=Gianluca Mori}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the [[Ancien Régime]], or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as ''[[Treatise of the Three Impostors]]'' and the reverend [[Jean Meslier]]s ''Atheistic Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, Enlightenment Contested'', Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 722ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Both texts were later published in edited versions by [[Voltaire]], but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These books were usually termed "philosophical works", but varied greatly in content from pornography, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.

Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and ''[[El Buscón]]''.

A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The [[Olympia Press]] in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including [[Henry Miller]], who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time.

'''''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs''''' (working title: '''''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs''''') is a ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[animation|animated]] cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], and released to theatres on January 16, 1943 by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[The Vitaphone Corporation]].&lt;ref name="bcdb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/7484-Coal_Black_And_De_Sebben_Dwarfs.html|title=Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs|publisher=BCDB|date=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is an all-[[African American|black]] parody of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[fairy tale]] ''[[Snow White]]'', known to its audience from the popular 1937 [[Walt Disney]] animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. The stylistic portrayal of the characters is an example of [[blackface|"darky" iconography]], which was widely accepted in [[United States|American]] society at the time. As such, it is one of the most controversial cartoons in the classic Warner Brothers library, being one of the [[Censored Eleven]]. The cartoon has been rarely seen on television, and has never been officially released on home video.

==History==
[[Image:1942 Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs Ad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Coal Black'' lobby card. The character designs for "So White" and her seven friends are examples of the 'darky' iconography typical of Hollywood animation during the first half of the 20th century. As a result, ''Coal Black'' and similar cartoons have been removed from circulation and are little known today among mainstream audiences.]]

===Overview===
In this version of the story, all of the characters are black, and speak all of their dialogue in rhyme. The story is set during World War II in the [[United States]], and the original tale's [[fairy tale]] wholesomeness is replaced in this film by a hot [[jazz]] mentality and sexual overtones. Several scenes unique to Disney's film version of ''Snow White'', such as the wishing-well sequence, the forest full of staring eyes, and the awakening kiss, are directly parodied in this film. The film was intended to have been named ''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs'', which producer [[Leon Schlesinger]] thought was too close to the original film's actual title, and had changed to ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Clampett intended ''Coal Black'' as both a parody of ''Snow White'' and a dedication to the all-black jazz [[musical film]]s popular in the early 1940s (i.e. ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'', etc.). In fact, the idea to produce ''Coal Black'' came to Clampett after he saw [[Duke Ellington]]'s 1941 musical revue ''Jump for Joy'', and Ellington and the cast suggested Clampett make a black musical cartoon.&lt;ref name="bcdb" /&gt; The Clampett unit made a couple of field trips to Club Alabam, a [[Los Angeles]] area black club, to get a feel for the music and the dancing, and Clampett cast popular radio actors as the voices of his three main characters. The main character, So White, is voiced by [[Vivian Dandridge]], sister of actress [[Dorothy Dandridge]]. Their mother, [[Ruby Dandridge]], voices the [[Queen (Snow White) in derivative works|Wicked Queen]] (or rather her sweet voice and evil cackle, while for the majority of the cartoon, the Queen's true voice, which is low and raspy, is played by Danny Webb). [[Leo Watson]] is the voice of "Prince Chawmin'". The other characters, including the Sebben Dwarfs, are voiced by standard Warner Bros. voice artist [[Mel Blanc]].

Originally, Clampett wanted an all-black band to score the cartoon, the same way [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] had [[Cab Calloway|Cab Calloway and His Orchestra]] score the ''[[Betty Boop]]'' cartoons ''[[Minnie the Moocher]]'', ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (1933 cartoon)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'', and their own version of ''[[Snow White (1933 cartoon)|Snow White]]''. However, Schlesinger refused, and the black band Clampett had hired, Eddie Beals and His Orchestra, only recorded the music for the final kiss sequence. The rest of the film was scored, as was standard for Warner Bros. cartoons, by [[Carl W. Stalling]].

===Synopsis===
''Coal Black'' opens in front of a fireplace with a red-tinted silhouette of a large woman holding a young child in her lap. The little black girl asks her "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" to tell her the story of "So White an' de Sebben Dwarfs". "Mammy" begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, once there was a ''mean'' ol' queen. And she lived in a gorgeous castle. And was that ole' gal rich! She was just as rich as she was mean! She had ''everythang!''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rich, [[Queen (Snow White)|Wicked Queen]] then appears, depicted as a "food hoarder", with a large repository of items that were on ration during [[World War II]]: rubber, sugar, gin ("[[Eli Whitney]]'s [[cotton gin|Cotton Gin]]" brand) and more. After stuffing her face with candies (from a box marked "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo|Chattanooga Chew-Chews]]"), she asks her magic mirror to "send her a prince 'bout six feet tall", (2 metres) but when Prince Chawmin' arrives in his flashy car, he declares "that mean ol' queen sho' is a fright / but her gal So White is dyn-a-mite!" Finding So White hard at work doing the laundry, the prince takes her hand and the two swing out into a wild [[jitterbug]]. The queen sees this and hires "[[Murder, Inc.|Murder, Incorporated]]" to "black-out So White."  The assassins arrive in a panel truck that advertises, "We rub out anybody for $1.00; [[Midget]]s: 1/2-price; [[Jap]]s: free". ([[US$]]1 would be equal to US${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|1|1943|r=2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}.{{Inflation-fn|US}})

The assassins kidnap the girl, but after several unseen "favors" which make the would-be assassins very happy, set her free in the woods unharmed. Just before they drive off, the assassins are seen covered with So White's lipstick, an [[innuendo]] as to exactly how she earned her freedom. Wandering through the woods by herself, So White runs into the Sebben Dwarfs, seven diminutive army men in uniform who sing "[[You're in the Army Now (song)|We're in the Army Now]]," with two dwarfs singing "it takes us cats ... to catch them rats" at the end, and So White declares in a 1940s swing-style singing voice, "I'm wacky over khaki now!" They immediately recruit her as their squad cook, and she spends her days "fryin' up eggs an' pork chops too" (to the tune of "Five O'Clock Whistle") for the hungry soldiers, as a sign which hangs from her outdoor antique stove reads, "Keep 'em frying," as a sendup of the World War II slogan, "Keep 'Em Flying."

Meanwhile, the queen has learned that So White is still alive, and pumps an apple full of poison to give to the girl and kill her.  Several worms escape the apple as the queen injects it with poison, one carrying a sign that says "Refoogies."  The queen disguises herself as an old peddler woman, and arrives at the Sebben Dwarfs' camp and gives So White the poisoned apple. One of the seven dwarfs (modeled on the "Dopey" dwarf in Disney's film) alerts the others that the queen has caused So White to "kick the bucket," and the entire squad hops into its vehicles (a [[Jeep]], a "Beep," and, for "Dopey," a "Peep"). As the queen makes her escape over the hills, the dwarfs load a cannon with both a war shell and "Dopey." The shell sails over to the queen, stops in front of her in mid-air, opens, and "Dopey" appears, knocking the crone out with a mallet.

Even though the queen has been defeated, So White is still dead to the world. The dwarfs note, in spoken rhyme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
She's outta this world! She's stiff as wood!
[[I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)|She's got it bad, and that ain't good!]]
There's only one thing that'll remedy this
and dat's Prince Chawmin' and his Dynamite [[Kiss]]!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon the dwarfs' invoking his name, the prince jumps into the scene in a spotlight and promises to "give her a kiss / and it won't be a dud / I'll bring her to life with my special 'Rosebud'", a nod to ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Wiping his lip and leaning over the girl in preparation, Prince Chawmin' proceeds to give So White a succession of highly aerobic kisses, practically swallowing the girl's face whole in trying to awaken her, but without any luck. Prince Chawmin' keeps frantically kissing So White (his efforts underscored by a solo from Eddie Beale's trumpet player), and the efforts literally take the life out of him as he first turns blue in the face, before turning into a withered old, pale-faced man, shrugging his shoulders in defeat. The "Dopey" dwarf then saunters over to So White, and, to the tune of "You're in the Army Now," lays a kiss on the girl so dynamic that not only does So White wake up, but her eyes become large as saucers and her pigtails fly straight up into the air (depicted in Rod Scribner's typically extreme animation style) as she jumps into the air.

The worn-out and aged Prince asks "Dopey," "Man, what you got that makes So White think ''you'' so hot?!" "Dopey" replies, with the only non-rhyming line in the cartoon, "well, dat is a military secret," and lays another kiss on So White, which sends her pigtails sailing into the air again and causes the red ribbons on them to turn into twin [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]s, to several notes of "[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]", and immediately after the kiss, So White and "Dopey" both show an obvious "afterglow" in their eyes and their smile. The film then fades to the standard ''Merrie Melodies'' "That's all, Folks!" end title text, superimposed over a shot of the little girl and her "mammy" from the opening scene.

===Race controversy===

In April, 1943, the [[NAACP]] protested the caricatures which appeared in ''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=https://thadkomorowski.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/naacp-coal-black.pdf|title=Memorandum to Mr. White from Miss Harper|date=1943-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=http://www.egusd.net/franklinhs/MediaCom/Animation1/Animation1_Term2/Coal_Black_Questions.htm|title=Coal Black Questions|publisher=Elk Grove Unified School District}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs'' is notorious for being one of the "[[Censored Eleven]]": 11 Schlesinger/Warner Bros. cartoons produced at the height of the [[Hollywood Animation: The Golden Age|Golden Age of Hollywood animation]] based on its unflattering and stereotypical use of [[darky iconography]]. Because it was produced in America during [[World War II]], there is also [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]: the firm "Murder Inc." advertises that it does not charge to kill "Japs".

The same basic stereotypical elements present in the earlier Censored Eleven films are also present in ''Coal Black'', depicted with more detail and made to conform to Clampett's "wacky" directorial style. The Prince, a vague [[Cab Calloway]] lookalike, is depicted as a slender, [[zoot suit]]ed Black man with [[straightened hair]], a [[monocle]], and gold teeth (with dice in place of the front two incisors). Both he and the dwarfs are drawn with large eyes, small noses, and unnaturally large pink lips, derived from the appearance of a white man in [[blackface]] rather than that of an actual black man. The middle-aged wicked Queen is depicted as an overweight, asexual [[Hag|crone]], with large lips that are only partially covered with lipstick (the Queen's lipstick only extends as far as it would if her lips were proportionate to her face).

Only So White escapes the extreme caricature given the other characters, although she is stereotyped in a different manner. She is designed as an attractive young woman with a voluptuous figure revealed by a short skirt and a low-cut, cleavage-revealing blouse. The sexualization of So White recalls [[Walter Lantz]]'s 1941 cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', where a young light-skinned Black woman is depicted as attractive while the other Black characters are drawn as extreme caricatures. In both that film and ''Coal Black'', the sexually attractive features of the young women are significant plot devices. In ''Coal Black'', So White is the object of sexual desire for every male character in the picture. This draws upon the stereotype of the young attractive black woman as an "exotic" sexual being, a stereotype present in roles that African-American actresses such as [[Dorothy Dandridge]] and [[Lena Horne]] played in American cinema.

Clampett would revisit black jazz culture again in another 1943 Merrie Melodies cartoon, ''[[Tin Pan Alley Cats]]'', which features a feline caricature of [[Fats Waller]] in a repurposing of the wacky fantasy world from ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]'' (during the opening sequence, the "Fats" cat is distracted by what appears to be So White). Clampett's colleague [[Friz Freleng]] directed a cartoon titled ''[[Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears]]'' in 1944, essentially ''Coal Black'' remade with a different fairy tale, and Warner's director [[Chuck Jones]] directed a series of shorts starring a prepubescent [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] hunter named [[Inki]] from 1939 to 1950. Like ''Coal Black'', ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' and ''Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears'' would also end up in the Censored Eleven.

Bob Clampett claimed in the cartoon's defense that;

{{quote|In 1942, during the height of anti-Japanese sentiment during [[World War II]], I was approached in Hollywood by the cast of an all-black musical off-broadway production called ''Jump For Joy'' while they were doing some special performances in Los Angeles. They asked me why there weren't any Warner's cartoons with black characters and I didn't have any good answer for that question. So we sat down together and came up with a parody of Disney's "[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|Snow White]]" and "Coal Black" was the result. They did all the voices for that cartoon, even though Mel Blanc's contract with Warners gave him sole voice credit for all Warners cartoons by then. There was nothing racist or disrespectful toward blacks intended in that film at all, nor in ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' which is just a parody of jazz piano great Fats Waller, who was always hamming into the camera during his musical films. Everybody, including blacks had a good time when these cartoons first came out. All the controversy about these two cartoons has developed in later years merely because of changing attitudes toward black civil rights that have happened since then.}}

===''Coal Black'' in later years===
The racially stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans in ''Coal Black'' and the other "[[Censored Eleven]]" cartoons led to their being suppressed from [[television]] broadcast. In 1968, [[United Artists]], which then owned the rights to the pre-August 1948&lt;ref&gt;The latest released WB cartoon sold to a.a.p. was ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'', released on July 24, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. cartoon library, officially banned the cartoons from circulation, and they have not been officially broadcast or released on [[home video]] since - even as the rights returned to Warners.

''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'' is often praised and defended by film scholars and animation historians, and has often been included on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. One such list, the subject of [[Jerry Beck]]'s 1994 book ''[[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]]'', placed ''Coal Black'' at number 21, based upon votes from over 1000 members of the American animation industry. Scholarly animation texts including [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]]'s ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barrier [https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Cartoons-American-Animation-Golden/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], 2003, Oxford University Press, 978-0195167290&lt;/ref&gt; name ''Coal Black'' as Clampett's undisputed masterpiece.  Despite its being banned, ''Coal Black'' is a popular draw at [[film festivals]] and small-audience screenings, and is often [[copyright infringement|bootlegged]] for release on home video.

It was seen briefly in the 1989 [[Turner Entertainment]] VHS release ''Cartoons For Big Kids'', hosted by [[Leonard Maltin]], and in the ''Behind the Tunes'' featurette "Once Upon a Looney Tune", which is included in the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5]]'' [[DVD]] box set.

On April 24, 2010, ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'', along with seven other titles from the [[Censored Eleven]], was screened at the first annual [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM) Film Festival as part of a special presentation hosted by film historian [[Donald Bogle]]; the eight shorts shown were restored for that release.

The '''contemporary realism''' movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/contemporary-realism.html|title=Contemporary Realism|website=www.artcyclopedia.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[North America]]n style of painting which came into existence c. 1960s and early 1970s. Featuring a straightforward  approach to representation practiced by artists such as [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Alex Katz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/alex-katz/|title=Alex Katz {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Beal]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-27|title=Jack Beal|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Beal&amp;oldid=767666756|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neil Welliver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-19|title=Neil Welliver|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_Welliver&amp;oldid=766314373|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement refers to figurative art works created in a natural yet highly objective style.  Today the term Contemporary Realism encompasses all post-1970 sculptors and painters whose discipline is representational art, where the object is to portray the "real" and not the "ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/realism.htm|title=Realism Art Movement: History, Characteristics of Naturalism|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Contemporary Realists, like Beal and [[Rackstraw Downes]], began as trained abstract painters. (Abstract Expressionism had been well-established by c. 1960.) Rural artist enclaves (e.g., The Hamptons; areas of Maine) encouraged naturalistic imagery for some. Others shared approaches and methods of [[Photorealism]].  Some art schools, notably the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], have continued to nurture the legacy of 19th-century American Realist painting; Yale has seen a loose, inter-generational network of representational painters over the past few decades. The [[New York Academy of Art]] continues to further contemporary figurative art.  A number of women artists have been prominently associated with stylistic variants of '''contemporary realism,''' including (not limited to) [[Jane Freilicher]], [[Jane Wilson]], [[Lois Dodd]], [[Janet Fish]], [[Catherine Murphy (artist)|Catherine Murphy]], [[Yvonne Jacquette]] and [[Martha Mayer Erlebacher]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Crucifixions and crucifixes''' have appeared in [[the arts]] and [[popular culture]] from before the era of the pagan [[Roman Empire]]. The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] has been depicted in [[religious art]] since the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]]. In more modern times, [[crucifixion]] has appeared in film and television as well as in fine art, and depictions of other historical crucifixions have appeared as well as the crucifixion of Christ. Modern art and culture have also seen the rise of images of crucifixion being used to make statements unconnected with [[Iconography#Christian iconography|Christian iconography]], or even just used for shock value.

In the first three centuries of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian art]], the crucifixion was rarely depicted. Some [[engraved gem]]s thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and it is thought that at this period the image was restricted to [[heresy|heretical]] groups of Christians. The earliest Western images clearly originating in the mainstream of the church are 5th-century, including the scene on the doors of [[Santa Sabina]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–91, fig. 321&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] forbade crucifixion as a method of execution, and early church leaders regarded crucifixion with horror, and thus, as an unfit subject for artistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Dreyer&gt;Elizabeth A. Dreyer, ''The Cross in Christian Tradition: From Paul to Bonaventure'', Paulist Press, 2001, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported discovery of the [[True Cross]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], and the development of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] as a site for [[pilgrimage]], together with the dispersal of fragments of the [[relic]] across the Christian world, led to a change of attitude.  It was probably in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the [[Monza ampullae]], small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the [[Holy Land]], as well as 5th-century [[ivory]] [[relief]]s from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–90, figs. 322–326&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Middle Ages]], early Christians preferred to focus on the "triumphant" Christ, rather than a dying one, because the concept of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|risen Christ]] was so central to their faith.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3728859|title=Donne and the Crucifixion|first=Julia J.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1984|publisher=|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=79|issue=3|pages=513–525|doi=10.2307/3728859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plain cross became depicted, often as a "glorified" symbol, as the [[crux gemmata]], covered with jewels, as many real early medieval [[processional cross]]es in goldsmith work were.

=== Eastern church ===
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|250px|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], 586 CE]]
Early depictions showed a living Christ, and tended to minimize the appearance of suffering, so as to draw attention to the positive message of resurrection and faith, rather than to the physical realities of execution.&lt;ref name=Dreyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Kevin Seasoltz ,''A Sense Of The Sacred: Theological Foundations Of Christian Architecture And Art'', 2005, Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early history of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|church in Ireland]], important events were often commemorated by erecting pillars with elaborate crucifixes carved into them, such as where [[Saint Patrick]], returning as a missionary bishop, saw the place he was held captive in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7yFjie05bcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=life+of+saint+columba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEvvnbkZLNAhUE44MKHQECA3oQ6AEIFDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Patrick&amp;f=false Life of St Columba], Penguin books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine depictions such as that in the [[Rabbula Gospels]] often show Christ flanked by [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] and [[Stephaton]] with their spear and pole with vinegar. According to the gospels, the vinegar was offered just before Christ died, and the lance used just after, so the presence of the two flanking figures symbolizes the "double reality of God and man in Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93&lt;/ref&gt; In images from after the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], Christ is shown as dead, but his "body is undamaged and there is no expression of pain"; the Eastern church held that Christ's body was invulnerable. The "S"-shaped slumped body type was developed in the 11th century. These images were one of the complaints against Constantinople given by Rome in the [[Great Schism of 1054]], although the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne]] is probably nearly a century older.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western church ===
[[File:Cimabue 025.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Santa Croce Crucifix]], {{convert|448|x|390|cm|1|abbr=on}}, by [[Cimabue]], [[Florence]], 1287–1288]]
The earliest Western images of a dead Christ may be in the [[Utrecht Psalter]], probably before 835.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early Western examples include the [[Gero Cross]] and the reverse of the [[Cross of Lothair]], both from the end of the 10th century. The first of these is the earliest near life-size sculpted cross to survive, and in its large scale represents "suffering in its extreme physical consequences", a trend that was to continue in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 141 quoted, 105–106, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Such figures, especially as [[rood]]s, large painted or sculpted crucifixes hung high in front of the [[chancel]] of churches, became very important in Western art, providing a sharp contrast with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, where the subject was never depicted in [[monumental sculpture]], and increasingly rarely even in small Byzantine ivories. By contrast, an [[Altar crucifix|altar cross]], almost always a [[crucifix]], became compulsory in Western churches in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;That it should be a crucifix was first specified in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1570&lt;/ref&gt; and small wall-mounted crucifixes were increasingly popular in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] homes from the [[Counter-Reformation]], if not before.

As a broad generalization, the earliest depictions, before about 900, tended to show all three crosses (those of Jesus, the [[Penitent thief|Good Thief]] and the [[Impenitent thief|Bad Thief]]), but later medieval depictions mostly showed just Jesus and his cross. From the Renaissance either type might be shown. The number of other figures shown depended on the size and medium of the work, but there was a similar trend for early depictions to show a number of figures, giving way in the [[High Middle Ages]] to just the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]], shown standing on either side of the cross, as in the [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]] depictions, or sculpted or painted on panels at the end of each arm of a rood cross.

The soldiers were less likely to be shown, but others of the party with Mary and John might be. Angels were often shown in the sky, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] in some early depictions gave way to a small figure of [[God the Father]] in the heavens in some later ones, those these were always in the minority. Other elements that might be included were the sun and moon (evoking the [[Crucifixion darkness|darkening of the heavens]] at the moment of Christ’s death), and [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]]. Although according to the Gospel accounts his clothing was removed from Jesus before his crucifixion, most artists have thought it proper to represent his lower body as draped in some way. In one type of sculpted crucifix, of which the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Volto Santo in Lucca]] is the classic example, Christ continued to wear the long ''collobium'' robe of the Rabbula Gospels.
[[File:Giotto di bondone e collaboratore napoletano, crocifissione, 1328-1332 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|A crowded Gothic narrative treatment, workshop of [[Giotto]], c. 1330]]

In the Gothic period more elaborate narrative depictions developed, including many extra figures of [[Mary Magdalene]], disciples, especially [[The Three Marys]] behind the Virgin Mary, soldiers often including an officer on a horse, and angels in the sky. The moment when [[Saint Longinus|Longinus the centurion]] pierces Christ with his spear (the "[[Holy Lance]]") is often shown, and the blood and water spurting from Christ's side is often caught in a chalice held by an angel. In larger images the other two crosses might return, but most often not. In some works [[donor portrait]]s were included in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–158&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions begin in the late 12th century, and become common where space allows in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Related scenes such as the ''[[Descent from the Cross|Deposition of Christ]]'', ''[[Entombment of Christ]]'' and ''Nailing of Christ to the Cross'' developed.  In the Late Middle Ages, increasingly intense and realistic representations of suffering were shown,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'', 1987, Greenwood Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the development of highly emotional [[andachtsbilder]] subjects and devotional trends such as [[German mysticism]]; some, like the [[Trinity#The Trinity in art|Throne of Mercy]], [[Man of Sorrows]] and [[Pietà]], related to the Crucifixion.  The same trend affected the depiction of other figures, notably in the "[[Swoon of the Virgin]]", who is very commonly shown fainting in paintings of between 1300 and 1500, though this depiction was attacked by theologians in the 16th century, and became unusual.  After typically more tranquil depictions during the [[Italian Renaissance]]—though not its [[Northern Renaissance|Northern equivalent]], which produced works such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]—there was a return to intense emotionalism in the [[Baroque]], in works such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s [[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|''Elevation of the Cross'']].

The scene always formed part of a cycle of images of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' after about 600 (though it is noticeably absent before) and usually in one of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''; the presence of Saint John made it a common subject for altarpieces in churches dedicated to him. From the late Middle Ages various new contexts for images were devised, from such large scale monuments as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|"calvaire"]] of [[Brittany]] and the [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] to the thousands of small [[wayside shrine]]s still found in many parts of Catholic Europe, and the [[Stations of the Cross]] in the majority of Catholic churches.

=== Popular art ===
Crucifixion in popular art, as with modern art, is sometimes used for its shock value. For example, a World War I [[Liberty bond]] poster by [[Fernando Amorsolo]] depicts a German soldier nailing an American soldier, his arms outspread, to the trunk of a tree. Crucifixion imagery is also used to make points in [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]].

After all, the way it's generally used in anime—when it's used at all—is in a manner Westerners can understand. It becomes a form of torture ''for someone who doesn't deserve it.''"({{Harvnb|Drazen|2003|pp=142–43}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Passion plays ==
[[File:PassionPlay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A passion play, Poland, 2006]]
{{Main|Passion play}}
Passion plays are dramatic presentations of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They originated as expressions of devotion in the [[Middle Ages]]. In modern times, critics have said that some performances are [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television ==

=== Film ===
Numerous movies have been produced which depict the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of these movies depict the crucifixion in its traditional sectarian form, while others intend to show a more historically accurate account. For example, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), was probably the first movie to depict the nails being driven through Jesus' wrists, rather than his palms. [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) depicted an extreme level of violence, but showed the nails being driven into Jesus' palms, as is traditional, with ropes supporting the wrists.

Although crucifixion imagery is common, few films depict actual crucifixion outside of a Christian context. ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) depicts the mass crucifixions of rebellious slaves along the [[Appian Way]] after the [[Third Servile War]]. The character Big Bob is crucified by cannibals in [[Wes Craven]]'s horror exploitation film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) as well as [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|its 2006 remake]]. ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) depicts [[Conan the Barbarian|the protagonist]] being crucified on the Tree of Woe.

The 1979 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' ends with a comical sequence in which several of the cast, including Brian, are crucified by the Romans. The film ends with them all singing the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]". In this sequence, the characters are not nailed to the crosses, but tied at the wrists to the crossbar, and are standing on smaller crosspieces at foot level.

In the 2010 film [[Legion (2010 film)#Plot|''Legion'']], one of the diner patrons is found crucified upside down and covered with huge boils.

=== Television ===
Simulated crucifixions have been performed in [[professional wrestling]]. On the December 7, 1998, edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', professional wrestling character [[The Undertaker]] crucified [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/11494884@N02/1382011485/|title=Stone Cold gets crucified by Undertaker on Taker's symbol|work=flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 1996, in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], during a feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], instructed his [[Raven's Nest]] to crucify Sandman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/sandman_crucifixion.html|title=Wrestlinggonewrong.com|work=wrestlinggonewrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other television performers have used crucifixion to make a point. The [[Australians|Australian]] [[comedian]] [[John Safran]] had himself crucified in the [[Philippines]] as part of a [[Good Friday]] [[Crucifixion#As a devotional practice|crucifixion ritual]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] show, ''[[John Safran's Race Relations]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/safran-crucifixion-disrespectful-immoral/story-e6frfkp9-1225699011366, Philippines villagers bewildered by John Safran comedy stunt]&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Robbie Williams]] performed a stunt on an April 2006 [[Easter]] Sunday show shown on the UK television channel [[Channel 4]], in which he was affixed to a cross and pierced with needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywood.premiere.com/news/music/story/church_slams_williams_crucifixion_stunt/|title=Church Slams Williams Crucifixion Stunt|work=premiere.com}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HBO]] television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' (2005–2007) contained several depictions of crucifixion, as it was a common torture method during the historical period the show takes place in.

In the 2010 ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'' television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'', Segovax, a slave recruit to the gladiatorial [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]] of Lentulus Batiatus, attempts to assassinate Spartacus in the ludus washrooms and is crucified for doing so "after being parted from his cock".

Crucifixion has been depicted in the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995–2001), where its depiction has been cited in feminist studies as illustrating violent and misogynist tendencies within a messianic paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Kathleen|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680770701477966|title=Xena On The Cross|journal=Feminist Media Studies|accessdate=December 12, 2011|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=313–332|doi=10.1080/14680770701477966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series "Vikings", the character Æthelstan, after being captured by the Saxons and named an apostate, is shown wearing a crown of thorns and being nailed to a cross. After the cross is raised he is taken down at the order of King Ecbert.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Japanese science fiction series [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] features crucifixion as a recurring motif.

== Music ==

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Weyden Christ on the Cross with Mary and St John.jpg|thumb|right|In music, ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' refers to compositions of a [[hymn]] of the same name, while ''[[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]'' in art is a specific form of depiction, as in this painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], circa 1460.]]
{{Main|Passion music}}
Famous depictions of crucifixion in classical music include the ''[[St John Passion]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s setting of ''[[Stabat Mater]]''. Notable recent settings include the [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|''St. Luke Passion'']] (1965) by Polish composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the [[Passio (Pärt)|''St. John Passion'']] (1982) by Estonian composer [[Arvo Pärt]]. The 2000 work, ''[[La Pasión según San Marcos (Golijov)|La Pasión según San Marcos]]'' (St. Mark Passion) by Argentinian Jewish composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]], was named one of the top classical compositions of the decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121772989&amp;ps=bb2|accessdate=April 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Huizenga|title=The Decade In Classical Recordings|date=December 27, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of traditional passion motifs with [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[Capoeira]], and [[Kaddish]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/osvaldo-golijovs-musical-passion|accessdate=April 2, 2010|title=Osvaldo Golijov's Musical "Passion"|date=April 2, 2010|publisher=wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion has figured prominently in Easter [[Passion cantata|cantatas]], [[oratorio]]s, and [[requiem]]s. The third section of a full [[mass (music)|mass]], the ''Credo'', contains the following passage at its climax: ''"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est,"'' which means "And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried." This passage was sometimes set to music separately as a ''Crucifixus'', the most famous example being that of [[Antonio Lotti]] for eight voices.

The [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven utterances of Jesus while on the Cross]], gathered from the four gospels, have inspired [[Musical settings of The Seven Last Words of Christ|many musical compositions]], from [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1645 to Ruth Zechlin in 1996, with the best known being [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'', composed in 1787.

Depictions of crucifixion outside the Christian context are rare. One of the few examples is in [[Ernest Reyer]]'s opera ''[[Salammbô (Reyer)|Salammbô]]'' (1890).

=== Popular music ===
The 1970 [[rock opera]] [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ends with Jesus' crucifixion.

The cover art of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]] features an image of Tupac being crucified on a cross. He stated that the image was not a mockery of Christ; rather, it showed how he was being "crucified" by the media.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Multiple [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] videos such as "I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me" and "Coma White" feature crucifixion imagery, often oddly staged in surreal modern or near modern-day settings. The Norwegian black metal band [[Gorgoroth]] had several people on stage affixed to crosses to give the appearance of crucifixion at a now infamous concert in [[Kraków]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathan Tisdall |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland – Aftenposten.no |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archivedate=2009-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated this act in the music video for "Carving a Giant." In 2006, singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] caused controversy by opening a concert held near [[Vatican City]] with a mock crucifixion, complete with a [[crown of thorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=387254&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Madonna under fire over mock crucifixion|work=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookshop2.jpg|thumb|A small selection of covers from The Douglas Hyde Gallery's recent publications. Clockwise from top left: Matthew Day Jackson, Fergus Feehily, Ciaran Murphy, James Castle.]]
'''The Douglas Hyde Gallery''' is a publicly funded [[contemporary art]] gallery situated within the historical setting of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/dublin/art/venue/1:5169/douglas-hyde-gallery Douglas Hyde Gallery review], ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Gallery opened in 1978, it was for a number of years Ireland's only public gallery of contemporary art. Today, in an abundance of smaller galleries and exhibition spaces in Dublin, The Douglas Hyde Gallery continues to sustain its reputation for holding exhibitions by some of the most established and well-regarded Irish and international artists working today.

The Douglas Hyde Gallery consists of two exhibition spaces that are used to show concurrent exhibitions, which often have a relating theme or tone.

== Gallery 1 ==
Gallery 1, designed by [[Paul Koralek]] of [[ABK Architects]], is the Gallery's main space and has played host to solo-exhibitions by renowned artists such as [[Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss|Fischli/Weiss]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Gabriel Orozco]] and [[Peter Doig]]. Notable Irish artists who have exhibited in Gallery 1 include: [[Dorothy Cross]], [[Willie Doherty]], [[Gerard Byrne (artist, born 1969)|Gerard Byrne]], Patrick Graham, Patrick Hall, [[Michael Warren (sculptor)|Michael Warren]] and Kathy Prendergast.

== Gallery 2 ==
[[File:Marlene Dumas the-douglas hyde gallery.jpg|thumb|Installation photograph of 'The Paradise [4]' by Marlene Dumas in Gallery 2, The Douglas Hyde Gallery, December 2001]]
Gallery 2, which opened in 2001, was designed by McCullough Mulvin Architects. In addition to exhibitions by contemporary artists, this space is often used to show small collections of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] objects and artefacts which are generally marginalised by larger museums and galleries. The most popular of these exhibitions have included: Nepalese Shamanic objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=51 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213205416/http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=51 |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Tea Bowls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145808/http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=25 |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ghanaian [[Asafo]] Fante Flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=19 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213232001/http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=19 |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of exhibitions in Gallery 2 fall under ‘The Paradise’ series of shows, which invites artists to create a new work or present a series of works based on their own idea of ‘The Paradise’. As of February 2011, there have been 34 exhibitions in The Paradise series.

== Publications ==
The Douglas Hyde Gallery produces publications for many of its exhibitions. These books can take the form of [[exhibition catalogue]]s, artists’ books or curated projects and, while extremely different in content, they all share a similar exterior presentation. Since 2002, the Gallery has published over forty books in this small, hardback format.

The Leaves &amp; Papers series of books and leaflets is an ongoing project which allows The Douglas Hyde Gallery to produce and publish ideas, images and texts relating to a specific theme or concept which does not always relate directly the Gallery's programme.

Another ongoing series of books documents the Galley's programme while also highlighting some of the central principles of the Gallery and its exhibitions. The books explore ideas about visual culture, identity, and spirituality through carefully selected texts and imagery. These books include: the bread and butter stone, 1997; Patmos, 1999; 33 Happy Moments, 2003; Alabama Chrome, 2007; The Bridge, 2008; Questions of Travel, 2009; Saunter, 2010.

== Music ==
The Douglas Hyde Gallery has become increasingly well known for its programme of musical events. In recent years, [[Cat Power]], [[Sufjan Stevens]] and [[Laura Veirs]] have all played in the Gallery. Sometimes the musical performances relate directly to exhibitions: In 2008, [[Jandek]] performed a concert to coincide with an exhibition of his album covers and in 2009, [[Jim White (musician)|Jim White]] played a gig to celebrate the opening of his exhibition of ephemera from the [[Southern United States|American South]]. It is more often the case that the performances and exhibitions share a mood or atmosphere rather than a direct connection.

The '''Espresso Book Machine''' (EBM) is a [[print on demand]] (POD) machine that prints, collates, covers, and binds a single book in a few minutes.

The EBM is small enough to fit in a retail book store or small library room, and as such it is targeted at retail and library markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/overview-of-report-on-future-of-books.html Overview of the report on "Future of Books"] CQ Researcher Blog. May 29, 2009. Retrieved 2011-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The EBM can potentially allow readers to obtain any book title, even books that are [[out of print]]. The machine takes a [[PDF]] file for input and prints, binds, and trims the reader’s selection as a [[paperback book]].&lt;ref name="PR Web"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[Jason Epstein]] gave a series of lectures in 1999 about his experiences in publishing. Epstein mentioned in his speech that a future was possible in which customers would be able to print an out-of-stock title on the spot, if a book-printing machine could be made that would fit in a store. He founded 3BillionBooks with Michael Smolens, a Long Island entrepreneur in Russia, and Thor Sigvaldason, a consultant at [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]]. At the time, Jeff Marsh, a [[St Louis]] engineer and inventor, had already constructed a prototype book printer that could both photocopy and bind. Marsh was working on this project for Harvey Ross, who held U.S. Patent 5,465,213.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=H.M.|title=System and Method of Manufacturing a Single Book Copy|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5465213|publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Zelchenko, a Chicago-based technologist and a partner of Ross in a related patent effort, worked with Marsh to prove the concept and also helped bring Marsh and other players together with several venture interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rose|first=M.J.|title=Twelve-minute Book Delivery|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/07/45228|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=July 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ultimately Epstein, together with Dane Neller, former President and CEO of [[Dean and Deluca]], licensed Marsh's invention and founded On Demand Books.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ondemandbooks.com/history.htm About ODB: History], OnDemandBooks.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Espresso Book Machine was installed and demonstrated June 21, 2007 at the [[New York Public Library]]'s Science, Industry and Business Library. For a month, the public was allowed to test the machine by printing free copies of [[public domain]] titles provided by the [[Open Content Alliance]] (OCA), a non-profit organization with a database of over 200,000 titles.&lt;ref name="PR Web"/&gt;

==Distribution==
The direct-to-consumer model supported by Espresso Book Machine eliminates the need for shipping, warehousing, returns and pulping of unsold books; it allows simultaneous global availability&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; of millions of new and backlist titles.

EBM books can also be made available for distribution through [[Lightning Source]], a subsidiary of [[Ingram Content Group]].

'''Experience architecture''' ('''XA''') is the art of articulating a clear [[user story]]/[[user journey|journey]] through an [[information architecture]], [[interaction design]] and [[experience design]] that an end user navigates across products and services offered by the client or as intended by the designer. This visual representation is intended not only to highlight the systems that the end user will touch and interact with, but also the key interactions that the user will have with interacting the internal systems or back end structure of an application. It provides a holistic view of the experience, vertical knowledge of industry, the systems, documenting, analysing and the points that should be focused on when developing a series of interactions that are intended to enhance end user’s emotions. The Experience architecture provides an overall direction for user experience actions across the projects.

==Experience architect==
An experience architect (also known as an XA) is a designer authoring, planning and designing the experience architecture deliverables.  An XA will encompass variety of interaction and digital design skills of human behaviour, [[user-centered design]] (UCD) and [[interaction design]]. This person is also responsible for connecting human emotions with the end product thus creating co-relations by ensuring that the experience meets or exceeds needs and objectives of the intended or wide users. The XA integrates the results into an actionable requirements. They are responsible for conceptualising and delivering the design deliverables that meets business and usability objectives by identifying the modules, templates, structure and evaluating the end product integration.

==Experience architect deliverables==
Experience architects are responsible for documenting and delivering a series of project manuals, guidelines and specifications. These include all or some of the below practices.
* [[Persona]]
* [[Scenario]]
* [[User story]]
* [[User journey]]
* [[Process flow diagram]]
* [[Information Architecture]]
* [[Website wireframe|Wireframe]]
** Ranging from High-Fidelity to Low-Fidelity
* [[Content strategy]]
* [[Prototype]]
* [[Functional specification]]

==Inclusive experience==
A great design experience must be self-explanatory and emphasizes on a user journey from step to step in minimalistic manner. In a broader term, it is a branch of [[inclusive design]] and [[universal design]]. The purpose of inclusion in the context of experience architecture is to create technology and user interfaces accessible for wider audiences inclusive of full range of human diversity with respect to ability, gender, age and other forms of human difference.

This methodology is to achieve independent experience and accessibility for users who are aging, abled or disabled or impaired either by birth, natural or incurred through natural events. It requires exercising and creating interfaces or prototyping a [[lower level design]] for physical world that makes actions and steps more self-explanatory thereby removing layers of prerequisite requirements to access any digital system. Inclusive Experience is an emerging and developing skill sets and standard elements in applications that are mass-produced for consumers, government and in other public domains.

== Education ==
The first Experience Architecture program began at Michigan State University. Developed by Liza Potts, Rebecca Tegtmeyer, Bill Hart-Davidson, this program launched in 2014.

In physics, a '''global symmetry''' is a [[symmetry in physics#Local and global symmetries|symmetry]] that holds at all points in the [[spacetime]] under consideration, as opposed to a [[local symmetry]] which varies from point to point.

Global symmetries require [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, but not [[forces]], in physics.

An example of a global symmetry is the action  of the &lt;math&gt;U(1)=e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; a constant - making it a global transformation) group on the Dirac Lagrangian:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_D = \bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu-m\right)\psi&lt;/math&gt;

Under this transformation the fermionic field changes as &lt;math&gt;\psi\rightarrow e^{i\theta}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}\rightarrow e^{-i\theta}\bar{\psi}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html&lt;/ref&gt; and so:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\rightarrow\bar{\mathcal{L}}=e^{-i\theta}\bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu-m\right)e^{i\theta}\psi=e^{-i\theta}e^{i\theta}\bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu-m\right)\psi=\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Harnessing The Power Of Wisdom: From Data to Wisdom''''' is a philosophical book by [[Andrew Targowski]] that discusses the concept and status of wisdom in modern society.

==Summary==
In the book Targowski defines wisdom as good judgement and choice and also states that wisdom can be taught. He goes on to say that wisdom is one portion of the cognitive units that create the Semantic Ladder: Data, Information, Concept, Knowledge, and Wisdom. Targowski also gives his reasons as to why civilization is, as a whole, further behind than it was in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] times on a philosophical level. He opines that even with the advances in the realm of [[Information Technology]] (IT), society remains unable to convert the information at its fingertips into the ultimate form of knowledge and wisdom. This book besides scientific synthesis of wisdom covers also the “art of living” and the decline in human ability to achieve its greatest potential as a global community.

==Reception==
''Biocosmology'' gave ''Harnessing the Power of Wisdom'' a positive review, stating that it was "a remarkable wise contribution to the contemporary cultural world, forming an interdisciplinary theory of wisdom and conception of the wise Integralist civilization. Substantially, this is a significant step towards the integral organization of contemporary social and cultural life, and a valuable piece of information of the integrally organizing essence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=KHROUTSKI|first1=Konstantin S.|title=Harnessing the Power of Wisdom (review)|journal=Biocosmology|date=Winter–Spring 2014|volume=4|issue=1-2|url=https://b0e97027-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/biocosmologyneoaristotelism/home/1-1/91.Khroutski.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7co65XKmU1AoJK3kiSTL_ce8HaUjsJ5FhGmXWr6GPU81tWDAXkj6SPHqqRCBBzNDUIMtQoc11hpYRG4EgVWz6S2Rfj7UBSFMH9UaGOw67snlNDvvFYThNoehQyACpjNld8SIK4cVeflCZvKQkCmuIOiQyUf-G2sT5-MoBl5VZ7GGGBXYXOY656Eb97a4KUf2ycwo1pfL0hVncVPTOyjCTpKMKBf7b9YxOO40J8YsbQjEIZ09bPt08t-oZV3QakbrCT4TUIhX&amp;attredirects=0|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dialogue and Universalism'' also praised the work and made it one of the main focuses of one of their 2014 issues where they brought in 8 writers to reflect on the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kato|first1=Hisanori|title=A Way to Wisdom|journal=Dialogue and Universalism|date=2014|volume=24|issue=2|pages=222–223|doi=10.5840/du201424242|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=du&amp;id=du_2014_0024_0002_0222_0223|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=III.

==Plot==
After returning home from [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], Harold Lee and Kumar Patel decide to travel to [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] so Harold can surprise his neighbor and newfound girlfriend Maria. At the airport, Kumar argues with a [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] agent for searching him “because of the color of his skin” despite the agent being black. The duo encounter Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's [[bong]] for a [[bomb]] and the duo are apprehended by [[sky marshal]]s. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], believes the duo are agents of a joint [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[North Korea]]n conspiracy and send them to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]]. The duo escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to [[Miami, Florida]] where they begin their trek to [[Texas]], hoping Colton can clear their names. 

The duo endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son, escaping a [[Ku Klux Klan]] rally, and visiting a brothel with [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who helps them evade capture from Fox. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to exonerate the duo, but upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers them to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox’s men. When Fox tries confronting them he is knocked out by Dr. John Beecher the [[Vice Chairman]] of the [[NSA]] after Fox repeatedly treated him poorly. But he accidentally loses his footing, opens a door and falls to his death. Harold and Kumar escape via parachute, and Fox falls to his death while pursuing them. The two land in [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s estate, and after smoking [[cannabis]] with the duo, Bush pardons them. The duo are escorted to Vanessa and Colton's wedding by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold punches him out. Kumar consoles a furious Vanessa by reciting a poem he wrote for her in college and they reconcile. Harold, Kumar, and Vanessa travel to Amsterdam where Harold finds Maria, and the couples happily tour the city together while getting high off cannabis.

==Production==
&lt;!---- 
Clearly not B class level, and due to the lack of coverage of the production phase it's not really 'C' class either. There is no coverage of the development phase including the casting, or the filming or the post-production. A 'C' class article should serve as a sufficient article in its own right, and while it allows for gaps in the coverage it shouldn't be misisng entire sections, so I'm demoting it to "Start" class. If you add a "production" section and want the article reassessed unstrike your request. Betty Logan (talk) 05:56, 25 July 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Horror Victorianorum''' (terror of the Victorian), coined by the philosopher [[David Stove]], is an extreme distaste or condemnation of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] culture, art and design. The term was used in Stove's book ''[[David Stove#The Plato Cult|The Plato Cult]]'' as part of his argument against [[Karl Popper]] and other philosophers whom he characterised as "[[modernism|modernist]]s". For Stove, Popper was influenced by the pervasive anti-Victorian mentality of the era, epitomised by [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s book ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'', in which the absurdity of Victorian values is expressed by a parody of "Victorian" conceptions of the civilizing mission of imperialism, when the hero is finally trapped in the Amazonian jungle, forced eternally to read the works of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] to a [[tribal chief]].

For Stove, the ascription of absurdity to Victorian culture was essentially a matter of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]], but one so powerful and irrational that it possessed the intensity of religious faith. As a result, it produced a revulsion &amp;ndash; rather than a reasoned scepticism &amp;ndash; to writers such as the Victorian philosopher of science [[William Whewell]].

Following Stove's usage, the term was taken up by the design historian Shelagh Wilson to refer to modernist distaste for [[Victorian architecture]] and design. Wilson argued that "Palissyite" design, influenced by the methods of [[Bernard Palissy]], had been ridiculed and misunderstood by proponents of "Puginite" design, following the proto-modernist principles of [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]]. Wilson's argument formed part of a reaffirmation of the aesthetic principles of the [[grotesque]].

The argument that distaste for Victorian cultural values ('[[Anti-victorianism]]') is irrational has been adopted by other writers,{{ref|nation}}either following Stove's politically conservative attack on [[liberalism|liberal thought]], or Wilson's critique of modernism.

'''Janice Battersby ''' (also '''Lee''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Portrayed by [[Vicky Entwistle]], the character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 6 January 1997.&lt;ref name="itv"/&gt;

On 2 August 2010, it was announced that Entwistle had quit her role as Janice after 14 years on the show and would depart in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a254796/janice-battersby-to-leave-corrie.html|title=Janice Battersby to leave Corrie|publisher=''[[DigitalSpy]]''|date=2 August 2010|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her final appearance on 25 March 2011 after she leaves Weatherfield with her new boyfriend [[Trevor Dean]] (Steve Jackson) to go travelling around the world.

==Storylines==
Janice first appears in January 1997 as a new machinist at [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) garment factory "Underworld". In July 1997 she returns along with husband [[Les Battersby|Les]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), daughter [[Toyah Battersby|Toyah]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) and stepdaughter [[Leanne Battersby|Leanne]] ([[Jane Danson]]). She is consistently rude to her various managers at the factory. She breaks up with Les after having an affair with [[Dennis Stringer]] ([[Charles Dale]]) late in 2001, who is seeing [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) at the time. Les is so upset that he attempts suicide on New Year's Day, and while driving him to hospital, they collide with another car. Les survives with minor injuries but Dennis is badly injured and later dies in hospital. Janice is left devastated by Dennis's death.

In March 2004, Janice sneaks into the storeroom at the factory for a crafty cigarette but drops the cigarette when caretaker [[Harry Flagg]] ([[Iain Rogerson]]) locks her in, a fire starts. Just before the whole room burns down, factory manager [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Adam Rickitt]]) comes to her rescue - and as a result of the fire, she ends up in hospital and Nick is sacked by Mike.

Janice later becomes involves with police officer, [[Mick Hopwood]]. When Mick and Les get into a fight, Les is unfairly imprisoned and Janice splits up with Mick. A later attempt at reconciliation with Les fails as a result of interference from [[Cilla Battersby-Brown|Cilla Brown]] ([[Wendi Peters]]).

In the summer of 2005, Janice discovers, to her horror, that she has [[Head louse|nits]]. Drunkenly, she asks friend [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) to shave her head. When she sees her bald head in the mirror, she is appalled. A couple of weeks later, she has a mud fight with resident [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) on the Red Rec after Claire calls her a "pug faced scumbag".

In early 2006, Janice and Leanne are involved in a car accident, when [[Danny Baldwin|Danny]] ([[Bradley Walsh]]) does not ask [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) to perform a full service on the car. They crash into [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Platt]]'s ([[Helen Worth]]) front wall. Since then, Janice and Sally Webster become rivals as Janice feels that Sally and her daughter, Rosie, look down their noses at her. The rivalry comes to a head on 27 February 2006, when Janice is sacked by Danny Baldwin, and shortly after, she is punched by nemesis Sally, in the middle of the [[Rovers Return Inn]]. She leaves the Street in shame.

However, it was reported in December 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds27748.html Digital Spy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111174254/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds27748.html |date=11 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that despite original plans for her to be written out of the series, Vicky Entwistle's contract was renewed. She goes to stay with Toyah in London in March 2006, but returns by April, telling Leanne that life in London was not any better than life in Weatherfield. She then helps Leanne as she discovers Mike's original will, that Leanne's boyfriend Danny does not know about.

In January 2007, Janice's heating breaks down and she calls plumber [[Roger Stiles]] ([[Andrew Dunn (actor)|Andrew Dunn]]) to fix it, who arrives late. After socialising a bit, Roger asks Janice to go with him to [[France]] for a few months, which she accepts. She returns in March and Roger returns in June. She subsequently finds out that her stepdaughter Leanne is a [[prostitute]]; after everyone finds out, Janice gets into a catfight with co-worker [[Kelly Crabtree]] ([[Tupele Dorgu]]). Janice pleads with her to give up her work, but Leanne initially refuses as it is too lucrative. Eventually she admits that she can not continue and moves in with Janice. Janice and Roger reconcile, and Roger gives Leanne a loan for the restaurant she plans to open but his lack of money means he struggles to pay his rent, so he moves in with Janice. Leanne's restaurant burns down in April 2008. A few weeks later, Paul tells the police he and Leanne set the place on fire for insurance money. Janice is furious with Leanne for lying to her.

In September 2008, Janice and Leanne discover that one of the Lottery syndicate tickets for ''Underworld'' is a winner, to the tune of almost £25,000. Spotting an opportunity, Leanne persuades Janice that they should keep the money and claim the winnings by setting up a bogus bank account in [[Rosie Webster]]'s ([[Helen Flanagan]]) name. However, Rosie has vanished, worrying her parents and when they learn of the lottery win, the police stop looking for Rosie, believing that she has absconded with the cash. Unable to live with her guilty conscience, Janice eventually comes clean on 8 October 2008 and is arrested while at work in the factory. The factory girls also tell Roger about the scam and he leaves Janice, disgusted at her behaviour. Janice is left on the Street in tears as Roger drives away. Leanne sees her from her upstairs window and callously just shuts the blind. In November, Janice stands trial for the scam alone, having agreed to keep Leanne's name out of it and is sentenced to community service, much to the disgust of her colleagues. She starts her work placement at the canteen at Weatherfield General Hospital in December and is initially delighted to discover that her supervisor is [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]), whom she sees as a pushover. However, she is proven wrong as Emily is very strict. On 29 December, she goes for a cigarette outside the hospital and meets [[Mike (Coronation Street)|Mike Scott]] (Anthony Bessick). He tells her he is in for a chest infection, downgraded from pneumonia. She tells him about her community service, and they laugh over their shared misfortune. Janice then goes back to work, but that night her friends tell her that she has been beaming the whole time she has been out with them, which suggests that she still has Mike on her mind.

Mike reappears on 30 January 2009, when he and Janice chat. However, he keels over and collapses. Janice gets help for Mike but later discovers that he has died, following an operation one week before. Mike's wife, Laura, is grateful that Janice was with him when he died. After this, Janice decides that she wants to become a nurse, despite ridicule from her friends, but her new boss, [[Luke Strong (Coronation Street)|Luke Strong]] ([[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]]), sends her on a first-aid course in March 2009 and makes her the factory first-aider. Janice's skills come in useful when [[Joshua Peacock]] ([[Benjamin Beresford]]) collapses after swallowing a bee at the Street's summer fete. He is later rushed to hospital and recovers. Janice later tells Kelly that she does not want to be a nurse any more from the horror that Joshua could have died.

In January 2010, [[Trevor Dean]], a local dustman, provokes Janice by refusing to empty her rubbish bin. In protest, she jumps onto the side of his bin lorry and holds on as he drives down the street. Later, the pair become friends, and after telling Trevor she is looking for a lodger, he agrees to move in with her. Janice is very attracted to him but he starts dating her boss, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/2783613/Janice-Battersby-gains-a-hunky-toyboy.html | location=London | work=The Sun | title=Dust lust | date=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janice is disappointed when Trevor later leaves Weatherfield after breaking up with Carla.

On 6 December 2010, a tram crashes onto the cobbles, following an explosion at 'The Joinery' Bar. Janice puts her first aid training to use, helping the injured in the Rovers. She also witnesses stepdaughter Leanne's wedding to [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), which takes place in hospital as he was injured in the disaster.

In January 2011, Janice meets a man called Gaz at a singles night in the Rovers who invites her to go on holiday with him. However, she is too drunk to board the flight and returns later that evening. At this time, [[Chris Gray (Coronation Street)|Chris Gray]] ([[Will Thorp]]) has paid an associate to rob Janice's flat, hoping to cause trouble for Streetcars; he is disturbed by her entry and runs off but knocks Janice to the ground and is left shaken. In the weeks following the burglary, Janice becomes very nervous of living alone and eventually gives up her flat, moving in with workmate [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]). In March 2011, with ''Underworld'' struggling to remain afloat, Janice says the wrong thing once too often, when she tries to convince her co-workers to go on strike, and Carla sacks her. Janice is pleasantly surprised when she bumps into Trevor again. He tells her that he is only staying briefly as he is leaving to go on a world trip and suggests Janice go with him, a few days later. Now unemployed and with Leanne happily married to Peter, she agrees. After saying goodbye to Leanne, Janice's co-worker [[Izzy Armstrong]] ([[Cherylee Houston]]) spots her and tells the locals so they go outside to wave her off. Janice spots them coming out of the Rovers, so they drive into a puddle soaking all her friends and she shouts "Losers" as she drives off into the distance with Trevor.

In July 2011, Leanne received a phonecall from Janice to wish her happy birthday and tell her that she is currently working at a hotel in France. On this day, Leanne finds out that newcomer [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) is her birth mother but decides not to tell Janice because she has been more of a mother to her than Stella ever was.

In an episode on 22 January 2014, Janice was mentioned by Leanne the episode after [[Hayley Cropper]]'s ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) death. Leanne mentioned her when asking "Should I ring Janice, to tell her about Hayley?". She was also mentioned by [[Leanne Battersby]] that she had sprained her ankle by falling off a ladder.

==Creation==

===Background===
The mid 1990s were a time of big change behind-the-scenes at ''Coronation  Street''. The long-running serial was being regularly beaten in the ratings by rival soap ''[[EastEnders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corrie.net/kabin/archive/1997/1997_1.html|title=Street Life's Too Tough, Blasts Rita|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''|date=9 February 1997|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new producer, Brian Park, was brought in to revitalise the soap in 1997. Dubbed "the axeman",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/174529.stm|title=The axeman cometh for C5 family |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=18 September 1998|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park was responsible for culling 8 long-running and established characters, as well as giving the go-ahead for more controversial and sensationalist storylines, aimed at attracting a younger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980118/ai_n9702535 |title=Deirdre in the dock |publisher=''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' |date=18 January 1998 |accessdate=2008-08-27 |first=Lesley |last=Gardiner }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced various new characters, among them were the Battersby family. Dubbed the "family from hell", the Battersbys were Janice and her husband [[Les Battersby-Brown|Les]], living with him and his daughter [[Leanne Battersby|Leanne]] and a daughter of her own, [[Toyah Battersby|Toyah]], who was the result of a short-lived relationship Janice had with Ronnie Clegg when she was 16.  Although not above occasional law-breaking, Janice was nowhere near as anti-social as Les.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/23 |title=Coronation Street: The Advisor's Tale |publisher=''PFC'' |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906112226/http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/23 |archivedate= 6 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6705789.stm|title=Street's Les Battersby to leave |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/serial-killers-651081.html|title=Serial killers|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=13 May 2002|accessdate=2008-08-27|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Auditions were held for the part of Janice Battersby with actress [[Vicky Entwistle]] going on to secure the role. In 2005 after 8 years in the show the character of Janice was axed by producer Tony Wood along with characters [[Sunita Alahan]] and [[Jessie Jackson (Coronation Street)|Jessie Jackson]].  However a few weeks after the axing, a last-minute decision was made and the character was given a reprieve by the newly drafted producer Steve Frost.  Of this decision the soaps spokesperson said:  "The new producer has talked to Vicky Entwistle and asked if she would like to stay with the programme. Janice is a very popular character, but ultimately it was the producer's own decision to keep her on, prompted by the great new storylines the character can play out."&lt;ref name="axe"/&gt;

==Development==
Janice is a very larger than life character and is not afraid of confrontation with other people. ITV publicity describes the character along with her former husband as 'Weatherfield's answer to Wayne and Waynetta Slob' but did stress that her character has shown her softer side in certain storylines such as Toyah's rape and proved she actually does have morals when she tried to stop Leanne's prostititution.&lt;ref name="itv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/JaniceBattersby1.html |title=Coronation Street - Cast &amp; Characters - Janice Battersby |publisher=ITV.com |author=Webmaster |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421111917/http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/JaniceBattersby1.html |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her manager at Underworld from 2004 to 2006, [[Danny Baldwin]], had his own nickname for her: "Lippy" because of her loud mouth and answering back. An inside spokesperson for Coronation Street said of Janice's character in 2005 that: "She is well loved for being such a feisty character who can get quite nasty at times.".&lt;ref name="axe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/194/194337_streets_janice_avoids_the_axe.html|title=Street's Janice avoids the axe|publisher=Manchester Evening News|author=Claire Lane|date=30 December 2005|accessdate=2009-05-13}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
Janice's recognisable appearance and loud mouth tendencies led to her being spoofed on ITV TV show [[2DTV]].

Henry's attempts at locating his father lead him to Dr. Slavkin O'Hara ([[Michael Sheen]]), a university professor who has decided to raise his daughter, Audrey ([[Samantha Weinstein]]), as a psychology experiment in a world free of gender bias.

'''''Kid Notorious''''' is an American [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] that aired from October 22 to December 17, 2003 on [[Comedy Central]]. It starred [[Hollywood]] film producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] as himself. Episode plots were often bizarre and [[absurdism|absurdist]] in nature, featuring Evans as a [[James Bond]] type character. [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] also appeared on the show as himself. The show was directed by [[Pete Michels]].

==Characters==
* [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert "Kid Notorious" Evans (himself)]], a playboy Hollywood producer who finds himself mixed up in bizarre and absurd situations but never loses his cool.
* Tollie Mae ([[Niecy Nash]]), Evans's loud and obese maid. Spends most of her time binge eating chocolate and lusting after [[Denzel Washington]]. Her catchphrase is "Not in my job description." Tollie Mae was named for Tollie Mae Wilson, who was Evans's housekeeper at the time of his marriage to [[Ali MacGraw]].
* [[Alan Selka|Alan "English" Selka (himself)]], Evans's long suffering butler. A running gag involves Puss Puss farting into his face. Voiced by Evans's real life butler, Alan Selka, who is reportedly very much like his character in real life.
* Puss Puss, Evans's beloved cat, who follows him wherever he goes; she plays chess and smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Puss has a hate-hate relationship with English which has included pistol-whipping, neck crushing, releasing flatulence into face and placing piranha in the sauna.
* [[Slash (musician)|Saul "Slash" Hudson (himself)]], the former lead guitarist for [[Guns N' Roses]]. As in real life, Slash is Evans's close friend and next-door neighbor.
* [[Donald Rumsfeld]] ([[Billy West]]), the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] at the time. He is depicted as a sidekick and poker buddy of Evans and Slash.

[[File:Letters of Charles Lamb.jpg|thumb|170px|Title page to the 1837 Talfourd edition of Lamb's letters]]
The 19th-century English writer '''[[Charles Lamb]]'s letters''' were addressed to, among others, [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Godwin]], and [[Thomas Hood]], all of whom were close friends. They are valued for the light they throw on the English literary world in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and on the evolution of Lamb's essays, and still more for their own "charm, wit and quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t113.e4287 |title=Lamb, Charles |author=Dinah Birch (ed.) |work=The Oxford Companion to English Literature |publisher=Oxford Reference Online |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manuscripts ==

More than 1,150 of Lamb's letters survive, scattered among institutions and private collections in Britain and the United States. The largest collection, comprising about 200 letters, is in the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]]. There are very few existing letters addressed to Lamb apart from those sent by his friend [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]], since Lamb usually destroyed his old correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR92&amp;dq=%22IV+The+present+edition%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |pages=xcii–xciii }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Courtney |first1=Winifred P. |title=Young Charles Lamb 1775–1802 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMSyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22His+later+friend+Thomas+Manning%22&amp;dq=%22His+later+friend+Thomas+Manning%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1982 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=0333315340 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb wrote his letters in a "bold free hand and a fearless flourish" (his own words), which present no great difficulties to editors, though his spelling and punctuation were sometimes erratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas|title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcENAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Lamb's+pen-work%22&amp;dq=%22Lamb's+pen-work%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |page=viii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==

Lamb's main correspondents were the poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, [[Robert Southey]], Thomas Hood, [[Bernard Barton]], [[Mary Matilda Betham]] and [[Bryan Procter]]; the philosopher and novelist William Godwin; the music critic [[William Ayrton (music critic)|William Ayrton]]; the publishers [[Edward Moxon]], [[William Hone]], [[Charles Ollier]], [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] and J. A. Hessey; the statistician [[John Rickman]]; the actress Fanny Kelly; the political agitator [[Thomas Allsop]]; the [[Sinology|Sinologist]] Thomas Manning; the lawyer [[Henry Crabb Robinson]]; also John Bates Dibdin, member of a theatrical family, and Robert Lloyd from a literary Quaker family. The surviving letters extend over a period of nearly 40 years, beginning in May 1796 and ending only a few days before his death in December 1834. In the first sequence of 30 letters written to Coleridge he minutely criticises his friend's poems, advising him to abandon conventional poetic diction and "cultivate simplicity". The influence he exercised on his friend is seen as crucial in preparing Coleridge for the Romantic revolution that he and Wordsworth launched two years later in their ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Holmes (biographer) |title=Coleridge: Early Visions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2q7gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22crucial+in+the+maturing%22&amp;dq=%22crucial+in+the+maturing%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1990 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth |isbn=0140124403 |page=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKenna |first1=Wayne |title=Charles Lamb and the Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvFaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Cultivate+simplicity,+Coleridge%22&amp;dq=%22Cultivate+simplicity,+Coleridge%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1978 |origyear=1974 |publisher=Smythe |location=Gerrards Cross |isbn=0901072613 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pierce |first1=Frederick E. |title=Currents and Eddies in the English Romantic Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPdVIHbghfEC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Cultivate+simplicity,+Coleridge%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1918 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |pages=57–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the beginning the letters show Lamb's sense of duty to his family and friends, but after a few years, without abandoning his moral convictions, Lamb found a lighter means of expression. In an 1801 letter he wrote, "I have had a time of seriousness, and I have known the importance and reality of a religious belief. Latterly, I acknowledge, much of my seriousness has gone off…but I still retain at bottom a conviction of the truth, and a certainty of the usefulness of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas |title=Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dQvAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Why+it+should+have+so+moved+Thackeray%22&amp;q=%22time+of+seriousness%22 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birrell |title=Essays |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/62550/ |accessdate=21 April 2012 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later letters it is often possible to see Lamb forming and developing the ideas that he later presented in fully matured form in the ''[[Essays of Elia]]'' and other magazine pieces, and in this way they proved to be essential to his career as a published writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lordbyron.org/contents.php?doc=ChLamb.1905.Contents |title=Charles Lamb: Works of Charles and Mary Lamb.

The humour and (as he often said) "nonsense" of his letters is sometimes seen as a disguise for mental instability and deep anguish. The essayist [[Augustine Birrell]] wrote that "He took refuge in trivialities seriously, and played the fool in order to remain sane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birrell |title=Essays |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/62550/ |accessdate=21 April 2012 |pages=20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters have a great deal to say about Lamb's incessant reading, often among 17th century writers, and it has been argued that his love of [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], [[Thomas Browne]] and the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] tragedies may show an underlying depression and despair which answered to theirs. Lamb's words on Burton have frequently been taken as applying to himself: "Burton was a man often assailed by deepest melancholy, and at other times much given to laughing and jesting, as is the way with melancholy men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lordbyron.org/contents.php?doc=ChLamb.1905.Contents |title=Charles Lamb: Works of Charles and Mary Lamb.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] was so impressed by the beauty of Lamb's character as revealed in his letters that he once pressed one of them to his forehead and exclaimed "Saint Charles!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas |title=Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dQvAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Why+it+should+have+so+moved+Thackeray%22&amp;dq=%22Why+it+should+have+so+moved+Thackeray%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=21 April 2012|pages=533–534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the opinion of [[Thomas Noon Talfourd]], who knew Lamb well, that there was scarcely one of his letters "which has not some tinge of that quaint sweetness, some hint of that peculiar union of kindness and whim, which distinguishes him from all other poets and humorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Will D. |authorlink1=Will D.

== Publication history ==

As early as February 1835 a decision was made to prepare a collection of Lamb's letters. Thomas Noon Talfourd was chosen as the editor, and his ''Letters of Charles Lamb'' appeared in 1837. 180 of Lamb's letters appeared in this collection, according to Edwin Marrs's count, though Talfourd's contents page suggests a different number because of his (and several later editors') practice of separating and recombining passages to form, in effect, letters that never were. The number he could print was limited by the need to protect the feelings of Lamb's surviving friends, and still more those of his sister [[Mary Lamb|Mary]], whose periodic fits of insanity Lamb had many times explicitly referred to. With Mary's death the need for tactful suppression became less pressing, and a supplementary collection consisting of 82 entirely new letters, Talfourd's ''Final Memorials of Charles Lamb'', appeared in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR62 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxii–lxvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A projected third edition of the letters was to have been edited first by Talfourd and then by [[William Carew Hazlitt]], but both editors successively abandoned the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR67 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxvii–lxviii }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorship was then given to the journalist [[George Augustus Henry Sala]], who completed the first volume of a ''Complete Correspondence and Works of Charles Lamb''. This was printed in 1868, but no further volumes were ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcENAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=22 April 2012 |page=ix }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new ''Complete Correspondence and Works of Charles Lamb'', edited by the drama critic [[Thomas Purnell (critic)|Thomas Purnell]], containing 337 letters, appeared in 1870 in 4 volumes, the letters being also issued separately in one volume. Another drama critic, [[Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald|Percy Fitzgerald]], edited a ''Life, Letters and Writings of Charles Lamb'' in 1876 with 451 letters, and this, like all previous collections, was published by [[Edward Moxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR68 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxviii–lxx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Carew Hazlitt then returned to the task he had previously abandoned, and produced a ''Letters of Charles Lamb'' in 1886, based on Talfourd's two collections but with much revision and addition, so that the number of letters now totalled 488.  ''The Letters of Charles Lamb'' were edited only two years later by [[Alfred Ainger]] in 1888, and re-edited in 1900 and 1904; these collections numbered 414, 446 and 464 letters respectively, making them in point of size inferior to Hazlitt's edition, and further disfigured by a good deal of bowdlerisation. An edition by William Macdonald, containing 581 letters, appeared in 1903.  ''The Letters of Charles Lamb'', issued by the Bibliophile Society of Boston in 1905 with an introduction by Henry Howard Harper, increased the tally considerably to 746 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR71 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxxi–lxxxiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of E. V. Lucas's editions appeared as volumes 6 and 7 of his ''Works of Charles and Mary Lamb'' (1903–1905), and for the first time included Mary's correspondence on equal terms. It contained only 590 letters, but he highlighted one of the problems which had caused his and several previous editions to leave out easily findable material:&lt;blockquote&gt;Owing to the curious operations of the law of copyright, it will not for at least forty-two years be possible for any one edition of Lamb's correspondence to contain all the letters.  To-day, in order to possess a set complete down to the present time, one must purchase at least nine, and possibly more, works, amounting to many volumes―among them ''Charles Lamb and the Lloyds'', of which I was the editor, but which I am debarred from using.&lt;/blockquote&gt;His second edition was published in 1912 with 604 letters.  His third edition, ''The Letters of Charles Lamb, to which is Added Those of His Sister Mary Lamb'' (1935), included as many as 1,027 letters, Lucas's publishers having negotiated a solution to the copyright problems, so that he was able to claim that "The present edition of the letters of Charles Lamb is the first to bring all the known material into one work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR84 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxxxiv–lxxxviii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Lucas's harshest critics acknowledge that the 1935 edition's completeness made it the best available up to that point, but several papers in academic journals by George L. Barnett and other Lamb scholars have made it clear that the texts are unreliable. Barnett complained that Lucas appeared not to have read manuscript letters of whose location he was well aware, that on the contrary &lt;blockquote&gt;many, if not most, of the letters are based on previous and faulty editions, and that Lucas has failed to avoid the tendency of editors of Lamb's letters to perpetuate errors and to inaugurate others by overzealous emendation, excessive editing, and downright carelessness.&lt;/blockquote&gt; He elsewhere referred to "faulty dating, erroneous location of manuscripts, incorrect transcription of text, and misinformation in the notes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riehl |title=Dangerous |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9wcin_BkcMC&amp;pg=PA134 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=George L. |title=A Critical Analysis of the Lucas Edition of Lamb's Letters  |journal=Modern Language Quarterly |volume=9 |date=September 1948 |page=314 |doi=10.1215/00267929-9-3-303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=George L. |title=Corrections in the Text of Lamb's Letters |journal=Huntington Library Quarterly |volume=18 |date=February 1955 |page=147 |doi=10.2307/3816539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1975 to 1978 three volumes of a new edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's letters were published by Edwin W. Marrs, which included many new letters discovered during the previous 40 years. Lamb's life was covered up to 1817, and further volumes were intended to carry on up to his death in 1834, but to date none have appeared. The three published volumes have attracted great praise for their exceptionally full annotation and for the completeness and accuracy of the texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riehl |title=Dangerous |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9wcin_BkcMC&amp;pg=PA134 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18218">This is a listing of [[illuminated manuscript]]s produced between 900 and 1066 in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[monastery|monasteries]], or by Anglo-Saxon [[scribe]]s or [[Limner|illuminators]] working in continental scriptoria.  This list includes manuscripts in [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]].  For manuscripts produced before 900 see the [[List of Hiberno-Saxon illuminated manuscripts]].

The invasions during the reign of King [[Alfred the Great]] created a disruption in the manuscript production in [[England]].  When manuscript production resumed in the later portion of Alfred's reign, a break with the previous [[Insular art|Insular]] style of manuscript illumination occurred.  The new style, although drawing some elements from Insular manuscripts, also was influenced by [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]], [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]], and Mediterranean traditions.  The [[Norman Conquest]] produced another break in English manuscript production which ended the Anglo-Saxon tradition of manuscript illumination. For more information see [[Anglo-Saxon art]].
==Listing==
This listing includes every surviving manuscript with Anglo-Saxon miniatures, drawings, or other major decoration.  It also includes a representative sample of manuscripts with Anglo-Saxon pen-work initials.  The manuscripts are sorted by their current location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21545">A '''record chart''', also known as a '''music chart''', is a method of ranking [[music]] judging by the [[popularity]] during a given period of time. Examples of record charts are the [[Hit parade]], [[Hot 100]] or [[Top 40]]. Although primarily a marketing or supermarketing tool like any other [[sales]] statistic, they have become a form of popular media culture in their own right.

Record charts are compiled using a variety of criteria. These commonly include sales of [[Gramophone record|records]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[compact disc]]s; amount of [[radio]] airplay; requests to radio [[disk jockey]]s; voting for songs by the radio listeners and, recently, number of [[music download|download]]s.

Some charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week, with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts.  [[Component chart]]s have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

Reviewers often describe records using [[round number]] milestones within a chart. For example, a record that peaks at number 7 may be called a "Top 10" [[hit single|hit]], even when there is no chart limited to only the top 10 records in that particular location.

The '''''Madonna in Glory with Saints''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Pietro Perugino]], dating to c. 1500–1501. It is housed in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna|Pinacoteca Nazionale]] of [[Bologna]], [[Italy]].

It was originally located in the Scarani Chapel of the church of [[San Giovanni in Monte]].

==Description==
The scheme of the composition, typical of Perugino's mature works (based on the lost ''Assumption'' of the [[Sistine Chapel]] and used in numerous works of the period, such as the ''[[San Francesco al Prato Resurrection]]'' and the [[Vallombrosa Altarpiece]]), includes two different levels. The Madonna with Child, depicted within an almond in the upper part; and a group of four saints above a hilly landscape in the lower one. 

The saints are, from the left: the Archangel Michael (with a decorated armor), Catherine of Alexandria (with her traditional attributed of the torture wheel), Apollonia (with the [[pincer (tool)|pincer]] of her martyrdom) and John the Evangelist, who has the [[Tetramorph]] eagle).

Perugino's signature (''PETRUS PERUSINUS PINXIT'') can be seen on Catherine's wheel.

'''Mario Bernasconi''' ([[Pazzallo]], February 13, 1899 – Viganello, March 19, 1963) was a Swiss-Italian sculptor.

==Biography==
Mario Bernasconi was born in 1899 in Lugano-Pazzallo, in the home facing the Museum. He was the son of Luigi Bernasconi (electrician) and Caterina Dozio (seamstress). He grew up with his sister Maria (Nini), who was two years younger.

He was attracted to what he called "la mia montagna" (my mountain) - [[Monte San Salvatore|San Salvatore]]. On the mountain, he discovered clay and received his first inspirations. During his childhood, beside the school there was the country life. He brought home lizards, snakes, insects of every kind, which he studied and observed attentively.

===Work and study===
1914 - Once the obligatory schools terminated and having to learn a trade, Mario worked in a pharmacy in [[Lugano]]. In the evening he posed as a model in the studio of the sculptor Luigi Vassalli. Captured by the arts, Mario left the pharmacy and became a student of Luigi Vassalli (monument to Carlo Battaglini). He appears as the angel-like figure in the monument. In addition to posing and performing hard work, he learned the art of moulding,  design in relief, and the study of the human body. In carving marble and shaping clay he was more than ever convinced to become a sculptor.
1917 - Mario continued his studies by the painter and sculptor Giuseppe Foglia and started his own studio in Pazzallo, in the house that is now the Mario Bernasconi Museum. 
In his studies, Mario was deeply inspired by Michelangelo, Donatello, Rodin, Maillol and Lehmbruck.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, Salati, Caglio, Manzoni, 1981 p. 17-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works and scholarships===

Mario obtained the first Federal scholarship that was renewed for three consecutive years:

1921 - the mask La scema (the idiot) [[File:La scema-Mario Bernasconi contributed by owner Claudia-Esposito-Bernasconi.jpg|thumb|right|La Scema - early work]] 
 
1922 - the portraits of "Enea" and "Eva".

1923 - the bust "La giovane madre" [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Mario%20e%20giovane%20madre.jpg Mario with the young Mother]
[[File:Ritratto di Eva-Mario Bernasconi.jpg|thumb|right|Ritratto_di_Eva - early work]].
He made portraits of his friends, among them Angelo Tonello, the painters Filippo Boldini, Gualtiero Colombo, the writers Vinicio Salati Francesco Manzoni and Silvio Calloni the naturalist from Pazzallo.
He created the head of "Cristo" (Christ) that stands atop the steps of San Pietro Pambio Cemetery, at the center of the big stone cross.[[File:Cristo, Croce.jpg|thumb|Christ]]

1923 - His mother became ill and died. A period of inertia followed, but it's the portrait of his mother that brought back his creativity.

1925- At the National Exhibition of Fine Art at the Kunsthaus Zurich, the Federal Government acquired the statue "Il Curato di campagna" (The country Priest) and donated the bronze to the city of [[Lugano]][[File:Curato dettaglio.jpg|thumb|Detail of the country priest]]
The full plaster figure can be seen at the Museum in Pazzallo.
On June 13, 1926, in New York, on the Daily News of the workers of America, "The New World" in the center of the front page appears the reproduction of the sculpture "Il Martire" (The Martyr) by Mario Bernasconi. It was [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Matteotti%20Morente%201926%20001.jpg Giacomo Matteotti], which in New York on that day, the second year of his death was commemorated. Bernasconi later donated this sculpture to the Chamber of Labor in Lugano.

===Career, character, marriage and travel===

The artist demonstrates to be a free-thinker, a great lover of nature, mystic, philosopher, intuitive, poet, romantic. His family and friends considered him to be gentle and having a good character, a bit narcissistic, sentimental and emotional. Sometimes argumentative at times revolutionary and remembered for his motto "Lottare per non morire" (Fight not to die).

Of the encounter with friends, writes Francesco Manzoni in the volume "Mario Bernasconi Scultore" Editions Aurora, Lugano:

''"Then the political rounds would break loose and Mario wearing the Valiere tie, was singing Bandiera Rossa (Red Flag) and the hymn to the anarchists or he would play them on the mouth accordion, his face assuming a faun flavor whereby his authentic faith was affirmed without reservation: perhaps with great anger, that sometimes had the epic of [[Brecht]] and when cooled off, ended with the recitation of a scarlet "Ca ira."''&lt;ref&gt;Manzoni 1981 p. 29 "RIcordo di uno scultore".&lt;/ref&gt;

Matured by the strong impression of the Egyptian sculptures, Greek and Roman, the one of the Renaissance, the neo-Gothic of [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck|Lehmbruck]], the realism of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], Mario Bernasconi found his own style. 
For art studies, he gives preference to the cities of Siena and Florence (Firenze) and he continues his formation through contact with artists and intellectuals.
Works in central Switzerland, Zurich, Bern and Glarus.

1927 - Marks the beginning of a very moving and rich successful career. [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1914712M/Le_sculture_all'aperto_nella_città_di_Lugano Le sculture all'aperto nella citta di Lugano, pagina 115, Biografie] 
Through the family von Alvensleben of Porza, Mario meets [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/eirma.htm Irma Pannes], a descendant of a distinguished German family, who became his wife. The bride and groom depart for Germany. First stop Freiburg, Darmstadt and Wiesbaden. He meets with Werneralvo von Alvensleben in Berlin for the first
Porza Association exhibit that took place in Berlin on December 9, 1927. While waiting for a studio in Berlin he travels with his wife to Reichenbach in Slesia thereafter reaching the city of Prague, rich in works of art.

The period in Berlin turns out to be the most useful and prolific of his career, especially for the contacts that the friendly atmosphere permits him to establish and for the friendly relations with leading personalities of the artistic, scientific and literary world. With enthusiasm, he makes the portrait of the German writer [[Carl Zuckmayer]] while he made a drawing of the sculptor at work. He becomes friend with Erich Maria Remarque, who at that time worked on the famous novel "Im Westen nichts Neues". He meets La Jana(actress)Jana the famous dancer of the Thirties, makes the portrait of the actress [[Elisabeth Lennartz]] [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Elisabeth%20Lennarts.jpg Elisabeth Lennartz] takes part in the "Grosse Berliner Kunst Austellung 1928".
In [[Potsdam]] at the Gutmann estate/ 
Villa he spends a period of great prosperity with the family of the [[Friedrich Gutmann|Banker Gutmann]] (director of the Dresden Bank) where he creates the [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Banker%20Gutmann%20and%20wife%20Daisy.jpg portraits] of the banker, his wife [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Banker%20Gutmann%20and%20wife%20Daisy.jpg Daisy] and their [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Banker%20Gutmann%20children.jpg and two children] and a sculpture for their park estate.

The following trips take him to Krefeld the birth-city of his wife, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt on the Main, Munich in Bavaria, Breslavia and Paris where another "Porza" home was erected. In those cities, he created and left numerous artworks.

From his artistic standpoint what he wants to achieve is the static, a balanced and contained movement emanating silence.
Several works were created:
[http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/busto%20irma2.jpg "Il busto di Irma" (bust of Irma)] a Federal purchase that can be seen [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415005837/http://www.olten.ch/de/portrait/geschichte/?action=showinfo&amp;info_id=362 Martin Disteli] Museum of Olten.

Professor Emilio Motta al Liceo di Lugano. Professor [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/prof%20pizzorno2.jpg Angelo Pizzorno] Liceo di Lugano. Pastor Nicolas-Boldt, writer in Lugaggia; Professor [[Friedrich Gogarten|Gogarten]] of the University of Jena; [http://www.adhikara.com/cornelia-forster.html Cornelia Forster]; Emil Mauser, industrial from Zurich.

In 1933 he takes part in the Exposition SPSAS at the [[Kunsthaus Zurich]] and at the Staatliche Kunstaustellung Munich.
Many artists and friends from Berlin and Zurich come to visit his home in Sala Capriasca.
From the book "Mario Bernasconi Scultore" Editions Aurora Lugano, Vinicio Salati writes in "L'amico" (Friend):
''"From this couple of artists new forces are resumed."''
A young Russian artist wrote:
''"... for me and many of my friends, Sala is like a pilgrimage."''

The artist wanted to purchase the home but the owner would not sell it. Reluctantly they had to leave the beloved residence that was their paradise, and a favorite gathering place for many international artists. Mario would miss it forever. They find temporary residence in Montarina above Lugano, at the [http://retedue.rsi.ch/home/networks/retedue/classicaperle/2011/05/23/claudio-arrau.html Villa Beausite]

1936 - Rents a home in the center of Cureglia, remaining there for 25 years.
The home is of the 1500s. It belongs to the Fontana family and it had always been a home and gathering place for artists. The last tenant, before Bernasconi lived there, was the painter Ernesto Fontana, who lived in Milan, and occupied the home in Cureglia during the warm seasons. The building, filled with relief and stucco work, was always visited by artists who left signatures, writings and poems on the veranda walls.

===Awards and Prestigious Appointments===

Bernasconi finds a large studio in Lugano, along the Cassarate river, where companion artists work such as Boldini, Ribola, Moglia, {{ill|Nag Arnoldi|lt=Ardnoldi|it}} and others.

1942 - Federal acquisition of the portrait [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/francesco%20chiesa.jpg Francesco Chiesa portrait] at the Palazzo Comunale in Castagnola.

1943 - Mario Bernasconi presents four projects for the Madonna that will be placed in front of the [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Madonna_san-lorenzo_lugano.jpg San Lorenzo Cathedral in Lugano]. The competition is organized by Pro Helvetia. Over forty-six participating sculptors, Mario is the winner with the "Virgo Potens" project. He meets Amelia Anastasi Quadri, a pianist from Lugano, who was discovered and encouraged as a child, by Giacomo Puccini. She poses as a model for the statue of the Madonna.

1945 - Another Federal acquisition is the portrait of "Cornelia".

1946 - The great statue of the [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/Madonna%20di%20Sn%20Lorenzo%20.jpg Madonna di San Lorenzo] commissioned by Pro Helvetia and the city of Lugano, executed in fine Saltrio marble, also referred to as    [http://www.museomariobernasconi.com/madonna2.jpg Virgo Potens] is inaugurated and placed in the courtyard of the [[Cathedral of Saint Lawrence (Lugano)|San Lorenzo Cathedral]] overlooking the city of Lugano.
The speech is held by [[:it:Francesco Chiesa (scrittore)|Francesco Chiesa]]  Luigi Caglio of that artwork exalted in: "L'affermazione dei valori della vita" ''"The affirmation of life's values"''

''"Among the values of life that Mario Bernasconi was a firm believer, was a religiosity that without being subject to discipline, without making a profession of faith in certain dogmas, is indisputable. This spiritual position came to light in the statue of the Madonna that stands in front of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo. Of all the verses of the litany, the artist chose the one that most reflected his intentions. "Virgo Potens". The woman who has been shaken and trembled at the Annunciation, the Mother who generated the divine infant in the squalor of the Bethlehem stable, the one who will be torn from the atrocious sufferings inflicted on the Son, this statue symbolizes a vigorous vitality. Seeing her, one is induced to enter the word robur (fortress) in the Salve Regina, where Mary is pleaded as life dulcedo et spes nostra. "''&lt;ref&gt;Caglio 1981 p. 26 "Affermazioni dei valori della vita"&lt;/ref&gt;

His works have seen and endured many moves and travels in Switzerland and abroad.

Regarding the Water-carrier a very positive critique appeared, on March 9, 1956 by Prof. Charly Clerc, entitled: "Sculpteur tessinois" on the front page of the [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306665/Journal-de-Geneve%20Journal%20de%20Geneve Journal de Geneve], . Here translated from the French:

''"Mario Bernasconi is a fine and original artist who has worked hard. The projects in his studio stand to demonstrate not only a distinguished artist but a great artist"

''Soon in Paradiso the inauguration will take place of the young girl that draws water from the fountain, that is an ensemble of gentleness, grace and grandeur."''&lt;ref&gt;Clerc March 9, 1956 p 1 "Sculpteur tessinois"&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ACQUAIOLA the painter [https://www.mutualart.com/Artist/Manlio-Guberti-Helfrich/CE955133FCF9F7F4 Mario Guberti Helfricht] from Ravenna, on the invitation for the centenary celebration of Mario Bernasconi 1899-1999 by the city of Lugano responded expressing as follows (in the Italian language) :

The double funeral takes place on March 21, at the cemetery of San Pietro Pambio.
The Government officials of the "Dicastero della Cultura" were present with Aldo Patocchi, President of the "Societa' Ticinese delle Belle Arti".
Vinicio Salati and Cesco Manzoni, two faithful friends to the end, gave a farewell speech.

"The artwork and the personality of Mario Bernasconi, one of the
maximum sculptors of the period, have not yet been the object of deep
studies, which constitutes a serious gap for the comprehension of the
southern Swiss artistic reality of the first half of the 20th century."
quote by Elisabeth Voyame translated from the Italian on [http://www.salvioni.ch/tishop/welcome.asp?idarticolo=3567&amp;categoria=arte Arte in Ticino], categoria arte 2003, third
volume, page 330, article 112.

==Premise==
Set in [[Detroit, Michigan]] the series stars [[Martin Lawrence]] in the role of Martin Payne, a [[disc jockey]] with a girlfriend named Gina Waters ([[Tisha Campbell-Martin]]). Martin works for the fictional radio station WZUP and later for local [[Public-access television]] station Channel 51. A common theme of the series is Martin's selfish and free-spirited nature. Episodes often center on Martin's inappropriate behaviors and incessant smart mouth towards his friends, neighbors, and whoever else finds themselves in his presence. When all is said and done, however, Martin loves his family and friends—it just takes dire situations for him to show it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/03/news/review-television-a-macho-image-for-a-sensitive-soul.html|title=A Macho Image for a Sensitive Soul|website=The New York Times|date=November 3, 1992|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the series progressed, plotlines saw Martin eventually move on to become the host of the talk show ''Word on the Street'', which aired on the small Detroit public-access television station Channel 51. He retained this position until the series' final episode, in which he and Gina prepared to move to [[Los Angeles]], from where his show would be syndicated nationally. The move coincided fortuitously with Gina's promotion by her boss Mr. Whitaker to head up his company's new Los Angeles headquarters, after having shut down the Detroit office. Gina's best friend Pam, whom Whitaker let go two episodes earlier due to this consolidation and downsizing, went on to pursue a career in the music industry as an artists &amp; repertoire ([[A&amp;R]]), executive at Keep It Real Records. (This plotline is the subject of a backdoor pilot episode that was included in the ''Martin'' series for a planned sitcom on Fox starring Tichina Arnold to be called ''Goin' for Mine'' (Episode 129, "Goin' for Mine"). This sitcom never materialized, however.) And at series' end, Cole{{who|date=November 2016}} proposed to his even more dimwitted, but attractive and devoted girlfriend Shanise (portrayed by Maura McDade), and they made plans to move into their own place. The only actor to appear in every episode as the same character is [[Thomas Mikal Ford]] as Tommy.

In early episodes, Lawrence began with a [[monologue]] of him speaking directly to the camera and audience from the darkened radio studio.

In 1997, Tisha Campbell filed a lawsuit against her co-star Martin Lawrence and the show's producers for [[sexual harassment]] and [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[Physical abuse|physical assaults]], and she did not appear in most of the season five episodes. The explanation in most of the episodes Campbell did not appear in was that Gina was "out on business", though in the two-part episode "Going Overboard" it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/15/arts/tv-notes.html|title=TV Notes|website=The New York Times|date=January 15, 1997|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBO Studios eventually settled the case with Campbell so that the show's last season could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/martin-campbell-reconcile-1117342288/|title='Martin,' Campbell reconcile|date=March 21, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell did return to the Martin set to film the two-part series finale of the show under the condition that she would not share any scenes with or interact in any way with Martin Lawrence.  In the episode, Martin and Gina kept entering and exiting the sets at different times and the storyline was adjusted so that the characters were both part of it but never crossed paths.

== Characters ==

=== Main characters ===
* '''Martin Payne''' ([[Martin Lawrence]]) Martin, the [[title role|title character]], is a caring family man deep down, but on the outside a very macho, selfish smart alec. Martin carries himself in a typical [[urban culture|urban]] youth manner, with modern expressions and mannerisms. His girlfriend turned wife, Gina Waters, has sometimes tried to change him (much to his anger, seeing as he likes the way he acts), but this rarely worked. Martin is not much of a physical fighter despite trying to come off as such. He has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Gina's best friend Pam.
* '''Regina "Gina" Waters-Payne''' ([[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]]) (Seasons 1–4 (&lt;small&gt;main&lt;/small&gt;); 5 &lt;small&gt;recurring&lt;/small&gt;), Martin's professional, fun-loving, eternally romantic and forgiving girlfriend and later wife. She often acts as a peacemaker, admonishing others when they trade barbs and insults and breaking up fights. Gina works for a public-relations firm. She complements Martin's street savvy by serving as a voice of reason. She is Pam's best friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-07/entertainment/ca-16050_1_fox-series|title='Martin's' Wife Leaves Fox Series|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/martin-campbell-reconcile-1117342288/|title='Martin,' Campbell reconcile|date=March 21, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Thomas "Tommy" Strawn''' ([[Thomas Mikal Ford]]), one of Martin's best friends. Level-headed, intelligent, and charming, Tommy serves as another voice of reason, especially during Martin's schemes. He would often portray himself as a ladies' man and would flirt with Pam and other women on the show. He had a romantic relationship with Pam during the third and fourth seasons. His mysterious employment status was a running gag on the show. Of all the male characters, he is the only one to have attended college. He is the only character to appear physically in every episode.
* '''Cole Brown''' ([[Carl Anthony Payne II]]), Martin's other best friend. Dimwitted but well-meaning and known for his eclectic taste in headgear, Cole proudly cleans jets at the airport for a living, drives an [[AMC Pacer]], and lives with his mother Maddie until early Season Five. For a time in Season 3, Cole appeared to be attracted strictly to plus-sized women and dated a security guard named Big Shirley (who is fully seen in only one episode; another episode only showed "her" below the neck to portray her as being much taller and bigger than Cole). In the final season, after Cole meets Shanise and moves into his own apartment in a rough neighborhood, he dates Shanise, who appears to be even more dimwitted than he is. During the series finale, he becomes engaged to Shanise.
* '''Pamela "Pam" James''' ([[Tichina Arnold]]), Gina's sassy and ill-tempered co-worker, best friend and Tommy's girlfriend. Before eventually dating Tommy, Pam was always looking for a good man. Pam worked at the PR firm where she was employed as Gina's assistant. Pam has a very adversarial relationship with Martin. When he insults her, she responds typically via belittling that brings attention to Martin's short stature. Pam has a beautiful singing voice that she displays throughout the show.

=== Supporting characters ===
* '''Bruh-Man (Brother Man)''' ([[Reginald Ballard]]) &lt;small&gt;(1993–1997)&lt;/small&gt;: Martin's neighbor, who debuts in season two. He lives on the fifth "flo" (yet he always puts 4 fingers up when relating this fact), directly upstairs from Martin. Whenever Martin asks what he is doing, Bruh-Man replies, "Nuttin'…just chillin'." He often climbs down the "f-a-a-a-ah 'scape" (fire escape), to enter Martin's apartment, taking food, borrowing assorted items, and generally lounging around as if he lives there. At first, this greatly annoyed Martin but he eventually got used to it. In fact, fire escapes seem to be his only means of movement throughout buildings—he is seldom seen entering or exiting the apartment through the front door. When he attended Martin and Gina's engagement party at Gina's apartment, he went as far as climbing the building since there was no fire escape. Bruh-Man always wears badly fitting clothing a size or two too small (frequently, items he's "borrowed" from Martin), and has a characteristic gait consisting of a slow and lazy, rather limping, plodding walk, with his head cocked to one side. Martin, as Bruh-Man was heading toward the window to make his exit, once referred to it as his "slow bop". Bruh-Man speaks in a deep voice and with a long drawl, like that of [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. Despite being a popular character, Bruh-Man was quietly phased out of the series after season three. His last appearances were in the fourth season, and he explains his absence by stating that he only comes around when Martin and Gina are away out of respect for their marriage. This is proven true as he is absent throughout the fifth and final season of the series, however he is mentioned once albeit briefly. In episode 13, "Ain't That About a Ditch", when Gina's mother locks Martin out of his apartment, he pauses to think, then whispers "Bruh-Man" to himself as he walks off to climb in through the fire escape, then Martin shows up in his apartment.
* '''Hustle Man''' ([[Tracy Morgan]]) &lt;small&gt;(1994–1996)&lt;/small&gt;: The neighborhood purveyor of questionable products and services "at a discount rate! I don't do dat for erra'body! I'm just tryna help ''YOU'' out!" He always greets Martin with his trademark "What's happenin', chief?" In one episode, one of Hustle Man's more outrageous items for sale was an 'appetizing' array of roasted pigeons impaled on a tree branch (as if barbecued on it), which he attempted to sell to Martin and his friends while they were snowed in and starving. In another episode he served as Martin's cut-rate "wedding planner", armed with a shopping cart brimming with plastic flowers, chitlin loaf, and a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor—Martin's retaliation for Gina's choice of a more elegant and ridiculously overpriced wedding planner.
* '''Stan Winters''' ([[Garrett Morris]]) &lt;small&gt;(1992–1994; 1995; 1997; guest role)&lt;/small&gt;, Martin and Shawn's boss, the owner and founder of radio station WZUP. He perpetually used too much cologne and wore woefully outdated clothing from the 1970s. Martin knew Stan to be cheap and quite untrustworthy, and just when Martin didn't think Stan could sink any lower with his schemes, Stan was always able to surprise him. Furthermore, Garrett Morris' real-life shooting resulted in his unexpected absence in the episode and a major change in the storyline, regarding Martin's career. Therefore, Stan was absent in the episode "The Hoedown in Motown" when he gets into trouble with the IRS due to a debt of $20,000 in unpaid taxes, precipitating his sale of the radio station, but returned in the season 2 finale "Martin's on the Move" where Stan recovers from the hospital and reunites with Martin for one last goodbye until he left town and subsequent flight to parts unknown. He returned for one episode in Season 3 to form a partnership with Martin, and together they opened a restaurant—Marty Mart's Meatloaf and Waffles. Needless to say, their joint venture was a failure. After this episode, Stan was never seen or mentioned again, however he returns as a guest appearance in the two-part series finale episode [[California, Here We Come]] where Martin reunited with him as he and the gang gave Martin a farewell roast at Nipsey's.
* '''Shawn McDermott''' ([[Jon Gries|Jonathan Gries]]) &lt;small&gt;(1992–1994; 1997; guest role)&lt;/small&gt;, the white, scatterbrained radio station engineer at WZUP. Martin always finds himself having rather strange conversations with him. Shawn often does things that upset their boss Stan, and once even tried to secure a record deal from [[Snoop Dogg]] when he was at an engagement party for Martin &amp; Gina. Shawn was later fired, along with Martin, when Stan sold the radio station. It is revealed in a later episode that Shawn was retained by the new station as an engineer. Shawn's final appearance on the show was in the Season 2 season finale episode where he says farewell to Martin. That particular episode showed a more serious side of Shawn as he gives Martin some advice on life that actually made sense. After this episode, Shawn is never seen or mentioned again, with the exception of the Season 4 clip show "The Best of Martin" in which he appears via archive footage, however he returns for one final guest appearance in the two-part series finale [[California, Here We Come]] where Martin reunites with him and the gang as he prepared Martin for a final roast at Nipsey's.
* '''Ms. Geri''' (Jeri Gray): She was a tough, trigger-happy senior who, regardless of her age and diminutive size, has no qualms about "whoopin' ass". Most of her assaults are committed on Martin in everyday situations, such as standing in line at the DMV or at the unemployment office. On one occasion, her opponent was Dragonfly Jones (Lawrence), whom she soundly defeated as well, taking his money for good measure.
* '''Shanise McGullicuddy''' (Maura McDade) &lt;small&gt;(1996–1997)&lt;/small&gt; is Cole's girlfriend (and later fiancée), during the fifth and final season. Shanise is a very friendly woman. She always has a positive attitude. However, she is even more dimwitted than Cole. She and Cole briefly break up in one episode but this occurs because when she told Cole she needed more space, he assumed she meant she wanted to break up but she actually wanted a bigger apartment. She is also thoughtful and willing to help others. In the episode ''Over the Hoochie's Nest'', she assists Martin, Tommy and Cole in rescuing Pam from an insane asylum. In the [[California, Here We Come|series finale]], Cole wanted to ask Shanise to marry him. He had a hard time asking her due to him losing the ring. Shanise was even taken to get X-rayed in order for Cole to find the ring after he stuck it in cupcake. Finally, they become engaged when she is tricked into reading a letter that says "Will you marry me?" and Cole says yes to her. At the end of the episode, she is last seen helping the Paynes move out of their apartment as well as saying farewell to them. The character started minor but developed a grounded position in the group after [[Tisha Campbell]] briefly left the show.
* '''Nipsey''' (Sean Lampkin): The rotund, good-natured bartender who owns Nipsey's Lounge, the group's favorite hangout.
* '''Varnell Hill''' (Tommy Davidson): The more successful talk show host and frenemy of Martin's that is constantly showing off and throwing his flashy lifestyle in Martin's face. Varnell is known to be a ladies man and gets worldwide recognition to Martin's dismay. He appears on the radio show that Martin hosts at WZUP.

* '''Nadine Waters''' ([[Judyann Elder]]): Gina's doting and somewhat over-protective mother, who comes on as sophisticated, sweet and mild-mannered on the surface, but has shown a dark side on occasion—such as once getting immediately turned on by a brief scene from a porn video, and generally becoming quite flustered whenever conversation or situations turned to sexual subjects.
* '''Dr. Cliff Waters''' ([[J.A. Preston]]): Gina's overbearing and overprotective father who works as a chiropractor. Instantly disliked Martin because he didn't feel he was good enough for his daughter. During the wedding rehearsal dinner, he threatens to start "capping" people, instantly inciting a major fight with members of the Payne family.
* '''Lil' Dawg''' (Adrian Tibbs): A tall, lanky barber at Jim's Barber Shop whose unorthodox personal style is the subject of much ribbing in the workplace—he keeps his head nearly shaved, but grows a long mane of hair in back, and wears Coke-bottle-thick glasses. He is often seen at Nipsey's trolling for women (successfully!), and despite his looks and demeanor always seems to come out on top whenever he and Martin have a disagreement.
* '''Buckwhite''' (Ray Massara): A very easygoing, tall white boy with a huge dark-coloured Afro, Buckwhite has been seen hanging out at Jim's Barber Shop, at Martin's apartment for various sporting events on TV, and at Nipsey's Lounge. He speaks Ebonics in an unaffected "normal" white manner. (Massara is actually a property master and special-effects assistant in the film and television industry; at the time of his appearances on ''Martin'', he was that production's property master.)
* '''Bro Fo' Real (Brother For Real)''' ([[Charlie Murphy]]): A faithful audience member of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program, and quite possibly Martin's number one fan. Bro Fo' Real attends every of Martin's taping for his show and encouraged Martin to be himself during one of the show's taping ([[List of Martin episodes#Season 3: 1994–1995|Season 3, Episode 14]]).
* '''Angry Man''' (David Jean Thomas): A fellow audience member of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program, and often can be found in other locations such as the DMV. He is prone to stand up and shout "''Man.... SIT-CHO ASS DOWN!!''" when a guest (or anyone else, for that matter) says something he disagrees with.
* '''Mr. and Mrs. Booker''' ([[Jeris Lee Poindexter]] and [[Ellia English]]): A married couple and audience members of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program. The Bookers are constantly arguing. Mr. Booker appears to be somewhat goofy and dimwitted, while Mrs. Booker is loud and aggressive. Their most prominent appearance is in the Season 4 episode "Kicked to the Curb", where they assist Martin and Gina in getting their apartment back, by scaring off the new tenants after Mrs. Booker pretends to be a scorned wife looking to fight the woman who was "creeping with her husband".
* '''Maddie Brown''' (Laura Hayes): Cole's gossiping, no-nonsense mother who still supports him. She's known for talking about other people and spreading their business around. For example, Martin being broke and having Gina support him.
* '''Evelyn Porter''' ([[LaWanda Page]]): A senior resident who lives in Martin's apartment building who is also friends with Mama Payne and Cole's mother, Maddie.
* '''The Reverend Leon Lonnie Love''' ([[David Alan Grier]]): A local fire-and-brimstone preacher whose brand of religion doesn't seem to frown upon avarice, lying, cheating, stealing, and philandering—even with his own cousin Pam.
* '''Marian''' (Roxanne Reese): A seemingly well-heeled, middle-aged neighborhood alcoholic who often appears at parties, nightclubs, and gatherings, such as the audience on Martin's show ''Word on the Street'' and The Ladies League of Detroit. However, in one episode, she reveals that she is not drunk, that she is instead on medication.
* '''Kenji''' (Kenneth Whack): Dragonfly's student. 
* '''Laquita''' ([[Simbi Khali]]): The nail stylist at Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon and Sheneneh's even-more vocal best friend.
* '''Keylolo''' ([[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]): A hairstylist at Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon. She is also Sheneneh's sidekick.
* '''Bonquisha''' ([[Kim Coles]]): Another one of Sheneneh's friends who always has bad breath. Bonquisha routinely claims that Keylolo is the one that has bad breath stating that was "eatin chitlins".
* '''Sonny''' ([[Reno Wilson]]): Martin's shoplifting cousin who dresses and acts like [[Eddie Murphy]].
* '''Luis''' ([[Luis Antonio Ramos]]): The superintendent of the apartment building where Martin lives. In one episode, he marries Pam to avoid deportation.
* '''Titus''' ([[Bentley Kyle Evans]]): A handsome well-dressed guy who is Gina's hairdresser, and seems to be attracted to Martin—affectionately calling him "Almond". (Evans was the executive producer of ''Martin''; he made several cameo and voice-only appearances throughout the series, including one of the callers on WZUP, a guest at one of Gina's parties, and the only guy who appeared at an all-male fashion show that Pam and Tommy sponsored.)
* '''Myra''' (BeBe Drake-Massey): Stan's girlfriend; they once double-dated with Martin and Gina (while Martin was on the outs with Cole, Pam and Tommy). She was a customer of Sheneneh's hair salon, and went bald after Gina treated her hair. While working for the unemployment office, she got several jobs for Martin – then nearly gave up on him since he kept quitting each job he received.
* '''Gloria Rodriguez''' (Angelina Estrada): Station director and Martin's supervisor at television station Channel 51.
* '''Bernice''' (Kymberly Newberry): A producer at Channel 51 who is always at odds with Martin. (Kymberly Newberry also briefly played an entirely different part of a shoe-saleswoman in episode 8 of season 2 "You've Got a Friend".)

=== Other roles played by Lawrence ===
One of the trademark running gags of ''Martin'', especially early in its run, was Lawrence playing multiple characters, utilizing various costumes and prosthetic appliances. This was often done as a plot device or comic relief. Season four was the last season to feature Lawrence as multiple characters on a regular basis. This technique was rarely used in Season 5, which was the final season of the series. The only characters that appeared in Season 5 were Sheneneh, Roscoe and Elroy. Mama Payne does not appear but her voice is heard in the holiday episode "Scrooge". Most of the other characters were last seen in Season 4 and the episodes they last appeared in seemingly wrote them out of the series.
* '''Sheneneh Jenkins''': Played by Martin, she is an exaggerated parody of a stereotypical "ghetto girl": she always has on flashy clothes/fashion accessories and [[Artificial hair integrations|hair weaves]]; nature has endowed her with a disproportionately oversized [[steatopygia|ghetto booty]]; and she speaks in [[African American Vernacular English]]. Sheneneh is the owner/operator of ''Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon''. Mama Payne and Sheneneh were the only two characters Lawrence played as women on the show, and both characters hated Gina. Full of quirks, Sheneneh is tall and thick in build and often describes herself as a "''la-a-a-dy''{{-"}}. Some of her other locutions are "''Oh mah goodnehhh!''{{-"}} and "''Aw-iight?''{{-"}} at every other word, and "Oh, no you didn't." Sheneneh's portrayed as being a very feisty, belligerent, touchy antagonistic, confrontational and disparaging diva, known for her ghetto fabulous scoldings. She lives in the apartment across the hallway from Martin's and factors into many of the plots by picking fights with Gina and especially Pam out in the hallway. Sheneneh has several girlfriends who occasionally appeared in the program, those being Keylolo ([[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]), Bonquisha ([[Kim Coles]]), and Laquita ([[Simbi Khali]]). Of all the secondary characters played by Lawrence, Sheneneh is the only one to make an appearance in the final episode, though only her voice was heard. The [[nae nae]] dance, created in 2013, was inspired by the way Sheneneh danced in ''Martin'', and was named after the character.
* '''Edna (Mama) Payne''': Martin's extremely frenetic, and easily excited mother, who is extremely over-protective of Martin, and who dislikes Gina immensely. Comically, Lawrence's mustache was never covered with stage make-up while in this role. Mama's mustache was occasionally the subject of a sharp retort by Gina when she and Martin argued. She has a brother named Junior (portrayed by [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]). Mama does not appear in the fifth and final season, but her voice is heard in the Christmas episode "Scrooge". She has the same catchphrase as her son Martin, ''"Damn! Damn! Daaaaamn!"''
* '''Ol' Otis''': A very abrasive, strict, stuttering and potbellied old man, who is always seen in uniform while on his job as a security guard. His catchphrase is repeatedly referring to males as "bwah" [boy] and females as "guh" [girl]. Otis is usually seen melodramatically and hyperactively attempting to keep order whether there's trouble or not. Because of his immense gut, advanced age, and oafish appearance, Otis is often taken for a weak old man who just ''acts'' tough. Because of this, he's often challenged to physical fights following his abrasive behavior. Otis is always more than willing to oblige others in engaging in combat. Surprisingly through his buffoonish-styled wrestling, unexpected strength from Otis always catches his "antagonists" off guard, invariably making him the victor in the end. Otis's pet peeve is misconduct in the "younger generations". When all is said and done, he physically defeats all his much younger challengers with ease. In his final episode on the show, he moves to an undisclosed island. Otis does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Jerome''': A loudmouthed, aging, somehow well-funded, once-flashy but now-faded Detroit pimp. He runs an illicit casino, sports a family-heirloom gold tooth ("gold toof-es") in his mouth, was once voted Detroit's "Player of the Year", and has his sights set on Pam, as when he occasionally calls her "Junk in the Trunk". He often speaks in rhyming sentences. Usually Jerome appears on the scene with his signature spiel, "Oooh, oooh, oo-oo-ooh, I say Jerome's in the house, I say Jerome's in the ah-um-ah-um...watch yo' mouth!" Jerome's final appearance on the show is in the episode "Uptown Friday Night" (which parodies ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]''), in which his final line is "And that's the eeeend!" Jerome does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Roscoe''': An antagonistic child with a perpetually runny nose and a very smart mouth, who can be considered Gina's arch-enemy (similar to Martin and Pam's rivalry). Lawrence played the role by standing on his knees, with shoes attached to his kneecaps. Roscoe only appears once during the first, fifth and final season.
* '''Dragonfly Jones''': A martial arts "expert" who is beaten up in nearly every appearance. He always seems to owe money to a real martial artist named Kenji, who is actually a student of Dragonfly. Kenji who would often beat up Dragonfly whenever he refuses to pay him some small sum he is owed. Dragonfly does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Bob''': A white man who works in an unknown capacity at the marketing firm where Gina is employed, Bob is best described as a stereotypical surfer-dude-cum-redneck. He speaks in a Southern Californian accent mixed with a Southern twang, and often uses words like "dude" and "man", even in professional settings. Lawrence achieved a white appearance with stage make-up and a prosthetic nose appliance to make him appear Caucasian, as well as wearing a long, blond [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] wig to complete the look. Bob only appears in 2 episodes, once in the first season and again in the second season.
* '''Elroy Preston''': The fictional "Godfather of Black Surf Music" who is now completely forgotten and washed up. Preston works as an auto mechanic, and is best known for randomly breaking into song while performing his mechanical duties. He often distracts himself and irritates others when reminiscing on things that involve his trademark song, which consists only of Preston singing "Don't you know no good!" over and over. He makes one appearance in the fifth and final season.
* '''King Beef''': Cole's favorite 1970s [[blaxploitation]] movie actor, who is actually Lawrence in a huge bodysuit. Whenever trouble arises, he feels the overwhelming need to dance. It does not matter if he is on the run from Godzilla—he always finds time for dancing, and always with his scantily clad female co-stars flanking him. He is only seen during the first season.

== Possible revival ==
In January 2018, rumors have circulated that the popular series was possibly slated for a reboot due to a post that Martin Lawrence's fiance teased on Instagram, which made viral headlines to a popular blog [[The Shade Room]]. She posted a picture of the Martin TV show [[Intertitle|title card]] logo with the caption: ''"Got word from my fiance that my favorite TV show may be coming back"'' ending the comment with the peeking wide eyes emoji and Martin replied to the post with the same emoji, which can insinuate a common nod towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeZE8mFFmZ7/|title=Instagram post by The Shade Room • Jan 26, 2018 at 12:02am UTC|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HipHollywood'', another internet entertainment media blog, questioned Tisha Campbell-Martin on the rumor during an interview, in which she gave a ecstatic response that she can't speak upon it stating ''"It has been an honor to be Gina all these years and its surprising that people still love those characters so much. So, i can't tell you guys anything, but it is very excitng"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=HipHollywood|title=Exclusive: Tisha Campbell-Martin Confirms 'Martin' Reboot!|date=2018-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwilqeYaftw|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding insult to injury, a few days later during an [[E! News]] Daily Pop interview, she was caught off guard by the host who asked her about it, and instead of answering it, she jokingly denied it and brushed it off by changing the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=E! News|title=Tisha Campbell-Martin Teases "Martin" Reboot {{!}} Daily Pop {{!}} E! News|date=2018-01-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlrw66eh-BY|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her responses caused an immediate interest from all media outlets to believing that she confirmed a possible reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dish Nation|title='MARTIN' REBOOT MAY BE IN THE WORKS|date=2018-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqoTjVPp91E|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early February, [[TMZ on TV|TMZ]] caught up with Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell-Martin and Martin Lawrence altogether leaving Morton's Steakhouse in Burbank, California, all smiles and anticipating the same question. Martin replied by saying ''"Never Say Never"'', Tichina added by stating ''"In life there's always new beginnings, and there's always change...so we'll see what's happening".'' Tisha ended it bluntly and jokingly by blurting out  ''"We can't tell y'all shit, how 'bout that"'', The interview continues to go more in depth about questioning the shows popularity from the past and how a reboot can be made up to date with current events and hold its' popularity if it's greenlighted. Tichina and Tisha's responses kind of hinted and gave it away that it may happen, but realizes the questions already pushed them to reveal their answer, in which Tisha ends it with the same blunt quote she stated earlier in the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/02/01/martin-cast-reunites-steaks-talks-reboot-never-say-never/|title='Martin' Cast Reunites, Plays it Coy About TV Reboot|work=TMZ|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview is also the first time Tisha and Martin is seen publicly together since their past cast debacle, which was part of the reason for the show's cancellation in 1997.

'''''Moments of Being''''' is a collection of posthumously-published autobiographical essays by [[Virginia Woolf]].  The collection was first found in the papers of her husband, used by [[Quentin Bell]] in his biography of Virginia Woolf, published in 1972.  In 1976, the essays were edited for publication by Jeanne Schulkind.  The second edition was published in 1985.  The original texts are now housed at [[Sussex University]] and in the [[British Library]] in [[London]].

==Title==
The title for the collection was chosen by its original editor, Jeanne Schulkind, based on a passage from "A Sketch of the Past". As described by Woolf, 'moments of being' are moments in which an individual experiences a sense of reality, in contrast to the states of 'non-being' that dominate most of an individual's conscious life, in which they are separated from reality by a protective covering. Moments of being could be a result of instances of shock, discovery, or revelation.

==Contents==
''Moments of Being'' consists of five autobiographical essays:
#"Reminiscences" (1907)
#"[[A Sketch of the Past]]" (1939-40)
#"22 Hyde Park Gate" (1920–1)
#"Old Bloomsbury" (1921–2)
#"Am I a Snob?" (1936)

"22 Hyde Park Gate", "Old Bloomsbury" and "Am I a Snob?" were written for the Memoir Club, a group formed in 1920 by [[Molly MacCarthy]] which met to present honest autobiographical papers.

'''Persian dance''' or '''Iranian dance''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:رقص ایرانی) refers to the dance styles indigenous to [[Iran]]. Genres of dance in Iran vary depending on the area, culture, and language of the local people, and can range from sophisticated reconstructions of refined court dances to energetic folk dances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.laurelvictoriagray.com/persian-dance.html|title = A Brief Introduction to Persian Dance|date = 2007|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = Laurel Victoria Gray, Central Asian, Persian, Turkic, Arabian and Silk Road Dance Culture|publisher = |last = Gray|first = Laurel Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Iran includes many [[Ethnic minorities in Iran|ethnicities]], such as [[Kurds]], [[Azeri-Iranian|Azerbaijanis]], [[Iranian Turkmen|Turkmen]], [[Persian Jews|Jews]], [[Iranian Armenians|Armenian]], [[Iranian Georgians|Georgian]] peoples, in addition to numerous Iranian tribal groups which can be found within the borders of modern-day Iran.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each group, region, and historical epoch has specific dance styles associated with it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Raghs (also spelled as Raqs) is the Arabic word for dance, and is almost exclusively the word used for dance in [[Persian language|Persian]], as the Persian word for dance, paykubi, is no longer in common usage. It's also the word in Azerbaijani for dance (''Reqs''). The [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] word for dance is Halperke, and the Lurs from [[Lorestan]] use the word Bākhten (or Bāzee) for dance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
People of Iranian plateau have known dance in forms of music, play, drama or religious rituals and have used instruments like mask, costumes of animals or plants, and musical instruments for rhythm, at least since 6th millennium BC. Cultural mixed forms of dance, play and drama have served rituals like celebration, mourning and worship. And the actors have been masters of music, dance, physical acts and manners of expression. Artifacts with pictures of dancers, players or actors were found in many of archaeological prehistoric sites in Iran, like Tepe Sabz, Ja'far Abad, Chogha Mish, Tall-e Jari, Cheshmeh Ali, Ismaeel Abad, Tal-e bakun, Tepe Sialk, Tepe Musian, tepe Yahya, Shahdad, Tepe Gian, Kul Farah, Susa, Kok Tepe, Cemeteries of Luristan, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfadram.ut.ac.ir/article_24776.html|title = Dance, Play, Drama; a Survey of Dramatic Actions in Pre-Islamic Artifacts of Iran|date = 2012|publisher = Tehran: University of Tehran, Honarhay-e Ziba Journal|last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest researched dance from historic Iran is a dance worshiping [[Cult of Mithras|Mithra]] (as in the Cult of Mithras) in which a bull was sacrificed. This cult later became highly adhered in the [[Roman Empire]]. This dance was to promote vigor in life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian from [[Herodotus]] of Halikarnassos, in his work ''Book IX (Calliope)'', in which he describes the history of Asian empires and Persian wars until 478 BC.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artira.com/nimakiann/history/preislamic.html|title = Persian Dance And It's Forgotten History|date = 2000|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = Nima Kiann|publisher = Les Ballets Persans|last = Kiann|first = Nima}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Persia was occupied by foreign powers, first [[Greeks]], then [[Arabs]], and then [[Mongols]] and in turn political instability and civil wars occurred. Throughout these changes a slow disappearance of heritage dance traditions occurred.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the fall of Persian Empire, when the country was torn into pieces, Iranian women and young girls were enslaved by the new conquerors, often forced into sexual slavery and required to perform erotic dances for the new rulers. Religious prohibition of dancing in Iran came with the spread of Islam, but it was spurred by historical events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Religious prohibition to dancing waxed and waned over the years, but after the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979 dancing was no longer allowed due to its frequent mixing of the sexes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Islamic Revolution of 1979, was the end of a successful era for dancing and the art of ballet in Iran.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iranchamber.com/cinema/articles/persian_dance_history03.php|title = Persian Dance History|date = 2002|accessdate = Aug 26, 2015|website = Iran Chamber Society|publisher = |last = Kiann|first = Nima}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian national ballet company was dissolved and its members emigrated to different countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to the principles of the “cultural revolution” in Iran, dancing was considered to be perverse, a great sin, immoral and corrupting.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As a result, many of the talented Persian dancers moved to the West and spread out mainly in Europe and the United States and new generation of Iranian dancers and ballet artists have grown up in the Diaspora.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Genres of dance ==
Iran possesses four categories of dance and these genres are; chain or line dances, solo improvisational dance, war or combat dances and ritual or spiritual dances.

'''Chain or Line dances''' are often named for the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Solo dance''' includes usually reconstructions of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Court Dance. These often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms, such as wrist circles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''War or Combat dances''' imitate combat, or help train the warrior. It could be argued that men from the [[Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals|zurkhaneh]] (a traditional Persian style gymnasium) called the “House of Strength” and their ritualized, wrestling-training movements are known as a type of dance called Raghs-e-Pa but could also been seen as a [[Martial arts|martial art]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasehpour.com/tonbak/persian-dance.html|title = A Brief About Persian Dance|date = |accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = Official Website of Dr. Peyman Nasehpour|publisher = |last = Nasehpour|first = Peyman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ritual or spiritual dances''', are often [[Sufism|Sufi]] are known as sama and also a type of zikr (religious chant).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are various types of dancing in a trance for healing practices in Iran and surrounding areas. One healing ritual that involves trance, music, and movement is called le’b guati of the Baluchis of Eastern Iran, which is performed to rid a possessed person of the possessing spirit and appears to be in a similar state as an exorcism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thebestofhabibi.com/volume-18-no-2-september-2000/spirituality-in-iran/|title = Spirituality in Iranian Music and Dance, Conversations with Morteza Varzi|date = 2002|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = The Best of Habibi, A Journal for Lovers of Middle Eastern Dance and Arts|publisher = Shareen El Safy|last = Friend PhD|first = Robyn C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a term in Balochi "gowati" for psychologically ill patients (possessed by wind) who have recovered through music healing, music as medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://everything2.com/title/Bandari|title = Bandari|date = May 2, 2003|accessdate = July 14, 2014|website = everything2|publisher = |last = oakling|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern coastal regions of Iran such as [[Qeshm Island]] have a similar possession by wind ceremony and it is thought that it may be influenced or originated in Africa, particularly the [[Abyssinian Empire|Abyssinian]] or [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian]] region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The word sama'','' from the Arabic root meaning “to listen,” refers to the spiritual practice of listening to music and achieving unity with the Divine, it is spelled sema in Turkish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dancing mystics (regardless of their specific religious identifications) are called [[Dervish]].

Contemporary social dances and urban dance performed at festive occasions like weddings and [[Noruz]] celebrations focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms, with each dancer interpreting the music in her own special way but within a  specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Populous''' is a global [[architecture|architectural]] firm specializing in the design of sports facilities, arenas and convention centers, as well as the planning of major special events.

Populous formerly operated as '''HOK Sport Venue Event''', which was part of the [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum|HOK Group]]. In January 2009, Populous was created through a management buyout, becoming independently owned and operated. It is reported to be one of the largest architecture firms in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Collison, [http://www.kansascity.com/business/story/965900.html "HOK Sport Venue now stands alone"], ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', January 5, 2009. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://populous.com|title=POPULOUS – Drawing People Together|website=POPULOUS|language=en-US|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613105835/http://populous.com/|archivedate=June 13, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Collison, [http://www.kansascity.com/business/story/1116065.html "Sports architecture firm changes name"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403194146/http://www.kansascity.com/business/story/1116065.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', March 31, 2009 (access date March 31, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Company development===
[[File:HOK Sports.svg|thumb|Logo of the former HOK Sports]]
In 1983, [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum|HOK]] under Jerry Sincoff created a sports group (initially called the Sports Facilities Group and later changed to HOK Sport Venue Event). The firm initially consisted of eight architects in Kansas City, and grew to employ 185 people by 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/HOK-Group-Inc-Company-History.html|title=History of HOK Group, Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301060554/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/HOK-Group-Inc-Company-History.html|archivedate=March 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On several projects, HOK Sport had teamed with international design practice LOBB Partnership, which maintained offices in London, England, and Brisbane, Australia. On HOK Sport's 15th anniversary in November 1998, the firm merged with LOBB. The new practice retained headquarters in all three cities.

The [[Kansas City, Missouri]], office was first based in the city's [[Garment District (Kansas City, Missouri)|Garment District]] in the Lucas Place office building.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2009/03/30/daily12.html|title=HOK Sport Venue Event changes name to Populous – Kansas City Business Journal|website=Kansas City Business Journal|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211758/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2009/03/30/daily12.html|archivedate=October 24, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, it moved into its headquarters at 300 Wyandotte in the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market]] neighborhood in a new building it designed, on land developed as an [[urban renewal]] project through tax incentives from the city's Planned Industrial Expansion Authority. It was the first major company to relocate to the neighborhood in several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitch.com/2007-02-01/news/thanks-now-scram&amp;page=19/ |title=Thanks.

In October 2015, Populous relocated to its new headquarters at the newly renovated [[Kansas City Board of Trade|Board of Trade]] building at 4800 Main street near the [[Country Club Plaza]] in Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2014/04/24/populous-will-move-from-river-market-to-plaza-area.html|title=Populous will move from River Market to Plaza area – Kansas City Business Journal|website=Kansas City Business Journal|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224162722/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2014/04/24/populous-will-move-from-river-market-to-plaza-area.html|archivedate=February 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is one of several Kansas City-based sports design firms that trace their roots to [[Kivett and Myers]] which designed the [[Truman Sports Complex]] which was one of the first modern large single purpose sports stadiums (previously, stadiums were designed for multipurpose use). Other firms with sports design presence in Kansas City that trace their roots to Kivett include [[Ellerbe Becket|Ellerbe Becket Inc.]] and [[HNTB|HNTB Corp.]]. [[360 Architecture]] is also based in Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kansascity.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2003/06/23/focus1.html|title=New game plan|website=Kansas City Business Journal|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917185528/http://kansascity.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2003/06/23/focus1.html|archivedate=September 17, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Retro" era of baseball parks===
[[Image:Oriole Park Conway Street.JPG|thumb|The red brick facade of Camden Yards was designed by Populous to blend into the surrounding neighborhood of downtown Baltimore, especially the nearby [[B&amp;O Warehouse]].]]
Populous is credited for spearheading a new era of [[baseball park]] design in the 1990s, beginning with [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref name="Byrnes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/03/retro-ballpark-movement-officially-over/1597/|title=Is the Retro Ballpark Movement Officially Over?|last=Byrnes|first=Mark|date=March 30, 2012|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112083813/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/03/retro-ballpark-movement-officially-over/1597/|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Camden Yards, and in other stadiums built by Populous soon thereafter, such as [[Coors Field]] in Denver and [[Progressive Field]] in Cleveland, the ballpark was designed to incorporate aesthetic elements of the city's history and older "[[Jewel Box (baseball)|classic ballparks]]." Camden Yards's red brick facade emulates the massive [[B&amp;O Warehouse]] that dominates the right field view behind [[Eutaw Street]],&lt;ref name="SantelliSantelli2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Santelli|first1=Robert|last2=Santelli|first2=Jenna|title=The Baseball Fan's Bucket List: 162 Things You Must Do, See, Get, and Experience Before You Die|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQtTF0CAq7AC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=November 12, 2013|year=2010|publisher=Running Press|isbn=9780762440313|page=73|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103050446/http://books.google.com/books?id=TQtTF0CAq7AC&amp;pg=PA73|archivedate=January 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Progressive Field's glass and steel exterior "call to mind the drawbridges and train trestles that crisscross the nearby [[Cuyahoga River]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/indians/2013/06/18/indians-progressive-field-sustains-splendor/2434813/|title=Indians' Progressive Field sustains splendor|last=Mock|first=Joe|date=June 18, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720061012/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/indians/2013/06/18/indians-progressive-field-sustains-splendor/2434813/|archivedate=July 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with [[Great American Ball Park]] in Cincinnati in 2003, a number of Populous Sport's stadiums featured more contemporary and even [[futurism|futuristic]] designs. Subsequent stadium exteriors featuring [[Baseball park#Retro-modern ballparks|this motif]] opened in [[Nationals Park|Washington]] and [[Target Field|Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="Byrnes"/&gt;

In addition to moving away from the concrete exteriors of the "cookie-cutter" [[multi-purpose stadium]]s that preceded the new parks, Populous incorporated other innovative touches: natural grass playing surfaces (instead of [[artificial turf]]), asymmetrical field dimensions, various park-specific idiosyncrasies (like [[Minute Maid Park#Features|Tal's Hill]] in Houston), and less [[foul territory]] that would keep fans farther from the diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/bal/oriolepark/history.jsp#history|title=OriolePark.com: History|website=Baltimore Orioles|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602203012/http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/bal/oriolepark/history.jsp#history|archivedate=June 2, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/baseball-the-tenth-inning/america/fields-and-dreams/|title=Fields and Dreams|last=Ward|first=Geoffrey C.|author2=Ken Burns|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112081930/http://www.pbs.org/baseball-the-tenth-inning/america/fields-and-dreams/|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosensweig2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosensweig|first=Daniel|title=Retro Ball Parks: Instant History, Baseball, and the New American City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwkHmiWiHLIC|accessdate=November 12, 2013|year=2005|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|isbn=9781572333512|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103050540/http://books.google.com/books?id=LwkHmiWiHLIC|archivedate=January 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And because the stadiums were designed for baseball instead of several sports, the [[sightlines]] were "uniformly excellent."&lt;ref name="lamster"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/July-2009/Play-Ball/|title=Play Ball|last=Lamster|first=Mark|date=July 2009|work=Metropolis Magazine|accessdate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112094317/http://www.metropolismag.com/July-2009/Play-Ball/|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden Yards was hugely popular with baseball fans, and its success convinced many cities to invest public funds in their own new ballparks to help revitalize struggling urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Rosensweig2005"/&gt; From 1992 to 2012, HOK Sport/Populous were the lead architects on 14 Major League Baseball stadiums and helped renovate four existing stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/mia/ballpark/architect.jsp|title=About the Architect|website=Miami Marlins|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630092149/http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/mia/ballpark/architect.jsp|archivedate=June 30, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
Populous's designs across Major League Baseball have become so prevalent that some critics have asserted that the distinctiveness that was originally found in early "retro" ballparks is impossible to maintain: "There are nearly 20 [new ballparks] around the league, [so] their heterogeneity has come to seem altogether homogenous." Whereas "classic" ballparks like [[Fenway Park]] were given strange dimensions simply because of the limitations provided by the plots of land on which the parks were built, new stadiums do not feature such restrictions. One sportswriter said the attempt to emulate the old parks in this way is "contrived."&lt;ref name="lamster"/&gt;

In addition, a number of commentators have criticized what they see as a tendency to cater new ballparks toward wealthier ticket buyers, such as with expanded use of [[luxury suite]]s instead of cheaper, conventional seating.&lt;ref name="lamster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMauseCagan2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMause|first1=Neil|last2=Cagan|first2=Joanna|title=Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money Into Private Profit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkLqMf1vhwQC|accessdate=November 12, 2013|year=2008|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803228481|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103050515/http://books.google.com/books?id=zkLqMf1vhwQC|archivedate=January 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/subway-series-affordable-aspect-yankee-stadium-experience-4-train-fare-article-1.146146|title=Subway Series: Only affordable aspect of Yankee Stadium experience is the 4 train fare|last=Lupica|first=Mike|date=May 23, 2011|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112090229/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/subway-series-affordable-aspect-yankee-stadium-experience-4-train-fare-article-1.146146|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2009/04/new_yankee_stad_1.php|title=New Yankee Stadium Opens Its Vast, Expensive Gates|last=deMause|first=Neil|date=April 2, 2009|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112084641/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2009/04/new_yankee_stad_1.php|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several writers have noted that upper deck seating at new ballparks may actually be farther away from the field than in the older parks, partly as a result of these new upper decks being pushed higher by rows of luxury suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/cover/2005/cover1007.html|title=Rich Fan, Poor Fan|last=Levin|first=Josh|date=Oct 7–13, 2005|work=[[Washington City Paper]]|accessdate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112082047/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/cover/2005/cover1007.html|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One writer in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said it is "not quite right to credit or blame Populous" for trends in their new stadiums—as it is ultimately team owners that plan what they want in future stadiums—but they "certainly enabled" such changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-end-of-the-retro-ballpark|title=The End of the Retro Ballpark|date=April 6, 2012|website=The New Yorker|access-date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401003808/http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-end-of-the-retro-ballpark|archivedate=April 1, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018 Populous, together with Madison Square Garden Company, announced plans to construct two grandiose entertainment arenas: Sphere Las Vegas and Sphere London. According to plans, both vast venues will be futuristically designed and equipped with advanced acoustic and visual technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/populous-design-spherical-music-venues-london-las-vegas|title=Populous to Design Spherical Music Venues in London and Las Vegas {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some, including Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, support the development of the London Venue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/09/msg-sphere-plans-london-next-venue-stratford-olympic-park|title=MSG Sphere: plans offer glimpse of London’s next venue|last=Booth|first=Robert|date=2018-02-09|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; others are concerned about the feasibility of the plans.

'''Robert Watts''' was an American artist best known for his work as a member of the international group of artists [[Fluxus]]. Born in [[Burlington, Iowa]] June 14, 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/bio.html] Robert Watts on Fluxus Artpool&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artist_e.jsp?iartistid=5816 Cybermuse]&lt;/ref&gt; he became Professor of Art at Douglass College, [[Rutgers University]], New Jersey in 1953, a post he kept until 1984. In the 1950s, he was in close contact with other teachers at Rutgers including [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Geoffrey Hendricks]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. This has led some critics to claim that [[pop art]] and [[conceptual art]] began at Rutgers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgsa.rutgers.edu/runy/runy03_nfc.html Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/__Off_Limits_257.html Corinne Robins]&lt;/ref&gt;

He organised the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'', May 1963 with [[George Brecht]], and was one of the main protagonists, along with [[George Maciunas]], in turning [[SoHo]], New York, into an artist's quarter. He died Friday September 2, 1988 of lung cancer in [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/obituaries/robert-watts-artist-and-fluxus-figure-dies-of-cancer-at-65.html New York Times Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also known as '''Bob Watts''' or '''Doctor Bob'''.

After earning a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Louisville]], Watts served as an officer in the United States Navy aboard aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Friedman_e.html Flux Med Dr Bob]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts left the Navy and moved to New York in 1948, where he studied art at the [[Art Students League]] and later at [[Columbia University]] from where he gained a degree in the History of Art, majoring in pre-Columbian and non-Western Art.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;  After becoming Professor of Art at Douglass College, Rutgers University, 1953, he started to exhibit works in a proto-pop style. He participated in Pop Art shows such as ''New Forms, New Media'' exhibition in 1960 at Martha Jackson's Gallery; the ''Popular Image'' exhibition at the Washington Gallery of Art in 1963; and the 1964 ''American Supermarket'' exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery, which also featured [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref name="MailArt"&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mail Art John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After exhibiting at [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli's]] Gallery in 1964, Watts turned his back on the gallery system, and concentrated instead on the [[anti-art]] of the emerging New York avant-garde centred around George Maciunas. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[His] work obviously related to that of the Pop artists that I had discovered a few years before...Watts' chromed objects closely related to [[Jasper Johns|Johns']] cast beer cans and flashlights, for instance. The 1964 exhibition also included Watts' sculpture of plaster cast loaves of bread on shelves. That work, in particular, I think of as one of his most important inventions. I'm also particularly fond of the chrome eggs and egg carton in my own collection which will appear in this [posthumous] show. The public will be surprised that an artist -so promising at such an early date- did not receive through the years the appreciation he deserved." Leo Castelli&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Yam Festival===
[[Image:LanternEvent.jpg|240px|right|thumb|''Lantern Event; an aspect of Yam Festival'', 1962, a mail art piece by Robert Watts and George Brecht; the coloured paper scores are by Watts.]]
Watts met the artist and chemist [[George Brecht]] in 1957 after the latter saw an exhibition of Watts' work and sought his acquaintance;&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht; A Heterospective, Konig, 2005, p306&lt;/ref&gt; the two would meet for lunch every week, with Kaprow occasionally joining them, for a number of years to discuss art and to plan joint exhibitions. One of the most famous was the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'' (1962–3), which used mail-art to build expectations for a month-long series of happenings, performances and exhibitions at Rutgers, New York City and [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal's]] farm in [[New Jersey]]. Participating artists included [[Alison Knowles]], [[Ay-O]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[John Cage]], and [[Dick Higgins]]. The events ran parallel to George Maciunas' Fluxus Festivals in Europe (Sept 1962-early 1963) -which had already performed some of Watts' event scores in Düsseldorf- and the two events were officially joined when Maciunas published Brecht's event scores as [[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|''Water Yam'']], the first of the Flux boxes to be published. Watts' own flux collection, ''Robert Watts Events'' was published a year later and brought together many of the mail art event scores that had been used to publicise the Yam Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Miller_h.html Flux Med]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I consider Yam Lecture a chain of events arranged in such a way that the sequence is quite random, no performance exactly like any other, with changing performers, costumers, actions, sounds, words, images, and so on. The 'structure' is such that it is very flexible (nearly non-existent) and permits inclusion of anything one wished to do and any possible future changes. It is a loose and open thing. The audience puts it together the way it wishes or not at all."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Similar ideas were at work in Yam Festival which George Brecht and I carried out last year. In effect this was a mailing to an audience, sometimes randomly chosen, of an assortment of things. Some were event cards similar to the above; others were objects, food, pencils, soap, photos, actions, words, facts, statements, declarations, puzzles, etc. Certain ones were by subscription. One might say this way of working is a way or manner of calling attention to what one wishes to talk about; or it is a way of talking about it. Or it is a way to hold up for scrutiny a range of material that ordinarily is not so directly useful for art or has not yet been so considered." Robert Watts, quoted in the Times Literary Supplement, 1964&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One example of Watts' event scores around this point is ''Casual Event'';

===''Casual Event'' (1962)===
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive car to filling station&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;inflate right front tire&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;continue to inflate until tire blows out&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;change tire*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive home

&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;*if car is newer model drive home on blown out tire

According to [[Henry Flynt]], Maciunas '[begged] Watts not to continue 'Yam' separately from Fluxus. Maciunas was desperate to unite the whole post-Cage movement under his command.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mailart; Robert Watts by John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus===
[[Image:Wattstimekit.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A number of versions of the ''Flux Timekit'', 1967, by Robert Watts, collecting together objects that exist in different time scales.]]
Watts' friendship with Maciunas was cemented when the latter was confined to a hospital bed throughout May 1963. To cheer him up, Watts sent him ''Hospital Events'' (see [http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/moreinfo.cfm?title_id=3931&amp;return=/search/search.cfm&amp;qty=0&amp;type=1&amp;email=&amp;cookie1=D9E71EB4-1C42-ECEB-7880DA46C41B8750&amp;retail=100.0000&amp;qty=1&amp;page=3&amp;frompage=Search%20%3E%20%3CA%20HREF%3D%2Fcatalogue%2Fsearch%2Ecfm%3Femail%3D%26cookie1%3DD9E71EB4%2D1C42%2DECEB%2D7880DA46C41B8750%26search%3Dfluxus%2520box%26search%5Ftype%3D%3Efluxus%20box%3C%2FA%3E]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Hendricks_e.html Geoff Hendricks] retrieved 23–04–09&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas enjoyed the piece so much that he published it as an early ''Fluxbox''; many of Watts' contemporary event cards were subsequently included in ''Fluxus 1'', 1963, Maciunas' first year box compiling works by the members of the international avant-garde.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It must have been Alison Knowles who called me up to say [George Maciunas] was in bad shape with asthma in an Air Force hospital in Germany and needed help or at least some encouragement.... I decided to send something for entertainment, so I stuck some pistol caps on the back of old photos from an Italian magazine of WWI vintage. I remember there was a photo of a priest blessing a propeller of an Italian Air Force fighter plane. The idea was to put the photo on an anvil and hit the front with a hammer until all the caps exploded. Later GM said he got a big kick out of this procedure, especially since after he exploded all the caps, he set up the photos' remains for the locals to continue the destruction.... he said the people beat the shit out of those photos until there was nothing left but fuzz." Robert Watts, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p62&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Over the years Watts contributed a number of works to Fluxus including a ''Flux Atlas'', a collection of rocks from different countries, and a ''Flux Timekit'', a series of boxes that housed objects that existed in different time scales, such as seeds to be planted, a time-lapsed photo of a speeding bullet and a pocket watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml Cold War Games and Postwar Art / Claudia Mesch] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713171331/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml |date=July 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set up ''Implosions Inc.'' with Maciunas to mass-produce novelty items, and helped run the ''Flux Housing Co-Operative'', an artist-run scheme that is held responsible for the rehabilitation and gentrification of SoHo, offering cheap loft spaces to artists throughout the sixties and seventies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0532909/bio Imdb Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts himself was the first resident of the first working Flux Co-Op at 80 Wooster Street.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Mekas]]' cinematheque and Maciunas' apartment were housed in the same building which soon became the 'central Fluxus loft'.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p177&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the notorious ''Flux Mass'', and was one of the very few original artists apart from Maciunas himself to have neither distanced himself from the movement, nor to have been expelled.

==Posthumous Reputation==
Referred to as ''the invisible man of Fluxus and Pop'' by the critic Kim Levin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_3_88/ai_60130219/ Watts and Kaprow, Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt; a term later used as the title of a solo posthumous show in Kassel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artistInfo/artist/1994/lang/1 ArtFactsNet&lt;/ref&gt; Watts remains a 'distant, aloof, and enigmatic'&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt; figure. In general his reputation has gradually recovered since the late 90s, although not without comments on some of the works' perceived sexism.&lt;ref name="Richard"/&gt; As individual members of Fluxus have increasingly been singled out for re-appraisals, Watts work has been seen in a number of solo and small group shows across the USA and Europe.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'There is something impersonal or phlegmatic in Watts's composition, a deliberately flattened sense of timing. This aspect of his work has not aged as gracefully as have his concerns with commodity and its absurdities. A puckish wit remains where media and message are crisply meshed, as in Portrait Dress, 1965, a see-through vinyl frock with pockets for photographs, or the suite of neon signs in which the signatures of masters like Ingres, Duchamp, and Lichtenstein glow like ads. Other items in this show appeared dated, such as the Lucite sculptures with embedded photographs of food, or the painted plaster casts of bread lined up in a grayscale row, but this was largely because their semiotic jokesterism has been so wholly assimilated by successors that it cannot startle now as it did then.' Frances Richard, 2001&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_2_40/ai_79826078]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His work is held in numerous collections, including The [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=86231 Cloud Music]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris,  [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Kunsthaus Zurich]], and [[Tate Modern]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/bio.html Doctor Bob, Flux Med]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''San-X'''|サンエックス|San Ekkusu}} is a Japanese stationery company known for creating and marketing [[Kawaii|cute]] characters such as [[Tarepanda]], [[Rilakkuma]], [[Sumikko Gurashi]], and [[Kogepan]]. The characters are usually [[anthropomorphic]] representations of animals or inanimate objects. Each character has its own quirky traits; for example, Momobuta is a [[pig]] with a head shaped like a [[peach]], who enjoys [[karaoke]] and painting her nails. San-X head designer and creator of Tarepanda, Hikaru Suemasa said in 1999: "It's not just being cute. There is something different - a relaxed look, powerless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/cute.html?pg=2&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set=|title=Cute Inc.|first=Mary|last=Roach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San-X characters can be found on stationery sets and pencils, as small [[figurine]]s, [[keychain]]s, and [[stuffed toy]]s. They are sold as [[blind box]]es, [[gashapon]] and in [[UFO catcher]]s and other prize machines in Japan's arcades. There are also [[anime]] series, [[video game]]s and [[children's book]]s featuring the characters.

==History==
San-X was founded in April 1932 as a privately owned business under the name ''Chida Handler''. In October 1942, Chida Handler became a [[limited company]]. Chida Handler's name was changed to San-X in May 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.san-xdirect.com/about_sanx/about.htm San-X Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921220356/http://www.san-xdirect.com/about_sanx/about.htm |date=2008-09-21 }} https://web.archive.org/web/20080821233019/http://www.san-xdirect.com/characters/&lt;/ref&gt; The name San-X derives from an earlier logo which was a row of three ''X'' characters. ''San'' is ''three'' in Japanese.

Before Tarepanda became a hit, most of San-X products did not rely on characters. They continue to sell products like stationery with scenic shots and illustrations. In 1987 San-X created Pinny-Mu, their biggest character until [[Tarepanda]] was created in 1995. After Tarepanda became a success in 1998 San-X turned into a full-scale character development and licensing company. In 2003 [[Rilakkuma]] was created and in 2005 [[Mamegoma]], which was adapted to an [[anime]] series in 2009.

In 2010 ''[[The New York Times]]'' described San-X as a smaller, nimbler company, with potential to surpass the [[Sanrio]] corporation. The San-X characters Tarepanda and Rilakkuma were described as "huge hits in Japan" that were rising in the Character Databank character popularity charts while Sanrio's [[Hello Kitty]] character slumped in popularity, especially in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Search of Adorable, as Hello Kitty Gets Closer to Goodbye |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=May 14, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/business/global/15kitty.html?src=me&amp;ref=business }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, [https://aliquantum-international.com/ Aliquantum International] (AQI) became the exclusive distributor of San-X products in North America.

'''Spanish Romanesque''' to designate the spatial division of the [[Romanesque art]] corresponding to [[Chronology of the kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula|Hispanic-Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, its stylistic features are essentially common to the European Romanesque, and in the particular differentiated between areas that usually subdivided. The southern half of the peninsula lacks of Romanesque art since remained under Muslim rule ([[Hispanic-muslim art|Andalusi art]]). The Romanesque in the central area of the peninsula is low and late, with virtually no presence at south of the Ebro and the Tagus; It is the northern third peninsular the area where are concentrated the Romanesque buildings. In view of the fact that the Romanesque is introduced into the peninsula from east to west, for the purposes of its study, the regional delimitation is done in the same direction: in "eastern kingdoms" (the kingdoms or Pyrenean areas: Catalan Romanesque, Aragonese Romanesque and Navarrese Romanesque), and "western kingdoms" (Castilian-Leonese Romanesque, Asturian Romanesque, Galician Romanesque and Portuguese Romanesque).

The [[First Romanesque]] or Lombard Romanesque has especially presence in Catalonia, while the full Romanesque spread from the foundations of the [[Cluniac Reforms|Order of Cluny]] along the axis of [[Camino de Santiago]]. The late-romanesque continues in the 13th century, especially in rural buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Fernández (historian)|Antonio Fernández]], [[Emilio Barnechea]] and [[Juan Haro]], ''History of Art'', Barcelona: Vicens-Vives, 1992, {{ISBN|9788431625542}}, cp. 9, pg. 145-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Romanesque architecture in Spain}}

From the 11th century the European artistic influence (especially Burgundian - [[Monastery of Cluny|Cluny]] - and [[First Romanesque|Lombard monasteries]] - [[Lombard arch]]es -)  was superimposed on local artistic traditions ( called as "[[Pre-Romanesque]] - [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]], [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]], [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] or [[Repoblación art and architecture|Repoblación art]]) and [[Hispanic muslim art|Andalusi art]] or Hispanic Muslim) and lived with the so-called [[Mudéjar]] Romanesque (or "Romanesque of brick", dominant in some areas, such as the center of the Northern Plateau -from Sahagún to Cuéllar-, Toledo or Teruel) giving rise to an art of strong personality.

The chronology in the penetration of architectural forms is visible in a display from east to west, being the first examples in Catalonia ([[Sant Pere de Rodes]], 1022) and developed around [[Camino de Santiago]] those of Aragon ([[Jaca Cathedral|Cathedral of Jaca]], from 1054), Navarre ([[Monastery of Leyre|Leire]], 1057), Castile ([[San Martín de Tours, Fromista|San Martin de Frómista]], 1066) and Leon ([[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro]] -portico of 1067), ending in Galicia, where it raised the most outstanding work: the [[cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] (begun in 1075 with the plant of pilgrimage characteristic of most of the churches of the Way, from that of [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse|St. Sernin of Toulouse]]). The 12th century was the culmination of the style ([[Santa Maria de Ripoll|Monastery of Ripoll]], [[Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí|churches of Boí and Taüll]] -in Catalonia-, [[Loarre Castle|Castle of Loarre]], [[San Juan de la Peña|Monastery of San Juan de la Peña]] -in Aragon, [[Palacio de los Reyes de Navarra, Estella|Palace of the Kings of Navarre (Estella)]], [[Done Mikel eliza (Estella-Lizarra)]], [[Church of Saint Mary of Eunate|Saint Mary of Eunate]], [[San Pedro, Olite|Saint Peter of Olite]] -in Navarre-, Segovian arcaded churches, [[Santo Domingo, Soria|Santo Domingo (Soria)]], [[Monastery of San Juan de Duero|San Juan de Duero]] -in Castile-, [[Cathedral of Zamora]], [[Old Cathedral of Salamanca]] -in Leon-). From the late 12th is identified the transition from Romanesque to Gothic ([[Cathedral of Tarragona]], [[La Seu Vella, Lleida|La Seu Vella (Lleida)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Few, but notable are the churches of central plant, which are often associated with models of the Holy Land brought by the military orders (Eunate in Navarre, Vera Cruz in Segovia).&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''Historia del Arte'', Editex, 2009, pg. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century emphasizes the facades of [[Santa Maria de Ripoll]], of the [[Church of Santa María la Real, Sangüesa|Andre Maria erreginaren eliza]] (Zangoza/Sangüesa) of the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|San Pedro el Viejo]] (Huesca) and the cloister of [[San Juan de la Peña|Monastery of San Juan de la Peña]]. In the late 12th century belong the facades of the [[Church of Santa María del Camino (Carrión de los Condes)]] and [[Santo Domingo, Soria|Santo Domingo (Soria)]]. In some works of this period is visible the transition to [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic]]: the apostolate of the [[Cámara Santa|Cámara Santa (Oviedo)]], the facade of [[San Vicente, Ávila|San Vicente (Ávila)]] and [[Portico of Glory]] of Cathedral of Santiago de Cosmpostela (of [[Master Mateo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, op. cit.; Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit.'', pg. 189 y ss.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the early sculptors of known name is [[Arnau Cadell]] (capitals of the cloister of [[Monastery of Sant Cugat|Sant Cugat]]).

The carvings in the round bulge that have been preserved, in polychrome wood, usually have as theme the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ crucified]] in the type called ''[[Majesty (crucifix)|Majesty]]'' and the [[Madonna with Child]] in the type called ''[[Seat of Wisdom|sedes sapientiae]]'' ("Seat of Wisdom"). An exceptional sculpture complex is the ''[[Davallament of Sant Joan de les Abadesses]]'', of transition to the Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit'', pg. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Romanesque frescoes are outstanding: Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro (León) retained 'in situ', or the torn from its places of origin ([[San Baudelio de Berlanga]], [[hermitage of la Vera Cruz (Maderuelo)]] -both in the [[Prado]]- and the collection assembled in the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, ``op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel painting produced [[antependium]] that, especially in Catalonia collected the Italian-Byzantine influence from the 12th century (''[[Altar frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles]]''). In later period it evolves to the [[Gothic painting]], of higher capacity narrative and lower stiffness (''[[Altar frontal from Avià]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, op. cit.'', pg. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sumptuary arts==

The preparation of manuscripts in the ''[[scriptorium]]'' of monasteries and cathedrals was an out-standing activity, continuing the Mozárabe tradition (Beatus) and incorporating the European influences (''[[Libro de los testamentos]]'', ''[[Tumbos compostelanos]]'', ''[[Codex Calixtinus]]'', etc.) have been retained some outstanding examples of tissues in liturgical vestments and tapestries (''[[Tapestry of Creation]]'' of the Cathedral of Girona) The [[Ivory carving]], of Andalusian influence, played an important workshop at the Leonese court. The [[goldsmith]] produced rich pieces (''[[Cáliz de las Ágatas]] '' or of Doña Urraca -ca 1063-,&lt;ref&gt;[http://domuspucelae.blogspot.com.es/2010/07/visita-virtual-el-caliz-de-dona-urraca.html Virtual tour: THE GOBLET OF DOÑA URRACA, pious donation of the Queen of Zamora]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ark of San Isidoro]]''), including the incorporation of the technique of the [[Limoges enamels]] (''[[Frontal of Santo Domingo de Silos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit.'', pg. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''templon''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τέμπλον meaning "temple", plural ''templa'') is a feature of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] churches consisting of a barrier separating the [[nave]] from the [[sacraments]] at the [[altar]].

The solid templon first appeared in Christian churches around the 5th century and is still found in many [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] churches. Initially it was a low barrier probably not much different from the [[altar rails]] of many Western churches. It eventually evolved into the modern [[iconostasis]], still found in Orthodox churches today.

It is usually composed of carved wood or marble colonnettes supporting an [[architrave]] (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the [[sanctuary]]. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, [[icons]] were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the colonnettes, and the templon became more opaque. In modern Orthodox churches, it is common for the openings of the templa to be constructed specifically to contain icons.

==Origins==
[[Image:Proskenionastemplon.jpg|thumb|A Greek [[scaenae frons]] (theater screen) portraying a three-doored temple facade, posited in the early 20th century as a possible origin for the design of the templon.]]The templon most likely has an independent origin from that of [[Latin]] chancel barriers. Classical stage architecture is one possible source. At certain times during Byzantine history, [[theater]] heavily influenced painting and sculpture. Architects then, influenced by stage backdrops dating back to [[Sophocles]], consciously imitated the classical ''proskenion'' (Latin [[proscenium]]; the backdrop of a classical Greek stage), copying the multiple columns punctuated by a large door in the middle and two smaller doors to each side. The statues on top of the backdrop would thus be analogous to the icons of the saints looking down.&lt;ref name="myref-12"&gt;[[Josef Strzygowski|Strzygowski, Josef]]. "A Sarcophagus of the Sidamara Type ... and the Influence of Stage Architecture upon the Art of Antioch." ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', '''Vol. 27''' (1907). 99–122.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities, however, are probably only visual. Although classical drama was performed in [[Constantinople]], the capital of the Byzantine Empire, during the 5th and 6th century when the first templa appear, when Christian [[liturgy]] was first being developed, the plays and their architecture had lost their importance and could not have influenced Christian ritual.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A much more plausible theory is that the templon models, in both form and content, the decorative wall of the [[Torah screen]] in [[Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. These, too, had three main divisions: a central door leading to the altar, smaller flanking passages, and a distribution of parts similar to a templon. The Torah screen was probably not the direct prototype of the templon; it probably derives from the imitation of the Torah screen in the altar of a typical [[Syria]]n [[Paganism|pagan]] [[temple]].&lt;ref name="myref-2"&gt;Swift, Emerson Howland. ''Hagia Sophia''. Columbia University Press, New York, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct comparison can also be made to the layout of the great [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. The most sacred and innermost portion, known as the [[Holy of Holies]], was where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was kept. This room was separated from the larger part of the main building's interior by a large curtain, the "[[parochet|veil of the temple]]". Only the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on [[Yom Kippur]]. The third part was the entrance court. This architectural tradition for the two main parts can be seen carried forward in Christian churches and is still most demonstratively present in Eastern Orthodox churches where the iconostatsis divides the altar, the Holy of Holies containing the consecrated Eucharist - the manifestation of the New Covenant, from the larger portion of the church accessible to the faithful. In Orthodox Christian tradition, with the exception of churches at women's [[monastery|monasteries]], only men with good cause may enter the altar portion behind the iconostasis.

Barriers called templons in Greek were also used on occasions when the [[Roman Emperor]]s appeared in public, to segregate the Imperial retinue from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Cheremeteff in Leong, Albert ed.;''The Millennium: Christianity and Russia, A.D. 988–1988''; p.108-110; 1990; St Vladimir's Seminary Press;{{ISBN|0-88141-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Templon'' is a [[loan word]] in Greek, from the [[Latin]] ''templum'', "[[temple]]"; how and why it came to have its present meaning is unclear. The most obvious explanation is that the form of the templon resembles a pagan [[temple]]. The steps up to the [[apse]] (semicircle where the altar is located) are analogous to the [[stylobate|stereobate]] and [[stylobate]] of the temple (the floor of a temple). The colonnettes arranged in the π shape resemble the [[columns]] that surround all four sides of a temple, the [[architrave]] looks like the architrave on a temple, and the carved disks on the architrave are analogous to the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] on the [[entablature]]. 

However, it has also been suggested that the name templon derives not from the pagan temples but from the Christian idea of the shrine where God was worshipped, or more specifically the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].
In almost all modern European languages, the word ''templon'' is a direct and late borrowing of the Greek architectural term, and it is rarely found outside the academic usage; besides the Greek ''templon'', another direct descendant of the Latin ''templum'', having the same architectural meaning, is the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''tâmplă'', "iconostasis".{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=56280 tâmplă]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} at the Online Version of the Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early templa==
[[File:Rom, Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Innenansicht.JPG|thumb|[[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome]]
Archaeological evidence for an early templon comes from the [[Monastery of Stoudios|Cathedral of St. John at Stoudios]] in Constantinople, a [[basilica]] dedicated to [[John the Baptist]], built around 463. The chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large door facing the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known. The chancel barrier was not merely a low [[parapet]] (a short wall); remains of colonnettes have been found, suggesting that the barrier carried an architrave on top of the columns.&lt;ref name="myref-9"&gt;Matthews, Thomas F. ''The Early Churches of Constantinople: Architecture and Liturgy''. Pennsylvania State University Press, PA, 1971, {{ISBN|0-271-00108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fragments of a marble templon have been discovered on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Was the Aksa Mosque built over the remains of a Byzantine church?, By ETGAR LEFKOVITS, Jerusalem Post, November 16, 2008 [https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Was-the-Aksa-Mosque-built-over-the-remains-of-a-Byzantine-church]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some architectural and archaeological evidence of early templa, the first and most detailed description of a templon comes from a poem by [[Paul the Silentiary]], describing [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople. It was composed near the end of [[Justinian I]]’s reign and was probably recited on [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]], January 6, 563, celebrating the reinauguration of the church after the reconstruction of the great dome.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Hagia Sophia’s templon surrounded, according to Paulus, "such space as was reserved in the eastern arch of the great church for the bloodless sacrifices".&lt;ref name="myref-8"&gt;Lethaby, W. R. and Swainson, Harold. ''The Church of Sancta Sophia Constantinople: A Study of Byzantine Building''. Macmillan and Co., London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it stretched the length of the eastern semidome, including the apse but excluding the [[exedra]]e (half-dome recesses in a wall). Twelve silver-covered marble columns of approximately 4.94 meters from base to capital were arranged on three sides of a rectangular ground plan around the altar. A horizontal entablature rested upon these. Three doors allowed entry to the apse, the central one larger than the other two. Though earlier scholars have proposed that all columns and all doors were in a single line parallel to the apse, modern reconstructions show the central portal facing out to the nave with the smaller doors each located on the other sides of the rectangular plan.&lt;ref name="myref-15"&gt;Xydis, Stephen G. "The Chancel Barrier, Solea, and Ambo of Hagia Sophia." ''The Art Bulletin''. '''Vol. 29''', No. 1 (March 1947). 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In between the columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On them had been carved the monograms of Justinian and [[Theodora (6th century)]], even though Theodora had been dead for several years, as well as a many-armed [[cross]] in the center. On the center of the architrave was a [[repoussé]] medallion of [[Christ]]. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the [[Prophet]]s, the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], and finally the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to [[St. John of Ephesus]], rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix.&lt;ref name="myref-10"&gt;Procopius. ''Procopius. Vol. VII: Buildings''. Trans. H.B. Dewing and Glanville Downey, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an inscription to [[St. John the Theologian]] over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. [[St. John the Baptist]] was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.

In any case, the majority of templa followed the same basic design. They were usually carved of monochrome marble, though some, like Hagia Sophia’s, were covered in precious metals and others used [[polychrome]] [[marble]]s. The slabs were often carved with vegetal or animal patterns and the architraves with [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of God, the Virgin, and the saints. Figurative decoration on the templon was mainly concentrated on the [[architrave]], initially with carved busts. This continued from the time of Justinian into the middle Byzantine period, as shown from a 10th-century excavation in [[Elaiussa Sebaste|Sebaste]] in [[Phrygia]], which uncovered a marble templon whose epistyle is covered with busts of saints. There is evidence that icons were hung from the columns of the templon prior to [[iconoclasm]]. [[Saint Nicephorus|Nicephorus I]], [[Patriarch]] of Constantinople from 806 to 815 describes portable icons hung from columns and the gate of the templon in his ''Antirretikoi''. Important portable and colossal icons were also placed in front of the templon, as in the 11th-century church of [[Saint Panteleimon]] in [[Nerzei]].&lt;ref name="myref-6"&gt;Kavan, Katrina. "Screen: Early Christian and Byzantine." ''The Grove Dictionary of Art Online''. Oxford University Press, Accessed 23 March 2004. &lt;www.groveart.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
[[Image:Iconostasis in Moscow.jpg|thumb|Five-panel Deesis row, Iconostasis of the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] by [[Theophanes the Greek]], 1405 – the first five-row Iconostasis]]
The templon gradually replaced all other forms of chancel barriers in Byzantine churches in the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries except in [[Cappadocia]]. As late as the 10th century, a simple wooden chancel barrier separated the apse from the nave in the rock-cut churches, though by the late 11th century, the templon had become standard. This may have been because of the veneration and imitation of the Great Church Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, though the columnar form of chancel barrier does predate Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref name="myref-7"&gt;{{cite book| last=Kostof| first= Spiro| title=Caves of God: The Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia| publisher= MIT Press| location= Cambridge, MA| year= 1972| isbn= 0-262-11042-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The templon began to change forms to the medieval templon with the attachment of icons and painted scenes to the architrave. Some of the best preserved of these images are from the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. The late 12th-century templon beam shows twelve canonical feast scenes, with the [[Deesis]] (Christ enthroned, flanked by Mary and St. John the Baptist) located in the middle between the Transfiguration and the Raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], linking the scene of Lazarus with the [[Holy Week]] images according to liturgical practice. Several epistyles of this form have been excavated throughout the empire, none earlier than the 12th century, indicating a change from busts on the architrave to scenic decoration. This new scenic style is representative of the increasing liturgification in Byzantine representational art after iconoclasm.&lt;ref name="myref-3"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Epstein| first= A. W.| title=The Middle-Byzantine Sanctuary Barrier: Templon or Iconostasis?| journal=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association| volume= 134| year=1981| pages= 1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the Middle Byzantine period, the space between the colonnettes was not filled with icons but with curtains. [[Nicholaos Andidorum]] describes in his ''Protheoria'' "the shutting of the doors and the closing of the curtain over them".&lt;ref name="myref-13"&gt;"Templon." ''The [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]''. Ed. Alexander P. Kazhdan, '''Vol. 3'''. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1991. 2023–4, {{ISBN|0-19-504652-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widespread image on the medieval templon seems to have been the Deesis. Its popularity arose from not only its simplicity and elegance, suggesting the [[efficacy of prayer]] and the threat of the [[Last Judgment]], but also because it could be easily adapted to the patron’s tastes with the addition of secondary scenes and characters, as in the Saint Catherine's Monastery where scenes from the life of [[St Eustratios]] appear on either side of the Deesis on a templon beam. [[Proskynetarion|Proskynetaria]] (large icons) also played a major part in the decoration of the medieval templon, either as monumental images placed on the piers flanking the templon or as portable images in front of the screen. Proskynetaria of both these types still exist in Cyprus, from Lagoudera, now in the Archbishop’s Palace in Nicosia, and in St Neophytos.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Naya, Carlo (1816-1882) - n. 52 - Venezia - Interno di San Marco.jpg|thumb|A columnar templon at [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]]]]

Sometime between the 11th and 14th centuries, icons and proskynetaria began to be placed in the intercolumnar openings on the templon. After the reconquest in 1261, carving on the medieval templon approached [[sculpture|sculpture in the round]]. From this period, the first wood-carved templa, or [[iconostasis|iconostases]], were produced. They for most part had a fixed program of icon decoration with three levels: the Local, the Deesis, and the Festival tiers. Early Russian versions were at chest height, and called "thoraxis" in Greek.

The full height iconostasis became standard in the 15th century, and probably owes more to 14th-century [[Hesychasm|Hesychast]] mysticism and the wood-carving genius of the [[Russians]] than anything else. The first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed for the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in [[Moscow Kremlin]] by [[Theophanes the Greek]] in 1405, and soon copied by his assistant [[Andrey Rublyov]] in the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1408.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Cheremeteff in Leong, Albert ed.;''The Millennium: Christianity and Russia, A.D. 988–1988''; p.109-110; 1990; St Vladimir's Seminary Press;{{ISBN|0-88141-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hunger''''' is a 1983 [[Erotic film|erotic]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Tony Scott]] and starring [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. It is the story of a [[love triangle]] between a doctor who specialises in sleep and aging research and a [[vampire]] couple. The film is a loose adaptation of the 1981 [[The Hunger (Strieber novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Whitley Strieber]], with a screenplay by Ivan Davis and Michael Thomas, and is Scott's feature directorial debut.

The film was screened out of competition at the [[1983 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1513/year/1983.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Hunger |accessdate=21 June 2009|work=[[Cannes Film Festival]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Miriam Blaylock ([[Catherine Deneuve]]) is a vampire, promising specially chosen humans [[Immortality|eternal life]] as her vampire lovers. As the film begins, her companion is John ([[David Bowie]]), a talented cellist whom she married in 18th century France. In a night club in New York, they connect with a young couple who they bring home and feed upon by slashing their throats with a bladed [[Ankh]] pendant. The bodies are disposed of by an incinerator in the basement of John and Miriam's elegant New York townhouse, where they pose as a wealthy couple who teach classical music.

Approximately 200 years after his turning, John begins suffering insomnia and ages years in only a few days. John realizes Miriam's promise that periodically killing and feeding upon human victims would give him immortality was only partially true: he will have eternal life but not eternal youth. He seeks out Dr. Sarah Roberts ([[Susan Sarandon]]), a gerontologist, alongside her boyfriend Tom ([[Cliff De Young]]), who specialises in the effects of rapid aging in primates, hoping she will be able to reverse his accelerating decrepitude. Sarah assumes that John is a [[hypochondria]]c or mentally unbalanced and ignores his pleas for help. As John leaves the clinic in a rage, Sarah is horrified to see how rapidly he is aging. John rebuffs her once she tries to help him.

One of the Blaylocks' students, Alice Cavender ([[Beth Ehlers]]), drops by their townhouse to say that she cannot attend the next day's lesson. In a last attempt to regain his youth, John murders and feeds upon Alice, whom Miriam was grooming to be her next consort when she came of age, to no avail. John begs Miriam to kill him and release him from the agony of his decrepit body. Weeping, Miriam tells him there is no release. After John collapses in the basement, Miriam carries him into the attic full of coffins and places him in one. Like John, Miriam's former vampire lovers suffer an eternal living death, helplessly moaning and trapped in their coffins. Later, a police official comes to the residence, looking for the missing Alice. Miriam feigns ignorance and claims that her husband is in Switzerland.

Sarah comes looking for John at his home but only finds Miriam, who now feels alone after losing both John and Alice. The two have a sexual encounter, during which Miriam bites her arm and some of Miriam's blood enters Sarah's body. Miriam attempts to initiate Sarah in the necessities of life as a vampire, but Sarah is repulsed by the thought of subsisting on human blood.

Sarah returns home and goes out to dinner with Tom, who becomes argumentative about her 3-hour disappearance at the Blaylock residence, of which she is strangely quiet. The next day at the lab, the team investigates Sarah's blood by Tom's authority and reveal she has some kind of infection that is taking over. Confused, Sarah returns to confront Miriam about her sudden changes. Still reeling from the effects of her vampiric transformation, Sarah allows Miriam to put her to bed in a guest room.

Tom arrives on Miriam's doorstep, trying to find Sarah. Miriam shows him to the upstairs bedroom. Sarah, starving and desperate, kills Tom. Miriam assures her that she will soon forget what she was. As the two kiss, Sarah drives Miriam's [[ankh]]-knife into her own throat and holds her mouth over Miriam's, forcing Miriam to ingest her blood, possibly working on a hunch regarding the "blood borne metabolic aging disease" and "host" relationship she was told about affecting her blood. Miriam carries Sarah upstairs, intending to place her with her other boxed lovers. A rumbling occurs and the mummies of Miriam's previous lovers - including John - emerge from their coffins, driving her over the edge of the balcony. As she rapidly ages, the mummies become dust, ostensibly providing the trapped souls with release.

The police investigator returns to find a real estate agent showing the townhouse to prospective buyers. Sarah is now in London, standing on the balcony of a chic apartment tower, admiring the view as dusk falls. From a draped coffin in a storage room, Miriam repeatedly screams Sarah's name.

==Production==
The final scene of Sarah on the balcony was added at the studio's behest, with a view to leaving the film open-ended and allowing for possible sequels.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;[[Tony Scott]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2004, [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sarandon later expressed regret that this sequence seemed to make no sense in the context of the rest of the film: "The thing that made the film interesting to me was this question of, 'Would you want to live forever if you were an addict?' But as the film progressed, the powers that be rewrote the ending and decided that I wouldn't die, so what was the point? All the rules that we'd spent the entire film delineating, that Miriam lived forever and was indestructible, and all the people that she transformed [eventually] died, and that I killed myself rather than be an addict [were ignored]. Suddenly I was kind of living, she was kind of half dying... Nobody knew what was going on, and I thought that was a shame."&lt;ref name="Sarandon"&gt;[[Susan Sarandon]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2004, [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie was excited to work on the film but was concerned about the final product. He said "I must say, there's nothing that ''looks'' like it on the market. But I'm a bit worried that it's just perversely bloody at some points."&lt;ref name=RS83&gt;{{Cite news | last=Loder | first=Kurt | author-link=Kurt Loder| title=Straight Time | magazine=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=395 | date=12 May 1983 | pages=22–28, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[Howard Blake]] was musical director on ''The Hunger''. Although a soundtrack album accompanied the film's release ([[Varèse Sarabande]] VSD 47261), this issue omits much of the music used in the film. Blake also composed the orchestral score for ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' (1980) alongside rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and the Oscar-winning animated short film of [[Raymond Briggs]]', ''[[The Snowman#Animated film|The Snowman]]'' (1982).

Blake's notes on working with director Tony Scott: "Tony wanted to create a score largely using classical music and I researched this, many days going to his home in Wimbledon with stacks of recordings to play to him. One of these was the duet for 2 sopranos from Delibes' ''Lakmé'', which I recorded specially with Elaine Barry and Judith Rees, conducting my orchestra The Sinfonia of London. Howard Shelley joined with Ralph Holmes and Raphael Wallfisch to record the second movement of Schubert's [[Piano Trio No. 2 (Schubert)|Piano Trio in E flat]]. Ralph recorded the Gigue from Bach's Violin Partita in E and Raphael the Prelude to Bach's solo cello sonata in G, to which Bowie mimed. I was persuaded to appear in one scene as a pianist, for which I wrote a 'Dolphin Square Blues'. Tony wanted to add a synthesizer score and I introduced him to Hans Zimmer, then working at The Snake Ranch Studio in Fulham but Tony eventually used a score by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger with electronics by David Lawson. It is hard however to exactly separate these elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 2006 | last=Blake | first=Howard|authorlink=Howard Blake | url= http://www.howardblake.com/music/Film-TV-Scores/545/THE-HUNGER.htm | title= The Hunger op.314 (October 1982) | website = howardblake.com | accessdate = 13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Hunger'' received mixed reviews upon its release and was particularly criticised for being heavy on atmosphere and visuals but slow on pace and plot. [[Roger Ebert]], of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', described the film as "an agonizingly bad vampire movie". He remarked that the sex scene between Deneuve and Sarandon is effective, but that the film is so heavy on set design and scene cuts that any sense of a story is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| date = 3 May 1983| last=Ebert | first=Roger| author-link=Roger Ebert| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hunger-1983 | title= The Hunger | work=rogerebert.com|accessdate=February 16, 2015}} {{Rating|1.5|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a brief review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Michael Sragow]] similarly called it "A minor horror movie with a major modern-movie problem: director Tony Scott develops so many ingenious ways to illustrate his premise that there's no time left to tell a story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sragow |first=Michael |title=The Hunger|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 9, 1983 |issue=397|page=52|authorlink=Michael Sragow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Camille Paglia]] wrote in ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990) that while ''The Hunger'' comes close to being a masterpiece of a "classy genre of [[vampire film]]", it is "ruined by horrendous errors, as when the regal Catherine Deneuve is made to crawl around on all fours, slavering over cut throats."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. ''[[Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]]''. [[Yale University Press]], 1990, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elaine Showalter]] called ''The Hunger'' a "post-modernist vampire film" that "casts vampirism in  bisexual terms, drawing on the tradition of the lesbian vampire...Contemporary and stylish, [it] is also disquieting in its suggestion that men and women in the 1980s have the same desires, the same appetites, and the same needs for power, money, and sex."&lt;ref&gt;Showalter, Elaine. ''Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siècle''. Virago Press, 1995, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has found a [[cult following]] that responded to its dark, glamorous atmosphere. The [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] song "[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]" plays over the opening scene and credits. The film is popular with some segments of the [[Goth subculture]] and inspired a short-lived [[The Hunger (serial)|TV series of the same name]] although the series has no direct plot or character connection to it. ''The Hunger'' was nominated for the [[Saturn Award]]s  for [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Make-up]]. It holds a 48% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 29 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moria.co.nz/horror/hunger-1983.htm|website=Moria|title=''The Hunger''|first=Richard|last=Scheib|date=1990|quote=The film has gained a small cult in subsequent years, particularly among the gay community who appointed Susan Sarandon as some kind of icon.|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Valse.jpg|thumb|''The Waltz'', a 1905 cast of the second version]]
'''''The Waltz''''' (French: ''La valse'') or '''''The Waltzers'''''  (French: ''Les valseurs'') is a sculpture by French artist [[Camille Claudel]].  It depicts two figures, a man and a woman, locked in an amorous embrace as they dance a [[waltz]]. The work was inspired by Claudel's burgeoning love affair with her mentor and employer [[Auguste Rodin]].  Various versions were made from 1889 to 1905, initially in modelled in plaster, and later cast in bronze.  Examples are held by the [[Musée Rodin]] and the [[Musée Camille Claudel]].

==Background==
Claudel was studying with [[Alfred Boucher]] in Paris when she was first introduced to Rodin in 1883, when she was aged 19.   She joined his studio around 1884, where she assisted him with ongoing works such as his ''[[Gates of Hell]]'' and ''[[Burghers of Calais]]''.  She also worked on her own sculptures under Rodin's guidance.  They quickly fell into a passionate romantic relationship. Claudel became increasingly frustrated with Rodin's unwillingness to break away from his long-term mistress, [[Rose Beuret]], and their love affair ended in 1892.  

Claudel and Rodin continued to work together until 1898, but their relationship deteriorated irretrievably after Rodin saw her transparently autobiographical sculpture ''[[The Mature Age]]'', which depicts a young woman pleading with her older lover to leave his female companion.

==Description==
Claudel began working on ''The Waltz'' in about 1889, while her relationship with Rodin was still passionate.  As originally conceived, the work depicts two naked dancers, a man and a woman, in a [[hold (dance)|dance hold]], frozen at a moment in time in their amorous embrace.  The woman's head rests tenderly on the man's right shoulder, with their bodies fluidly merging into a single shape as the man turns his head towards the woman's face as if to kiss her.  

Claudel continued to work on the subject for several years, eventually seeking a public commission to create a half-life-size marble version.  Her plaster model of the sculpture was reviewed in 1892 by the art critic [[Armand Dayot]], who was working as an inspector for the French [[Ministry of Beaux-Arts]].  In his report to the ministry, he praised the sensuality and expression of the work, and the modelling of the figures, but concluded that it was not acceptable for public display due to the indecency of the naked dancers.  

In response to Dayot's comments, Claudel reworked the sculpture, draping the lower half of the female figure with a flowing skirt which billows out with the twisting movement of the waltzing dancers, and curled around the dancer's heads.  Dayot reviewed the amended plaster model in 1893: he was impressed with the sense of movement added by the drapery, and supported the new work, known as ''La valse avec voiles'' ("The waltz with veils").  He described it as "un gracieux enlacement de  formes superbes balancées dans un rythme  harmonieux au milieu de l'enveloppement  tournoyant des draperies" ("a gracious intertwining of superb shapes balanced in an harmonious rhythm among swirling drapes"), concluding that Claudel was an artist with great talent.

Claudel exhibited this revised plaster model in 1893 at the [[Paris Salon]] of the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], but the minister [[Henry Roujon]] deemed it unacceptable for a woman to be given a public commission which included a naked man.  Despite support from Rodin, the ministry declined to commission a marble version.

Emulating Rodin's reuse of figures from earlier sculptures in his later works, Claudel adapted the female figure from ''The Waltz'' as the figure of ''Fortune'' in her 1904 bronze cast.

==Casts==
The original plaster version was bought by the founder {{ill|Siot-Decauville|fr}} and in 1893 produced in a single bronze cast of this first version of ''The Waltz'', sometimes known as ''La  valse avec voiles''. 

Claudel worked on modified versions of ''The Waltz'' from 1895 to 1898, removing the drapery around the dancers' heads to make their faces visible.   Claudel made several versions of this modified sculpture, with slightly differing poses, and presented sculptures to several of her friends and acquaintances, including [[Claude Debussy]], [[Robert Godet]] and [[Frits Thaulow]].

The founder and art dealer {{ill|Eugène Blot|fr}} bought the rights to reproduce the sculpture from Siot-Decauville around 1902, and also bought the unique bronze cast of the first version.  Blot sold the this case, and it was held in a private collection in Sweden until the 1950, and then another collection until sold at [[Sotheby's]] in June 2013, for £5,122,500.  Blot also made bronze casts of the second version in 1905; he envisioned an edition of 50, but only 25 were made.

In addition to the bronzes, other examples exist, including a green-glazed [[stoneware]] version, one of four versions exhibited together at the [[Musée Camille Claudel]] at [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] near Paris

==Sales==
Several examples have been sold at auction in recent years, with prices increasing considerably.
* There were two sales of bronze casts of the second version at [[Christie's]] in New York in 2000, with one sale at $204,000 and the other at $281,000
* A cast of the second version sold at Christie's in London in 2011 for £724,450, one at Sotheby's in New York in May 2013 for $1.865 million, and one in Paris in 2014 for €829,500
* The only known cast of the first version was sold at Sotheby's in London in June 2013, for £5,122,500
* A small cast, described as a ''petit modèle'' of the second version, was sold at Sotheby's in New York in November 2013 for $869,000

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7874">'''Theatre Pro Rata''' is a small, professional theatre company operating in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], United States.  The company's name is derived from the term [[pro rata]], which comes from the Latin for "in proportion."  Their mission:  To each of us: a foundation in the play, a pursuit of creative excellence, and a continuation of curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreprorata.org Theatre Pro Rata website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 2000 under the artistic direction of '''Carin Bratlie''', the company gained local notoriety with ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' as part of the 2002 Minnesota Fringe Festival. Shortly thereafter, Theatre Pro Rata began to produce regular seasons and has taken up residence at the [[Gremlin Theatre]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].

In 2008, ''Metamorphoses'' was named one of the top ten productions of the year by ''[[Lavender Magazine]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=John Townsend | title=2008 Theater Year in Review | work=Lavender Magazine |url=http://www.lavendermagazine.com/archives/issue-354/2008-theater-year-in-review/ |  year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the set design for ''Killer Joe'' named among the best of 2008 by ''[[City Pages]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Quinton Skinner | title=The Year's Best Set Designs | work=City Pages |url=http://www.citypages.com/2008-12-24/arts/the-year-s-best-set-designs/ |  year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, Theatre Pro Rata produced [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]]'s translation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Life of Galileo]]'', coinciding with the [[International Year of Astronomy]] and featuring a gender-blind cast led by Noë Tallen in the title role.

Beginning in 2015 with their production of The Illusion by Tony Kushner, Theatre Pro Rata will perform one show of each season at Park Square Theatre's new Andy Boss Thrust Stage as part of a theatrical collaboration between the two companies.

'''Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre''' (18 November 1901 – 30 October 1990), referred to as '''V. Shantaram or Shantaram Bapu''', was a Marathi Indian [[Filmmaking|filmmaker]], [[film producer]] and actor.&lt;ref name="Tilak2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tilak, Shrinivas |title=Understanding Karma: In Light of Paul Ricoeur's Philosophical Anthropology and Hemeneutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1xXDHLlNYIC&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=19 June 2012|year=2006|publisher=International Centre for Cultural Studies|isbn=978-81-87420-20-0|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is most known for films such as ''[[Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani]]'' (1946), ''[[Amar Bhoopali]]'' (1951), ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'' (1955), ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]]'' (1957), ''[[Navrang]]'' (1959), ''[[Duniya Na Mane]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]]'' (1972), ''Chani'', ''Iye Marathiche Nagari'' and ''Zunj''.

==Career==
V. Shantaram started his film career doing odd jobs in Maharashtra Film Co. owned by [[Baburao Painter]] at [[Kolhapur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaplaza.com/Promo/vshantaram/page2.shtml Biography – The V. Shantaram Centennial Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902234856/http://www.indiaplaza.com/Promo/vshantaram/page2.shtml |date=2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to debut as an actor in the silent film ''Surekha Haran'' in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/old/20001208/falis.htm Remembering the Pioneer] screenindia. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923154918/http://www.screenindia.com/old/20001208/falis.htm |date=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shantaram, fondly known as Annasaheb, had an illustrious career as a filmmaker for almost six decades. He was one of the early filmmakers to realize the efficacy of the film medium as an instrument of social change and used it successfully to advocate humanism on one hand and expose bigotry and injustice on the other. V. Shantaram had a very keen interest in music. It is said that he "ghost wrote" music for many of his music directors, and took a very active part in the creation of music. Some of his songs had to rehearsed several times before they were approved by V. Shantaram.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Narwekar|first=Kiran Shantaram with Sanjit|title=V. Shantaram, the legacy of the Royal Lotus|year=2003|publisher=Rupa &amp; Co.|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-291-0218-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed his roles so well that [[Rajesh Khanna]] also has appreciated him for his performance.

He directed his first film ''[[Netaji Palkar (film)|Netaji Palkar]]'', in 1927.&lt;ref name="Lal2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lal, S. |title=50 Magnificent Indians Of The 20Th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkI1_n4QAxMC&amp;pg=PT274|accessdate=20 February 2015|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7992-698-7|pages=274–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, he founded the [[Prabhat Film Company]] along with [[Vishnupant Damle]], K.R. Dhaiber, S. Fatelal and S.B. Kulkarni, which made ''[[Ayodhyecha Raja]]'', the first [[Marathi language]] film in 1932 under his direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/05/02/stories/2002050200380100.htm A navrang of Shantaram's films – Retrospective] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 2 May 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901060422/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/05/02/stories/2002050200380100.htm |date=1 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Prabhat co. in 1942 to form "[[Rajkamal Kalamandir]]" in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prabhatfilm.com/founders.htm Founders] ''[[Prabhat Film Company]] '' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903050113/http://www.prabhatfilm.com/founders.htm |date=3 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, "Rajkamal" became one of the most sophisticated studios of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2001/11/30/stories/2001113000910400.htm Well ahead of his times] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 30 November 2001. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201142316/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2001/11/30/stories/2001113000910400.htm |date=1 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was praised by [[Charlie Chaplin]] for his Marathi film ''[[Manoos]]''. Chaplin reportedly liked the film to a great extent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://in.movies.yahoo.com/news/charlie-chaplin-saluted-v-shantaram-140157157.html Charlie Chaplin saluted V. Shantaram].

Shantaram Motion Picture Scientific Research and Cultural Foundation, established in 1993, offers various awards to film-makers. The award is presented annually on 18 November.&lt;ref name=phalke/&gt; A postage stamp dedicated to Shantaram was released by [[India Post]] on 17 November 2001.

==Personal life==
Shantaram was born in 1901 at [[Kolhapur]] to a Marathi family with a Jain father and Hindu mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyden, John |title=The Routledge Companion to Religion and Film |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9OJLAZakI4C&amp;pg=PA148 |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-44853-6 |pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, aged 20, he married 12-year-old Vimalabai, a girl of his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian manner. Their marriage lasted their entire lives and its relationships of harmony and mutual support survived even his subsequent two marriages, which were concurrent with his first. Vimalabai bore four children, being son Prabhat Kumar (after whom Shantaram named [[Prabhat Film Company|his movie company]]) and daughters Saroj, Madhura and Charusheela. Shantaram's second daughter Madhura is the wife of [[Pandit Jasraj]] and mother of music director Shaarang Dev Pandit and of TV personality [[Durga Jasraj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/jai-ho-jasraj/article2254030.ece Jai ho! Jasraj]. ''The Hindu''. 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Shantaram's third daughter, Charusheela, is the mother of Hindi and Marathi actor Sushant Ray a.k.a. [[Siddharth Ray]].

On 22 October 1941, Shantaram (aged 40) married the actress Jayashree (née Kamulkar), with whom he had fallen in love while they worked together in several films, including ''Shakuntala'' (1942) which ran for 104 weeks in Mumbai. Jayashree became Shantaram's second wife, and was received with traditional ceremonies by his first wife Vimalabai. Until January 1957, it was perfectly legal (and in keeping with ancient custom) for Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, and it was typical for the wives to live harmoniously together in the same household. Jayashree bore Shantaram three children – one son, the Marathi film director and producer [[Kiran Shantaram]],&lt;ref name="Gavankar2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavankar, Nilu N. |title=The Desai Trio and the Movie Industry of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGAyEpXtK3UC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=26 July 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-9981-7|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 50 years of a Shantaram classic | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-years-of-a-Shantaram-classic/articleshow/2033356.cms |author=Mishra, Ambarish |date=28 September 2006| accessdate = 22 September 2014 | publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two daughters, [[Rajshree]] (the actress) and Tejashree. Shantaram's six children grew up playing and bonding with each other. The two wives also had a cordial relationship and often interacted with each other, although they maintained separate houses. Vimalabai was strongly bonded with Shantaram's extended family; she would be at her husband's side at all religious and family finctions that they attended, and she would be hostess whenever they themselves hosted such functions. On the other hand, Jayashree would accompany Shantaram to all events and functions connected with the film industry and the film profession and at any parties he hosted for the film fraternity.

In the early 1950s, Shantaram grew close to another of his leading ladies, the actress [[Sandhya Shantaram|Sandhya]] (née Vijaya Deshmukh), who was his co-star in many films like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'', ''Navrang'', ''[[Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli]]'' and ''Sehra''. Vimalabai did not have much contact with Shantaram's professional associates and took Sandhya in her stride, but the case was different with Jayashree, who came to regard Sandhya as an ambitious gold-digger who was using the middle-aged Shantaram for her own purposes, to become a successful actress at his expense and riding on his shoulders. Things came to a head during the making of ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' a film which Shantaram was producing and which featured him and Sandhya in the main roles. Shantaram ran short of money while making the film, and asked his wives to give him their jewellery so that he could mortgage the same and raise funds to get over the cash crunch. The jewellery would be redeemed and returned to the ladies after the movie was completed, he said. Vimalabai agreed without fuss and handed over her jewellery, but Jayashree did not, apparently because she suspected that the jewellery would end up in Sandhya's possession. This led to a misunderstanding between the couple. Later, Jayashree realized that money was indeed the problem and that in fact, even Sandhya had parted with her jewels in order to help Shantaram. When she came to know this, Jayashree felt bad that she was the only person to have retained her jewellery. On some minor occasion (a birthday), she tried to make amends by gifting some of her jewellery to Sandhya, so that the latter could have some jewels at least. However, Sandhya declined the gift by saying that she had lately stopped wearing jewellery. Jayashree took offence at the snub and the rift between the ladies grew. It became clear that they would not be able to live harmoniously together the way Vimalabai and Jayashree were living. It also became clear that there existed a widening rift between Jayashree and Shantaram also.

Finally, Shantaram and Jayashree were divorced on 13 November 1956. This was one of the earliest divorces to be granted in India, because it happened only weeks after parliament passed a law making it possible for Hindus to get a divorce; previous to this, divorce had been literally impossible for Hindus. According to Shantaram's daughter by Vimalabai, neither Shantaram not Jayashree could ever forget each other in later life and both of them deeply regretted that the parting of ways.

Hardly a month after the divorce, on 22 December 1956, Shantaram married Sandhya. This marriage was also legally valid because the law which forbade bigamy for Hindu men would come into effect only on 1 January 1957; it was therefore one of the last bigamous marriages to be conducted among Hindus in India. Sandhya had met Vimalabai many times before her wedding, and when the wedding was being finalized, she told Vimalabai that she would only marry Shantaram if Vimalabai not only gave her willing consent but also permitted her to stay in the same house with her. Touched by Sandhya's humility, goodness and traditional values, Vimalabai wholeheartedly gave her consent. She performed the traditional ceremonies and received her new co-wife into her household. The two ladies lived together harmoniously in the same house not just during Shantaram's lifetime but even after his death. Vimalabai and Sandhya enjoyed a close and cordial relationship with each other, which was enhanced because of the large age difference between them, because of their common values of ''pativratha sanskar,'' and also because it was known from the beginning that Sandhya would never bear children. This was because Shantaram had undergone an operation after the birth of Jayashree's third child, which left him incapable of begetting further progeny. Sandhya had been informed of this fact and had accepted it knowingly, which earned her great respect in her new home and put to rest all the speculation about her being a gold-digger. She would often say in Marathi “Hey sagle majhe mula aahet (all these are my kids)" indicating Shantaram's seven children. Sandhya treated Vimalabai with great respect at all times, and Vimalabai looked upon Sandhya with deep affection. In the professional field, Sandhya worked exclusively with her husband and refused all film offers made by other film-makers. She starred in some of Shantaram's biggest hits like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Navrang]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje]]'' and ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]].''

Shantaram died on 30 October 1990 in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/14188 Biography] American Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by all three of his wives. Even his second wife Jayashree, who was divorced from him, attended his funeral rites, participated in the rituals, and took to wearing the garb of a widow thereafter, thus indicating that the piece of legal paper which constituted their divorce was only a paper. Vimalabai and Sandhya continued to reside together in one house along with Vimalabai's son Prabhat and his wife and children. Vimalabai, passed away in 1996 after being bedridden for four years. Sandhya lives today in the care and company of Vimalabai's children, especially of Prabhat and his family.

Shantaram used to live at [[Panhala]] near [[Kolhapur]] in [[Maharashtra]] state. His daughter Saroj has maintained his house and has converted it into a hotel named Valley View.
