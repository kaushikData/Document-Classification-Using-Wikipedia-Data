[[File:Accurate News and Information Act clean2.png|thumb|right|alt=A scanned sheet of paper including the text of the first page of the Accurate News and Information Act|The ''Accurate News and Information Act'', including a note about the Lieutenant-Governor's [[reservation and disallowance|reservation]]]]

The '''''Accurate News and Information Act''''' was a statute passed by the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], [[Canada]], in 1937, at the instigation of [[William Aberhart]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government. It would have required newspapers to print "clarifications" of stories that a committee of Social Credit legislators deemed inaccurate, and to reveal their sources on demand.

The act was a result of the stormy relationship between Aberhart and the press, which dated to before the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 election]], in which the Social Credit League was elected to government. Virtually all of Alberta's newspapers—especially the ''[[Calgary Herald]]''—were critical of Social Credit, as were a number of publications from elsewhere in Canada. Even the American media had greeted Aberhart's election with derision.

Though the act won easy passage through the Social Credit-dominated legislature, [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta]] [[John C. Bowen]] [[disallowance and reservation|reserved]] [[royal assent]] until the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's ''[[Reference re Alberta Statutes]]'', the court found that it was unconstitutional, and it never became law.

==Aberhart and the press==

===Before the 1935 election===

[[William Aberhart]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit League]], running candidates for the first time, won a large majority in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 Alberta election]] on the strength of promises to use a new economic theory called [[Social Credit|social credit]] to end [[Great Depression in Canada|depression]] conditions in the province. It did so against the almost uniform opposition of the news media. Some of the province's major newspapers were loyal to one of the traditional parties: the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'', for example, had supported the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]] since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;Barr 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberhart initially laid out his economic agenda in only vague terms, and by early 1935 his opponents, including Premier [[Richard Gavin Reid]] of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], were trying to force him to commit to a specific plan. The ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' took up this call, going so far as to offer Aberhart a full page to lay out his approach in detail. Aberhart refused, on the grounds that he considered the ''Herald'''s coverage of him to be unfair.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 172&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently attacked the newspaper in speeches around the province,&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 174&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 28 suggested that his followers boycott it and other unfriendly newspapers. The boycott was successful to the extent that it drove at least one newspaper out of business.&lt;ref name="Elliott 182"&gt;Elliott 182&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Herald'' responded to the boycott by asking "Is everyone opposed to the political opinions and plans of Mr. Aberhart to be boycotted?  He has invoked a most dangerous precedent and has given the people of this province a foretaste of the Hitlerism which will prevail if he ever secures control of the provincial administration."&lt;ref name="Elliott 182"/&gt;

Shortly before the election, the ''Herald'' began to run cartoons by [[Stewart Cameron]], a virulently anti-Aberhart cartoonist. The day before the election, it ran one featuring a car, labelled "the people", travelling along "Aberhart Highway No. 1" and arriving at a railway crossing. A train, labelled "common sense", was approaching from around the bend, along tracks labelled "fundamental facts". Aberhart leans out the "S.C. Signal Tower" advising the car "All's clear. Don't stop, look or listen."&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the ''Herald'' was the most strident in its opposition to Aberhart and Social Credit, the ''Bulletin'', the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', the ''[[Medicine Hat News]]'', the ''[[Lethbridge Herald]]'', and many smaller papers all, in the words of [[Athabasca University]] historian Alvin Finkel, "attacked Social Credit viciously as a chimera which, if placed in power, would wreck Alberta's chances for economic recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Finkel 36&lt;/ref&gt; Of the province's major papers, only the ''Calgary Albertan'' provided even lukewarm support.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne 101&lt;/ref&gt;

So frustrated were the Social Crediters&lt;!-- In this context, "Crediter" is the correct spelling. --&gt; with the newspapers' hostility that in 1934 they founded their own, the ''Alberta Social Credit Chronicle'', to spread their views.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicle'', in addition to acting as Aberhart's mouthpiece, carried guest editorials by such figures as British [[fascism|fascist]] leader [[Oswald Mosley]] and [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] priest [[Charles Coughlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-election===

Media reaction to Social Credit's 1935 victory, in which it won 56 of 63 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], was almost uniformly negative. The ''Herald'' opined that "the people of Alberta have made a most unfortunate decision and may soon see the folly of it."&lt;ref&gt;Brennan 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Even the ''Albertan'' expressed its wish that social credit be first tried in "Scotland, or Ethiopia or anywhere but Alberta."&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 203&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction across Canada was also negative; the ''[[St. Catharines Standard]]'' called the results "a nightmare that passeth all understanding" and the ''[[Montreal Star]]'' accused Albertans of voting for "an untried man and a policy whose workings he ostentatiously refused to explain before polling day."&lt;ref name="Elliott 202"&gt;Elliott 202&lt;/ref&gt; American newspapers were less restrained: the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' asked "Greetings to the Canadians. Who's loony now?" and the ''[[Boston Herald]]'''s headline screamed "Alberta goes crazy".&lt;ref name="Elliott 202"/&gt;

The relationship did not improve once Aberhart took office. In January 1935, H. Napier Moore wrote two articles for ''[[Maclean's]]'' casting doubt on Aberhart's honesty and his ability to follow through on his election promises. The American ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' ran a profile that mocked Aberhart's appearance, taking note of his "vast colorless face" and his "narrow, left slanted mouth with soft, extra-heavy, bloodless lips which don't quite meet and through which he breathes wetly."&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 230–231&lt;/ref&gt; Finkel, finding fault with both sides of the Aberhart-press feud, states
&lt;blockquote&gt;The major newspapers of the province opposed virtually everything the government did.  Virtually every reform instituted was made to sound more draconian than it actually was. The conservative views of the owners and editors often interfered with the objective presentation of news reports, although perhaps not to the extent that the government claimed. In many cases, the papers simply concentrated on the very real chaos and confusion in government ranks and required few embellishments to make the government look bad.&lt;ref name="Finkel 62"&gt;Finkel 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Herald'' lured Stewart Cameron away from working on [[Walt Disney|Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to make him its first ever staff cartoonist; Cameron devoted himself full-time to the ridicule of Aberhart.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 240&lt;/ref&gt; Though Social Credit staffer turned journalistic historian John Barr argues that the media's unswerving hostility to Aberhart may have benefited him politically by allowing him to "depict the press as a mere tool of Eastern financial and commercial interests", by January 1936 Aberhart was telling the listeners of his weekly gospel radio show that he was "glad there will be no newspapers in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 230&lt;/ref&gt;

To help combat the negative press, Aberhart resolved to gain control of the ''Albertan'', the one paper of note to show him any support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a [[gospel]] program to promote stock sales.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 232&lt;/ref&gt; The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 247&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the ''Albertan'' became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.&lt;ref name="Finkel 62"/&gt;

Aberhart reacted bitterly to the media's hostility. In a September 20, 1937, radio broadcast, he said of the press "these creatures with mental hydrophobia will be taken in hand and their biting and barking will cease."&lt;ref&gt;Barr 108&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, a special session of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] opened, with the ''Accurate News and Information Act'' figuring prominently on its [[order paper]].&lt;ref&gt;Barr 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==

The [[1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt]] had forced Aberhart to abdicate a portion of his power to the newly created [[Social Credit Board]], which consisted of five Social Credit backbenchers charged with supervising a commission of experts. While the initial plan was to have this commission headed by [[C. H. Douglas]], social credit's British founder, Douglas did not like Aberhart and did not view his approach to social credit as consistent with its true form. He refused to come. Instead, he sent two subordinates, L. D. Byrne and G. F. Powell. These surrogates were charged with recommending legislation to implement social credit in Alberta. Their first round of proposals, which included measures imposing government control on banks and prohibiting any person from challenging the constitutionality of any Alberta law in court without receiving the approval of the [[Lieutenant-Governor in Council]], was [[disallowance and reservation|disallowed]] by the federal government. The second round included the ''Accurate News and Information Act''.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;

The act empowered the chair of the Social Credit Board to require a newspaper to reveal the names and addresses of its sources, as well as the names and addresses of any writers, including of unsigned pieces. Non-compliance would result in fines of up to $1,000 per day, and prohibitions on the publishing of the offending newspaper, of stories by offending writers, or of information emanating from offending sources. The act also required newspapers to print, at the instruction of the chair of the Social Credit Board, any statement "which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the Government of the Province."&lt;ref name="Elliott 272"&gt;Elliott 272&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was attacked by opposition politicians as evidence of the government's supposed fascism, and alienated even the ''Albertan''.&lt;ref name="Elliott 273"&gt;Elliott 273&lt;/ref&gt; The international press was also cutting: one British paper referred to Aberhart as "a little Hitler".&lt;ref name="Barr 109"&gt;Barr 109&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentators have been no more favourable: Finkel calls the act evidence of the "increasingly authoritarian nature of the Aberhart regime",&lt;ref name="Finkel 62"/&gt; and even Barr, generally sympathetic to Social Credit, calls it "a harsh blow to free speech".&lt;ref name="Barr 109"/&gt;

[[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[John C. Bowen]], mindful of the federal government's disallowance of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, [[disallowance and reservation|reserved]] [[royal assent]] of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested at the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. This was the first use of the power of reservation in Alberta history,&lt;ref name="Elliott 273"/&gt; and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's [[Government House (Alberta)|official residence]], his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and [[Ernest Manning]] biographer [[Brian Brennan (author)|Brian Brennan]] attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.&lt;ref name="Elliott 278"&gt;Elliott 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Bowen put a stop to the ''Accurate News and Information Act'', at least temporarily, but Aberhart's fight against the press continued: on March 25, 1938, a resolution of the Social Credit-dominated legislature ordered that Don Brown, a reporter for the ''Edmonton Journal'', be jailed "during the pleasure of the assembly" for allegedly misquoting Social Credit backbencher [[John Lyle Robinson]] on the inclusion of [[chiropractors]] in the ''Workman's Compensation Act''. Brown was never actually jailed; the next day, in response to negative publicity from across Canada, the legislature passed another resolution, ordering "the release of Mr. Don C. Brown from custody."  In Barr's view, "the government was made to look less ominous than silly."&lt;ref&gt;Barr 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, the Supreme Court ruled on the ''[[Reference re Alberta Statutes]]''. It found that the ''Accurate News and Information Act'', along with the others submitted to it for evaluation, was ''[[ultra vires]]'' (beyond the powers of) the Alberta government.&lt;ref&gt;Barr 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the ''Accurate News and Information Act'', the court found that the [[Canadian constitution]] included an "[[implied bill of rights]]" that protected freedom of speech as being critical to a parliamentary democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Morton 481–482&lt;/ref&gt;

For its leadership in the fight against the act, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] committee awarded the ''Edmonton Journal'' a bronze plaque, the first time it honoured a non-American newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne 125&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-five other newspapers, including the ''Calgary Albertan'', ''Edmonton Bulletin'', ''Calgary Herald'', ''Lethbridge Herald'', and ''Medicine Hat News'', were presented with engraved certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albertasource.ca/lawcases/constitutional/premierconstitution/premierconstitution_significance.htm |title=The Premier vs. the Constitution—Significance |work=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Heritage Community Foundation |accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014''' (c. 12) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that consolidated and expanded [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|law enforcement powers]] in addressing [[Anti-social behaviour#In the UK|anti-social behaviour]]. One significant aspect of The Act is that it replaced [[anti-social behaviour order]]s, the primary [[civil law (common law)|civil]] order in the United Kingdom since 1998, with [[criminal behaviour order]]s. [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] and [[John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Holbeach]] introduced the legislation.

== Background ==
In 2012, the government produced a [[white paper]] titled ‘Putting victims first: more effective responses to anti-social behaviour’, that outlined its intentions about reforming anti-social behaviour legislation. The white paper stated that it wanted to challenge ‘''dangerous and yobbish behaviour of those who make victims’ lives a misery''’.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228863/8367.pdf|title=Putting Victims  First: More Effective Responses to Anti-Social Behaviour. Command Paper 8367|last=Home Office|first=|date=2012|website=GOV.UK|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013 government paper, ‘Reform of Anti-Social Behaviour Powers: Groups ‘Hanging Around’’ mentioned specifically targeting certain types of youths behaviour. It mentioned that the Government acknowledged that youths ‘hanging about’ might cause people to feel intimidated and fear for their safety regardless if their behaviour was anti-social.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/248750/01_GROUPS_HANGING_AROUND_WEB.PDF|title=Reform of Anti-social Behaviour Powers Groups 'Hanging Around'|last=Home Office|first=|date=2013|website=GOV.UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Government publications also revealed it was eager to deal with concerns about the perceived anti-social behaviour of people who are [[drunks]],  [[beggars]], and irresponsible dog owners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/364851/Public_and_open_spaces_information_note.pdf|title=Reform of Anti-social Behaviour Powers:Public and Open Spaces|last=Home Office|first=|date=2013|website=GOV.UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Putting Victims First ==
The focus for the Act was on putting victims first, and the powers are designed to be quicker to implement so that victims get respite from anti-social behaviour faster.  With the exception of the Criminal Behaviour Order, the remainder can be processed through the civil courts which allows for a lower [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] and thus makes it easier for agencies to obtain.  The Act also set out an absolute possession enabling Councils and Housing Association to evict anti-social tenants already found guilty of anti-social behaviour.

To put victims first, there were also two measures introduced in this Act to enable victims to have their say:

# Community Remedy - whereby victims can have a say in what type of punishment would be appropriate for the offender (e.g. clean up graffiti)
# Anti-Social Behaviour Case Review - also called Community Trigger.  A victim can insist on a multi-agency review of their case if they have reported the problem 3 times in the past 6 months and yet the problem has not yet been resolved.

== Consolidation ==
The focus of the Act was to streamline the tools and powers available to front-line agencies in dealing with anti-social behaviour. Previously there had been nineteen different powers, but these were reduced to a base of six.

The previous sixteen mechanisms were,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Anti-social behaviour injunction
* [[Anti-social behaviour order]]s (ASBOs)
* Closure order (known as S.161)
* Crackhouse closure order
* Criminal anti-social behaviour orders (CrASBOs)
* [[Designated public place order]]
* Direction to leave order (known as S.27)
* Disposal order (known as S.30)
* Dog control order
* Drinking banning order
* Drinking banning order (on conviction)
* Gating order
* Graffiti / defacement removal notice
* Individual support order
* Intervention order
* Litter cleaning notice
* Noisy premises closure order
* Premises closure order
* Street litter cleaning notice

Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 consolidated them to,
* Civil injunctions
* [[Criminal behaviour order]]s
* Dispersal powers
* Community protection notices and remedial orders
* [[Public space protection order]]s
* Closure notices and orders
* Absolute grounds for possession

The government produces statutory guidance about the use of the six new mechanisms. December 2017 is the latest revision of the guidance {{as of|May 2018|lc=yes}}.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/679712/2017-12-13_ASB_Revised_Statutory_Guidance_V2.1_Final.pdf|title=Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014:Anti-social behaviour powers Statutory guidance for frontline professionals|last=Home Office|first=|date=2017|website=GOV.UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil injunction ==
Part 1 of the Act empowers specified organisation to apply to the courts for a civil injunction aged 10 or over for actual or threatened anti-social behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973732993|title=Police law|last=Richard,|first=Card,|others=English, J. (Jack),|isbn=9780198786801|edition=Fifteenth|location=Oxford|oclc=973732993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested by the government is that civil injunctions might be used for aggressive begging, [[bullying]], [[gang]]s, irresponsible dog ownership, noisy or abusive neighbours, public drunkenness, and [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The injunction is a civil rather than a criminal order. A civil injunction can either prohibit or require a person from activities mentioned in the order. A court has the discretion if to include a power of arrest for breaches of the injunction. Breaches of an injunction are treated as [[Contempt of Court Act 1981|contempt of court]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Statutory government guidance provides four tests for using a civil injunction. On the balance of probabilities, the behaviour must be likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress (non-housing related anti-social behaviour); or conduct capable of causing nuisance or annoyance (housing-related anti-social behaviour); and just and convenient to grant the injunction to prevent anti-social behaviour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Criminal behaviour orders ==
{{See|Criminal behaviour order}}

== Dispersal Powers ==
Part 3 of the Act covers police powers permitting the dispersal of people. The powers of dispersal require the authorisation of a police officer at least the rank of Inspector. The Act only allows authorising dispersal powers when members of the Public in the locality are being harassed, alarmed or distressed, or when there is localised crime and disorder.  The authorisation is limited to forty-eight hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Authorising officers should consider the principles of the Human Rights Act.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The statutory Government guidance requires consideration of the impact of vulnerable people, the displacement of the problems elsewhere, and if working in partnership with other agencies might provide a longer-term solution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When authorised to do so, police officers and [[police community support officer]]s,  if permitted by their Chief Constable, can, in writing when feasible, direct a person to leave a geographical area and not return for a defined time period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The exceptions are people under ten years old,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in which case if they are under sixteen,  [[Children Act 2004|the Children Act 2004]], allows taking them to their home.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A direction should not be given that prevents a person from going to their home, their place of employment, where they are receiving education or training, places where they are receiving medical treatment or any place they are required to attend by a court. The power exists to seize any articles that connected to the anti-social behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Failing to disperse or preventing the seizure of articles related to the anti-social behaviour is a criminal offence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Public space protection orders ==
{{see|Public space protection order}}

== Community Protection Notices, and Remedial Orders ==
Part 4 of the Act introduced Community Protection Notices and Remedial Orders. The aim of them was to challenge ongoing nuisance problems detrimental to a community’s quality of life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The use of Community Protection Notices does not interfere with the obligation of local authorities to issue abatement notices for statutory nuisances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A person over the age of sixteen, an organisation or business can be issued a Community Protection Notice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The statutory guidance states that the vulnerability of a person should additionally be considered before issuing a notice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before a notice is issued they must receive written notice warning them about the problem they are causing, and issuing a notice is an option being considered. It is issued by either giving it to a person, organisation or business, leaving at their address, or posting it to them. Community Protection Notices have three potential purposes, to stop or make them do something, or take reasonable steps towards an outcome. What is expected of them is written on the notice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Failing to conform to a Community Protection Notice is an offence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The liability of a person, organisation or business for the offence is negated by payment of a [[fixed penalty notice]] up to the value of £100.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If a Community Protection Notice is breached, a Remedial Order can be applied for at court.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Closure Notices and Orders ==
Part 4 of the Act empowers the issuing of Closure Notices and Closure Orders. Both notices and orders can be applied to residential and other premises. Issuing a Closure Notice is usually the first resort to dealing with a problem. Closure Notices can be issued if either nuisance or disorder has, or may occur at the premises. The Notice is in force for a maximum of forty-eight hours. A Closure Notice can bar any person from accessing the premises, except any residents. The penalty for breaching a Notice upon conviction is a maximum of three months’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Closure Orders are usually issued in more serious instances. The criteria for issuing an order is that the premises must be connected to disorderly, offensive, or criminal behaviour, or disorderly behaviour in the near vicinity of it. It must be a serious nuisance to the public. An order can prohibit any person from entering the premises, including a resident. The maximum penalty for breaching a notice is up to six months imprisonment and an unlimited fine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 created an offence of obstructing a person issuing an order or notice, officials entering the premises, or people securing it. The maximum penalty is three months imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Act did no consolidate all closure powers, for example, closure of licensed premises under the [[Licensing Act 2003]], or certain premises used for [[Prostitution in the United Kingdom|prostitution]], under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Additional Offences ==

#

The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 included several provisions not related to anti-social behaviour,

* Dangerous dogs
* Firearms
* Protection from sexual harm, including Sexual Risk Orders
* Child sexual exploitation in hotels
* Violent offending
* Forced Marriages
* Policing, including the [[College of Policing|National College of Policing]], and complaints against the police
* Extradition
* Criminal Justice and Court fees

== Sexual Risk Orders ==
The Act also created Sexual Risk Orders, which can require suspects to give police advanced notification of intention to engage in sexual activities or face prison sentences. The SROs, requested by police, are issued by magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=22 January 2016|title=Man ordered to tell police if he plans to have sex|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-35385227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forced marriage ==
The Act also created several new offences relating to [[forced marriage]]:
* breaching a forced marriage protection order (amendment to the [[Family Law Act 1996]])
* causing a forced marriage, i.e. using threats, violence or other coercion (not necessarily against the victim) to cause a person to marry without their full and free consent (or any person who lacks capacity to consent even without coercion)
* using deception to cause a person to leave the UK to enter into a forced marriage.
The latter two offences are defined separately for England and Wales and for Scotland. They apply to any marriage ceremony even if not legally binding.

== Criticisms of the Act ==
A general criticism of the Act was it interfered with the rights of young people, made them feel unable to use public places as they wish, even if their behaviour and activities are lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnstone|first=C|date=2016|title=After the ASBO: Extending Control Over Young People's Use of Public Spaces in England and Wales|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0261018316651943|journal=Critical Social Policy|volume=36 |issue=4|pages=716–726|subscription=yes|via=Sage Journals|doi=10.1177/0261018316651943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances''' is a [[multilateral treaty]] which regulates [[copyright]] for [[Audiovisual art|audiovisual performances]] and expands the [[performers' rights]]. It was adopted on 26 June 2012 by the Diplomatic Conference on the Protection of Audiovisual Performances of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], in which 156 WIPO member states, six [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]], and six [[non-governmental organizations]] participated. Forty-eight countries signed the treaty on 26 June, followed by 19 other countries in 2012 and 2013. 20 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty.&lt;ref name="WIPO-Administered Treaties"/&gt; The treaty will not enter into force until it has been ratified or acceded to by at least 30 parties.

The treaty has been praised by artists' and performers rights advocates around the world as well as some activist nonprofits such as [[Knowledge Ecology International]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Knowledge Ecology International]]&lt;/ref&gt; but has also been criticized by some [[digital rights]] and [[free culture movement|free culture]] activists such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) as an infringement on [[free speech]], and aiding [[censorship]] schemes.

==Adoption==
Negotiations for the treaty lasted 12 years. It was adopted on 26 June 2012 by WIPO's Diplomatic Conference on the Protection of Audiovisual Performances, which began on 20 June in [[Beijing]]. 156 WIPO member states, six intergovernmental and six non-governmental organizations participated in the conference.&lt;ref name=WIPO/&gt;

The Final Act of the treaty was signed by 122 countries, and the treaty itself collected 48 country signatures.&lt;ref name=WIPO/&gt; Signatories from Europe include [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Moldova]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]]; from Americas, [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Grenada]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States of America]]; and from Asia, [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="WIPO-Administered Treaties"/&gt; The convention remained open for signature for one year. During that time, 19 additional countries and the European Union joined as signatories ([[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Botswana]], [[Czech Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Estonia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Indonesia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Poland]], [[Qatar]], [[Romania]], [[Slovenia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Zimbabwe]]). Further countries may become a party to the treaty through accession. The treaty has not entered into force until it has been ratified by at least 30 eligible parties.&lt;ref name=WIPO/&gt;

In February 2016, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] submitted the treaty to the [[U.S. Senate]] for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message to the Senate—The Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/10/message-senate-beijing-treaty-audiovisual-performances |website=The White House |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |accessdate=February 11, 2016 |date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The treaty is a multilateral treaty which regulates copyright for [[audiovisual performance]]s.&lt;ref name="WIPO"/&gt;

According to WIPO "the new treaty brings audiovisual performers into the fold of the international copyright framework in a comprehensive way, for the first time", referring to the clauses dedicated to protecting their works on the Internet.&lt;ref name=WIPO/&gt; It addresses the issue of the copyright system discriminating against certain groups of performers, as the previous treaties, such as [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], focused more on the sound than visual aspects.&lt;ref name="wipo"/&gt; WIPO states that the treaty boosts the [[economic rights]] and [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of audiovisual performers (the [[performers' rights]]). The expanded economic rights give them an opportunity to share the income collected by producers from internationally distributed audiovisual works. The moral rights address issues such as lack of attribution and distortion.&lt;ref name=WIPO/&gt;

==Praise==
The treaty has been praised by a number of audiovisual performers. Publicity was provided by the presence and support from several world-famous actors, namely American [[Meryl Streep]], Brazilian [[Sônia Braga]], Chinese [[Mei Baojiu]] and Spanish [[Javier Bardem]] and [[Antonio Banderas]], who spoke out on several instances endorsing the treaty.&lt;ref name=WIPO/&gt; Government representatives from China, EU, and the United States  also supported the initiative.&lt;ref name=WIPO/&gt;&lt;ref name=ip/&gt; Organizations supporting the treaty include the [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]].&lt;ref name=ip/&gt;

==Criticism==
The treaty has been criticized by [[digital rights]] and [[free culture movement|free culture]] scholars and activists, for giving the actors a [[monopoly]] on deciding how their audiovisual performances can be used. The performers in question no longer have to hold the copyright to their work for that purpose critics claim, it is possible that the new treaty would make it increasingly illegal to use clips from movies, TV series, and other such preferences in [[Mashup (video)|mash-up]]s, [[remixes]], and parodies.&lt;ref name=techdirt/&gt; There are fears that this would allow actors and musicians (who are also covered by the treaty) to shut down any such parody or commentary not to their liking, thus infringing on [[free speech]] and limiting [[fair use]] and similar reuse rights.&lt;ref name=techdirt/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff/&gt; Professor Hannibal Travis noted that the treaty makes it easier to set up [[censorship]] schemes.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt; [[Techdirt]] has remarked that the treaty also allows for those new rights to be transferred to the producers, which can lead to a system where the performers are forced to do so, thus further strengthening the producers and organizations like [[RIAA]] and [[MPAA]].&lt;ref name=techdirt/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff/&gt;

The '''Bustamante Code''' (also known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as Código de Derecho Internacional Privado) is a treaty intended to establish common rules for [[Private International Law]] in the Americas. The common ideas of the treaty were developed by [[Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven]] and solidified during the 6th Pan American Congress held in [[Cuba]] in 1928 with the [[Treaty of Havana]] being attached as an Annex to the Bustamante Code.

The treaty was not widely accepted: the [[United States]] withdrew in the middle of negotiations, [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]] did not sign it, [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]] decided to abide by the rules of the [[First South American Congress of Private International Law|Treaties of Montevideo]] with regard to private international law, and the countries to ratify did so countries with large reservations. The treaty is a set of rules which seek to regulate the legal relations of foreign trade among the countries party to the treaty. The previously mentioned reservations cover many of the States discretion on the use of this code in cases which contradicted the country's domestic legislation, so the actual purpose of it are distorted.

'''United States Senate Bill S.3804''', known as the '''Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA)''' was a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced by Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) on September 20, 2010. It proposed amendments to Chapter 113 of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]] that would authorize the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] to bring an ''[[Jurisdiction in rem|in rem]]'' action against any [[domain name]] found "dedicated to infringing activities", as defined within the text of the bill. Upon bringing such an action, and obtaining an order for relief, the registrar of, or registry affiliated with, the infringing domain would be compelled to "suspend operation of and lock the domain name."&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-3804|title=S. 3804: Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was supported by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Viacom]], and the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes|International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States]].&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

It was opposed by organizations and individuals such as [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Demand Progress]], the Distributed Computing Industry Association,&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt; [[Tim Berners-Lee]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/11/coica-web-censorship-bill/ Web Censorship Bill Sails Through Senate Committee], Wired, November 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill passed the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] with a vote of 19-0 but never received a full vote on the Senate floor.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt; Senator [[Ron Wyden]] (D-OR) announced he would take the steps necessary to halt COICA so it is not enacted into law in 2010, and was successful, effectively killing this bill and requiring it to be resubmitted and for it to make it through a new committee again in 2011 with a different makeup of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/211162/senator_threatens_to_block_online_copyright_bill.html |title=Senator Threatens to Block Online Copyright Bill |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was rewritten as the [[Protect IP Act]].

==Scope==

===Definition of infringement===
The text of the bill defined an infringing website as one that is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(A) primarily designed, has no demonstrable, commercially significant purpose or use other than, or is marketed by its operator, or by a person acting in concert with the operator, to offer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) goods or services in violation of [[title 17, United States Code]], or enable or facilitate a violation of title 17, United States Code, including by offering or providing access to, without the authorization of the copyright owner or otherwise by operation of law, copies of, or public performance or display of, works protected by title 17, in complete or substantially complete form, by any means, including by means of download, transmission, or otherwise, including the provision of a link or aggregated links to other sites or Internet resources for obtaining such copies for accessing such performance or displays; or

(ii) to sell or distribute goods, services, or materials bearing a counterfeit mark, as that term is defined in section 34(d) of the Act entitled 'An Act to provide for the registration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain international conventions, and for other purposes', approved July 5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the '[[Trademark Act of 1946]]' or the 'Lanham Act'; {{usc|15|1116}}(d)); and
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(B) engaged in the activities described in subparagraph (A), and when taken together, such activities are central to the activity of the Internet site or sites accessed through a specific domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0:is:18|title=Read The Bill: S. 3804 - Sep 20, 2010|work=GovTrack.us|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Powers granted===
The bill, if passed, would have allowed the Attorney General to bring an ''[[Jurisdiction in rem|in rem]]'' action against the infringing domain name in [[United States District Court]], and seek an order requesting [[injunctive relief]]. If granted, such an order would compel the register of the domain name in question to take the following actions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Upon receipt of such order, the domain name registrar or domain name registry shall suspend operation of, and may lock, the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0:is:49|title=Read The Bill: S. 3804 - Sep 20, 2010|work=GovTrack.us|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nondomestic domains===
If the infringing website had not been located in the [[United States]], the bill empowered the Attorney General to bring a similar action in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]. Should an order for injunctive relief been granted, the Attorney General would then have been empowered to serve said order upon, and compel to perform the actions listed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0:is:52|title=Read The Bill: S. 3804 - Sep 20, 2010|work=GovTrack.us|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) a service provider, as that term is defined in section [[512(k)(1)]] of [[title 17]], United States Code, or other operator of a domain name system server shall take reasonable steps that will prevent a domain name from resolving to that domain name's Internet protocol address;

(ii) a financial transaction provider, as that term is defined in section 5362(4) of title 31, United States Code, shall take reasonable measures, as expeditiously as practical, to prevent--
&lt;blockquote&gt;

(I) its service from processing transactions for customers located within the United States based on purchases associated with the domain name; and

(II) its trademarks from being authorized for use on Internet sites associated with such domain name; and
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(iii) a service that serves contextual or display advertisements to Internet sites shall take reasonable measures, as expeditiously as practical, to prevent its network from serving advertisements to an Internet site accessed through such domain name.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Enforcement===
Should a party fail to comply with an order served upon it by the Attorney General, the Attorney General would have been able to bring an ''[[in personam]]'' action against the party in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0:is:60|title=Read The Bill: S. 3804 - Sep 20, 2010|work=GovTrack.us|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Department lists===
The bill also called for the creation, by the Justice Department, of two publicly available lists of domain names. The first list would have been composed of domain names against which the Attorney General has obtained injunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0:is:59|title=Read The Bill: S. 3804 - Sep 20, 2010|work=GovTrack.us|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic domains would be required to be locked by their registrars, and service providers, financial institutions, and advertisers would be required to block service to any nondomestic domains on this list. The second list would be a list of domains ''alleged'' by the Justice Department to be infringing, but against which no action had been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0:is:73|title=Read The Bill: S. 3804 - Sep 20, 2010|work=GovTrack.us|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any service provider who willingly took steps to block access to sites on this second list would gain immunity from prosecution under this bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0:is:58|title=Read The Bill: S. 3804 - Sep 20, 2010|work=GovTrack.us|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed amendment==

Due to various concerns from outside parties, Senator Patrick Leahy proposed an amendment to the legislation that responded to these concerns, while preserving the purpose of the legislation. The amendment:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101106004834/http://judiciary.senate.gov/legislation/upload/COICA-ManagersAmendment.pdf COICA Managers Amendment] judiciary.senate.gov, archived version of November 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9188780/Outcry_prompts_amendments_to_online_IP_protection_bill Outcry prompts amendments to online IP protection bill] By Jaikumar Vijayan, computerworld.com September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* Struck provisions that would have authorized the Justice Department to publish a listing of domain names that provided access to websites dedicated to infringing activities, but against which it did not to seek a court order under the Act, in response to concerns from Internet service providers (ISPs), online companies, and public interest groups.
* Eased the burden on ISPs and payment processors that are required to take action pursuant to this Act. The amendment specified that an ISP shall not be required to modify its network or facilities to comply with an order or take steps with respect to domain name lookups performed by others. In addition, the amendment requires only that ISPs and payment processors act as expeditiously as reasonable.
* Provided more explicit protection from legal liability for any third-party registrar, registry, ISP, payment processor or advertising network that takes action pursuant to this Act.
* Required the Attorney General to develop a process in consultation with other law enforcement agencies to coordinate related investigations.

==Public reaction==
Public reaction to the bill was negative by consumer groups, while the bill was generally lauded by artist's rights groups, various labor unions, and the entertainment and publishing industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/pages/who-supports-coica|title=Who Supports COICA|work=Global Intellectual Property Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the bill was rapidly followed by a wave of protest from digital rights activists, including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/censorship-internet-takes-center-stage-online|title=Censorship of the Internet Takes Center Stage in "Online Infringement" Bill|work=eff.org|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Demand Progress]]'s petition against COICA garnered more than 300,000 signatures.

On September 30, 2010, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] posted an update to their Deeplinks Blog, announcing that the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee had been delayed until after the [[United States congressional elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/victory-internet-censorship-bill-delayed|title=Victory: Internet Censorship Bill is Delayed, For Now &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Eff.org|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the bipartisan bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/internet/128208/senate-panel-approves-website-shut-down-bill|title=Senate panel approves website shut-down bill
|work=ITWorld.com|date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, 2010, the [[New York Times]] reported that the U.S. government had seized the domain names of 82 websites, which digital rights advocates used as an example of overreaching enforcement that can already occur under current law, which they believe will take place more frequently and on a broader basis under the more lenient enforcement requirements set by COICA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/27/technology/27torrent.html?_r=1 |title=U.S. Shuts Down Web Sites in Piracy Crackdown |newspaper= New York Times |date=November 26, 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/11/us-government-seizes-82-websites-draconian-future |title=U.S. Government Seizes 82 Websites: A Glimpse at the Draconian Future of Copyright Enforcement? |publisher=Eff.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate opposition===
Oregon Democratic Senator [[Ron Wyden]] opposed the bill after it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 18, 2010, saying that unless it is changed, he will prevent it from coming to a vote on the full Senate floor this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/83999/20101119/oregon-senator-opposes-bill-to-block-sites.htm|title=Oregon Senator Opposes Bill That Would Block Web Sites|author=Emspak, Jesse|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem, but it seems to me that COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/11/senator-web-censorship-bill-a-bunker-busting-cluster-bomb/ |title=Senator: Web Censorship Bill A ‘Bunker-Busting Cluster Bomb’ |publisher=Wired.com |date=2010-11-20 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Viridian Corporate Seal.png|thumb|Example of a corporate seal. Notice in this case, the word "seal" is also being used as visual pun; as an image of the [[Pinniped|marine animal of the same name]] is used on the device]]
A '''company seal''' (sometimes referred to as the '''corporate seal''' or '''common seal''') is an official [[seal (device)|seal]] used by a [[company (law)|company]].  Company seals were predominantly used by companies in [[common law]] jurisdictions, although in modern times, most countries have done away with the use of seals.

In the UK, a company may have a company seal under the provisions of Companies Act 2006 section 45. It may have further seals for other territories and for issuing securities. These seals have the additional legend of the territory or the word SECURITIES. A company may wish still to seal documents as a means of protection against forgery.

Traditionally, the seal was of some legal significance because the affixing of the seal signified that the document was the act and deed of the company, whereas when a document was merely signed by a director, then that was deemed to be an act carried out on behalf of the company by its agents, which was subject to applicable restrictions and limitations under the ordinary [[law of agency]].

Corporate seals are generally only used for two purposes by corporations today:
*Documents which need to be executed as [[deed]]s (as opposed to simple [[contracts]]), may be executed under the company's common seal
*Certain corporate documents, for example [[share certificate]]s are often issued under the company seal (and some countries required that share certificates be issued under the common seal). For example, in India a share certificate is given under the common seal of the company and each usage of common seal is documented in the statutory registry of the company.

Physically, seals used to be used to make an impression on melted wax on the relevant document, although modern seals will usually only leave an indentation or impression on the paper (although sometimes a red wafer is used to imitate old red wax seals, and to make the sealing show up better on photocopies).

The '''Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008''' ({{USStatute|110|229|122|754-876|2008|05|08|S|2739}}; '''CNRA''') was an [[act of Congress|act]] passed in the [[110th United States Congress]] and enacted on May 8, 2008.

==Legislative history==
The bill was introduced by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jeff Bingaman]] of [[New Mexico]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and the chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]], on March 10, 2008, as '''S. 2739'''. It was a "[[Bicameralism|bicameral]] and [[bipartisan]]" package of land and water [[federal lands]] bills considered as an [[omnibus bill]]. 
 
The bill was reported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 11. It passed the full Senate on April 10 on a 91-4 vote, with five Senators not voting. It passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 29 on a 291-117 vote, with 23 Representatives not voting. The bill passed the House under a motion to [[Suspension of the rules in the United States Congress|suspend the rules and pass]] (usually used for non-controversial legislation and requiring a [[Supermajority|two-thirds majority]] to pass). It was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on May 8, 2008.

The [[long title]] of the act is ''A bill to authorize certain programs and activities in the Department of the Interior, the Forest Service, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], to implement further the Act approving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, to amend the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, and for other purposes''.

==Provisions==
Title I is entitled "[[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] Authorizations":

*Sec. 101 creates the [[Wild Sky Wilderness]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], designating {{convert|106577|acre|km2}} of [[United States National Forest|national forest]] in the [[Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest]] as [[National Wilderness Preservation System|wilderness area]], the most-protected class of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] lands. The Senate has passed the legislation for the Wild Sky Wilderness three previous Congresses, but because legislation had previously failed to pass the House, it was not until the enactment of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act that the wilderness area was designated (S. 520 and H.R. 886). 
*Sec. 102 designates a {{convert|19.6|mi|km}} trail around [[Waldo Lake]] in [[Oregon|Oregon's]] [[Willamette National Forest]] in Oregon as the "Jim Weaver Loop Trail." [[Jim Weaver (Oregon politician)|Jim Weaver]] was the U.S. Representative of [[Oregon's 4th congressional district]] from 1975 to 1987 (H.R. 247).

Title II is entitled "[[Bureau of Land Management]] Authorizations":

*Sec. 201 authorizes the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), part of the [[United States Department of the Interior]], to designate the [[Piedras Blancas Light|Piedras Blancas Light Station]] in [[California]] (H.R. 276) an [[Outstanding Natural Area]]s within the BLM's [[National Landscape Conservation System]]
*Sec. 202 authorizes the BLM to designate the [[Jupiter Inlet Light]]house and surrounding federal lands in [[Florida]] as an Outstanding Natural Area within the National Landscape Conservation System (S. 1143 and H.R. 1922)
*Sec. 203 permit the [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] without [[consideration]] of approximately {{convert|51|acre|m2}} of BLM land by [[Clark County, Nevada]] to the Nevada Division of State Lands for use by the [[Nevada National Guard]] (S. 1608 and H.R. 815).

Title III is entitled "[[National Park Service]] Authorizations":

Subtitle A—Cooperative Agreements has only one section, Sec. 301, which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to "enter into cooperative agreements with State, local, or tribal governments, other Federal agencies, other public entities, educational institutions, private nonprofit organizations, or participating private landowners for the purpose of protecting natural resources of units of the [[National Park System]] through collaborative efforts on land inside and outside of National Park System units," and sets terms and conditions, limitations, and authorizes appropriations for such cooperative agreements. One of the terms is that cooperative agreements must provide clear and direct benefits to natural resources in units of the NPS such as the preservation of [[Riparian zone|riparian systems]], eradication of [[Invasive species|invasive]] [[Introduced species|exotic species]], and restoration of native wildlife habitat" (S. 241 and H.R. 658)

Subtitle B—Boundary Adjustments and Authorizations includes three sections:
*Sec. 311 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire no more than {{convert|110|acre|km2}} of land to be added to the [[Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site]] via willing sellers or donation (S. 488 and H.R. 1100)
*Sec. 312 adjusts the boundary of the [[Lowell National Historical Park]]  in order to include five parcels of land within the city of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] (S. 867 and H.R. 299)
*Sec. 313 adjust the boundary of the [[Minidoka Internment National Monument]] to include the [[Nidoto Nai Yoni Memorial]] in [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]] (S. 916 and H.R. 161)

The '''Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness''' is a 1961 United Nations [[multilateral treaty]] whereby sovereign states agree to reduce the incidence of [[statelessness]]. The Convention was originally intended as a Protocol to the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], while the 1954 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]] was adopted to cover [[statelessness|stateless persons]] who are not refugees and therefore not within the scope of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.&lt;ref&gt;van Waas, Laura Ellen. Laura [http://www.institutesi.org/Nationality_Matters.pdf Nationality Matters: Statelessness under International Law], p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statelessness prior to World War II==
While one case of statelessness was identified in the ''Protocol relating to a Certain Case of Statelessness'' at the [[League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930]] in [[The Hague]]: "In a State whose nationality is not conferred by the mere fact of birth in its territory, a person born in its territory of a mother possessing the nationality of that State and of a father without nationality or of unknown nationality shall have the nationality of the said State."  Over time, many signatories have adjusted their laws to ensure this rule remains true.  (For example, in [[Australian nationality law]], a child born in the country acquires citizenship if any parent is a citizen).  However, despite this, many cases remained ambiguous or uncovered primarily due to the fact that a person did not always receive the nationality of its parents, or was born in a certain place and not always provided citizenship of that state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b39520.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nansen International Office For Refugees]], an organization of the [[League of Nations]], was internationally in charge of refugees from war areas from 1930 to 1939. It received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1938. Their [[Nansen passports]], designed in 1922 by founder [[Fridtjof Nansen]], were internationally recognized identity cards first issued by the League of Nations to stateless refugees. In 1942 they were honored by governments in 52 countries and were the first [[refugee travel document]]s.

==Background to UN action addressing the problem of statelessness==
[[Image:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|right|The Room of the United Nations General Assembly where Resolution was passed in 1949 which inspired the adoption of the [[Convention Regarding the Status of Stateless Persons]] in 1954 and the completion of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]]

Migrations forced from political instability during [[World War II]] and its immediate aftermath highlighted the international dimensions of problems presented by unprecedented volumes of displaced persons including those rendered effectively stateless.

Dating from December 1948, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] at Article 15 affirms that:

* Everyone has the right to a nationality.
* No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.

At the Fourth [[UN General Assembly|United Nations General Assembly]] Session in October–December 1949, the [[International Law Commission]] included the topic "Nationality, ''including statelessness''" in its list of topics of international law provisionally selected for codification. At the behest of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) in its 11th Session soon after, that item was given priority.

The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was done on 28 July 1951. It was originally desired to cover 'refugees ''and'' stateless persons'; however, agreement was not reached with respect to the latter.

The International Law Commission at its fifth session in 1953 produced both a Draft Convention on the ''Elimination'' of Future Statelessness, and a Draft Convention on the ''Reduction'' of Future Statelessness. ECOSOC approved both drafts.

The 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons was done in September 1954 (''The Status Convention'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3bbb25729.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This completed the unfinished work of the Refugee Convention three years prior.

On 4 December 1954 the UN General Assembly by Resolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/096/31/IMG/NR009631.pdf?OpenElement Ods Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted both drafts as the basis of its desire for a conference of [[plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] and an eventual Convention.

==How the convention works to reduce statelessness==
In respect of contracting states:
* "Stateless birth" on their territory attracts the grant of their nationality (article 1). 
* Otherwise stateless persons may take the nationality of the place of their birth or of the place where they were found (in the case of a [[child abandonment|foundling]]), otherwise they may take the nationality of one of their parents (in each case possibly subject to a qualifying period of residence in that State) (article 2).
* A stateless person has some time beyond attaining adulthood to seek to claim the benefit of the Convention.  That time is always at least three years from the age of eighteen (article 1(5)).
* Transfer of territory between states must occur in a manner that avoids the occurrence of statelessness for persons residing in the territory transferred.  When a State acquires territory, the inhabitants of that territory presumptively acquire the nationality of that State (article 10).
* Persons otherwise stateless shall be able to take the nationality of one of their parents (possibly subject to a period of prior residence not more than three years) (article 4).
* Absent circumstances of fraudulent application or disloyalty toward the contracting state, deprivations and renunciations of [[citizenship]] shall only take effect where a person has or subsequently obtains another nationality in replacement (article 8).
* The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) will issue [[travel document]]s evidencing nationality to persons, otherwise stateless, having a claim of nationality under the convention.
* [[birth aboard aircraft and ships|Birth on a sea vessel or aircraft]] may attract the nationality of the flag of that vessel or craft (article 3).
* Disloyal or certain criminal conduct may limit an individual's ability to avail the benefit of the Convention (article 8). 
* The benefit of the Convention may be claimed by guardians on behalf of children (article 1(1)).
* States may impose a period of residence qualification for granting nationality to persons who may be otherwise stateless.  That period is a maximum five years immediately prior to application and maximum of ten years overall (article 1(2)).


==Substantive provisions of the convention==
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|right|United Nations Headquarters, New York. Site of the completion of the Statelessness Reduction Convention in 1961]]

: For the purpose of assigning nationality, a foundling shall be considered to have been born in the State where it was found and from parents of that State's nationality. That presumption may be displaced by proof to the contrary.
; Article 3
: For the purpose of determining the obligations of contracting states under this convention, birth on a ship or aircraft shall amount to birth in the territory of the State that gives its flag to that ship or aircraft.

'''Dead capital''' is an economic term related to property which is informally held that it is not legally recognized.  The uncertainty of ownership decreases the value of the asset&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCtSqtxYXD8 Economist Hernando de Soto Discusses the Informal Economy in Tunisia]&lt;/ref&gt; and/or the ability to lend or borrow against it.  These lost forms of value are dead capital.

The term ''dead capital'' was coined by Peruvian Economist [[Hernando de Soto Polar]].

De Soto estimates there is [[US$]] 9.3 trillion in dead capital globally. The US$ 9.3 trillion are assets owned by poor or middle-class people in emerging economies which cannot be realized due to poor policies, procedures or bureaucracy.

If these assets in the informal sector were recognized and brought into the mainstream, market economy, they could become the key to fostering development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepowerofthepoor.com/concepts/c6.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems associated with dead capital ==
Local political instability, [[corruption]], rational under investment.

== Economic impacts ==
The economic impacts of dead capital are immense, only well-connected people have the ability to use their capital, join it together with other assets and create surplus value for further investment. Only these people can get life, educational, medical or property and casualty insurance and thus shield themselves from any problems. Only they can obtain unsecured loans (or even secured loans) after presenting proper evidence of their  property claims. The legal morass that complicates the property system disables them from being connected to the world. This then leaves a massive shadow economy which although very wealthy, does not fully contribute to the economy and does not help its participants fully achieve their potential.&lt;ref&gt;http://futurecapitalkenya.blogspot.com/2010/02/economic-effects-of-dead-capital-future.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digitalcourage''' – known until November 2012 as '''FoeBuD''' (''Verein zur '''F'''örderung des '''ö'''ffentlichen '''b'''ewegten und '''u'''nbewegten '''D'''atenverkehrs'') – is a [[Germany|German]] privacy and digital rights organisation. Under the motif of preserving "a world worth living in the digital age",&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;[http://www.foebud.org/aboutus "über uns"] ("about us"), German page on the FoeBuD website&lt;/ref&gt; Digitalcourage campaigns for civil and human rights, consumer protection, privacy, freedom of information and related issues. The group has links with organisations such as the German Working Group against [[telecommunications data retention|Data Retention]] (''Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung'') and the [[Chaos Computer Club]], and it is a member of the umbrella organisation [[European Digital Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edri.org/about/members EDRi members], on the EDRi website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==

The group is known for organising the German [[Big Brother Awards (Germany)|Big Brother Awards]]. These negative awards recognise “companies, institutions and persons who act in a prominent and sustained way to invade people's privacy or leak (personal) data to third parties”. An annual award ceremony featuring “winners” in various categories is organised by Digitalcourage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigbrotherawards.de?set_language=en Big Brother Awards Germany] (much of the content, including award speeches, available in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

To highlight the privacy implications of bonus or [[loyalty program|customer “loyalty” cards]], the organisation issued the so-called “Privacy Card”. Its design mirrored the popular “Payback” card and it bore the number of a regular card registered in FoeBuD's name. Users collected bonus points on behalf of FoeBuD, sharing one and the same customer profile. After 2,000 of these cards were being used, Payback disabled FoeBuD's registration and card contract.

[[File:Stoprfid-logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the "Stop RFID" campaign]]
Since October 2003, Digitalcourage has been active on the issue of [[radio-frequency identification|RFID]] and founded a campaign called “StopRFID” to accompany the introduction of this technology from a critical perspective.

FoeBuD has organised or supported various complaints at the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]] against disputed laws, such as those on data rentention, a central database for employees’ wages, or [[Internet censorship|Internet blocking]].

FoeBuD was a co-founder of the German Working Group against [[telecommunications data retention|Data Retention]] and supports an annual demonstration focusing on security measures that restrict civil liberties, under the name “Freedom Not Fear”.

In response to the threat to anonymity posed by date retention, Digitalcourage is running a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] exit node on a rented server. The organisation also makes and sells the ''PrivacyDongle'', a USB pen drive that can be used to run ''Tor Browser'' as a portable app, i.e. without installing it under Windows or MacOS.
As part of the campaign against the now abandoned law to introduce Internet blocking ([[Zugangserschwerungsgesetz]]), which would have been implemented by [[Domain Name System|DNS]] [[DNS cache poisoning|poisoning]], Digitalcourage is operating a public “anti-censorship” [[name server|DNS server]] under the IP address 85.214.20.141. Due to high demand a second server of this kind has been operated since 26th April 2018 under the IP address 46.182.19.48.&lt;ref&gt;Digitalcourage: [https://digitalcourage.de/support/zensurfreier-dns-server Zensurfreier DNS-Server], published 23th September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier activities: mailbox systems ==

In 1987, a mailbox ([[bulletin board system|bulletin board]]) system named BIONIC was created and operated by FoeBuD members. Objectives were to run a mailbox without censorship and to deny unlimited rights to the system’s administrators, regulating conflicts through the community instead. BIONIC became the birthplace of several early mailbox networks. The mailbox and linked networks were an early “home on the net” for many groupings in the left or “alternative” political spectrum.

Eric Bachman, a BIONIC user and FoeBuD member, instigated the ''[[ZaMirNET|ZaMir Transnational Network]]'' in 1991 in response to the [[Yugoslav wars]], which were beginning at the time. ''Za mir'' means “for peace”, and the network served as a low-cost and simple link between peace groups in that region, as a form of [[nonviolent resistance]]. The BIONIC software proved useful under the limited resources available; e.g. in [[Sarajevo]], 1,500 users were served using just 3 telephone lines. Other mailboxes existed in [[Ljubljana]] ([[Slovenia]]), [[Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]), [[Belgrade]] ([[Serbia]]), [[Tuzla]] ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]) and [[Pristina|Priština]] ([[Kosovo]]).

== Origins and name ==

FoeBuD co-founders Rena Tangens and padeluun had been active in the [[punk rock]] and [[new media art|media art]] scenes and established a gallery named ''Art d’Ameublement'' in Bielefeld in 1984. The gallery hosted the [[Chaos Computer Club]] as an exhibit in 1985, and a group of local enthusiasts for then-current forms of computer communication, [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacking]] and social or philosophical matters formed around the gallery. This led to a monthly event called "Public Domain" that was both a meeting for practical research and a talk and discussion series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/6/6156/1.html Die Künstler als Katalysatoren] (''The artists as catalysts''). German article on activities in art, music etc. before FoeBuD's foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foebud.org/pd Public Domain], full list of events on FoeBuD website (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, an association with charity status was formed. The organisation’s full name, “association for the promotion of public mobile and immobile data exchange” (''Verein zur Förderung des öffentlichen bewegten und unbewegten Datenverkehrs''), and the acronym FoeBuD were conceived as a parody of the language used by the telecommunications operator, [[Deutsche Bundespost]], which was then the state authority and monopolist for telephone and postal communications. Telecommunications equipment was heavily regulated on the German network, and the devices that were available often had names and acronyms that appeared bureaucratic and cumbersome. As FoeBuD’s activities and reputation spread outside the hacker scene and the historic background has largely been lost, the name was often perceived as just obscure.

As the organisation was nearing its 25th anniversary, it was perceived that the name FoeBuD had turned from an in-joke into an obstacle for the group’s publicity. A new name was sought, and eventually “Digitalcourage” was chosen and announced on 17 Nov 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.22/foebud-digitalcourage EDRi-gram 10.22] on the name change, published 21 Nov 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==

The ZaMir network was chosen for an award named “sense/information“ (''Sinnformation'') by the Green parliamentary party in the German parliament (''[[Bundestag]]'') in 1998. FoeBuD received a nationally reputed award, the ''[[Theodor Heuss]] medal'', for its civil rights activities in 2008.&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt;

'''Eben Moglen''' is a [[professor]] of [[law]] and legal history at [[Columbia University]], and is the founder, Director-Counsel and [[Chairman]] of [[Software Freedom Law Center]].

==Professional biography==
Moglen started out as a computer programming language designer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twit.tv/floss13 |title=FLOSS Weekly with Chris DiBona, episode 13 |publisher=Twit.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1980. In 1985, he received a [[Master of Philosophy]] in history and a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] from [[Yale University]].  He has held visiting appointments at [[Harvard University]], [[Tel Aviv University]] and the [[University of Virginia]] since 1987.

He was a [[law clerk]] to Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] (1986&amp;ndash;87 term). He joined the faculty of [[Columbia Law School]] in 1987, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/attorney/AttorneyDetails?attorneyId=5452766 NY State Bar Association record].&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in history from Yale University in 1993. Moglen serves as a director of the [[Public Patent Foundation]].

Moglen was part of [[Philip Zimmermann]]'s defense team, when [[Phil_Zimmermann#Arms_Export_Control_Act_investigation|Zimmermann was being investigated]] over the export of [[Pretty Good Privacy]], a [[public key cryptography|public key encryption]] system, under [[Export of cryptography#PC era|US export laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1742104,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A lawyer who is also idealist - how refreshing | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first=Glyn | last=Moody}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he received the [[EFF Pioneer Award]]. In February 2005, he founded the Software Freedom Law Center.

Moglen was closely involved with the [[Free Software Foundation]], serving as [[general counsel]] from 1994-2016 and [[board member]] from 2000 to 2007. As counsel, Moglen was charged with enforcing the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) on behalf of the FSF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/enforcing-gpl.html |title=Enforcing the GNU GPL — GNU Project — Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2001-09-10 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became heavily involved with drafting version 3 of the GPL. On April 23, 2007 he announced in a blog post that he would be stepping down from the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation. Moglen stated that after the GPLv3 Discussion Draft 3 had been released, he wanted to devote more time to writing, teaching, and the Software Freedom Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/blog/2007/04/index.html |title=Freedom Now |publisher=|date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom Box Foundation==
In February 2011, Moglen created the Freedom Box Foundation to design software for a very small server called the [[FreedomBox]]. The FreedomBox aims to be an affordable personal server which runs only free software, with a focus on anonymous and secure communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/nyregion/16about.html Decentralizing the Internet So Big Brother Can’t Find You]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chandler |first=Bob |url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/radiorahim/2011/08/freedom-box-make-technology-supports-freedom-turn-freedom |title=The Freedom Box: Make technology that supports freedom. Turn freedom on! |publisher=Rabble.ca |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; FreedomBox launched version 0.1 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomboxfoundation.org/news/2012-08-27-Version_0.1_released/index.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028231040/http://www.freedomboxfoundation.org/news/2012-08-27-Version_0.1_released/index.en.html |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stances on free software==
[[Image:Eben Moglen-20060823.jpg|thumb|Moglen at [[GNU General Public License#Version 3|GPL V3]] conference in [[Bangalore]], 2006]]
Moglen says that [[free software]] is a fundamental requirement for a democratic and free society in which we are surrounded by and dependent upon technical devices. Only if controlling these devices is open to all via free software, can we balance power equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOEMv0S8AcA |title=Eben Moglen - Freedom in The Cloud |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Moglen's Metaphorical Corollary to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's Law]]'' is the idea that the information appearance and flow between the human minds connected via the Internet works like [[electromagnetic induction]]. Hence Moglen's phrase "Resist the resistance!" (i.e. remove anything that inhibits the flow of information).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/publications/maine-speech.html |title=Freeing The Mind: Free Software and the Death of Proprietary Culture |website=Emoglen.law.columbia.edu |date=2003-06-29 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements and perspectives==
[[File:Eben Moglen - From the birth of printing to industrial culture; the root of copyright.ogv|thumb|right|Moglen sketches the history of copyright law as a form of industrial regulation, and analyses how the changes in technology have thrown the roles created by those laws into crisis. As part of an interview for [[Steal This Film]] in April 2007]]
Moglen believes the idea of [[proprietary software]] is as ludicrous as having "proprietary mathematics" or "proprietary geometry." This would convert the subjects from "something you can learn" into "something you must buy", he has argued. He points out that software is among the "things which can be copied infinitely over and over again, without any further costs."{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

Moglen has criticized what he calls the "reification of selfishness." He has said, "A world full of computers which you can't understand, can't fix and can't use (because it is controlled by inaccessible proprietary software) is a world controlled by machines."{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

He has called on lawyers to help the Free Software movement, saying: "Those who want to share their code can make products and share their work without additional legal risks." He urged his legal colleagues, "It's worth giving up a little in order to produce a sounder ecology for all. Think kindly about the idea of sharing."{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

Moglen has criticized trends which result in "excluding people from knowledge." On the issue of Free Software versus proprietary software, he has argued that "much has been said by the few who stand to lose." Moglen calls for a "sensible respect for both the creators and users" of software code. In general, this concept is a part of what Moglen has termed a "revolution" against the privileged owners of media, distribution channels, and software. On March 13, 2009, in a speech given at [[Seattle University]], Moglen said of the [[free software movement]] that, "'When everybody owns the press, then freedom of the press belongs to everybody' seems to be the inevitable inference, and that’s where we are moving, and when the publishers get used to that, they’ll become us, and we’ll become them, and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] will mean: '[[United States Congress|Congress]] shall make no law [...] abridging freedom of speech, or of the press [...].', ''not'' – as they have tended to argue in the course of the 20th century – 'Congress shall make no law infringing the sacred right of the [[The New York Times#Ochs-Sulzberger family|Sulzbergers]] to be different.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Free and Open Software: Paradigm for a New Intellectual Commons|Free and Open Software: Paradigm for a New Intellectual Commons]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of [[Digital Rights Management]], Moglen once said, "We also live in a world in which the right to tinker is under some very substantial threat. This is said to be because movie and record companies must eat. I will concede that they must eat. Though, like me, they should eat less."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Eben Moglen Keynote at Red Hat Summit 2006|Keynote speech at Red Hat Summit 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economic torts''', which are also called '''business torts''', are [[tort]]s that provide the [[common law]] rules on liability which arise out of business transactions such as interference with economic or business relationships and are likely to involve [[pure economic loss]].

==Nature of economic torts==
Economic torts are [[tortious interference]] actions designed to protect trade or business. The area includes the doctrine of [[restraint of trade]] and, particularly in the United Kingdom, has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective [[labour law]] and modern [[competition law]], and certain laws governing [[intellectual property]], particularly [[unfair competition]] law. The "absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Deakin|first1= Simon|last2= Markesinis|first2= Basil|last3= Johnston|first3= Angus|year= 2003|title= Markesinis and Deakin's Tort Law|edition= 5th|location= |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 0-19925712-4|page= 509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal torts are:

:* [[passing off]],
:* [[injurious falsehood]] and [[trade libel]] (see also [[Food libel laws]]),
:* [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]],
:* inducement of [[breach of contract]],
:* [[tortious interference]] (such as interference with economic relations or unlawful interference with trade),
:* negligent [[misrepresentation]], and
:* watching and besetting.

These torts represent the common law's historical attempt to balance the need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers).

Two cases demonstrate economic torts' affinity to competition and labour law. In ''Mogul Steamship Co Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow &amp; Co]]'' (1889) LR 23 QBD 598&lt;/ref&gt; the plaintiffs argued they had been driven from the Chinese tea market by a 'shipping conference', that had acted together to underprice them. But this [[cartel]] was ruled lawful and "nothing more [than] a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade."&lt;ref&gt;per [[Bowen LJ]], (1889) LR 23 QBD 598, 614&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel.

In English [[labour law]] the most notable case is ''Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants|link=Taff Vale Railway v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants|court=UKHL|year=1901|num=1|parallelcite=[1901] AC 426|date=22 July 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Lords]] thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions. But it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the [[British Labour Party]] and the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]]. Further torts used against unions include conspiracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Quinn v Leathem|link=Quinn v Leatham|court=UKHL|year=1901|num=2|parallelcite=[1901] AC 495|date=5 August 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; interference with a commercial contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Torquay Hotel Co Ltd v Cousins|link=Torquay Hotels Ltd v Cousins|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1968|num=2|parallelcite= [1969] 1 All ER 522 |date=17 December 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; or intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Rookes v Barnard (No 1)|link=Rookes v Barnard|court=UKHL|year=1964|num=1|parallelcite=[1964] AC 1129|date=21 January 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments==
Several of the economic torts in English law, in particular inducing breach of contract and "tortious interference" (otherwise known as causing loss by unlawful means), have been reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords:

:* In ''[[OBG Ltd v Allan]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Douglas &amp; Ors v. Hello! Ltd &amp; Ors|link=OBG Ltd v Allan|court=UKHL|year=2007|num=21|parallelcite=[2008] 1 AC 1|date=2 May 2007}}, [2007] UKHL 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the majority adopted a restrictive view of the unlawful means tort, where the plaintiff has a claim only where the wrong to the third party would have been actionable at the instance of that third party, and he must have an economic interest at stake in the interference by the defendant with that third party. 
:* In ''Total Network SL v Revenue and Customs'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Total Network SL v Revenue and Customs|link=|court=UKHL|year=2008|num=19|parallelcite=[2008] 1 AC 1174|date=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords distinguished the conspiracy tort from the unlawful means tort and held that a more flexible definition of “unlawful means” was needed in the conspiracy context.

In 2014, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], favouring the ruling in ''OBG'', standardized Canadian jurisprudence with respect to the "tort of unlawful interference with economic relations" (which it preferred to call "causing loss by unlawful means", or the "unlawful means tort"). In its ruling in ''[[A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd.|link=A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd.|year=2014|court=scc|num=12|parallelcite=|date=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; it declared:

#Liability to the plaintiff is based on (or parasitic upon) the defendant’s unlawful act against the third party.  The two core components of the unlawful means tort are that the defendant must use unlawful means and that the defendant must intend to harm the plaintiff through the use of the unlawful means.
#In order for conduct to constitute “unlawful means” for this tort, the conduct must give rise to a civil cause of action by the third party or would do so if the third party had suffered loss as a result of that conduct.  The unlawful means tort should be kept within narrow bounds, and it is not subject to principled exceptions.
#The defendant must have the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff as an end in itself or the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff because it is a necessary means of achieving an end that serves some ulterior motive.
#The focus of this tort is unlawful conduct that intentionally harms the plaintiff’s economic interests.  There need be no contract or even other formal dealings between the plaintiff and the third party so long as the defendant’s conduct is unlawful and it intentionally harms the plaintiff’s economic interests.
#The tort of unlawful means is available even if there is another cause of action available to the plaintiff against the defendant in relation to the alleged misconduct.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ex post facto'' law}}
An '''''ex post facto'' law''' (corrupted from {{Lang-la|ex postfacto|lit=out of the aftermath}}) is a [[law]] that retroactively changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, before the enactment of the law. In [[criminal law]], it may [[Criminalization|criminalize]] actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a [[crime]] by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the [[punishment]] prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; or it may alter the [[rules of evidence]] in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed. Conversely, a form of ''ex post facto'' law commonly called an ''[[amnesty law]]'' may decriminalize certain acts. A [[pardon]] has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. Other legal changes may alleviate possible punishments (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term '''''in mitius'''''.

Some [[common law|common-law]] [[jurisdiction]]s do not permit retroactive criminal legislation, though new [[precedent]] generally applies to events that occurred before the judicial decision. ''Ex post facto'' laws are expressly forbidden by the [[United States Constitution]] in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3 (with respect to federal laws) and Article 1, Section 10 (with respect to state laws). In some nations that follow the [[Westminster system]] of government, such as the [[United Kingdom]], ''ex post facto'' laws are technically possible, because the doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] allows [[Parliament]] to pass any law it wishes. In a nation with an entrenched [[bill of rights]] or a written [[constitution]], ''ex post facto'' legislation may be prohibited.

While American jurisdictions generally prohibit ''ex post facto'' laws, European countries apply the principle of '''''lex mitior''''' ("the milder law"). It provides that, if the law has changed after an offense was committed, the version of the law that applies is the one that is more advantageous for the accused. This means that ''ex post facto'' laws apply in European jurisdictions to the extent that they are the milder law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westen|first1=Peter|work=New Criminal Law Review: An International and Interdisciplinary Journal|title=Lex Mitior: Converse of ex post facto and window into criminal desert|date=May 2015|pages=167–213|doi=10.1525/nclr.2015.18.2.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ex post facto'' laws by country==

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has no strong constitutional prohibition on ''ex post facto'' laws, although narrowly retroactive laws might violate the constitutional [[separation of powers]] principle. Australian courts normally interpret statutes with a strong presumption that they do not apply retroactively.

Retroactive laws designed to prosecute what was perceived to have been a blatantly unethical means of [[tax avoidance]] were passed in the early 1980s by the [[Fraser Government|Fraser government]] (see [[Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance]]). Similarly, legislation [[criminalization|criminalising]] certain war crimes retroactively has been held to be constitutional (see ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'').

The government will sometimes make a press release that it intends to change the tax law with effect from the date and time of the press release, before legislation is introduced into parliament.

===Brazil===
According to the 5th Article, section XXXVI of the Brazilian Constitution, laws cannot have ''ex post facto'' effects that affect acquired rights, accomplished juridical acts and ''res judicata''.

The same article in section XL prohibits ''ex post facto'' [[criminal law]]s. Like France, there is an exception when retroactive criminal laws benefit the accused person.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], ''ex post facto'' criminal laws are constitutionally prohibited by [[Section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|paragraph 11(g)]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Also, under paragraph 11(i) of the Charter, if the punishment for a crime has varied between the time the crime was committed and the time of sentencing following a conviction, the convicted person is entitled to the lesser punishment.

The Canada sex offender registry, which went into effect on December 15, 2004, is somewhat retroactive. When the registry was created, all offenders who were on the Ontario sex offender registry, which was created in 2001, were required to register on the national registry. In addition, sex offenders in all provinces who were serving a sentence (whether imprisoned or on probation or parole) on December 15,2004 were required to register, regardless of when their offense and conviction occurred. However, the registry was not retroactive to anybody who had completed their sentence by late 2004 and was not on the Ontario registry. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-national-embarrassment/&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian courts have never ruled on the somewhat retroactive nature of the sex offender registry, since this seems to have never been challenged. 

Sex offender registration was not mandatory for sex offenders until 2011, and had to be ordered by a judge. &lt;ref&gt;https://doubleaspect.blog/tag/sex-offender-registration/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-national-embarrassment/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/40-3/bill/S-2/royal-assent/page-ToC&lt;/ref&gt;. Somewhat bizarrely, sex offender registration was seemingly mandatory for people convicted before December 15, 2004 who were serving a sentence on that date, but was only optional for sex offenders convicted between December 15, 2004 and January 1, 2011. 

Because section 11 of the Charter is among the sections that can be overridden under [[Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]] (the notwithstanding clause), Parliament could in theory enact ''ex post facto'' laws by invoking section 33. However, the federal Parliament (which has the sole power to enact laws punishable for violation by two years or more in penitentiary) has never attempted to enact an ''ex post facto'' law (or any other law) using section 33.

It should be emphasized that the Charter prohibition applies only to criminal law. Changes to [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] in Canada can be, and occasionally are, enacted ''ex post facto''. In one example, convicted murderer [[Colin Thatcher]] was ordered to forfeit proceeds from a book he had published (after being paroled from prison) under a [[Saskatchewan]] law. Although the law was passed long after Thatcher's murder conviction, the courts have ruled that such laws prescribe only [[civil penalty|civil penalties]] (as opposed to additional criminal penalties) and are thus not subject to Charter restrictions.

===Finland===
Generally, the Finnish legal system does not permit ''ex post facto'' laws, especially those that would expand criminal responsibility. They are not expressly forbidden; instead, the ban is derived from more general legal principles and basic rights. In civil matters, such as taxation, ''ex post facto'' laws may be made in some circumstances.

However, there have been three exceptional instances when ''ex post facto'' criminal laws have been used in Finland.

Following the [[Finnish Civil War]] of 1918, the [[Parliament of Finland]] passed a law setting up tribunals to try suspected rebels. These tribunals issued death sentences in many cases, although very few of those accused could have committed a crime that carried the [[Capital punishment in Finland|death penalty]] under Finnish law in force during the war. Several hundred people were executed under what was arguably an ''ex post facto'' legal arrangement. During the war, and before the tribunals were set up, thousands of people had been executed without trial by both sides.

After [[World War II]], Finland was under pressure to convict political leaders whom the Allied powers considered responsible for Finnish involvement in the war. An ''ex post facto'' law was passed in the autumn of 1945 to permit [[War-responsibility trials in Finland|prosecution for war responsibility]], and eventually eight politicians were convicted.

In another post-war case, the [[Weapons Cache Case|weapons cache case]], an ''ex post facto'' law was passed in 1947 so that military personnel could be prosecuted for unofficially preparing for guerrilla resistance in case of Soviet occupation.

===France===
In [[France]], so-called "''lois rétroactives''" (retroactive laws) are technically prohibited by Article 2 of the [[Code Civil]], which states that: "Legislation provides only for the future; it has no retrospective operation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/content/download/1950/13681/version/3/file/Code_22.pdf Link to Civil Code]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice however, since the Code Civil does not have the status of constitutional legislation and can therefore be overruled by subsequent laws, the [[Conseil Constitutionnel]] has determined that retroactive laws can be passed within certain limits – such as in the case of financial or tax legislation –, particularly where it is considered to be in the "general interest"; this has been demonstrated by a series of decisions handed down by the Conseil Constitutionnel concerning retroactive tax laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/a-la-une/janvier-2013-la-retroactivite-fiscale-dans-la-jurisprudence-du-conseil-constitutionnel.135573.html| title=Janvier 2013 : La rétroactivité fiscale dans la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel| language=French| date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in criminal law, ''ex post facto'' sanctions are effectively forbidden as per Article 112-1 of the [[French Penal Code]], except in cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person (called retroactivity "[[in mitius]]").&lt;ref name = Soyer&gt;{{cite book| last = Soyer| first = Jean-Claude| title = Droit pénal et procédure pénale| publisher = L.G.D.G.| series = Lextenso Editions| edition = 21| date = 2012| location = Paris| pages = 75–78| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also considered unconstitutional, since the principle of non-retroactivity is laid down in Article 8 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which has constitutional status under French law.&lt;ref name="Terré"&gt;{{cite book| last = Terré| first = François| title = Introduction générale au droit| publisher = Dalloz| series = Précis| edition = 8| date = 2001 | location = Paris| pages = 204–5| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[épuration légale]]'' trials held after the 1944 [[liberation of France]] introduced the status of ''[[indignité nationale]]'' for [[Nazi collaborators]] as a way to avoid ''ex post facto'' law.

===Germany===
Article 103 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German basic law]] requires that an act may be punished only if it has already been punishable by law at the time it was committed (specifically: by ''written'' law, [[Germany]] following civil law).

[[Robert A. Taft]], at the time a U.S. Senator from Ohio, asserted that the [[Nuremberg Trials]] following [[World War II]] were based on ''ex post facto'' law because the Allies did not negotiate the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|London Charter]], which defined crimes against humanity and created the International Military Tribunal, until well after the acts charged. Others, including the International Military Tribunal, argued that the London Charter merely restated and provided jurisdiction to prosecute offenses that were already made unlawful by the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], and the various [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The problem of ''ex post facto'' law was also relevant in the 1990s as there was a discussion about the trials against East German soldiers who killed fugitives on the Inner-German border ([[Schießbefehl#After reunification|''Mauerschützen-Prozesse'']] - ''Wall-shooters'/ -guards' trials''). German courts in these cases recurred to the [[Radbruch formula]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Lahusen [http://www.zeit.de/2009/46/A-Radbruch/komplettansicht "Aus Juristen Demokraten machen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In 2010, the parliament established a 98% punitive tax on any income over two million forints received either as a retirement package or as severance pay in the previous five years in the government sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realdeal.hu/20101109/controversial-98-tax-on-govt-severance-pay-made-retroactive-to-2005 Controversial 98% tax on gov't severance pay made retroactive to 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111025059/http://www.realdeal.hu/20101109/controversial-98-tax-on-govt-severance-pay-made-retroactive-to-2005 |date=November 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In India, without using the expression "''ex post facto law''", the underlying principle has been adopted in the article 20(1) of the Indian Constitution in the following words:
{{quote|No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence.}}

Further, what article 20(1) prohibits is conviction and sentence under an ''ex post facto'' law for acts done prior thereto, but not the enactment or validity of such a law. There is, thus, a difference between the Indian and the American positions on this point; whereas in the United States, an ''ex post facto'' law is in itself invalid, it is not so in India. The courts may also interpret a law in such a manner that any objection against it of retrospective operation may be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalserviceindia.com/article/l60-Protection-against-ex-post-facto-laws.html legalserviceindia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example for retrospective law in India is the Karnataka Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karunadu.gov.in/karigr/actsrules/otheracts/scst.htm Department of Stamps and Registration, Government of Karnataka]&lt;/ref&gt; in the state of [[Karnataka]].

===Indonesia===
The [[Indonesia]]n constitution prohibits trying citizens under retroactive laws in any circumstance. This was tested in 2004 when the conviction of [[Masykur Abdul Kadir]], one of the [[2002 Bali terrorist bombing|Bali bombers]], under retroactive anti-terrorist legislation was quashed.&lt;ref&gt;Indonesian Constitutional Court Decision No 013/PUU-I/2003 (Masykur Abdul Kadir Case)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
''Ex post facto'' laws, in all contexts, are prohibited by Article 169 (Chapter 11) of [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran's constitution]].

===Republic of Ireland===
The imposition of retroactive criminal sanctions is prohibited by Article 15.5.1° of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]]. Retroactive changes of the civil law have also been found to violate the constitution when they would have resulted in the loss in a right to damages before the courts, the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Irish Supreme Court]] having found that such a right is a constitutionally protected property right.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] enacted the 1950 "Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law" for the purpose of punishing acts that occurred during the [[Second World War]], when Israel did not exist as a state. The law was used to punish [[Adolf Eichmann]] and others.

===Italy===
Article 25, paragraph 2, of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]], establishing that "nobody can be punished but according to a law come into force before the deed was committed", prohibits indictment pursuant a retroactive law. Article 11 of preliminary provisions to the [[Italian civil code|Italian Civil Code]] and Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of taxpayer's rights, prohibit retroactive laws on principle: such provisions can be derogated, however, by acts having force of the ordinary law; on the contrary, non-retroactivity in criminal law is thought absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/10805861/Irretroattività_della_norma_penale_e_redazione_legislativa Giampiero Buonomo, {{lang|it|Dura lex sed negligens}}, in Mondoperaio, 9/2014, p. 61.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Article 39 of the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] of [[Japan]] prohibits the retroactive application of laws. Article 6 of [[Criminal Code of Japan]] further states that if a new law comes into force after the deed was committed, the lighter punishment must be given.

===Lithuania===
Lithuania has no constitutional prohibition on ''ex post facto'' laws. Retroactive criminal sanctions are prohibited by Article 2, Part 1 (Chapter 1) of the [[Criminal Code]] of the [[Republic of Lithuania]]. Retroactive administrative sanctions are prohibited by Article 8 of the Administrative Code of the Republic of Lithuania.

Lithuanian lawyer Dainius Žalimas contends that there has been retroactive application of the law on Genocide (and subsequently adopted articles of the Criminal Code) against participants in Soviet repressions against Lithuanian guerilla fighters and their supporters, and gives examples of such decisions. The Article 99 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania was introduced only in September 26, 2000 and therefore can't be used in events of 1944-1953.

===Mexico===
According to the first and second paragraphs of the Article 14th of the Mexican Constitution, retroactive application of the law is prohibited if it is on detriment of a person rights. But the new law can be applied if it benefits the person.

===Netherlands===
Article 4 of the Law on General Provisions (in effect since 1838) states that "The law has no retroactive effect".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001833#Artikel4 Article 4 Wet algemene bepalingen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1 of Criminal Law states that no act is punishable without a pre-existing law, and that in the case an act was punishable but the law was changed after the criminal act the "most favorable" (to the suspect) of the two laws will apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/EersteBoek/TitelI/Artikel1 Article 1 Wetboek van Strafrecht (Criminal Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Civil Law there is no such provision.

===New Zealand===
Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1999 stipulates that enactments do not have retrospective effect. The [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] also affirms New Zealand's commitment to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], with section 26 preventing the application of retroactive penalties. This is further reinforced under section 6(1) of the current Sentencing Act 2002 which provides, "[p]enal enactments not to have retrospective effect to disadvantage of offender" irrespective of any provision to the contrary.

Section 26 of the Bill of Rights and the previous sentencing legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 1985, caused significant digression among judges when the [[Parliament of New Zealand|New Zealand Parliament]] introduced legislation that had the effect of enacting a retrospective penalty for crimes involving an element of home invasion. Ultimately, the discrepancy was restricted with what some labelled artificial logic in the cases of ''R v Pora'' and ''R v Poumako''.

===Norway===
Article 97 of the [[constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution]] prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect. The prohibition applies to both criminal and civil laws, but in some civil cases, only particularly unreasonable effects of retroactivity will be found unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norwegian Supreme Court case 2009/1575 |url=http://www.domstol.no/upload/HRET/saknr2009-1663-plenum.pdf |publisher=domstol.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
Article 12 of the constitution of Pakistan prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect by stating:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html The Constitution of Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12.1 - No law shall authorize the punishment of a person:-
* 12.1.a - for an act or omission that was not punishable by law at the time of the act or omission; or
* 12.1.b - for an offence by a penalty greater than, or of a kind different from, the penalty prescribed by law for that offence at the time the offence was committed.

===Philippines===
The 1987 Constitution of the [[Philippines]] categorically prohibits the passing of any ''ex post facto'' law. Article III ([[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]]), Section 22 specifically states: "No ''ex post facto'' law or [[bill of attainder]] shall be enacted."

However, the [[Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012|Cybercrime Prevention Act]], which went into effect on October 3, 2012, is criticized for being ''ex post facto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By the time you read this, I will be a criminal.|url=http://nissie.tumblr.com/post/32744104468/by-the-time-you-read-this-i-will-be-a-criminal|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
Retroactive application of law is prohibited by the Article 3 of the Polish [[civil code]], and the [[legal rule]] prohibiting such retroactive application is commonly memorised as a [[Latin]] sentence ''Lex retro non agit'' ("A law does not apply retroactively"). The said article, however, allows retroactive application of an Act of Parliament if it is expressly understood from its text or purpose.

===Portugal===
Article 18 of the Portuguese constitution forbids the retroactive application of any law the restricts right; article 29 of the Portuguese Constitution forbids retroactive application of criminal law; article 103 forbids the application of retroactive taxes.

===Romania===
Article 15 (2) of the Romanian constitution provides that the law shall only act for the future, except for the more favourable criminal or administrative law.

===Russia===
''Ex post facto'' punishment in criminal and administrative law is prohibited by article 54 of the constitution; ''ex post facto'' tax laws by article 57 of the constitution.

===Spain===
Article 9.3 of the [[Spanish Constitution]] guarantees the principle of non-retroactivity of punitive provisions that are not favorable to or restrictive of individual rights. Therefore, "ex post facto" criminal laws or any other retroactive punitive provisions are constitutionally prohibited.

As well as [[Statute law]] mentioned above, this now also includes '[[Precedent|court-made law]]'. The [[Parot doctrine (Spain)|Parot doctrine]], in which terrorists were denied the right (enshrined in a 1973 Statute) to earn a reduction in the length of their sentences by a Spanish court ruling in 2006 was judged by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] to be contrary to relevant articles on [[ECHR#Article 7 - retroactivity|retroactivity]] &amp; [[ECHR#Article 5 - liberty and security|liberty and security]] in 2013.

===South Africa===
Section 35(3) of the [[South African Bill of Rights]] prohibits ''ex post facto'' criminal laws, except that acts which violated international law at the time they were committed may be prosecuted even if they were not illegal under national law at the time. It also prohibits retroactive increases of criminal punishments.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], retroactive penal sanctions and other retroactive legal effects of criminal acts due the State are prohibited by chapter 2, section 10 of the [[Constitution of Sweden#Instrument of Government|Instrument of Government]] (''Regeringsformen''). Retroactive taxes or charges are not prohibited, but they can have retroactive effect reaching back only to the time when a new tax bill was proposed by the government. The retroactive effect of a tax or charge thus reaches from that time until the bill is passed by the parliament.

As the [[Swedish Act of Succession]] was changed in 1979, and the throne was inherited regardless of sex, the inheritance right was withdrawn from all the descendants of [[Charles XIV John]] (king 1818-44) except the current king [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]. Thereby, the heir-apparent title was transferred from the new-born [[Prince Carl Philip]] to his older sister [[Crown Princess Victoria]].

The Swedish Parliament voted in 2004 to abolish [[inheritance tax]] by January 1, 2005. However, in 2005 they retro-actively decided to move the date to December 17, 2004. The main reason was abolishing inheritance tax for the many Swedish victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which took place on December 26.

===Turkey===
''Ex post facto'' punishment is prohibited by Article 38 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution]] of [[Turkey]]. It states:
* c1. No one shall be punished for any act which does not constitute a criminal offence under the law in force at the time committed; no one shall be given a heavier penalty for an offence other than the penalty applicable at the time when the offence was committed.
* c2. The provisions of the above paragraph shall also apply to the statute of limitations on offences and penalties and on the results of conviction.
Thus, the article does not prohibit ''in mitius'' laws, i.e. cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], ''ex post facto'' laws are frowned upon,{{by whom|date=June 2018}} but are permitted by virtue of the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]]. Historically, all acts of Parliament before 1793 were ''ex post facto'' legislation, inasmuch as their date of effect was the first day of the session in which they were passed. This situation was rectified by the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Some laws are still passed retrospectively: e.g., the [[Pakistan Act 1990]] (by which the United Kingdom amended its legislation consequent to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] having re-admitted Pakistan as a member) was one such law; despite being passed on 29 June 1990, section 2 subsection 3 states that "This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on 1st October 1989", nine months before it was enacted.&lt;ref name=NA_PA1990 &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/14/section/2 |title= Pakistan Act 1990 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospective ''criminal'' laws are prohibited by Article 7 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, but several noted legal authorities have stated their opinion that parliamentary sovereignty takes priority even over this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] in ''Macarthys Ltd v Smith [1979] ICR 785 at p. 789, quoted in {{cite book | last = Steiner | first = Josephine | first2 = Lorna | last2 = Woods | first3 = Christian | last3 = Twigg-Flesner | title = EU Law | edition = 9th | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, New York | isbn = 978-0-19-927959-3|chapter=Section 4.4.2: Effect of the European Communities Act 1972, s.2(1) and (4) |quote=If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it — and says so in express terms — then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament. |page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeuleg/38-xiv/5020802.htm| title = Select Committee on European Scrutiny Minutes of Evidence: Examination of Witnesses (Questions 229-239): Rt hon Jack Straw MP and Mr David Frost| accessdate =2008-01-09 | first = Jack |last = Straw | authorlink = Jack Straw | date = 2005-02-08| work = House of Commons Publications |quote = I think your Committee will be familiar with what Lord Denning, then Master of the Rolls, said in McCarthy v Smith: "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision of it or with the intention of acting inconsistently with it—it says so in express terms—I should have thought it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute in our Parliament." That much is clear. Other consequences would follow in those circumstances, which arise from our signature on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaty, Article 27, which says that you have to respect the international obligations into which you have entered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[War Crimes Act 1991]] created an ''ex post facto'' jurisdiction of British courts over [[war crime]]s committed during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Another important example of a case which shows the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in action is [[Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate]], which retrospectively changed the law on compensation resulting from [[scorched earth]] actions in Burma during the war. The decision of the courts was overriden with retrospective effect by the War Damage Act 1965. More recently, the [[Police (Detention and Bail) Act 2011]] retroactively overrode a controversial court judgment resulting from an error in the drafting of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] that would potentially have invalidated thousands of criminal convictions.

One example of an ex post facto criminal law in the UK is the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This law allows people acquitted of murder and certain other serious offences to be retried if there is “new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence” that the acquitted person really was guilty. This Act applies retroactively and can be used to re-prosecute people who were acquitted before it came into force in 2005, or even before it was passed in 2003. As a result, two of the defendants who were acquitted in the murder of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to be retried, even though this murder occurred in 1993 and the defendants had been acquitted in 1996. Many people have criticized the Criminal Justice Act because of its essential abolition of prohibition against both ex post facto and double jeopardy laws.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8982608/Stephen-Lawrence-murder-change-in-double-jeopardy-law-allowed-Gary-Dobson-prosecution.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxation law has on multiple occasions been changed to retrospectively disallow [[tax avoidance]] schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8496921.stm | work=BBC News | title=Will retrospective taxes affect us all? | date=5 February 2010 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most significant example known concerns Double-taxation Treaty Arrangements where the [[Finance Act 2008]] with [[BN66]] retrospectively amended 1987 legislation creating large tax liabilities for 3,000 people where no liability existed before. More recently, the so called "[[2019 Loan Charge]]", coming in from 5 April 2019 and going back 20 years retrospectively has triggered an Early Day Motion [https://www.parliament.uk/edm/2017-19/1239] in UK Parliament and the establishment of a Loan Charge Action [https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/ Group]. It has since transpired that Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General Her Majesty's Treasury, misled UK Parliament stating that “the arrangements entered into by those who are in scope of this measure [the 2019 Loan Charge] were not legal when they were entered into, even though they may have been entered into in the past”. The Loan Charge Action Group has since [https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/blog/lcag-letter-to-mel-stride-mp-03-07-18 written to demand a formal apology and correction of parliamentary record].

===United States===
{{rquote|right|The sentiment that ''ex post facto'' laws are against natural right is so strong in the United States, that few, if any, of the State constitutions have failed to proscribe them. The federal constitution indeed interdicts them in criminal cases only; but they are equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases, and the omission of a caution which would have been right, does not justify the doing what is wrong. Nor ought it to be presumed that the legislature meant to use a phrase in an unjustifiable sense, if by rules of construction it can be ever strained to what is just.| [[Thomas Jefferson]] | Letter to Isaac McPherson, August 13, 1813 }}
In the [[United States]], Congress is prohibited from passing ''ex post facto'' laws by clause 3 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. The states are prohibited from passing ''ex post facto'' laws by clause 1 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Section 10]]. This is one of the relatively few restrictions that the United States Constitution made to both the power of the federal and state governments before the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] described them as "equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases". Over the years, however, when deciding ''ex post facto'' cases, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has referred repeatedly to its ruling in ''[[Calder v. Bull]]'', in which Justice [[Samuel Chase]] held that the prohibition applied only to criminal matters, not civil matters, and established four categories of unconstitutional ''ex post facto'' laws.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Calder v. Bull]]'', {{ussc|3|386|1798}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case dealt with the Article I, Section 10, prohibition on ''ex post facto'' laws, because it concerned a Connecticut state law.

Not all laws with retroactive effects have been held to be unconstitutional. One current U.S. law that has a retroactive effect is the [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]] of 2006. This law imposes new registration requirements on convicted [[sex offenders]] and also applies to offenders whose crimes were committed before the law was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.4472: |title=Library of Congress text of H.R.4472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Smith v. Doe]]'' (2003) that forcing sex offenders to register their whereabouts at regular intervals, and the posting of personal information about them on the Internet, do not violate the constitutional prohibition against ''ex post facto'' laws, because these laws do not impose any kind of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|538|84|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.onecle.com/constitution/article-1/59-ex-post-facto-laws.html |title=Ex Post Facto Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Starkey v. Oklahoma Department Of Corrections'', the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma found the Oklahoma Sex Offender Registration Act, or SORA, to be punitive in nature, if not in intent. While the law in question has been ruled as not being retroactive in nature, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had been applying the new legislation retroactively, and "also find the Department's retroactive application of the level assignment provisions of 57 O.S. Supp. 2007, 582.1 - 582.5, as amended, violates the ex post facto clause."&lt;ref&gt;''Starkey v. Oklahoma Department Of Corrections'', 2013 OK 43 (2013), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22Starkey%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,226&amp;case=1906264459000731549&amp;scilh=0]; OSCN Documents http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=470336&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy has also arisen with regard to [[sexually violent predator laws|sexually violent predator (SVP) laws]], which allow the indefinite commitment of a person with a mental abnormality which predisposes them to molest children. This issue arose in the case ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]''.&lt;ref name="Hendricks"&gt;''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', {{ussc|521|346|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hendricks'', a man with a long history of sexually molesting children was scheduled to be released from prison shortly after the enactment of Kansas's SVP act. Rather than being released, he was committed on the grounds that he had a mental abnormality. Hendricks contested the law on ''ex post facto'' and double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court of Kansas invalidated the Act, but the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision and ruled that the law was constitutional on the basis that the law did not impose a criminal punishment.&lt;ref name="Hendricks" /&gt;

Another example is the [[Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban]], where firearms prohibitions were imposed on those convicted of misdemeanor domestic-violence offenses and on subjects of restraining orders (which do not require criminal conviction). These individuals can now be sentenced to up to ten years in a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] for possession of a firearm, regardless of whether the weapon was legally possessed when the law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Uscsub|18|922|g|8}}, {{Uscsub2|18|922|g|9}}, and {{Uscsub2|18|924}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The law has been legally upheld because it is considered regulatory, not punitive; it is a [[status offense]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Emerson]]'', 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in ''Calder v. Bull'', the court expressly stated that a law that "mollifies" a criminal act was merely retrospective, and was not an ''ex post facto'' law.&lt;ref&gt;''Calder'', 3 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have argued that, as a historical matter, the phrase ''ex post facto'' referred to civil as well as criminal laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoldan|first1=Evan|title=The Civil Ex Post Facto Clause|ssrn=2469141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States administrative law|administrative law]], federal agencies may apply their rules retroactively if Congress has authorized them to; otherwise, retroactive application is generally prohibited. Retroactive application of regulations is disfavored by the courts for several reasons. The courts uphold retroactive regulation where Congress has expressly granted such retroactive power to the agency, as they did in ''Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital'', {{ussc|488|204|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules as they relate to the effects of ''ex post facto'' upon the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines|U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] can be found in {{ussg|1b1.11}}.

==Treatment by international organizations and treaties==

===International criminal law===
In [[international criminal law]], the [[Nuremberg trials]] prosecuted [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] perpetrated in World War II. Although the [[Nuremberg Charter]], the [[procedural law]] under which the trials were held, postdated [[V-E Day]], the tribunal rejected the defence that the criminal law was ''ex post facto'', arguing it derived from earlier treaties like the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]]. The [[International Criminal Court]] established in 2002 cannot prosecute crimes committed before 2002.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related treaties===
Article 11, paragraph 2 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that no person be held guilty of any criminal law that did not exist at the time of offence nor suffer any penalty heavier than what existed at the time of offence. It does however permit application of either domestic or international law.

Very similar provisions are found in Article 15, paragraph 1 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], replacing the term "penal offence" with "criminal offence". It also adds that if a lighter penalty is provided for after the offence occurs, that lighter penalty shall apply retroactively. Paragraph 2 adds a provision that paragraph 1 does not prevent trying and punishing for an act that was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations. Specifically addressing the use of the death penalty, article 6, paragraph 2 provides in relevant part that a death sentence may only be imposed "for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime".

===African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights===
Article 2, paragraph 7 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] provides in part that "[n]o one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offense at the time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offense for which no provision was made at the time it was committed."

===American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man===
Article 25 of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] provides in part that "[n]o person may be deprived of his liberty except in the cases and according to the procedures established by pre-existing law." The right to be tried in accordance to "pre-existing law" is reiterated in article 26.

===Arab Charter on Human Rights===
Article 15 of the [[Arab Charter on Human Rights]] provides that "[n]o crime and no penalty can be established without a prior provision of the law. In all circumstances, the law most favorable to the defendant shall be applied."

===European Convention on Human Rights===
Effectively all European states (except [[Belarus]]), including all [[European Union]] and [[European Economic Area]] states, are bound by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 7 of the convention]] mirrors the language of both paragraphs of Article 15 of the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, with the exception that it does not include that a subsequent lighter penalty must apply.

==Grammatical form and usage==
The phrase may not appear to be grammatically correct in Latin if it is interpreted to comprise the [[preposition]] ''ex'', the preposition ''post'', and a [[noun]] with the wrong [[grammatical case]] to agree with ''post''. Indeed, the ''Digesta Iustiniani'' (15.3.10.8.3, 20.1.22.pr2, etc.) shows a two-word phrase, ''ex postfacto'': ''out of a postfactum (an after-deed)'', or more naturally, ''from a law passed afterward''. This same work, however, also makes use of the three-word phrase ''ex post facto'', (2.14.17.4.2, 4.6.17.1.1, ''passim''), suggesting that ''post'' might best be understood as an adverb. This adverbial usage of ''post'' is not at all unusual. For example, the Classical author/advocate/politician [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] employs phrases such as ''multis post annis'' (''De Re Publica'' 2.5.8 and elsewhere).

Therefore, ''ex post facto'' or ''ex postfacto'' is natively an adverbial phrase, a usage demonstrated by the sentence "He was convicted ''ex post facto'' (from a law passed after his crime)." The law itself would rightfully be a ''postfactum'' law (''lex postfacta''); nevertheless, despite its redundant or circular nature, the phrase ''an ex post facto law'' is used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010 }}

In Poland the phrase ''[[:pl:Lex retro non agit|lex retro non agit]]'' ("the law does not operate retroactively") is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattila|first=Heikki E. S.|author2=Christopher Goddard|title=Comparative Legal Linguistics|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2006|pages=154|isbn=978-0-7546-4874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">An '''extraterritorial operation''' in [[international law]] is a [[law enforcement]] or [[military]] [[military operation|operation]] conducted outside the territory or [[jurisdiction]] of the state of the forces in operation, generally within the territory of another sovereign state. Under international law, these activities are generally highly restricted, and it is considered a violation of a [[state (polity)|state]]'s [[sovereignty]] if any other state engages in law enforcement or military operations within another state without gaining that state's consent:{{sfn|Stigall|2013|pp=16-17}}
{{cquote|The first and foremost restriction imposed by international law on a State is that—failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary—it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State.|author=[[Permanent Court of International Justice]], 1923&lt;ref name=PCIJ&gt;S.S. Lotus (Fr. v. Turk.), 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 10, ¶ 45 (Sept. 7); quoted in {{harvnb|Stigall|2013|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Law enforcement ==
The policing of [[transnational crime|transnational]] and [[International criminal law|international crime]]s is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention "tantamount to abduction" when carried out extraterritorially.{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=18}} These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as [[Interpol]] to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]'' ("[[extradition|extradite]] or prosecute") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including [[aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] of [[civil aviation|civilian aircraft]], taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of [[terrorism]], as well as crimes against [[diplomat]]s and other "[[Protection of Diplomats Convention|internationally protected persons]]".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|pp=19-21}}

== Military operations ==
While extraterritorial law enforcement activity is highly restricted and subject to the approval of the 'host' state, traditional interstate military operations assume some degree of extraterritorial operation. As Stigall points out, innate in 'just' war (''[[jus ad bellum]]'') is the expectation that one state may be conducting military activity against, and within the borders, of another state; the [[laws of armed conflict]] "[presuppose] extraterritoriality".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}} Therefore, "[i]f the circumstances exist for the 
lawful use of force under ''jus ad bellum'', then so long as a state abides by the rules articulated in ''[[Law of war|jus in bello]]'' [the law of war], that state’s extraterritorial actions are considered lawful."{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}}

=== "Unwilling or unable" ===
Problems with the legitimacy of extraterritorial operations arise, according to Stigall, when one state is conducting military activity against non-state actors in a state "that is not party to the conflict".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}} Although some commentators suggest that the use of force is permitted in some of these cases, with Deeks' commentary on the 'Unwilling or Unable Test' mentioning sources that recommend that "neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent",{{sfn|Deeks|2012|p=499}} Stigall reminds "that such view is not universal, and textual authority for such cross-border attacks is limited".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31-32}}

=== Humanitarian and human rights law ===
For the [[European Union]], key tenets of its [[human rights law]] jurisdiction are laid down in [[Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), with the convention employed to complement and reinforce the more specific scope of [[international humanitarian law|humanitarian law]].{{sfn|Orakhelashvili|2012|p=2}}{{efn|"This should be enough to dispel the assumption that, wherever human rights treaties such as the ECHR apply extra-territorially in situations of armed conflict and occupation, their effect could be curtailed by the more limited humanitarian law protection."{{sfn|Orakhelashvili|2012|p=2}}}} The application of this to extraterritorial operations has been noted by Ryngaert as mixed, with ''Al-Skeini and others v United Kingdom'' in 2011 attempting "to square ''Bankovic ''[''v. Belgium'''s "sufficient control" model of jurisdiction] with the personal model of jurisdiction",{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}{{sfn|Holcroft-Emmess|2013}} and ''Al-Jedda v United Kingdom'' "tried to reconcile the ‘ultimate control and authority’ standard... with  the ‘effective operational control’ standard endorsed by the UN’s International Law Commission."{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}} Ryngaert declares each of the two results to be "an awkward hybrid theory".{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}
&lt;!--"for those who brandish human rights, it is difficult to accept that States may do abroad what they are not allowed to do inside their borders."{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18310">The '''FM broadcast band''', used for [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] by [[radio station]]s, differs between different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib550024/attach_a1-chptr_1-general_information-26sept2012.docx.&lt;/ref&gt; and Africa ((defined as [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) [[ITU region|region]] 1)), it spans from 87.5 to 108 [[hertz#SI multiples|megahertz]] (MHz) - also known as VHF [[Band II]] - while in the Americas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz. The FM broadcast band in [[Japan]] uses 76 to 95&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[International Radio and Television Organisation]] (OIRT) band in [[Eastern Europe]] is from 65.8 to 74.0&amp;nbsp;MHz, although these countries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz band, as in the case of [[Russia]]. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have changed to the 87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz band.

[[Frequency modulation]] radio originated in the [[United States]] during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American [[electrical engineer]] [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]]. However, FM broadcasting did not become widespread, even in [[North America]], until the 1960s.

Frequency-modulated radio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this article are in the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz.

==CCIR bandplan==

===Center frequencies===
While all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8&amp;nbsp;MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95&amp;nbsp;MHz.

An [[ITU-R|ITU]] conference in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacings throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukspec.tripod.com/specbw.html#b87|title=UK Radio Frequency Bands|author=|date=|website=ukspec.tripod.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most countries have used 100&amp;nbsp;kHz or 200&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.
* Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50&amp;nbsp;kHz or even 100&amp;nbsp;kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.
* A few countries, such as [[Italy]], which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.
* The 50&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacings help prevent [[co-channel interference|co-channel]] [[electromagnetic interference|interference]], and these take advantage of FM's [[capture effect]] and [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].

===ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering===
The original frequency allocation in [[North America]] used by [[Edwin Armstrong]] used the frequency band from 42 through 50&amp;nbsp;MHz, but this allocation was changed to a higher band beginning in 1945. In [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[the Bahamas]], etc., there are 101 [[List of channel numbers assigned to FM frequencies in North America|FM channels]] numbered from ''200'' (center frequency 87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) to ''300'' (center frequency 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz), though these numbers are rarely used outside the fields of [[radio engineering]] and government.
 
The center frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200&amp;nbsp;kHz. The frequency of 87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88&amp;nbsp;MHz), is used by just two [[list of broadcast station classes|FM class-D]] stations in the United States. Portable radio [[tuner (radio)|tuner]]s often tune down to 87.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, so that the same radios can be made and sold worldwide. [[Automobile]]s usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz (±10&amp;nbsp;kHz) could be received, such as in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and [[Denver, Colorado]]. With the advent of [[digital television]] in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant when the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down or convert to digital by September 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/dtv-transition-and-lptv-class-translator-stations|title=DTV Transition and LPTV - Class A - Translator Stations|author=|date=24 May 2011|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but there are still [[analog television]] stations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also analog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.

In the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of 87.9–91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the ''[[reserved band]]'', exclusively for [[non-commercial educational]] (''NCE'') stations. The other channels (92.1&amp;nbsp;MHz through 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz (Channels 221–300) may be used by both commercial and non-commercial stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/topic/fm-radio&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this reservation does not apply.)

Originally, the American [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) devised a [[bandplan]] in which FM radio stations would be assigned at intervals of four channels (800&amp;nbsp;kHz separation) for any one geographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7, etc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7 etc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see [[FM broadcasting]]), which had a limit of three [[kilowatt]]s of [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) and an [[radio antenna|antenna]] height limit for the center of radiation of 300 feet (91.4 m) height above average terrain ([[HAAT]]). These frequencies were 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other frequencies, a station could be Class B (50&amp;nbsp;kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100&amp;nbsp;kW, 2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in.

In the late 1980s, the FCC switched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently operating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and change antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six kilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late 2004, a station can be "squeezed in" anywhere as long as the location and class conform to the rules in the FCC separation table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/spacing/|title=separation table|author=|date=|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for second-adjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.

===Deviation and bandpass===
Normally each [[channel (communications)|channel]] is 200&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]] (0.2&amp;nbsp;MHz) wide, and can pass [[Broadcasting|audio]] and [[subcarrier]] frequencies up to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. [[Frequency deviation|Deviation]] is typically limited to 150&amp;nbsp;kHz total (±75&amp;nbsp;kHz) in order to prevent [[adjacent channel interference]] on the band. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-stereo [[subcarrier]]s, increasing total [[modulation]] by 0.5% for each 1% used by the subcarriers.

==OIRT bandplan==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[OIRT bandplan]] --&gt;
The [[OIRT]] FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74&amp;nbsp;MHz. It was used in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] and most of the other [[Warsaw pact]] member countries of the [[International Radio and Television Organisation]] in  [[Eastern Europe]] (OIRT), with the exception of [[East Germany]], which always used the 87.5 to 100 (later 104) MHz broadcast band—in line with Western Europe.

The [[Band I|lower portion of the VHF band]] [[Radio propagation|behaves]] a bit like [[shortwave radio]] in that it has a longer reach than the upper portion of the VHF band.  It was ideally suited for reaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception. In a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate interference from [[skywave]]s.

Following the collapse of the communist governments in Eastern Europe, the 87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz band began to be adopted and is now in use in all those countries. This was prompted by the lack of equipment for the band and the modernisation of existing transmission networks.

Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM band, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the USSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the lack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia.

Countries which still use the OIRT band are [[Russia]] (including [[Kaliningrad]]), [[Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvr.by/eng/radio/1-kanal/|title=1 канал. Первый национальный канал Белорусского радио|author=|date=|website=www.tvr.by|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moldova]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Code/2523/mdfmlist.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:47:57 http://www.egocities.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiofm.narod.ru/fmair.html|title=FM,УКВ-радиостанции в Украине|author=|date=|website=www.radiofm.narod.ru|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukradio.info/OIRT_Tuner/|title=OIRT Tuner|author=|date=|website=ukradio.info|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in 2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur radio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform propagation and interference experiments in the 70–70.5&amp;nbsp;MHz band.

In Belarus, only government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All stations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main purpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment.

In 2014, Russia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the "western") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to reach more listeners.

Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based on 30&amp;nbsp;kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200&amp;nbsp;kHz multiples. This may have been to reduce co-channel interference caused by [[Sporadic E propagation]] and other atmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However, multipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band.

Stereo is generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process called [[polar modulation]]. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25&amp;nbsp;kHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal structure: L + R --&gt; 31.25&amp;nbsp;kHz reduced subcarrier L - R.

The [[4-meter band]] (70–70.5&amp;nbsp;MHz) [[amateur radio]] allocation used in many European countries is entirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the [[6-meter band]] (50–54&amp;nbsp;MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there is an "opening" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing because the 4&amp;nbsp;meter amateur allocation is only 0.5&amp;nbsp;MHz or less, and a single broadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the band.

The [[Television channel frequencies#Eastern Europe|System D]] television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within the 87.5–108&amp;nbsp;MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D therefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to make full use of this band for audio broadcasting.

==Japanese bandplan==
{{See also|FM broadcasting in Japan}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The FM band in Japan is 76–95&amp;nbsp;MHz (previously 76–90). The 90–108&amp;nbsp;MHz section was used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each [[NTSC]] television channel was 6&amp;nbsp;MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19&amp;nbsp;MHz compared to slightly more than 20&amp;nbsp;MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations that can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial radio stations are forced to use [[AM broadcasting|AM]]. 

Many Japanese radios are capable of receiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same model can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz, the frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the radio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode or other internal component.

Conventional analog-tuned (dial &amp; pointer) radios may be marked with "TV Sound" in the 90–108 section. If these radios were sold in the US, for example, the 76–88 section would be marked TV sound for VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88–108 section band as normal FM.

Second-hand automobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM band, and importers often fit a "converter" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing an incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in undesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular international FM band (up to 20.5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide) to the only 14&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide Japanese band (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert modes), and the car's [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some converters simply down-convert the FM band by 12&amp;nbsp;MHz, leading to logical frequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the 102–108&amp;nbsp;MHz band. Also, [[Radio Data System|RDS]] is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car radios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow pass-through of the [[Medium wave|MW band]], which is used for AM broadcasting. A better solution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the country where the car will be used.
 
[[Australia]] had a similar situation with Australian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108&amp;nbsp;MHz, and was intending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due to CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in Australia for 76 to 90&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;This was taught at the [[TAFE|TAFE college]] Audio course of the electronic servicing certificate, and it is also part of the long story of the introduction of FM radio in Australia, which can be found in older Australian electronics magazines.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic U.S. bandplan==
Early FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42–50&amp;nbsp;MHz band&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wa2ise.com/radios/fm45.html  Regarding the 42—50&amp;nbsp;MHz FM band and the switchover] Accessed 2010-08-28&lt;/ref&gt; (this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations known as [[apex (radio band)|apex broadcasters]]). In 1941, the [[Yankee Network]], which was already using FM for AM station [[Feed (broadcasting)|feeds]], started operating a station, [[W39B]], in this band from a transmitter atop [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], [[New Hampshire]], the highest point in the northeast United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mountwashington.org/about/visitor/history/, retrieved 10-08-2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United States [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88.1–105.9&amp;nbsp;MHz band (later extended to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although converters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to rebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set FM radio back ten years.

The "devastating" change was successfully lobbied for (with the FCC) by [[RCA]], which did not want FM radio to become dominant, although the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted "an organized campaign of misinformation". This protected RCA's and other networks' investments in [[AM radio]], and avoided competition with [[television]], which RCA wanted to focus on.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Howard Armstrong#FM radio]], [[FM broadcasting in the United States]], [[Yankee Network]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76–88&amp;nbsp;MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main?main=DocumentDetail&amp;o=090000648064a653|title=In the Matter of Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services|author=Federal Communications Commission|date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2008-08-26|quote=Certain commenters have urged the Commission to give a "hard look" to a proposal that the Commission re-allocate TV Channels 5 and 6 for FM broadcasting}}  {{USFR|73|28400}}, 28403&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76&amp;nbsp;MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioworld.com/article/67266 Could EXB Band Be Your New Home?]''RadioWorld'' September 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==FM radio switch-off==
With the invention of [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB+]] radio, some countries have planned and started a [[Digital audio broadcasting#FM radio switch-off|FM radio switch-off]]. [[Norway]], in January 2018, was the first country to discontinue FM as a result.

The '''five techniques''' (also known as Deep-Interrogation) were illegal [[interrogation]] methods which were originally developed by the [[British military]] in other operational theatres and then applied to detainees during [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. They have been defined as prolonged [[Stress position|wall-standing]], [[hooding]], [[Sensory overload|subjection to noise]], [[Sleep deprivation|deprivation of sleep]], and [[Starvation|deprivation of food and drink]].{{sfn|Lauterpacht|Greenwood|1980|p=198}}

They were first used in Northern Ireland in 1971 as part of [[Operation Demetrius]] – the mass arrest and [[internment]] (imprisonment without trial) of people suspected of involvement with the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). Out of those arrested, fourteen were subjected to a programme of "deep interrogation" using the five techniques. This took place at [[Shackleton Barracks|a secret interrogation centre]] in Northern Ireland. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept [[hooding|hooded]] and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a [[stress position]] for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was prolonged pain, physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=mcguffin4&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea4.htm Chapter 4: The Experiment].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcguffin6&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea6.htm Chapter 6: Replay].&lt;/ref&gt; It also resulted in long-term [[psychological trauma]]. The fourteen became known as "[[The Hooded Men 1971|the Hooded Men]]"  and were the only detainees in Northern Ireland subjected to all five techniques together. Other detainees were subjected to at least one of the five techniques along with other interrogation methods.&lt;ref name=mcguffin9&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea9.htm Chapter 9: Down on the Killing Floor].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] ruled that the five techniques amounted to torture. The case was then referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. In 1978 the court ruled that the techniques were "inhuman and degrading" and breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but did not amount to "torture". In 2014, after new information was uncovered that showed the decision to use methods of torture in Northern Ireland in 1971-1972 had been taken by ministers,&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/british-ministers-sanctioned-torture-of-ni-internees-1.1820882&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] asked the European Court of Human Rights to review its judgement and acknowledge the five techniques as torture.

The Court's ruling that the five techniques did not amount to torture was later cited by the [[United States]] and [[Israel]] to justify their own interrogation methods,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caj.org.uk/contents/1264 "The Hooded Men - joint press release from CAJ and the Pat Finucane Centre"]. [[Committee on the Administration of Justice]]. 24 November 2014. Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which included the five techniques.&lt;ref name=papertrail&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/belfast-and-beyond/paper-trail-northern-ireland%E2%80%99s-hooded-men-cia%E2%80%99s-global-torture "Paper trail: from Northern Ireland's hooded men to CIA's global torture"]. [[Amnesty International]]. 9 December 2014.

BBC News. 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iraq War]], the illegal use of the five techniques by British soldiers contributed to the [[death of Baha Mousa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14825889 "Baha Mousa inquiry: 'Serious discipline breach' by army"].

==Parker Report==&lt;!-- [[Parker Report (1972)]] redirects to this section heading if this is changed please change the redirect--&gt;
In response to the public and Parliamentary disquiet on 16 November 1971, the Government commissioned a committee of inquiry chaired by [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] to look into the legal and moral aspects of the use of the five techniques.

The "Parker Report"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/parker.htm |title=Report of the committee of Privy Counsellors appointed to consider authorised procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism|accessdate=30 December 2012}} held at [[CAIN]] part of [[Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive|ARK]] in collaboration with [[Queen's University Belfast]] and [[University of Ulster]]&lt;/ref&gt; was published on 2 March 1972, and had found the five techniques to be illegal under domestic law:
{{quotation|10.  Domestic Law ...(c) We have received both written and oral representations from many legal bodies and individual lawyers from both England and Northern Ireland. There has been no dissent from the view that the procedures are illegal alike by the law of England and the law of Northern Ireland. ... (d) This being so, no Army Directive and no Minister could lawfully or validly have authorised the use of the procedures. Only Parliament can alter the law. The procedures were and are illegal.}}

On the same day (2 March 1972), the United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] stated in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]:
{{quotation|[The] Government, having reviewed the whole matter with great care and with reference to any future operations, have decided that the techniques ... will not be used in future as an aid to interrogation... The statement that I have made covers all future circumstances.}}
Directives expressly prohibiting the use of the techniques, whether singly or in combination, were then issued to the security forces by the Government.{{sfn|Lauterpacht|Greenwood|1980|p=241}} These are still in force and the use of such methods by UK security forces would not be condoned by the Government.

==European Commission of Human Rights inquiries and findings==

The Irish Government, on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods, took a case to the
[[European Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="IrlUK"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:u7wX9dL11d4J:www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;lr=lang_en |chapter=Ireland v United Kingdom 1976 |title=Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights |pages= 512, 748, 788–94 |location=Strasbourg |publisher=European Commission on Human Rights |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission stated that it
"considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture, on the grounds that (1) the intensity of the stress caused by techniques creating sensory deprivation "directly affects the personality physically and mentally"; and (2) "the systematic application of the techniques for the purpose of inducing a person to give information shows a clear resemblance to those methods of systematic torture which have been known over the ages... a modern system of torture falling into the same category as those systems... applied in previous times as a means of obtaining information and confessions".&lt;ref name="IrlUK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/prohibits_torture.htm |title=Security Detainees/Enemy Combatants: US Law Prohibits Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment |page=Footnote 16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120013416/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/prohibits_torture.htm |archivedate=20 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Weissbrodt |url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc |title=materials on torture and other ill-treatment: 3.

==European Court of Human Rights trial ''Ireland v. the United Kingdom''== &lt;!--!Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)]] redirects to this section heading--&gt;

The Commission's findings were appealed. In 1978, in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) trial ''Ireland v. United Kingdom'' (5310/71) [1978] ECHR 1, the facts were not in dispute and the judges court published the following in their judgement:
{{quotation|These methods, sometimes termed "disorientation" or "[[sensory deprivation]]" techniques, were not used in any cases other than the fourteen so indicated above.  It emerges from the [[European Commission of Human Rights|Commission's]] establishment of the facts that the techniques consisted of:
*(a) wall-standing: forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a "stress position", described by those who underwent it as being "spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers";
* (b) hooding: putting a black or navy coloured bag over the detainees' heads and, at least initially, keeping it there all the time except during interrogation;
*(c) subjection to noise: pending their interrogations, holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise;
*(d) deprivation of sleep: pending their interrogations, depriving the detainees of sleep;
*(e) deprivation of food and drink: subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the centre and pending interrogations.&lt;ref name="Ireland.v. UK-96"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695383&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=Ireland v. the United Kingdom 28 October 2016}} Paragraph 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These were referred to by the court as the '''five techniques'''. The court ruled:
{{quotation|
{{ordered list| start=167
| ... Although the five techniques, as applied in combination, undoubtedly amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, although their object was the extraction of confessions, the naming of others and/or information and although they were used systematically, '''they did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture''' as so understood. ...
|  The Court concludes that recourse to the five techniques '''amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment''', which practice was in breach of'' [the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]] ''[[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 3 - prohibition of torture|Article 3 (art. 3)]].&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK-167-168"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695383&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=Ireland v. the United Kingdom}} Paragraphs 167 and 168&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

On 8 February 1977, in proceedings before the ECHR, and in line with the findings of the Parker report and United Kingdom Government policy, the Attorney-General of the United Kingdom stated that
{{quotation|The Government of the United Kingdom have considered the question of the use of the 'five techniques' with very great care and with particular regard to Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.  They now give this unqualified undertaking, that the 'five techniques' will not in any circumstances be reintroduced as an aid to interrogation.&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK-102"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695383&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=Ireland v. the United Kingdom}} Paragraph 102&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Irish Government seek to re-open case==

On 2 December 2014, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, [[Charles Flanagan]] TD announced that the Irish Government had asked European Court of Human Rights to revise its judgment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/press-releases/press-release-archive/2014/december/hooded-men-case-northern-ireland/|title=Statement on 'Hooded Men' case - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|last=Affairs|first=Department of Foreign|website=www.dfa.ie|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; following evidence uncovered by an [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] documentary called The Torture Files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/player/prime-time/2014/0604/|title=Prime Time Web: RTÉ Investigations Unit: The Torture Files|website=www.rte.ie|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Ramsdale Witton-(1901).jpeg|thumb|300px|right|Lieutenant G.R. Witton, Bushveldt Carbineers (1901).]]
'''George Ramsdale Witton''' (1874 – 14 August 1942) was a lieutenant in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in [[South Africa]].

He was sentenced to death for murder after the shooting of nine Boer prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Woolmore, pp. 142–144.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently reprieved by Lieutenant-General Viscount [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], although Lieutenants [[Peter Handcock]] and [[Harry Morant|Harry "Breaker" Morant]] who had been [[Court martial of Breaker Morant|court martialed]] with him were executed by firing squad on 27 February 1902.

==Early life and involvement in the Boer War==
Witton was born into a farming family near [[Warrnambool]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. He served as a gunner in the [[Royal Australian Artillery]], then enlisted in the [[Victorian Imperial Bushmen]] for the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] and was promoted from [[Corporal#Australia|Corporal]] to [[Squadron Quartermaster Sergeant#United Kingdom|Squadron Quartermaster-Sergeant]]. [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] Robert Lenehan then enlisted him into the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] with a commission as [[Lieutenant#Army ranks|Lieutenant]].

After the killing of a number of Boer prisoners, Witton was one of four officers charged by the [[British Army]] with murder, and was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19020404&amp;id=H-1hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ypEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6935,6526798&amp;hl=en Sidney Morning Herald April 4, 1902 Witton wrote he had fired at a escaping Boer to keep him away, although later in "Scrapgoats of the Empire" He admitted that he had shot a escaping Boer prisoner who had tried to seize Witton's carbine]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he strongly protested and secured a legal opinion from [[Isaac Isaacs]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]], an Australian member of parliament, who recommended that he petition [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|HM the King]] for a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/doview/nla.aus-vn311069-p.pdf Opinion of the Hon. Isaac A. Isaacs K.C., M.P., re the case of Lieutenant Witton] at nla.gov.au, accessed 21 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
Kitchener commuted Witton's sentence to life imprisonment. After further protests, he was released on 11 August 1904, although not pardoned. He had been ill twice in prison in England, once from [[arsenic]] fumes in a metal shop and once from [[typhoid fever]]. He returned to Australia on 12 November 1904, embittered after three years in prison, and wrote a book giving his version of the events involving Morant, Handcock and the BVC.

==''Scapegoats of the Empire'' book and later life==
His book, ''Scapegoats of the Empire'' was originally published in 1907 by D. W. Paterson of [[Melbourne]], but was long unavailable. It is claimed that prior to its reprint in 1982 by the Australian publishing house [[Angus &amp; Robertson]], only seven copies of the book survived in various Australian state libraries and in the possession of Witton's family. Although unsubstantiated, it has long been claimed that the book was suppressed by the Australian government and most copies were destroyed;{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} another explanation is that most of the copies were destroyed in an accidental fire at the publisher's warehouse. The 1982 reprinting was inspired by the success of a film based on the book, entitled [[Breaker Morant (film)|''Breaker Morant'']]. George Witton's cousin, Cecily Adams of Castlecrag Sydney, owned the copyright for "Scapegoats of the Empire" following George's death. Cecily was also aware of some additional documentation written by George Witton, which he had asked not to be released until after his death. Cecily was determined that a further edition, which included this additional material, should be published and in 1989 an edition was published by ADLIB BOOKS of Bath, by arrangement with Cecily Adams as the copyright owner and Angus &amp; Robertson (UK). &lt;ref&gt; &lt;Cecily Adams' daughter Berenice (Berry) Dunston&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Witton's main assertion, as indicated by the book's provocative title, was that he, Morant, and Handcock were made [[scapegoat]]s by the British authorities in [[South Africa]] — that they were made to take the blame for widespread British [[war crime]]s against the Boers, and that the trial and executions were carried out by the British for political reasons, partly to cover up a controversial and secret "no prisoners" policy promulgated by [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], and partly to appease the Boer government over the killing of Boer prisoners, in order to facilitate a peace treaty; the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed on 31 May 1902.

Witton also claimed that many of the accusations about them, which led to their arrest and trial, were made by disaffected members of their regiment whose rebellious behaviour had been suppressed by Morant and Handcock.

When [[World War I]] broke out, an embittered Witton did not rush to enlist. After former and future [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Andrew Fisher]] pledged during the [[Australian federal election, 1914|1914 general election]] that Australia would defend Britain "[[Andrew Fisher#Third government 1914–15|to the last man and last shilling]]," Witton intimated that he would be that last man. He lived in [[Gippsland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and in [[Queensland]] where he was a dairy farmer. He married twice, but did not have any children. He had a heart attack while cranking his car engine, and died in hospital on 14 August 1942. He was buried&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=43325 Witton George Ramsdale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613053017/https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=43325 |date=13 June 2012 }} — Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brisbane|Brisbane's]] [[Lutwyche Cemetery]] which, coincidentally, is located on the corner of Gympie and Kitchener Roads.

==2009 petitions for review of court martial ==
{{main|Pardon for Morant, Handcock and Witton}}
In 2009, an Australian lawyer and naval reservist, Commander Jim Unkles, submitted personal [[petition]]s, requesting a review of the convictions for Morant, Handcock and Witton, to [[The Crown]], in the form of:
* [[Queen Elizabeth II]] personally
* the Australian government, in the form of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Petitions Committee

The petitions committee considered Unkles' petition on 15 March 2010. He appeared before it, along with others including historian Craig Wilcox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/commttee/R12891.pdf |title=Petition regarding the convictions of Morant, Handcock and Witton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017072314/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/commttee/R12891.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee member [[Alex Hawke]] MHR stated: "there is in my view serious and compelling evidence that some form of redress should be given, all these years later, to those men executed by the British".&lt;ref&gt;''Hansard'' "House of Representatives Grievance Debate", 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Attorney-General of Australia]], [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McLelland]] referred the petition to the UK government.

On behalf of the Crown, Unkles' petition was rejected by UK [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Liam Fox]], in November 2010.

The '''Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States''' ('''HTSUS'''), also referred to as the '''Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated''' ('''HTSA'''), is the primary resource for determining [[tariff]] (customs duties) classifications for goods imported into the [[United States]]. It can also be used in place of Schedule B for classifying goods exported from the United States to foreign countries.&lt;ref name=usitc_tata&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usitc.gov/tata/index.htm|title=Tariff Information Center|accessdate=1 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006034321/http://www.usitc.gov/tata/index.htm|archivedate=6 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harmonized Tariff Schedule classifies a good based on its name, use, and/or the material used in its construction and assigns it a ten-digit classification code number, and there are over 17,000 unique classification code numbers. Although the [[United States International Trade Commission|U.S. International Trade Commission]] publishes and maintains the Schedule in its various forms, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] is the only agency that can provide legally binding advice or rulings on classification of imports.&lt;ref name=usitc_tata_hts/&gt;

The Schedule is based on the international [[Harmonized System]], the global system of nomenclature that is used to describe most world trade in goods, maintained by the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO).&lt;ref name="usitc_tata_hts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/index.htm|title=Official Harmonized Tariff Schedule|accessdate=27 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all countries base their tariff schedules on the WCO's Harmonized System.

==History==
The HTS was enacted by subtitle&amp;nbsp;B of title&amp;nbsp;I of the [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act]] of 1988, and became effective on January 1, 1989, replacing the previous Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). The United States had not adopted the previous international nomenclatures, but signed on as a member to the [[World Customs Organization]], which created the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC) and the [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs Service]]—predecessor to [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Homeland Security]]). Such organizations helped develop the HTS throughout the 1970s.

In 1981, President [[Ronald Reagan]] requested that the U.S.&amp;nbsp;International Trade Commission prepare a draft of the U.S. tariff schedules using HTS nomenclature. This conversion was issued in June 1983, and after lengthy review from interested parties, replaced the TSUS on August&amp;nbsp;23, 1988 with the enactment of the [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act]].

== Chapters ==

The tariff schedule has 99 chapters under 22 sections, and various appendices for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and intermediate chemicals for [[Acid dye|dye]]. Raw materials or basic substances generally appear in the early chapters and in earlier headings within a chapter, whereas highly processed goods and manufactured articles appear in later chapters and headings. For example, Section&amp;nbsp;I and Section&amp;nbsp;II cover animals and plants, while Sections&amp;nbsp;XVI, XVII, and XVIII cover "Machinery and Mechanical Applicances", "Vehicles, Aircraft, and Vessels", and "Precision Instruments, Clocks and Watches, and Musical Instruments".

This is not a hard-and-fast rule, however; "toys" appear in Chapter 95 and "works of art" are found in Chapter 97. Chapter 77 is "reserved for possible future use".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">The '''Hutchins Commission''' (whose official name was the '''Commission on Freedom of the Press''') was formed during [[World War II]], when [[Henry Luce]] (publisher of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines) asked [[Robert Hutchins]] (president of the [[University of Chicago]]) to recruit a commission to inquire into the proper function of the [[Media (communication)|media]] in a modern [[democracy]]. The commission was established as a response to criticism from the public and government over media ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = America's Battle for Media Democracy|last = Pickard|first = Victor|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Commission chair, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Hutchins]] had the duty of selecting members for the Commission, but he ran his picks by [[Henry Luce]] first. The final commission was made up of twelve prominent intellectuals, all white upper-class men. Although all members were respected intellectuals with sterling reputations, none was a journalist. [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Hutchins]] thought the commission would be more open-minded if it contained no journalists, but enemies of the Commission, particularly in the press, used that to attack its credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickard|first1=Victor|title=America's Battle for Media Democracy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=146–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After deliberating for four years, the Commission came to this conclusion in 1947: the press plays an important role in the development and stability of modern society and, as such, it is imperative that a commitment of social responsibility be imposed on mass media. According to this [[social responsibility]] theory, the press has a moral obligation to consider the overall needs of society when making journalistic decisions in order to produce the greatest good. Though there had been journalism "codes of ethics" for decades, the Commission's report was considered landmark by some scholars; they believed it was a pivotal reassertion of modern media's role in a democratic society.

Social-responsibility theory was born at a time (just after [[Franklin Roosevelt]]’s death) when large and powerful publishers were unpopular with the public, and when the public had a high degree of suspicions about the motivations and objectives of the press. The press had mushroomed into an unwieldy and powerful entity, and criticism of the [[Fourth Estate]] was widespread. Critics contended that the media had [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] tendencies, that corporate owners were not concerned with the rights or interests of those unlike themselves, and that [[Commercialism|commercialization]] produced a debased culture as well as dangerously selfish politics.

Social-responsibility theory thus proposes that the media take it upon themselves to elevate society's standards, providing citizens with the information they need to govern themselves. It is in the best interest of the media to do this; if they do not, social theorists warn, the public will demand that the government regulate the media.

Some scholars (among them John C. Nerone) have speculated whether journalistic fairness and balance already existed prior to the Commission’s report. Were the Commission's conclusions merely an "adjustment" in [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]], brought on by perceived business demands? [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarians]] (who prioritize individual liberty and seek to minimize the power of the state) are wary of the social-responsibility theory; they believe that responsibility means accountability, accountability means government intervention, and government intervention comes at the expense of liberty. Indeed, the Commission noted that continued misuse of press power would necessitate regulation.

The '''Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies''' is a non-partisan, independent academic center designed to explore the impact of [[antitrust]] enforcement on the individual consumer and public, and to shape policy issues.  It is located at [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

The School of Law created the institute in 1994 at the direction of then-dean Nina S. Appel, Professor Jane H. Locke, and a variety of other supporters.  Funding for the institute was provided via a [[cy pres]] award from the late [[Hubert Louis Will|United States District Judge Hubert Will]] with funds remaining from a large antitrust settlement.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Beverage Co. v. Owens-Illinois'', 827 F. Supp. 477, 482-83 (N.D. Ill. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the institute celebrated its 15th anniversary.

Beginning in 2000, Professor Spencer Waller became director of the institute.  Professor Waller has authored numerous scholarly articles and several books on the subject of antitrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=145112 |title=SSRN Author Page for Waller, Spencer Weber |publisher=[[SSRN]] |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to joining the institute, Professor Waller served as associate dean at Brooklyn Law School.  In addition to teaching, Professor Waller practiced with the [[United States Department of Justice]] Antitrust and Criminal Divisions and with the Chicago law firm of Freeborn &amp; Peters.

== Fellowship ==

===Student Fellowship Program===

The institute promotes the study and discussion of consumer and competition law issues through its [http://www.luc.edu/law/centers/antitrust/fellowship.html Student Fellowship Program], which began in January 2001. Fellows are law students chosen from among applicants who meet certain minimum requirements, including academic achievement (fellows must be in the top one-third of their class), an interest in pursuing a career in antitrust or consumer protection, and complete requisite coursework.[3] The institute provides fellows with a stipend.

Fellows attend all institute events as well as special programs designed to inform them of current topics of interest in competition law, practice and policy. These special programs introduce the fellows to the key policymakers in the public and private sectors. Each year, the institute sends fellows to the ABA Section of Antitrust Spring Meeting. In addition, fellows engage in externships with organizations such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[Illinois Attorney General]], public interest groups and private law firms.

The fellows write papers on timely antitrust and consumer protection issues, recent Supreme Court decisions and new developments in these fields. To see a few of the more recent papers written by fellows, scholars and institute faculty members, please click here,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luc.edu/law/centers/antitrust/publications/news_views/index.html|title=School of Law - Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies: Loyola University Chicago |publisher=Luc.edu |date=2014-04-21 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or see below under News &amp; Views.

Alumni of the Student Fellowship Program work at a wide variety of law firms, government agencies and corporate counsel offices. The institute has alumni who followed career paths at the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division]], the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] and Brooklyn Legal Services Foreclosure Defense.

'''''Jennings v Buchanan''''' [2004] NZPC 4; [2004] UKPC 36; [2005] 2 NZLR 577; [2005] 1 AC 115 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding [[defamation]] and the defence of [[parliamentary privilege]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1997, during a parliamentary debate, ACT MP [[Owen Jennings]] made a claim about an unnamed member of the [[New Zealand Wool Board|Wool Board]] who had arranged a sponsorship by the NZWB for a rugby event, in order that he could take his mistress on the tour to carry on their "illicit affair".

Whilst he did not name this official, most people knew he was talking about NZWB member Roger Buchanan.

Unfortunately for Buchanan, as this comment was made in Parliament, Jennings was protected by parliamentary privilege.

However, several months later, during an interview with ''[[The Independent Business Weekly|The Independent]]'' newspaper, Jennings said that he “did not resile from his claim about the officials' relationship”, and as a result, Buchanan sued Jennings in defamation for his comments in the subsequent interview.

Jennings defended the matter, saying that he was merely repeating comments he made in Parliament, and those original comments were absolutely protected by parliamentary privilege.

==Held==
The court ruled that privilege did not apply in the interview, and so his defence failed.

[[File:Taos County, New Mexico. Justice of the Peace Montoyo hears a minor case. - NARA - 522002.tif|thumb|right|Taos County, New Mexico. Justice of the Peace Montoyo hears a minor case. (1941)]]
A '''justice of the peace''' ('''JP''') is a [[judicial officer]] of a lower or ''[[puisne]]'' court, elected or appointed by means of a commission ([[letters patent]]) to keep the peace. In past centuries the term '''commissioner of the peace''' was often used with the same meaning. Depending on the jurisdiction, such justices dispense [[Summary offence|summary justice]] or merely deal with local administrative applications in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve, and are (or were) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office. Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs.

==History==
In 1195, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (''"the Lionheart"'') of England and his Minister [[Hubert Walter]] commissioned certain [[knight]]s to preserve the peace in unruly areas. They were responsible to the King for ensuring that the law was upheld and preserving the "[[Queen's peace|King's peace]]". Therefore, they were known as "keepers of the peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles Austin|last= Beard|authorlink=Charles Austin Beard|title= The Office of Justice of the Peace in England in Its Origin and Development|publisher= Columbia University Press|year= 1904|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_office_of_justice_of_the_peace_of_En.html?id=lyGyAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An act of 1327 had referred to "good and lawful men" to be appointed in every county in the land to "guard the peace"; such individuals were first referred to as [[conservator of the peace|conservators of the peace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Conservator|volume=6|page=977}}&lt;/ref&gt; or wardens of the peace. The title ''justice of the peace'' derives from 1361,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |title=Justices of the Peace Act 1361 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=17 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416050654/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. The "peace" to be guarded is the sovereign's, the maintenance of which is the duty of the [[The Crown|Crown]] under the [[royal prerogative]]. Justices of the peace still use the power conferred or re-conferred on them since 1361 to [[bind over]] unruly persons "to be of good behaviour". The bind over is not a punishment, but a preventive measure, intended to ensure that people thought likely to offend will not do so. The justices' alternative title of "[[magistrate]]" dates from the 16th century, although the word had been in use centuries earlier to describe some legal officials of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the centuries from the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] period until the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the JPs constituted a major element of the English (later British) governmental system, which had been termed sometimes [[squirearchy]] (i.e., dominance of the land-owning [[gentry]]). For example, historian [[Tim Blanning]] notes&lt;ref&gt;Tim Blanning, "[[The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815]]", Penguin, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary [[absolute monarchies]] such as France – a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the same social class as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground.

Being an unpaid office, undertaken voluntarily and sometimes more for the sake of renown or to confirm the justice's standing within the community, the justice was typically a member of the [[gentry]]. The justices of the peace conducted [[arraignment]]s in all criminal cases, and tried [[misdemeanour]]s and [[infraction]]s of [[local ordinance]]s and [[bylaw]]s. Towns and boroughs with enough burdensome judicial business that could not find volunteers for the unpaid role of justice of the peace had to petition the Crown for authority to hire a paid [[stipendiary magistrate]].

The [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] stripped the power to appoint normal JPs from those municipal corporations that had it. This was replaced by the present system, where the [[Lord Chancellor]] nominates candidates with local advice, for appointment by the [[British monarchy|Crown]].

Until the introduction of elected [[county council]]s in the 19th century, JPs, in [[quarter sessions]], also administered the county at a local level. They fixed wages, regulated food supplies, built and controlled roads and bridges, and undertook to provide and supervise locally those services mandated by the Crown and Parliament for the welfare of the county.

Women were not allowed to become JPs in the United Kingdom until 1919, the first woman being [[Ada Summers]], the Mayor of [[Stalybridge]], who was a JP (''Ex officio'') by virtue of her office. In October 1920 Ada was appointed a JP officially, alongside other pioneers like Miriam Lightowler OBE in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~calderdalecompanion/blw3.jpg|title=Calderdale companion|last=|first=|date=June 1958|website=freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Murphy]] of Edmonton, Canada, preceded her by some three and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne Hope Sanders, "Emily Murphy: Crusader", Macmillan, Toronto, 1945;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Mander, "Emily Murphy: Rebel", Simon &amp; Pierre, Toronto, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the UK, 50% of JPs are women.

In special circumstances, a justice of the peace can be the highest governmental representative, so in fact 'gubernatorial', in a colonial entity. This was the case in the [[Tati Concessions Land]], a gold-mining [[concession (territory)]] in the [[Matabeleland|Matabele kingdom]], until its annexation by the [[British Bechuanaland]] protectorate.

==Modern use==

===Australia===
A justice of the peace in Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s and [[affidavit]]s and to certify copies of original documents. Criteria for appointment vary widely, depending on the state.

====Queensland====
In the state of [[Queensland]], a "justice of the peace (qualified)" has the additional powers to issue search warrants and arrest warrants and, in conjunction with another justice of the peace (qualified) constitute a [[Magistrates Court of Queensland|magistrates' court]] for exercising powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/legal-mediation-and-justice-of-the-peace/about-justice-of-the-peace/jps-services/|title=Queensland Government|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.qld.gov.au/jpapp/frequently-asked-questions|title=Queensland Government Department of Justice and Attorney-General|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://qja.com.au/|title=Queensland Justices Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace (magistrates' court), usually in remote [[indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] communities, to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary [[magistrate]].

In Queensland, a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP (Magistrate's Court). A commissioner for declarations (C.dec) has powers limited to witnessing documents, witnessing statutory declarations, witnessing affidavits, witnessing and administering oaths and affirmations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first woman to become a JP in Queensland was Matilda (Maud) Hennessey of [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] on 24 April 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article169925667 |title=MACKAY WOMAN J.P. |newspaper=[[Daily Mercury]] |volume=60, |issue=4733 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=31 December 1927 |accessdate=20 January 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article220499392 |title=OUR FIRST LADY C.P.S. |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |issue=4753 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=30 March 1918 |accessdate=20 January 2018 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Victoria====
Justices of the peace and bail justices, who are also volunteers, are appointed to serve a semi-judicial function in all areas of the Victorian community. The main official roles in the Victorian community include witnessing statutory declarations, witnessing affidavits and hearing bail matters outside court hours (bail justices only).

The first woman to become a JP in Victoria was Mary Catherine Rogers who, in 1920, became the first woman councillor in [[Australia]] when she was elected in the [[City of Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article184978063 |title=LABOR WOMAN'S DEATH. |newspaper=[[Daily Standard]] |issue=6156 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=8 October 1932 |accessdate=20 January 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justices of the peace (JPs) provide a service to the community as independent witnesses of statutory declarations, powers of attorney and affidavits. JPs, who are also volunteers, are selected through an extensive interview, written exam and practical testing.  They are recommended by the state attorney-general and appointed by the governor-in-council, and it is their job to authorise and witness statutory declarations and affidavits within the state of Victoria. There are currently around 4,800 JPs serving in all areas of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/utility/volunteering/become+a+justice+of+the+peace+or+bail+justice|title=Become a justice of the peace or bail justice|first=Justice, Department of Justice and|last=Regulation|website=www.justice.vic.gov.au|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Bail justices=====

The role of a bail justice is to hear bail applications (under the [[Bail Act 1977]]) and to hear applications for interim accommodation orders for children (under the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1989]]) within Victoria. Bail justices, once appointed, may remain in their role until they turn 70 years of age (although they must be under 65 at the time of their appointment). They are often required to attend call outs and rule on bail applications or protection applications for children in danger on weekends and late at night when the courts are closed, but they can also witness Victorian statutory declarations and affidavits. Candidates must successfully complete a three-day training course run by the Department of Justice. Bail justices, who are also volunteers, also have some limited powers under federal legislation, including the power to conduct interstate extradition hearings and extending question time for federal police. Bail Justices may use the [[post-nominal]]s BJ after their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/|title=Home|first=Justice, Department of Justice and|last=Regulation|website=www.justice.vic.gov.au|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New South Wales ====
The most common functions performed by a justice of the peace in New South Wales are to witness the signing of a statutory declaration, witness the signing of an affidavit and certify that a copy of an original document is a true copy.&lt;ref name="jp.nsw.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.nsw.gov.au/jp/findjp/using_jp_services.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425171932/http://www.jp.nsw.gov.au/jp/findjp/using_jp_services.html |archivedate=25 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

JPs are appointed by the Governor of New South Wales for five-year terms. They are volunteers, who come from all walks of life and all sections of the community. JPs are people who are trusted to be honest, careful and impartial when performing the functions of a JP. They must not charge a fee or accept a gift for providing JP services, tell people what to write in a statutory declaration or affidavit or write it for them or give them legal advice.&lt;ref name="jp.nsw.gov.au"/&gt;

Ways to find a JP in New South Wales include:
1. Search the JP Public Register. The register lists all JPs for each postcode area and provides a telephone contact number for JPs who serve the community directly. 
2. Check a public listing of scheduled JP services to find when JPs are available at scheduled times and locations across the state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jp.nsw.gov.au/jp/findjp.html,c=y {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929103304/http://www.jp.nsw.gov.au/jp/findjp.html%2Cc%3Dy |date=29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Australia====
In South Australia, there are two types of justices: justice of the peace and special justices.

A justice of the peace (JP) in South Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s, [[affidavit]]s, [[Waiver|waiver rights]], [[search warrants]], [[drug warrants]], divorce documents, and to certify copies of original documents and to witness the signing of [[power of attorney]] and [[guardianship documents]], providing the JP is satisfied with the capability of the signatory.

A Special Justice (SJ) is a higher level of justice of the peace in South Australia; they sit on the bench of the [[Magistrates' Court of South Australia|magistrates' court]] hearing cases in the petty sessions division.

The South Australian Attorney-General has set up a web site to locate justices of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jp.agd.sa.gov.au/JPPublicWeb/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822033842/http://jp.agd.sa.gov.au/JPPublicWeb/ |archivedate=22 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of metropolitan and many regional Councils (Local Government authorities) have a rotational justice of the peace in residence at nominated times.

South Australia's first women justices were appointed in July 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105479357 |title=The Lady and the Law |newspaper=[[The Daily Herald (Adelaide)|Daily Herald]] |volume=6, |issue=1652 |location=South Australia |date=8 July 1915 |accessdate=30 August 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Australia====
Justices of the peace in Western Australia are appointed by the Governor who authorises them to carry out a wide range of official administrative and judicial duties in the community.

As well as presiding in the Magistrates Court, justices of the peace are regularly called upon by the WA Police to sign search warrants and authorise the issuing of summonses. The administrative tasks include witnessing affidavits and documents such as wills and statutory declarations.

'Visiting justices' are a special group of justices of the peace, appointed to preside over cases within the prison system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.dotag.wa.gov.au/R/role_of_a_jp.aspx?uid=2897-5148-1394-4484|title=Role of a Justice of the Peace|first=J. P.|last=Branch|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
In [[Belgium]], the [[justice of the peace (Belgium)|justice of the peace]] ({{lang-fr|juge de paix}}, {{lang-nl|vrederechter}}) is a law-trained judge who sits the lowest [[Court of record]] with [[original jurisdiction]] over [[small claims]] (less than €2500) matters of civil, commercial, and family law, including: tenancy and lease disputes, neighborhood disputes (party structures, trespassing, noise pollution), apartment buildings, small deceased estates, alimony, guardianships &amp; adoption, and the commitment of mental patients and oversight of their care. Litigants may opt either for conciliation or trial. Lawyers may act as ''locum tenens'' JPs.

===Canada===
In Canada, justices of the peace play a role in the administration of justice at the provincial level. Justices are generally appointed by the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors of Canada's provinces]], and by the [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|commissioners of Canada's territories]], on the [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of their relevant [[Prime minister|premier]] or [[Attorney General]]. Canada made the first appointment in the then British Empire of a woman as a magistrate, namely [[Emily Murphy]], who was sworn in as a police magistrate in the Women's Court of the City of Edmonton (Alberta) on 19 June 1916.

==== British Columbia ====
In [[British Columbia]], pursuant to the ''Provincial Court Act'', all judges are justices of the peace, and hence all of them are [[peace officer]]s.

==== Northwest Territories ====
In the [[Northwest Territories]], justices may hear summary conviction matters, municipal by-laws, and certain criminal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwtcourts.ca/Courts/jp.htm|title=Northwest Territories Courts|website=|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in more populated provinces justices usually preside over bail hearings and provincial offences courts. When not in a court session, a justice can perform other judicial functions, such as issuing search warrants.

==== Ontario ====
In [[Ontario]], justices perform a wide variety of duties related to criminal and regulatory law, at the federal, provincial and municipal levels. Ontario JP wear a green sash versus red worn by judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/04/10/only-five-of-14-new-justices-of-the-peace-have-a-law-degree-does-that-make-sense.html|title=Only five of 14 new justices of the peace have a law degree: Does that make sense?|first=Jacques|last=Gallant|date=10 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2017|via=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quebec ====
In Quebec, there are two type of justices of the peace, administrative justice of the peace and presiding justice of the peace.

Administrative justice of the peace are court officers appointed by the [[Ministry of Justice (Quebec)|Minister of Justice]], and perform duties such as receiving criminal informations and issuing warrants. Presiding justice of the peace are appointed by commission under the [[Great Seal of Quebec|Great Seal]], and can try some criminal matters and issue warrants. They are appointed from advocates of at least ten years' standing and serve full-time until the age of 70.

==== Yukon ====
In Yukon, justices of the peace are lay officers of the court. They sit in the Justice of the Peace Court, which is part of the [[Territorial Court of Yukon]].

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the historical functions of justices of the peace have been replaced by full-time, legally qualified [[Judiciary of Hong Kong#The Magistrates’ Courts|magistrates]]. Nowadays, justices of the peace are essentially titles of honour given by the Government to community leaders, and to certain officials while they are in their terms of offices. They have no judicial functions, and their main duties include visiting prisons, institutions for young offenders and drug addicts, psychiatric hospitals, remand homes, places of refuge, reception and detention centres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/jp/eng/main_g.htm |title=About Justice of the Peace, Government of Hong Kong |publisher=Info.gov.hk |date=1 April 2000 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; administering statutory declarations, and serving as members of advisory panels.

===India===
In India, justices of the peace do exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mppolice.gov.in/static/IPC%20and%20CrPC/IPC/chapter21.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920124842/http://www.mppolice.gov.in/static/IPC%20and%20CrPC/IPC/chapter21.htm |archivedate=20 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they no longer occupy a prominent post. One of the famous justices in India was [[Kavasji Jamshedji Petigara]].

Maharaja Prabirendra Mohan Tagore son of Maharaja Sir Prodyut Kumar Tagore KCSI of Calcutta was designated Justice of the Peace in 1932. He played a great part in saving more than 200 Muslim lives during the infamous riots in 1947 during the [[partition of India]], by sheltering the Muslims in the Calcutta locality and most importantly in his palace itself.

===Ireland===
Justices of the peace existed in Ireland prior to 1922, sitting in a bench under the supervision of [[resident magistrate]]s at [[petty sessions]] to try minor offences summarily, and with a [[county court]] judge (in his capacity of chairman of quarter sessions) and jury to try more serious offences at [[quarter sessions]]. In the [[Irish Free State]] the position was effectively abolished by the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1923/en/act/pub/0006/sec0004.html#sec4 |title=District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, Section 4 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and permanently abolished by the [[Courts of Justice Act 1924]]. Their judicial powers were replaced by full-time, legally qualified [[District Court (Ireland)|district justices]] (now called district judges) and their quasi-judicial powers by lay [[Peace Commissioner]]s. Peace commissioners may sign statutory declarations, and may issue summons and search warrants to the [[Garda Síochána]] (Irish police).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepost.ie/archives/2005/0220/so-you-want-to-become-a-peace-commissioner-2474.html |title=So you want to become a peace commissioner? |work=The Post |location=Ireland |date=20 February 2005 |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Peace Commissioner cannot sign an Affidavit, in Ireland that function is performed by a Commissioner for Oaths.

===Jamaica===
A justice of the peace (JP), according to the Ministry of Justice, is a person of unquestionable integrity who seeks to promote and protect the rights of the individual and helps to provide justice to persons in a particular community. Additionally, the JP serves as a justice in petty court sessions, attends juvenile court sessions, issues summonses, considers applications for bail, explains and signs legal documents, sits on licensing panels, and gives counsel/advice. Any [[Jamaica]]n citizen that can speak and write English is eligible to become a JP. Any club/organisation/citizen can recommend someone to become JP for a community. JPs are chosen under the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]]'s discretion.

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], justices of the peace have largely been replaced in magistrates' courts by legally qualified (first-class) stipendiary magistrates. However, state governments continue to appoint justices of the peace as honours. In 2004, some associations of justices of the peace pressed the federal government to allow justices of the peace to sit as second-class magistrates in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts.

===New Zealand===
A Justice of the Peace in [[New Zealand]] is someone of good stature in the community who is authorized to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s and [[affidavit]]s as well as [[certified copy|certify documents]]. They may also perform citizenship ceremonies and act as a Visiting Justice in prisons the function of which is to record a prisoner's grievance and decide on its validity.

They have certain powers to issue search warrants, and (in conjunction with another justice of the peace) may try minor criminal trials in the district court and exercise powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings. They are nominated for office by local Members of Parliament and appointed by the Governor General. Appointment is for life and a JP must take the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath.

===Pakistan===
Sections 22, 22-A and 22-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 provide for the appointment of justices of the peace by the provincial governments, their powers and duties respectively. However, seldom are justices of the peace appointed in Pakistan outside the judiciary. Session and additional session judges act as ex-officio justices of the peace as per Section 25 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. An Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding-
(i) non-registration of a criminal case;
(ii) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another; and
(iii) neglect, failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its functions and duties.
Such functions being quasi-judicial in nature could not be termed as executive, administrative or ministerial.(PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581)

It is pertinent to note however, as many academics have pointed out, that there is great utility in the appointment of such justices especially in rural areas where enmity between rival groups can lead to the inability of registration of cognizable offences and biased judicial proceedings.

===Singapore===
A justice of the peace in [[Singapore]] derives his powers from statute law. He is appointed by the President of the Republic of Singapore, under the provisions of section 11(l) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap.321). The President may revoke the appointment of any justice of the peace. A newly appointed justice of the peace is required by section 17 of the Subordinate Courts Act, to take the oath of office and allegiance as set out in the schedule to the Subordinate Courts Act, before exercising the functions of his office.

In their role, JPs serve as visiting justices of [[Changi Prison|Singapore prisons]], mediators or referees in the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|subordinate courts]]. They may also solemnise marriages in the [[Registry of Marriages]] or perform the duties of the magistrate conferred on them by any written law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=74 Justices of the Peace appointed|url=http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/slw/headlinesnews/24707-74-justices-of-the-peace-appointed.html|publisher=Singapore Law Watch|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, Justice of the Peace (JP) is an honorary post, with authorization to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s and [[affidavit]]s as well as [[certified copy|certify documents]]. Persons appointed as a Justice of the Peace may use the post-nominal '''JP'''. Current appointments are made under the ''Judicature Act No 02 of 1978'', by the [[Minister of Justice (Sri Lanka)|Minister of Justice]] at his/her discretion by publishing a list in the [[Gazette]] and appointee taking oaths before a [[high court]], [[district court]] [[judge]] or [[magistrate]] with [[Registrar (law)|registrar]] of the [[supreme court]] recording it. There are four types of appointments of Justice of the Peace;
* Justice of the Peace and Unofficial magistrate
* Justice of the Peace for the Whole Island
* Justice of the Peace for a Judicial District 
* Justice of the Peace (ex officio)

Senior [[Attorney at law]]s are appointed as [[unofficial magistrate|Justice of the Peace and Unofficial magistrate]]s to preside in the absence of a sitting [[Magistrate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawnet.lk/sec_process.php?chapterid=1973Y0V0C44A&amp;sectionno=37&amp;title=Administration%20of%20Justice%20Law&amp;path=5 Justices of the Peace and Unofficial Magistrates.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Any citizen of [[Sri Lanka]] can apply to the Ministry of Justice giving his or her credentials to be appointed as a justice of the peace. However, the applicant should be one who has served the public and carries out social service and should be of good standing. These JPs would be appointed with legal authority in all parts of the island or limited to a judicial district. The [[President of Sri Lanka]] and his/her officers are ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' justices of the peace. There about 100,000 JPs in the island.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/article/43296/Brief-history-of-Justice-of-the-Peace|title=Brief history of Justice of the Peace - FT Online|website=www.ft.lk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The post was introduced in the island during the British colonial era by the Governor [[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford|Frederick North]] in 1801 and was later reformed in 1871.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; Until 1938, appointments were made by the [[Governor of Ceylon|Governor]], after which appointments were made by the Legal Secretary until 1947. After Ceylon gained its independence in 1948, appointments were made by the [[Governor General of Ceylon|Governor General]] and the [[Minister of Justice (Sri Lanka)|Minister of Justice]]. Justice of the Peace had the power to administer oaths and affirmations per the ''Courts Ordinance No. 1 on 1889 section 84'' and they could formally appoint members of the public to act as [[Special police|special police officers]] in times of turmoil and riots. Since certain government officers were ex-officio justices of the peace, this allowed British colonial officers to appoint special police officers from the European planters in times of crisies such as the [[1915 Ceylonese riots|1915 riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89oUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=Justice+of+the+Peace+and+Unofficial+Magistrate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5ZhGvmjIko&amp;sig=anX2wX2T3J8X4nVovsHxKmqEXug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB4NuQqPzSAhVIOrwKHXIyBBwQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Justice+of+the+Peace+and+Unofficial+Magistrate&amp;f=false|title=The Legal System of Ceylon in Its Historical Setting|first=Tambyah|last=Nadaraja|date=27 December 1972|publisher=Brill Archive|accessdate=27 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Village Councils Law (No. 6 of 1964) made the Chairman of the Village Council an ''ex officio'' justices of the peace  for that village area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/vcl6o1964228/s22A.html|title=Village Councils Law (No. 6 of 1964) - Sect 24|website=www.commonlii.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tonga===
In 2014, for the first time, Justices of the Peace were authorized in [[Tonga]]. JPs are appointed by the Crown, but the Lord Chief Justice regulates their duties and defines their powers. The first JPs were warranted with duties including granting bail; issuing search warrants and subpoenas; taking affidavits, declarations and oaths; and having the power to witness documents. Term of office is one year and officials can be reappointed. The initial 19 JPs appointed were: ‘Aisea Ta’ofi and Sione Hinakau of [[Niuatoputapu]]; ‘Inoke Tuaimei’api of [[Niuafo'ou]]; Siosiua Hausia from [[ʻEua]]; Sione Palu, Sione Fakahua, Me’ite Fukofuka and Kisione Taulani of [[Ha’apai]]; Salesi Kauvaka, Viliami Pasikala, Haniteli Fa’anunu, Meli Taufaeteau and Moleni Taufa from [[Vava’u]]; and Salote Fukofuka, ‘Amelia Helu, [[‘Ofa Likiliki]], Tevita Fakatou, Sioape Tu’iono and Semisi Tongia of [[Tongatapu]].&lt;ref name="Tonga Broadcasting"&gt;{{cite news|title=19 Justices of Peace appointed for the first time |url=http://www.tonga-broadcasting.net/19-justices-of-peace-appointed-for-the-first-time.html |accessdate=21 March 2015 |publisher=Tonga Broadcasting Commission |date=20 June 2014 |location=Nuku’alofa, Tonga |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401111800/http://tonga-broadcasting.net/19-justices-of-peace-appointed-for-the-first-time.html |archivedate= 1 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
{{CourtsEnglandWales}}
{{Main|Magistrate (England and Wales)}}
&lt;!-- An internal link from A Canterbury Tale arrives here. If you change this sub-head, please consider the link as well—thanks. --&gt;
A [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in [[England and Wales]] is composed of a [[bench (law)|bench]] of (usually three) JPs or magistrates, who dispense [[summary offence|summary justice]]: that is they decide on offences which carry up to six months in prison, to a maximum of one year of imprisonment over not less than two indictable offences, or an unlimited fine. They are advised on points of law and procedure by a legally qualified [[justices' clerk]] and their assistants. No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence, common sense, integrity and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the local area and drawn from all walks of life following a rigorous selection process. All magistrates are carefully trained before sitting and continue to receive training throughout their service. Magistrates are unpaid volunteers but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses and subsistence. Lay justices or magistrates must sit for a minimum of 26 sessions (half-days) per year, but some sit as much as a day a week, or possibly more.  Magistrates can sit alone to hear issues such as warrant applications or many traffic offences under the new Single Justice Procedure.

In addition to the lay justices, there are a small number of [[district judge (magistrates courts)|district judge]]s, formerly known as ''stipendiary magistrates''. These are legally qualified, full-time members of the magistracy and hear cases alone, without any other magistrates on the bench. It is important to distinguish the district judge (magistrates' court) from the district judges who usually sit in the county court.

Magistrates' courts today can deal with minor offences (fines of up to £5,000, or imprisonment of up to six months for a single offence or 12 months for consecutive sentences, or both) and handle over 95% of the criminal cases in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about_judiciary/roles_types_jurisdiction/judicial_profiles/magistrates/index.htm|title=Magistrates|website=www.judiciary.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more serious offences, magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the [[Crown Court]] (a task in former times dealt with by a [[grand jury]]). Magistrates also have a civil [[jurisdiction]], such as a family jurisdiction. Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor, betting and clubs licensing applications, this was transferred under the [[Licensing Act 2003]] to local authorities. The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority.

Cardiff Magistrates' Court is the only court in the country which deals with offences under the Companies Act, such as for late filing of accounts or directors' offences. Westminster Magistrates' Court has special responsibilities for dealing with all terrorism and extradition offences throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/extradition/|title=CPS: Extradition|publisher=The Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=25 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127175114/http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/extradition/|archivedate=27 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Courts Act 2003]] came into force, magistrates were tied to a particular area (see [[magistrates' courts committee]], [[commission area]], [[petty sessions area]]). This has now been changed such that they are assigned to [[local justice areas]], but less strongly.

The Courts Act provides the current framework for appointment of the justices, which is done by the [[Lord Chancellor]] in the name of [[British monarchy|sovereign]]. Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism. District judges (magistrates' court) – previously known as stipendiary magistrates – must have a seven years' general legal qualification, and are appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the Lord Chancellor.

Before 1714, magistrates were liable to be approached at any time and in any place by people legally recognised as [[pauper]]s, appealing for aid if [[parish councils in England|parish authorities]] refused to provide any. It was relatively common for these magistrates to write out, on the spot, an order requiring aid to be granted.&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-108.html|title=England's early 'Big Society': parish welfare under the Old Poor Law|last=Charlesworth|first=Lorie|date=November 2010|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
{{See also|Judiciary of Scotland}}
Within the Scottish legal system justices of the peace are lay magistrates who currently sit in the [[justice of the peace court]]s. These courts were introduced in 2009 as a replacement for the [[District court (Scotland)|district courts]] (established in 1975), which in turn replaced burgh police courts.&lt;ref name="districtCourtsScotland"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1975|chapter=20|act=District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justices sit alone or in threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court. They handle many cases of breaches of the peace — drunkenness, minor assaults, petty theft, and offences under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.&lt;ref name="civicGovernemtnAct"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1982|chapter=45|act=Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum sentencing power of a justice of the peace is 60 days [[imprisonment]], or a fine up to £2,500, or both, and the ability to disqualify drivers.&lt;ref name="jppowers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Justices of the Peace - Judicial Office Holders - About the Judiciary - Judiciary of Scotland|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/38/0/Justices-of-the-Peace|website=www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk|publisher=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Scottish Government]] announced its intention to unify the management of the sheriff and district courts in Scotland but retain lay justices, as part of its initiative to create a unified judiciary under the [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]]. Following the passage of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 the justice of the peace courts were implemented on a [[sheriffdom]]-by-sheriffdom basis.&lt;ref name="jp2007"&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=act|year=2007|chapter=6|act=Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007}}"The Scottish Ministers may by order establish courts of summary criminal jurisdiction to be known as justice of the peace courts."&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Section 59}}

In Glasgow, the volume of business required the employment of three solicitors as "stipendiary magistrates" who sat in place of the lay justices. The stipendiary magistrates' court had the same sentencing power as the summary [[sheriff court]] in [[summary offence|summary proceedings]], which was the ability to [[sentence (law)|sentence]] an offender to up to one year in [[imprisonment|prison]] or [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] them up to {{Currency|10,000|GBP}}. Stipendiary magistrates were replaced by summary sheriffs.&lt;ref name="ScottishCriminalCourts"&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens at a Scottish criminal court case - mygov.scot|url=https://www.mygov.scot/criminal-court-case/where-cases-take-place/|website=www.mygov.scot|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=en|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="summarysheriff"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Sheriffs|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/39/0/Summary-Sheriffs|website=www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk|publisher=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|date=2017|quote=The 2014 Act also abolished the office of stipendiary magistrate...Part-time stipendiary magistrates will become part-time summary sheriffs from 1 April: J Kevin Duffy, Colin Dunipace, J Euan Edment, Sukhwinder Gill, David Griffiths, Diana McConnell.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====

In Northern Ireland, the situation initially continued as it had in pre-1922 Ireland. However, justices of the peace no longer sat out of petty sessions after 1935 (Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1935).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/special/2000/justice/11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, magistrates' courts in Northern Ireland have consisted of legally qualified resident magistrates (now known as district judges (magistrates' courts)) sitting alone, except in cases involving children, where two lay panelists sat with the magistrate. Justices of the peace were confined to the power to conduct committal hearings, bind persons over to the peace, sign warrants, summons, and other official documents. They were appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] on the recommendation of a committee in each county court division.

The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 introduced a new office of lay magistrate, to sit alongside resident magistrates at magistrates' courts in certain matters. Unlike in England and Wales, "lay magistrate" is the official title of the position, to distinguish from existing justices of the peace who do not sit in the magistrates' courts. The first lay magistrates were appointed in 2005. Two lay magistrates sit with the district judge (magistrates' court) in criminal proceedings involving children (replacing the former lay panelists) and Family Proceedings Court matters. The district judge (magistrates' court), who is a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing, presides over the bench.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload,150353,en.pdf ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122017/http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload%2C150353%2Cen.pdf |date=18 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most criminal justice functions of JPs were transferred to lay magistrates. It is expected that there will be no further appointments of justices of the peace in Northern Ireland, although those already appointed retain the title and any functions not transferred to lay magistrate under the 2002 Act.

===United States===
In some US states, the justice of the peace is a judge of a [[court]] of limited [[jurisdiction]], a [[magistrate]], or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first= Chester H. |title=The Justice of the Peace System in the United States |publisher= 15 Cal. L. Rev. 118|year=1926|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3925&amp;context=californialawreview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office.

The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears [[misdemeanor]] cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small [[debt]]s, [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] disputes, or other [[small claims court]] proceedings. Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts. In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a [[trial de novo]] before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered.

A justice of the peace also performs [[civil marriage]]s.

====Arizona====
A justice of the peace has the same jurisdiction as a municipal magistrate with respect to traffic and [[misdemeanor]] cases and restraining orders, though over cases whose affairs are not contained within the confines of a single municipality. Additionally, the Justice Court hears cases involving county ordinances (ordinances enacted by the board of supervisors that apply only to unincorporated areas), civil lawsuits up to a limit of $10,000, small claims cases up to $2,500, and issues evictions, called writs of restitution (after a forcible detainer or special detainer action (eviction) being successfully completed by a landlord). Justices of the peace, also called JPs, or Judges of the Justice Court, are elected in partisan elections for four-year terms from specific districts called precincts. They have the same authority and responsibility as all other judges in the state with respect to performing marriages, administrating oaths, adhering to the code of judicial conduct, and all aspects of justice administration. However, Arizona law does not require justices of the peace to be lawyers. Many justices of the peace are not legally trained, although all are required by the Arizona Supreme Court to complete a course at the Arizona Judicial College. As with JPs, municipal judges in Arizona are not required to be lawyers.

====Arkansas====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
In [[Arkansas]], a justice of the peace is an elected official equivalent to a [[county commissioner]] or county supervisor in some other states. Arkansas JPs sit on a county quorum court, composed of 9, 11, 13 or 15 JPs. The quorum court is a part-time body, elected from single-member districts, that has overall responsibility for county affairs. Among their responsibilities are passing the budget, creating new ordinances (at the misdemeanor level), setting property tax millage levels, and working with other elected officials. The full-time elected county administrator, who presides over the quorum court, is the county judge. Neither JPs nor the county judge have any judicial authority, though they do have the power to preside over civil marriages. Justices of the peace are elected every two years to these partisan offices.

====Massachusetts, Connecticut====
Justices of the peace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are often called on to perform marriages and, especially [[same-sex marriage]]s, which certain religious officials are not willing to oversee. Justices of the peace in Connecticut can preside over [[same-sex marriage]]s. Unlike Massachusetts, Connecticut JPs are not penalized for refusing to perform such ceremonies.

Justices of the peace in Connecticut and Massachusetts have the same general oath-giving powers as a [[notary public]]. 

====Louisiana====
*Are elected to serve six year terms as the judicial authority of a ward or district.
*Have jurisdiction in civil matters when the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000.
*Do not have jurisdiction when a title to real estate is involved, when the state or any political subdivision is a defendant, or in successions or probate matters.
*Can perform marriage ceremonies.

====Minnesota====
In Minnesota, the office of the Justice of the Peace was abolished in 1977 (Minn. Stat. 487.35). It has not existed for 40-plus years although some people who offer private wedding officiant services erroneously claim to be Justices of the Peace, this term may not properly be used inasmuch as the office has been abolished. Under Minnesota law, however, judges, retired judges, court administrators, retired court administrators,and other public officials designated in statute may officiate or solemnize marriage ceremonies in addition to licensed or ordained ministers of any religious denomination who have filed their credentials with a county registrar (Minn, Stat. 517.04).

====New York====
'''Justice courts''' are courts in [[New York State]] that handle traffic tickets, criminal matters, [[small claims court|small claims]] and local code violations such as [[zoning]]. Though justice courts constitutionally are part of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], state law generally makes justice courts independent of New York's Office of Court Administration (OCA) and instead makes Justice Courts the responsibility of their sponsoring localities. Town justice courts are often called Town Court, and village justice courts are often called Village Court. City courts in New York State handle mostly the same types of cases but are not justice courts.

The official title for [[judge]]s in Justice Courts is Justice, the same as in [[New York Supreme Court]]. However, in common usage, most people, including lawyers, call them Judge. Justices in Justice Court do not have to be lawyers. The vast majority are not. Many of these courts are in small towns and villages where none of the residents are lawyers. In the larger towns, the justices are almost always lawyers.

While Justices and their court clerks receive training from OCA, there is tremendous variability in how cases are handled. This includes court procedures and substantive results. Some courts will dismiss a traffic ticket if the officer does not appear for a trial, while others will adjourn the matter to give the officer another chance. In some courts the police prosecute their own tickets, while in others an [[Prosecutor|Assistant District Attorney]] from the county or a town or village attorney will prosecute the tickets. This may even vary by the type of officer, with State Troopers and Deputies prosecuting their tickets and a town attorney prosecuting tickets written by the town police.

Larger towns can have very busy caseloads, including several sessions a week with dozens of cases at each session, and people may have to wait hours before their cases are heard. In some small towns the caseload is extremely light, and a court might meet once a month and have only a few cases.

All criminal prosecutions that occur in towns and villages are commenced in a justice court. [[Misdemeanor]]s are handled exclusively in the justice court, while [[felony|felonies]] generally move up to County Court before the case moves forward.

Similar matters in some places outside New York are handled by a justice of the peace.

Town and village Justices also possess limited powers of a [[Notary public (New York)|New York notary public]], [[ex-officio]], only within the county in which the town or village for which they serve is located; they may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments and proofs of execution.  Some Justices seek and obtain a formal New York notary public commission to permit free travel statewide and enjoy the additional privileges and international legal recognition of a notary public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piombino|first1=Alfred E.|title=Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for New York|date=2011|publisher=East Coast Publishing|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Texas====
In Texas, JP's are elected on a partisan ballot every four years.

Texas does not require a JP to be an attorney in good standing. However, JP's are required to be "well versed in the law" and take mandatory classes to retain their office.  New JP's are required to take 80 hours of legal state mandated classes the first year, and 20 hours each year thereafter during their tenure in office.

Sections 18 and 19 of Article V of the [[Texas Constitution]], as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.

Under Section 18, the number of JP's (and associated [[constable]]s) is dependent on the size of the county:
*For counties with populations less than 18,000 (as determined by the census), the entire county shall be one JP precinct, unless the [[Commissioners' Court]] determines that more are needed, in which case the court can divide the county into no more than four JP precincts.
*For counties with populations at least 18,000 but less than 50,000, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than two nor more than eight.
*For counties with populations 50,000 or greater, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than four nor more than eight.
*In any county with population less than 150,000, if any precinct contains a city with 18,000 or more population, that precinct shall have two JP's.
*In any county with population 150,000 or greater, each JP precinct may have more than one JP.
*Special provisions apply to [[Chambers County, Texas|Chambers]] and [[Randall County, Texas|Randall]] counties (must have no fewer than two nor more than six precincts) and to [[Mills County, Texas|Mills]], [[Reagan County, Texas|Reagan]], and [[Roberts County, Texas|Roberts]] (the Constable office is abolished, with the Sheriff's office performing all duties).

Section 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court:
*Original jurisdiction in "criminal matters of misdemeanor cases punishable by fine only" (under the Texas Penal Code such offenses are called "Class C" misdemeanors, generally involving traffic offenses or public intoxication; however, in jurisdictions with a municipal court, if the traffic offense is written by a municipal police officer the municipal court will have jurisdiction, whereas if the offense is written by a state or county officer the JP court will hear the case),
*Exclusive jurisdiction in "civil matters where the amount in controversy is $200 or less", and
*"Such other jurisdiction as may be provided by law". Under this provision, the Legislature has raised the top limit on civil matters to $10,000 and assigned the JP courts, among others, the right to hear cases involving [[eviction]] as well as cases involving [[foreclosure]] and liens against personal property where the amount falls within the (revised) JP Court's jurisdiction.

JP cases are appealed to the county court level; the appeal results in a trial de novo. In criminal cases, cases beginning in justice court cannot be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted.

In smaller counties without a coroner, the JP has the duty to perform inquests.  The JP is also called out for any unattended deaths in the county.

A JP in a large precinct in a large county will work 5 days a week, 8 or more hours daily. Their duties will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Trials of civil matters, both to a 6-person jury and to the bench, with an amount in controversy not exceeding $10,000.00. Trials of criminal matters involving traffic violations and class C misdemeanors punishable by fine only. Pre-trial motion dockets and show cause hearings are held, and all discovery must be approved by the Judge in advance in civil cases. All criminal matters are controlled by the rules of criminal procedure and evidence. A much more restricted and smaller set of rules apply in civil matters unless in the Judges discretion, it is believed to be in the best interests of justice to apply the standard rules of evidence and procedure. The court has the exclusive jurisdiction of evictions. A Texas JP Judge will also magistrate prisoners and set bail. The Judge will hear juvenile violations such as truancy, and underage drinking and smoking. Warrants of Arrest, Alias, Search and Capias Profine are issued. Protective Orders can issue and result in jail time if violated. Several administrative matters are heard including the finding of a Dangerous Dog, Occupational Drivers License and tow hearings. Many writs are issued such as writs of re-entry to apartments, possession of realty and to reinstate utilities a landlord may have turned off. A JP has contempt power of $100 and up to 3 days in jail per occurrence. A JP is also authorized to perform marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/FA/htm/FA.2.htm|title=FAMILY CODE  CHAPTER 2. THE MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP|website=www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vermont====
Justices in [[Vermont]] are elected officials. They are elected by their towns but they are technically county officers. They also serve as election and poll officials, and on the boards of civil authority and tax abatement. They can perform civil marriages, administer oaths and have all the powers of a notary public.&lt;ref name="VTElections"&gt;{{cite web | title=Local Office Descriptions - Vermont Secretary of State | website=Elections | url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/elections/candidates/local-office-descriptions.aspx | access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replacement with other courts====
In many states, the office of justice of the peace has been abolished or transferred to another court, such as the [[magistrate]] court.&lt;ref&gt;Vanlandingham, Kenneth E. "Decline of the Justice of the Peace, The." 12 U. Kan. L. Rev. 389 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; In larger cities, cases may be heard in a [[state court (United States)|municipal court]] which has jurisdiction only within that city. Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the [[American Bar Association]], which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary, as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used.

California formerly had justice of the peace courts staffed by lay judges, but began phasing them out after a landmark 1974 decision in which the [[Supreme Court of California]] unanimously held that it was a violation of federal due process (under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]) to allow a non-lawyer to preside over a criminal trial which could result in incarceration of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon v. Justice Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/12C3d323.htm 12 Cal. 3d 323] (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; The court specifically recognized that in the aftermath of ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' (1963), it made no sense to allow a case to be tried before a layperson incapable of understanding the legal arguments of the attorney to whom the defendant was entitled under ''Gideon''. The remaining justice courts (as well as municipal courts) were eliminated by the passage of Proposition 220 in June 1998, which merged all lower courts within the state judicial branch into the [[Superior Courts of California|superior courts]] (the courts of general jurisdiction). Under current California law, all California judges must be licensed attorneys.

Notably, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] sharply disagreed with California's analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment in the landmark case of ''[[North v. Russell]]'', {{ussc|427|328|1976}},&lt;ref&gt;See also Young v. Konz, 88 Wash. 2d 276, 558 P.2d 791 (1977), on rehearing, 91 Wash. 2d 532, 588 P.2d 1360 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the court held that Kentucky's use of nonlawyer judges in its police courts was ''not'' a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.&lt;ref&gt;The possible ambiguity of the ''North v. Russell'' holding is suggested by the [[West Virginia Supreme Court]] case State ex rel. Collins v. Bedell, 460 S.E.2d 636 (W. Va. 1995):  "[I]n North v. Russell . . . the Supreme Court of the United States determined that Kentucky procedures provided for a trial ''de novo'', which included the right to a trial by jury, before a lawyer-judge; therefore, the Supreme Court found it unnecessary to decide whether the proceeding before a lay officer, which resulted in a sentence of thirty days in jail for driving under the influence, violated the constitutional rights of the defendant." Bedell, 460 S.E.2d at 643–644.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korean Armistice Agreement''' ({{lang-ko|한국휴전협정}}) is the [[armistice]] which brought about a complete cessation of hostilities of the [[Korean War]]. It was signed by [[U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Kelly Harrison, Jr.|William Harrison, Jr.]] representing the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] (UNC), [[North Korea]]n General [[Nam Il]] representing the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA), and the [[China|Chinese]] [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/index.html?dod-date=727 |title=Document for July 27th: Armistice Agreement for the Restoration of the South Korean State|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019201719/http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/index.html?dod-date=727 |archivedate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Armistice was signed on 27 July 1953, and was designed to "ensure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved."&lt;ref name=findlaw-19530727&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/korea/kwarmagr072753.html|title=Korean War Armistice Agreement|work=[[FindLaw]]|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|location=[[Canada]] and United States|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305164517/http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/korea/kwarmagr072753.html|date=27 July 1953|accessdate=5 March 2014|archivedate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1954 Geneva Conference]] in Switzerland, Chinese [[Chinese premier|Premier]] and foreign minister [[Zhou Enlai]] suggested that a peace treaty should be implemented on the Korean peninsula. However, the US secretary of state, [[John Foster Dulles]], did not accommodate this attempt to achieve such a treaty. A final peace settlement has never been achieved.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title= North Korea: Why negotiations can't wait for denuclearisation |date= 9 February 2018 |publisher= www.afr.com |url= http://www.afr.com/opinion/north-korea-why-negotiations-cant-wait-for-denuclearisation-20180208-h0vrle |accessdate= 15 February 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180215192231/http://www.afr.com/opinion/north-korea-why-negotiations-cant-wait-for-denuclearisation-20180208-h0vrle |archive-date= 15 February 2018 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signed Armistice established the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), the de facto new border between the two nations, put into force a [[cease-fire]], and finalized repatriation of [[prisoners of war]]. The DMZ runs close to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] and has separated North and [[South Korea]] since the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953.

==Background==
By mid-December 1950, the United States was discussing terms for an agreement to end the Korean War.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=212}} The desired agreement would end the fighting, provide assurances against its resumption, and protect the future security of UNC forces.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=211}} The United States asked for a military armistice commission of mixed membership that would supervise all agreements.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=212}} Both sides would need to agree to "cease the introduction into Korea of any reinforcing air, ground or naval units or personnel... and to refrain from increasing the level of war equipment and material existing in Korea."{{Sfn | Stueck | 1995 | p = 212}} The U.S. wished to create a demilitarized zone that would be roughly {{convert|20|miles|km| adj=mid | -wide }}.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=212}} The proposed agreement would also address the issue of [[prisoners of war]] which the U.S. believed should be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=212}}

While talk of a possible armistice agreement was circulating, in late May and early June 1951, the President of the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea) [[Syngman Rhee]] opposed peace talks. He believed the ROK should continue to expand its army in order to march all the way to the [[Yalu River]] and completely unify the nation.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=214}} The UNC did not endorse Rhee's position.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=214}} Even without UNC support, Rhee and the South Korean government attempted to mobilize the public to resist any halt in the fighting short of the [[Yalu River]].{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=215}} Other ROK officials supported Rhee's ambitions and the [[National Assembly of South Korea]] unanimously passed a resolution endorsing a continued fight for an "independent and unified country."{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=215}} At the end of June, however, the Assembly decided to support armistice talks,{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=215}} although President Rhee continued to oppose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19530701&amp;id=wvlXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gPYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6939,6666609|title=Allies Ready to Sign Armistice Without Syngman Rhee|author=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[The Spokesman-Review#History|Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=[[Spokane, Washington]]|date=1 July 1953|accessdate=26 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404233931/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19530701&amp;id=wvlXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gPYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6939,6666609|archive-date=4 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Syngman Rhee, North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] also sought complete unification. The North Korean side was slow to support armistice talks and only on 27 June 1951{{spnd}}seventeen days after armistice talks had begun{{spnd}}did it change its slogan of "drive the enemy into the sea" to "drive the enemy to the 38th parallel."{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=216}} North Korea was pressured to support armistice talks by its allies the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, whose support was vital to enabling North Korea to continue fighting.

==Armistice discussions==
[[File:Panmunjom, site of armistice negotiations.jpg|thumb|Site of negotiations in 1951]]
Talks concerning an armistice started 10 July 1951,{{sfn|Mount|Laferriere|2004|page=123}} in [[Kaesŏng]], a  North Korean city in [[North Hwanghae Province]] near the South Korean border.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1988|page=145}} The two primary negotiators were Chief of Army Staff General Nam Il, a North Korean deputy premier, and United States Vice Admiral [[Charles Turner Joy]].{{sfn|Mount|Laferriere|2004|page=122}} After a period of two weeks, on 26 June 1951, a five-part agenda was agreed upon{{Sfn | Stueck | 1995 | p = 225}} and this guided talks until the signing of the armistice on 27 July 1953. The items to be discussed were:

# Adoption of an agenda.
# Fixing a military demarcation line between the two sides so as to establish a demilitarized zone as a basic condition for the cessation of hostilities in Korea.
# Concrete arrangements for realization of a ceasefire and armistice in Korea, including the composition, authority and functions of a supervisory organization for carrying out the terms of a truce and armistice.
# Arrangements relating to prisoners of war.
# Recommendations to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=225}}

After the agenda was decided, talks proceeded slowly. There were lengthy intervals between meetings. The longest gap between discussions started on 23 August 1951,{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=225}} when North Korea and its allies claimed that the conference site in Kaesŏng had been bombed. North Korea requested the UNC conduct an immediate investigation, which concluded there was evidence a UNC aircraft had attacked the conference site. The evidence, however, appeared to be manufactured. The Communists subsequently refused to permit an investigation during daylight hours.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=229}} Armistice talks did not start again until 25 October 1951.{{sfn|Mount|Laferriere|2004|page=123}} The U.S. would not allow further discussion to take place in Kaesŏng.{{sfn|Catchpole|2000|page=320}} [[Panmunjom]], a nearby village in [[Kyŏnggi Province]], close to both North and South Korea, was chosen as the new location for deliberations. This was conditional on responsibility for protection of the village being shared by both powers.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=237}}{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=147}}

A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=187–99}} The Communists held 10,000 POWs and the UNC held 150,000 POWs.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=212}} The PVA, KPA, and UNC could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north,&lt;ref name="Boose2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boose, Jr.|first=Donald W.|title=Fighting While Talking: The Korean War Truce Talks|work=OAH Magazine of History|publisher=[[Organization of American Historians]]|date=Spring 2000|location=[[Bloomington, Indiana]]|url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/korea/boose.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712210732/http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/korea/boose.html|archivedate=12 July 2007|accessdate=7 November 2009|quote=... the UNC advised that only 70,000 out of over 170,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners desired repatriation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=189–90}} In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, chaired by Indian general [[K. S. Thimayya]], was set up to handle the matter.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=242–45}}

In 1952 the United States elected a new president, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and on 29 November 1952 the president-elect went to Korea to investigate what might end the Korean War.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=240}} With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=William T.|title=Military Armistice in Korea: A Case Studyfor Strategic Leaders|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA404504|work=[[Defense Technical Information Center]]|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|location=[[Fort Belvoir]]|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801180412/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA404504|archivedate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the KPA, the PVA, and the UNC ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]. Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by KPA, ROKA, United States, and Joint UNC forces. Discussions continued slowly because of difficulties regarding demarcation of the border between North and South Korea. [[China]] and [[North Korea]] expected the line to remain at the 38th Parallel. Within weeks, however, both nations accepted the Kansas Line, where the two sides had confronted each other at the time.{{sfn|Mount|Laferriere|2004|page=123}} In March 1953 the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] helped spur negotiations. While Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] was not willing to compromise then, the new Soviet leadership issued a statement two weeks after Stalin's death, calling for a quick end to hostilities.{{sfn|Agov|2013|page=238}}

On 19 July 1953 delegates reached agreement covering all issues on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/2-korea/1-timeline/|title=The Korean War Timeline|work=The Authentic History Center|publisher=[[Salem Media Group]]|location=United States|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104135209/http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/2-korea/1-timeline/|archivedate=4 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 1953 at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the Armistice was signed by Nam Il, delegate of the KPA and PVA, and William K. Harrison Jr., UNC delegate.&lt;ref name=findlaw-19530727/&gt; Twelve hours after the signing of the document, all regulations approved in the armistice commenced.{{sfn|Catchpole|2000|page=322}} The agreement provided for monitoring by an international commission. The [[Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission]] (NNSC) was established to prevent reinforcements being brought into Korea, either additional military personnel or new weapons, and NNSC member inspection teams from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland operated throughout Korea.{{sfn|Stueck|1995|page=216}}

==Effects==
[[File:Dmzmap.png|thumb|The [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] compared to the earlier [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] de facto border]]
The signed Armistice established a "complete cessation of all hostilities in Korea by all armed force"&lt;ref name=findlaw-19530727/&gt; that was to be enforced by the commanders of both sides. The armistice is however only a cease-fire between military forces, rather than an agreement between governments.&lt;ref name=seoul-usembassy-60th&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seoul.usembassy.gov/p_rok_60th_int_16.html |title=Armistice Agreement for the Restoration of the South Korean State (1953) July 27, 1953 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |year=2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085240/http://seoul.usembassy.gov/p_rok_60th_int_16.html |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[peace treaty]] was signed which means that the Korean War has not officially ended. The armistice established the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) and the DMZ. The DMZ was agreed as a {{convert | 2.5 | mi | km | adj=mid | -wide }} fortified buffer zone between the two Korean nations.{{sfn|Mount|Laferriere|2003|page=123}} The DMZ follows the Kansas Line where the two sides actually confronted each other at the time of the signing of the Armistice. The DMZ is currently the most heavily defended national border in the world {{as of|lc=yes|2018}}.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

The Armistice also established regulations regarding prisoners of war. The agreement stated that:

{{quote|Within sixty (60) days after this agreement becomes effective each side shall, without offering any hindrance, directly repatriate and hand over in groups all those prisoners of war in its custody who insist on repatriation to the side to which they belonged at the time of capture.&lt;ref name=findlaw-19530727/&gt;}}

Ultimately, more than 22,000 KPA or PVA soldiers refused repatriation. On the opposite side, 327 South Korean soldiers, 21 American soldiers and 1 British soldier also refused repatriation, and remained in North Korea or in China. (See: [[List of American and British defectors in the Korean War]].)

With the signing of the Armistice, the war is considered to have ended, even though there was no official peace treaty. Despite the three-year war, the international border remained at a similar location as at its start.

==Subsequent events==
===Failure of the Geneva Conference===
{{main|1954 Geneva Conference}}
Article IV (Paragraph 60) of the Armistice Agreement calls for a political conference to be held within 3 months of the signing of the agreement in order "to ensure the peaceful settlement of the Korean question".&lt;ref name="findlaw-19530727" /&gt; A conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland in April 1954, missing the 3 month timeline by 6 months. The conference focused on two separate conflicts: the conflict in Korea; and the [[First Indochina War|conflict in Indochina]]. Participants in the talks on the conflict in Korea were the US, the USSR, France, China, and North and South Korea. The peace agreement on the Korean peninsula was officially raised at the conference, by Chinese diplomat Zhou Enlai with the US Secretary of Defense, John Foster Dulles, but no progress was made.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The United States intentionally avoided discussing the "Peace Treaty on the Korean Peninsula", in spite of criticism from the other representatives at the conference about the negative attitude of the United States.

===United States abrogation of paragraph 13(d)===
[[File:1958-02-06 Atomic Weapons come to Korea.ogv|thumb|Deployment of U.S. atomic weapons in Korea in 1958]]
Paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement mandated that neither side introduce new weapons into Korea, other than piece-for-piece replacement of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v23p2/d209|title=New Equipment for U.S. Forces in Korea|author1=Robert R.

Following the abrogation of paragraph 13(d), the NNSC largely lost its function, and became primarily office based in the DMZ with a small staff. North Korea denounced the abrogation of paragraph 13(d).&lt;ref name=jaebong-2009/&gt; North Korea responded militarily by digging massive underground fortifications resistant to nuclear attack, and by the forward deployment of its conventional forces so that the use of nuclear weapons against it would endanger South Korean and U.S. forces as well.

In October 1996, the [[U.N.

Approving nations included the United States and the People's Republic of China, two of the armistice's signatories, effectively refuting any suggestion that the armistice was no longer in force.&lt;ref name=norton-1997/&gt;

On 28 April 1994, North Korea announced that it would cease participating in the Military Armistice Commission, but would continue contact at Panmunjom through liaison officers and maintain the general conditions of the armistice. North Korea stated it regarded the U.S. deployment of [[Patriot missiles]] in South Korea as terminating the armistice.&lt;ref name=INR-19940910&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB421/docs/19940429a.pdf |title=DPRK: New Arrangements&amp;nbsp;– The Secretary's Morning Intelligence Summary |work=Bureau of Intelligence and Research |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=29 April 1994 |accessdate=6 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413000556/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB421/docs/19940429a.pdf |archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=INR-19940429&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB421/docs/19940910.pdf |title=DPRK: Raising the Armistice Issue&amp;nbsp;– The Secretary's Morning Intelligence Summary |work=Bureau of Intelligence and Research |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=10 September 1994 |accessdate=6 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413000559/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB421/docs/19940910.pdf |archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002 U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], in his first [[2002 State of the Union Address|State of the Union Address]], labeled North Korea a part of an [[Axis of Evil]].&lt;ref name=nyt-20170112&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/opinion/the-us-must-talk-to-north-korea.html |title=The U.S. Must Talk to North Korea |author=Siegfried S.

There were two isolated violent incidents in 2010: the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking]], which was attributed to North Korea, despite denials; and the North Korean [[Bombardment of Yeonpyeong]]. In 2010, the U.S. position regarding a peace treaty was that it could only be negotiated when North Korea "takes irreversible steps toward denuclearization".&lt;ref name="Niksch2010"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/137176.pdf#page=5 |title=North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Development and Diplomacy |first=Larry A. |last=Niksch |publisher=Congressional Research Service |id=RL33590 |date=5 January 2010 |access-date=12 December 2015 |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306065101/http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/137176.pdf |archive-date= 6 March 2013 |dead-url=no |quote=North&amp;nbsp;Korea's position on a Korean peace treaty (an old North&amp;nbsp;Korean proposal going back to 1974) contrasted sharply in three respects with positions of the Obama Administration, which {{bracket|Stephen}}&amp;nbsp;Bosworth reiterated and reportedly were contained in a letter from President&amp;nbsp;Obama to North&amp;nbsp;Korean leader, Kim&amp;nbsp;Jong‑il, delivered by Bosworth. First, as reportedly stated by Bosworth, the Obama Administration would engage in a negotiation of a peace treaty when North&amp;nbsp;Korea 'takes irreversible steps toward denuclearization'. North&amp;nbsp;Korea appears to seek the denuclearization issue merged into a U.S.–North Korean peace treaty negotiation. Second, Bosworth repeated the position of the Obama Administration (and the Bush Administration) that U.S. normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea would be a main element of U.S. reciprocity in return for North&amp;nbsp;Korean denuclearization. North&amp;nbsp;Korea rejects diplomatic relations as a ''[[wikt:quid pro quo|quid&amp;nbsp;pro&amp;nbsp;quo]]'' for denuclearization (a position that North&amp;nbsp;Korea set out in January 2009). Third, North&amp;nbsp;Korea's longstanding agenda for a peace treaty and its repeated definition of 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' have focused on securing a major diminution of the U.S. military presence in South&amp;nbsp;Korea and around the Korean peninsula (which North&amp;nbsp;Korea defines as elimination of 'the U.S. nuclear threat'). The Obama Administration, like the Bush Administration, never has expressed a willingness to negotiate on U.S. military forces as part of a denuclearization negotiation. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 North Korea argued that the Armistice was meant to be a transitional measure and that North Korea had made a number of proposals for replacing the armistice with a peace treaty, but the U.S. had not responded in a serious way.  It further argued that the Military Armistice Commission and the NNSC had long been effectively dismantled, paralysing the supervisory functions of the Armistice.  North Korea believes the annual U.S. and South Korean exercises [[Key Resolve]] and [[Foal Eagle]] are provocative and threaten North Korea with nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201303/news07/20130307-07ee.html |title=Korean Armistice Agreement Will No Longer Exist: Rodong Sinmun |publisher=KCNA |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312033728/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201303/news07/20130307-07ee.html |archivedate=12 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[JoongAng Ilbo]] reported that U.S. vessels equipped with nuclear weapons were participating in the exercise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2968431 |title=U.S. nukes to remain in South |newspaper=JoongAng Ilbo |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315045124/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2968431 |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[the Pentagon]] publicly announced that [[B-52 bombers]] flown over South Korea were reaffirming the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" for South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/world/asia/north-korea-threatens-us-military-bases-in-the-pacific.html |title=North Korea Threatens U.S. Military Bases in the Pacific |author=Choe Sang-Hun |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 March 2013 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321170000/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/world/asia/north-korea-threatens-us-military-bases-in-the-pacific.html |archivedate=21 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, when North Korea proposed formal peace talks, the U.S. adjusted its position from the pre-condition that North Korea should have already taken "irreversible steps toward denuclearization", to a negotiating stance that includes North Korea halting its nuclear program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">The '''La Vergne Law''' (or '''Lavergne Law''') of 1910, formally known as the ''Loi amendant le Code civil concernant les contrats faits avec les compagnies de services d'utilité publique'' (1910, Geo. V, c. 40), was an act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec]] which made the use of both English and French mandatory on tickets, documents, bills and contracts issued by transportation and public utility companies.  Prior to this, these were customarily in English only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/amnord/quebec_Lavergne.htm |language=fr |title=La loi Lavergne de 1910 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?param=199&amp;art=1398 |title=The 100th anniversary of the "La Vergne Law" |author=Jacques Carl Morin |work=Canadian Parliamentary Review |date=Autumn 2010 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law's primary sponsor was [[Armand La Vergne]] (or Lavergne), a legislator representing the ''[[Ligue nationaliste canadienne]]''.  The law came into effect on January 1, 1911.

Although the scope of the legislation was very limited, it is remembered today as the first example of French-language rights legislation in [[Quebec]].

==Text==
The English version of the law reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=leg_lavergne_law |title=Lavergne Law (1910)—An Act to amend the Civil Code, respecting contracts made with public utility companies |work=Site for Language Management in Canada |publisher=University of Ottawa |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Article 1

The following articles are added after article 1682b of the Civil Code as enacted by the act 5 Edward VII, chapter 28, section 1:

:"1682''c''. The following shall be printed in French and in English : passenger tickets, baggage-checks, way-bills, bills of lading, printed telegraph forms, and contract forms, made, furnished or delivered by a railway, navigation, telegraph, telephone transportation, express or electric power company, as well as all notices or regulations posted up in its stations, carriages, boats, offices, factories or workshops."

:"1682''d''. Every contravention, by a railway, navigation, telegraph, telephone, transportation, express or electric power company, doing business in this Province, of any of the provisions of the foregoing article shall be punished by a fine not exceeding twenty dollars, without, prejudice to recourse for damages."

;Article 2

This act shall come into force on the first day of January, 1911.

[[Image:DavidIofScotland.jpg|150px|thumb|right|David I, who codified the ''Laws of the Bretts and Scotts''.]]

The '''Leges inter Brettos et Scottos''' or '''Laws of the Brets and Scots''' was a legal [[Codification (law)|codification]] under [[David I of Scotland]] (reigned 1124 – 1153). Only a small fragment of the original document survives, describing the penalties for several offences against people.

Historically, the term "Brets" refers to [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] peoples, while "Scots" refers to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]-speaking peoples. [[William Forbes Skene|Skene]] however, asserted that here "Scots" refers to all of the peoples living north of the firths of [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] and [[Firth of Forth|Forth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Skene|1890|p=217}} In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDsUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 The Tribe in Scotland]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the document's intrinsic importance to [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]], it is significant in its similarity to corresponding areas both of Irish [[Early Irish law|Brehon law]] and of [[Welsh law]], which are better-preserved than the laws of medieval southern Scotland, allowing reasonable conjectures to be made regarding the laws and customs of the region, as few historical records exist.

The '''Laws''' or their precursor were relevant in the early twelfth century, as the ''Laws of the Four Burghs'' (Latin: ''Leges Quatuor Burgorum'') explicitly banned parts of it relating to the ''cro'' (or [[weregild]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Seebohm|1902|p=298}} ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EROFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298 Clause XVII]'' of the ''Leges Quatuor Burgorum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Anonymous|1868|p=10}} the text of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CUpkgY6ivDoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA10 XVII. De blodewit et consimilibus]'' in the ''Leges Quatuor Burgorum''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="expl"&gt;The ''Laws of the Four Burghs'' is dated between 1135 and 1157, and there is uncertainty and some contention in establishing the specific date. The four burghs were then [[Stirling]], Edinburgh, [[Lanark]], and [[Linlithgow]], with the latter two replaced by [[Roxburgh]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in 1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Laws''' are known to have been relevant until 1305, as [[Edward I of England]] specifically abolished them in that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Seebohm|1902|p=298}} ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EROFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298 1305 abolishment of the laws by Edward I]''&lt;/ref&gt; following his invasion of Scotland. There is no further mention of them, and when Scotland successfully [[Wars of Scottish Independence|reasserted its independence]], the [[feudalism|feudal]] [[Scots law]] then became applicable.

== The surviving clauses ==

The surviving clauses&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Seebohm|1902|pp=307–318}} ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EROFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA307 Leges Inter Brettos et Scotos]'' (annotated)&lt;/ref&gt; show the society's origins as a [[tribe|tribal]] culture, where a perpetrator's family is responsible for the perpetrator's transgressions, and the family of a victim is compensated for the loss of a family member. As with other [[Celt]]ic societies, the rights and obligations of women are explicitly guaranteed (though at a lesser standing than that of men). Marriages are treated as relationships between different families, and payments accrue to the family of the victim's spouse under some circumstances, but accrue to the victim's family under other circumstances.

'''Definition of the penalties'''

* Penalties for death, including honour-price (clause LV) – ''cro'', ''enach'', and  ''galnes'' (cf. Irish ''crólige báis'' relating to ''[[éraic]]'', Irish ''enech'', and Welsh ''[[galanas]]'', resp.). Payment is made to the victims or their families. This is the feature of tribal law commonly known in English as a [[weregild]].
* Penalties for homicides that breach the king's peace (clause LVI) – These are separate from other penalties that might result from killing a person. It includes breaches to the peace of lesser individuals (such as breaching the peace of a noble), which have lesser penalties. Payment is made to the person whose peace was breached.
* Penalties for wounding or insults to personal honour (clauses LVII and LVIII) – ''kelchin'' or ''gelchach'' (cf. Irish ''enech'' and Welsh ''sarhad''). Payment is made to the victims or their families. Penalties are distinguished for greater and lesser wounds (e.g., different penalties for drawing blood than for a wound that does not draw blood).

'''Penalty amount according to social position'''

The amounts to be paid were on a scale according to the social position of the victim, with the king at the top with the greatest value, then with a lesser amount for his son or high-ranking noble, an even lesser amount for other nobles, and so on down to the least amount for a common person. Amounts for homicide were given both as a number of cows, and as an equivalent amount of gold. Amounts for wounding or insult were given in gold only.

Payments for a female victim were one third less than that of her husband (but equal to that of her brother if she were unmarried), and make clear that women retained their original kinship and rights after marriage, as death penalties were owed by her family (and not by her husband's family), while death payments were made to her family (and not to the husband's family). Also, the importance of the marriage is acknowledged in that some payments for insult accrue to the spouse of the victim, rather than to the victim's family.

The '''Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA)''' was signed on October 1, 1996, by [[United States]] President [[Bill Clinton]]. LSTA is a United States federal library grant program. Its roots come from the [[Library Services Act]] that was first enacted in 1956. LSTA replaced the [[Library Services and Construction Act|Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA)]] that was first enacted in 1962. The new act was developed by the [[American Library Association|American Library Association (ALA)]] and other library groups.&lt;ref&gt;Flagg, Gordon. "News Fronts Washington." American Libraries, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many changes occurred with the passage of LSTA. The original act, [[Library Services and Construction Act|Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA)]], allocated funds for construction of buildings, but LSTA has an emphasis on technology. The new priority is the creation of technological infrastructure.&lt;ref name="gwen"&gt;Gregory, Gwen. "The Library Services and Technology Act: How Changes from LSCA are Affecting Libraries." Public Libraries, Vol. 38, no. 6, 1999: p. 378-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Another change that occurred with the passage of LSCA was the responsibility of library services. This responsibility was originally a part of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]. It was moved to the newly created, independent federal agency called the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services|Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).]]&lt;ref name="gwen"/&gt; The range of libraries served also changed with the enactment of LSTA. Originally, public libraries were primarily served by LSCA. With the passage of LSTA, all types of libraries are served, including public, school, academic, and special.

Not all initiatives under LSCA have changed with the enactment of LSTA. Priorities, like services to the under-served and rural areas, are still supported.&lt;ref name="gwen"/&gt;

LSCA is a federally funded state-based program generally administered by the state library of each state.  Specific funding categories are set by each state based on a long-range plan filed with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services|IMLS.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16836">In [[United States]] [[government]], the '''[[line-item veto]],''' or '''partial veto,''' is the power of an [[executive (government)|executive authority]] to nullify or cancel specific provisions of a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], usually a budget appropriations bill, without vetoing the entire legislative package. The line-item vetoes are usually subject to the possibility of legislative override as are traditional vetoes.

== Governors ==
Forty-four states—with [[Indiana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]] as the only states that do not grant such powers—give their governors some form of line-item veto power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget-tax/gubernatorial-veto-authority-with-respect-to-major.aspx |title=Gubernatorial Veto Authority with Respect to Major Budget Bill(s) |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.]] also has this power.&lt;ref&gt;[[District of Columbia Home Rule Act]] ({{USStatute|93|198|87|777|1973|12|24}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gregory|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/06/lincoln-chafee/ri-gov-lincoln-chafee-says-governors-46-states-hav/|title=R.I. Gov. Lincoln Chafee says governors in 46 states have line-item veto authority|website=Politifact|publisher=Providence Journal|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisconsin ===
The [[Governor of Wisconsin]] is empowered with a sweeping line-item veto.  Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills.&lt;ref name=NYTWisconsin&gt;Apple, R.W., Jr. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/us/political-memo-line-item-veto-would-begin-voyage-into-a-vast-unknown.html "Line-Item Veto Would Begin Voyage Into a Vast Unknown"], ''New York Times'', March 27, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholars, Wisconsin has used four types of extraordinary partial vetoes.&lt;ref name="wilrb" /&gt; The first, the "digit veto", was first used by Governor [[Patrick Lucey]] in 1973. In appropriation for $25 million, he vetoed the digit 2, resulting in an appropriation of $5 million.&lt;ref name="wilrb"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Partial Veto in Wisconsin |publisher=Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau |author=Radatz, Clark G. |date=January 2004 |url=http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/ib/04ib1.pdf |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082555/http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/ib/04ib1.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two years later, Lucey introduced the "editing veto". In this instance, the word "not" was removed in the phrase "not less than 50 percent", thus resulting in the opposite effect than desired by the legislature.&lt;ref name="sabato"&gt;{{cite book | title=A More Perfect Constitution | publisher=Walker &amp; Company | author=Sabato, Larry J. | authorlink=Larry J. Sabato | year=2007 | location=New York | pages=284–285 | isbn=978-0-8027-1621-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, an even more extreme version, the "pick-a-letter" or "[[Vanna White]] veto" was introduced. Governor [[Anthony Earl]] edited a 121-word, five-sentence paragraph down to a one-sentence, 22-word paragraph to change an appeals process from the courts to the Public Service Commission. The final version, the "reduction veto", was introduced in 1993 by Governor [[Tommy Thompson]]. This resulted in a legislatively-appropriated amount being reduced arbitrarily by the governor.&lt;ref name="wilrb" /&gt; This unprecedented usage has resulted in eight lawsuits and numerous amendment proposals. In the first lawsuit, ''State ex. rel. Wisconsin Telephone Co. v. Henry'', the Wisconsin Supreme Court granted absolute partial veto power to the Governor as long as a workable, complete law remained, stating the governor had "the right to pass independently on every separable piece of legislation in an appropriation bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=State ex. rel. Wisconsin Telephone Co. v. Henry|vol=218|reporter=Wis.|opinion=302|pinpoint=314-315|court=Wis.|date=1935|url=http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/ib/04ib1.pdf|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first two terms as governor, Thompson used 1,500 line-item vetoes to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.&lt;ref name=NYTWisconsin/&gt; The only judicial limitation was ''Risser v. Klauser'', which prohibited the "reduction veto", stating that "the constitution prohibits a writein veto of monetary figures which are not appropriation amounts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Risser v. Klauser|vol=207|reporter=Wis. 2d|court=Wis.|pinpoint=191|opinion=176|year=1997|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wi-supreme-court/1128792.html|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a constitutional amendment was passed abolishing the "Vanna White veto".&lt;ref name="wilrb" /&gt; Yet, in 2011, Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] controversially crossed out 116 words in a pension-related section of the budget bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.progressive.org/wx070611.html | title=Gov. Walker Uses "Vanna White Veto" to Rob New Public Sector Workers | work=The Progressive | date=July 6, 2011 | accessdate=November 14, 2012 | author=Rothschild, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confederate States ==
Article 1, Section 7 of the [[Confederate States Constitution]], adopted just before the start of the [[American Civil War]], would have granted the [[President of the Confederate States]] the ability to "approve any appropriation and disapprove any other appropriation in the same bill," with such disapprovals returned to the Houses of Congress for reconsideration and potentially for override.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp|title=Constitution of the Confederate States; March 11, 1861 |publisher=Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Line-Item Veto Act of 1996 ==
{{main|Line Item Veto Act of 1996}}
Presidents of the United States have repeatedly asked the Congress to give them a line-item veto power.&lt;ref name="CBSnewseludes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Madison|first=Lucy|title=15 years after its brief existence, line-item veto eludes presidents|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57490325-503544/15-years-after-its-brief-existence-line-item-veto-eludes-presidents/|work=Political Hotsheet|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=16 August 2012|date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Louis Fisher in ''The Politics of Shared Power,'' [[Ronald Reagan]] said to Congress in his 1986 State of the Union address, "Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat." [[Bill Clinton]] echoed the request in his [[1995 State of the Union Address|State of the Union address]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=51634#axzz2gmSarpIs|title=Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union|publisher=The American Presidency Project|work=Transcript|date=1995-01-24|accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress attempted to grant this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control "[[pork barrel spending]]", but in 1998 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6-3 decision in ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]''. The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment.  Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008092502/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/|archivedate=October 8, 2008|title=Supreme Court Strikes Down Line-Item Veto|publisher=CNN|date=June 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/nara004.html|title=History of Line Item Veto Notices|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent developments ==
Though the Supreme Court struck down the Line-Item Veto Act in 1998, President [[George W. Bush]] asked the Congress to enact legislation that would return the line-item veto power to the Executive Authority. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006, to the Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senators [[Bill Frist]] (R-[[Tennessee|TN]]) and [[John McCain]] (R-[[Arizona|AZ]]), and Republican Whip Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] ([[Kentucky|KY]]) jointly introduced this proposal. Representative [[Paul Ryan]] (R-[[Wisconsin|WI]]) introduced his own version, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, in March of that year.&lt;ref name=govtrack&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4890|title=H.R. 4890 (109th)|accessdate=October 15, 2018|author=109th Congress (2006)|date=March 7, 2006|work=Legislation|publisher=GovTrack.us|quote=Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On that same day, [[Joshua Bolten]], the Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], gave a press conference on the President’s line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out "wasteful" spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to withdraw the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.

When asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line-Item Veto Act that the United States Supreme Court had declared illegal, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, for the President to successfully withdraw previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.

Though the 2006 line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in the Congress. Senator [[Robert Byrd|Robert C. Byrd]] of West Virginia, called it "an offensive slap at Congress", asserting that the legislation would enable the President to intimidate individual members of any Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away the Congress’s constitutional "[[power of the purse]]" and give it to the executive branch.

On June 8, 2006, [[Viet D. Dinh]], Professor of Law at [[Georgetown Law|Georgetown University Law Center]], and [[Nathan Sales]], John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center, testified by written statement before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution's Bicameralism and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants the Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.

H.R. 4890, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act, was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006 by a vote of 24-9. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar version was included in the "Stop Over Spending Act of 2006",&lt;ref&gt;S.3521 Stop Over Spending Act of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; authored by Senator Judd Gregg, in the Senate and approved by the Senate Budget Committee, but the full Senate failed to approve it, thereby preventing the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act from becoming law.&lt;ref name=govtrack /&gt;

=== Line Item Veto Re-Enactment Activity of 2009 ===
In 2009, Senators [[Russ Feingold]] (D-WI) and John McCain introduced legislation of a limited version of the line-item veto. This bill would give the president the power to withdraw [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark. Congress would then vote on the line-item vetoed bill with a [[majority]] vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaI_6LByaIA |title=Feingold, McCain, Ryan Introduce Line-item Veto to Curb Wasteful Spending |publisher=YouTube}} Video of reintroduction of Line Item Veto Bill March 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feingold.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=309038 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105025838/http://feingold.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=309038 |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |title=Feingold, McCain, Ryan Introduce Line-item Veto to Curb Wasteful Spending |publisher=United States Senate |date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-2-25-2009/ |title=Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs |publisher=The White House |date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate===
Some scholars, such as Louis Fisher, believe the line-item veto would give presidents too much power over government spending compared with the power of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Locklar, Is the 1996 Line Item Veto Constitutional?, 34 Hous. L. Rev. 1161 (1997); Louis Fisher, State Techniques to Blunt the Governor's Item-Veto Power (1996) (CRS Report No. 96-996 GOV) (listing the tactics used in states "to counteract, blunt, or neutralize the governor's item-veto power"); Legislative Line-Item Veto Proposals: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Budget, 103rd Cong. 60 (1994) (statement of Louis Fisher); Richard Briffault, The Item Veto in State Courts, 66 Temple L. Rev. 1171, 1181 (1993) (describing how legislative control over the definition of "item" has eroded the power of governors who have the line item veto); Louis Fisher &amp; Neal Devins, How Successfully Can the States' Item Veto be Transferred to the President?, 75 Geo. L. J. 159 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curry, James A.; Riley, Richard B.; Battistoni, Richard M.: ''Constitutional Government", Kendall Hunt, 2009, pg. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Some argue{{Who|date=July 2010}} that it could even give the President ''de facto'' legislative authority in altering the law which could violate the principles, and perhaps even the letter, of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

Supporters of the line-item veto argue that the provision would make the President more accountable for federal spending. Also, the line-item veto can be used to prevent the enactment of controversial [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] amendments that powerful legislators have sometimes inserted into important bills, or at least it can be used to ensure that someone elected at the national level is accountable for the enactment of such amendments. Without the line-item veto, Presidents have often felt compelled to sign controversial riders into law even if they did not support them. [[Bob Barr]]'s former 2008 [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] running mate [[Wayne Root]] has also endorsed the line-item veto to go with his libertarian political views on spending while also suggesting the lifting of [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974|the Congressional ban on presidents impounding bills]].

}} 
'''Lorenzo Peña''' (born August 29, 1944) is a Spanish [[philosophy|philosopher]],  [[lawyer]], [[logic]]ian and [[political philosophy|political thinker]]. His [[rationalism]] is a neo-Leibnizian approach both in [[metaphysics]] and [[law]].

==Life==
Lorenzo Peña was born in [[Alicante]], [[Spain]], on August 29, 1944. Persecuted by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime, his mother (born in the Madrid Royal Palace in 1911) was not allowed to return to the Spanish capital city until 1952.

In Madrid Peña was taught Greek and Indoeuropean linguistics by the renowned Spanish philologist [[Francisco Rodríguez Adrados]] and ethics by J.L. Aranguren.

Upon becoming a political activist in February 1962, he was forced to emigrate in the spring 1965. In early 1969 he married his class-mate María Teresa Alonso in [[Meudon]] ([[France]]). While staying in Paris he was a disciple of the French historian [[Pierre Vilar]] and he witnessed the upheaval of May 1968. He gave up all clandestine activities in 1972. After spending 18 years in exile, he went back to Spain in 1983.

== Career ==
In 1974 Peña was awarded his philosophy degree (''licenciatura'') from the PUCE (the Ecuadorian Pontifical University in [[Quito]]), with [http://hdl.handle.net/10261/12292] a thesis on [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s [[Ontological argument]] for  the existence of God, his adviser being Julio C. Terán, S.J., who taught him hermeneutics. He then spent four years in Liège, Belgium, (1975–1979) where, under [[Paul Gochet]]'s supervision, he wrote [http://lorenzopena.es/franc/liege/] his dissertation on a system of contradictorial (paraconsistent) logic. At that time he was also granted a complementary degree in American Studies by the [[University of Liège]].

Upon receiving his Ph.D. in 1979, he came back to Ecuador. He was a professor at the PUCE for four years and later on, after returning to Spain, at León University for another three years. In 1987 he was appointed senior scientific researcher at the CSIC ([[Spanish National Research Council]], Spain's main academic research institution).

He spent six months in [[Canberra]] as a visiting scholar (1992–1993), under the guidance of the late [[Richard Sylvan]], and was a colleague of [[Philip Pettit]] at the philosophy department of the [[Australian National University]]. Later on he shifted his research orientation to the [[philosophy of law]]. He became a lawyer by earning first an M.L. (DEA) from [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] in 2007 and then a PhD in Law (Doctor of Juridical Science) from the same University in 2015 with a doctoral dissertation entitled [https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.4072.8169] IDEA IURIS LOGICA. In 2008 he enrolled with the Madrid Bar Association of Advocates. He reached the highest academic professional level (Research Professor) in 2006.

In August 2014 he underwent compulsory retirement but was granted the title of honorary Professor at his academic institution, the CSIC. As such he was appointed co-PI (Principal Investigator) of a new R+D project on the legal and ethical responsibility of omissions (2014-2017).

Peña is the founder of the digital journal 
''SORITES'' (1995-2008) and also the founder and former leader of JuriLog (Logical Jurisprudence), the logic-and-law research group at the CSIC, which is carrying out an inquiry into nomological concepts and values.

== Philosophical views ==

=== Ontophantics ===
Ontophantics is the system of philosophical conceptions developed by Peña in the years 1974–1995 (which do not necessarily coincide with those he has developed in recent years).

Although ontophantics is essentially a metaphysical doctrine, its starting point was a methodological approach through the philosophy of language, based on a realist semiotic theory to the effect that what is shown by language is also said (as against the Tractarian dichotomy), namely reality or being. Rather than regarding sentences and states of affairs in a static way, as logical atomists have done, ontophantics looks upon them dynamically, as transitions or processes. To utter a statement is not a mere series of successive actions of uttering the sentence's components but a transit from one saying into another along a temporal dimension. Likewise facts are nontemporal transitions consisting in a relation passing from one thing to another.

Since all passages seem to be subject to [[Zeno's paradox]] of the arrow, a 
[[paraconsistent logic]] is resorted to in order to solve the puzzle. Instead of blaming contradictions on thought or language Peña ascribes them to reality by embracing a [[non-classical logic]].

Another feature of ontophantics is the rejection of all forms of essentialism in the sense of considering attributions of being-so independent of assertions of being or existence—an opinion Peña attributes to [[Aristotle]] and [[Alexius Meinong]]. Peña's existence-oriented ontology identifies each entity with a fact, its existence. Ontological truth is also identified with existence, which is a reduplicative property. Ontophantics follows Frege's view of sentences as names of objects, but in this case the objects under consideration are states of affairs. From a linguistic perspective phenomena of nominalization are thus gone into from an outlook which eliminates any categorical cleavages. Such a metaphysical theory is strongly Platonistic. Ontophantics is also a modal realism, which takes reality to be all-encompassing, and thus comprising non-actual worlds.

Ontophantics contains a holistic theory of knowledge influenced by Gonseth and Quine, considering the cleavage between analytic and synthetic judgments a matter of degree. This epistemological holism is a sort of empirical coherentism, for which the task of human knowledge is to set up theories, to confront them with experience taken as a whole and to gradually modify them. Not only foundationalism of any kind is rejected but reliabilism is not accepted either, since no procedure is to be unconditionally trusted come what may.

Peña rehabilitates induction as a sound ground even for [[logical truth]]s (he follows the outdated opinion of [[John Stuart Mill]]). The choice among alternative logical systems has to be made in accordance with plausible criteria, one of which is fitness with the best explanation of available evidence, thus resorting to an optimization postulate, which in turn gets circularly warranted by its epistemological fruitness.

That optimization postulate is a rationality ideal which also provides a ground for assuming God's existence. Peña's first published book, ''The coincidence of opposites in God'' (Quito, 1981), was a discussion of the proofs of God's inexistence canvassed in the analytical philosophy of religion. He broached the question through a combination of a contradictorial logic and a non-standard set theory (in a way a mirror reversion of Quine's ML system), which regards infinite entities as not being subject to the principle of separation in virtue of which a thing is comprised by the set of entities with a certain characteristic only to the extent it has that characteristic. In that book he adopted determinism and rejected free will, a position he has maintained ever since, using it as a lever while grappling with issues in the philosophy of law.

=== Contradictorial gradualism ===

As against other persuasions in paraconsistent logic (such as relevantism and the Brazilian school), the paraconsistent treatment developed by Peña, which belongs in the [[Lotfi A. Zadeh#Fuzzy sets and systems|fuzzy]] family founded by [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], regards true contradictions as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence. His approach to fuzziness deviates from Zadeh's mainstream orthodoxy in rejecting alethic maximalism and so embracing the principle of excluded middle, regarding all intermediaries as degrees of both truth and falseness, being and non-being (Plato's influence is discernable here).

=== Transitive logic ===

In order to clarify his philosophical proposal Peña has set up several systems of sentential and quantificational logic which he calls «transitive logic», TL, as partial implementations of his programme. TL is characterized by a couple of negations, one strong («not at all»), which has all classical properties, and a weak one (a mere «not»), which is degree-sensitive. The fragment of TL without strong negation is a non-conservative extension of [[Alan Ross Anderson]] and [[Nuel Belnap]]'s logic of relevance, ''E'', (by adding the funnel principle, namely that either A implies B or else A; in other words, what is not true at all implies anything). Transitive implication is partly similar to relevant implication (although much stronger), but its underlying philosophical motivation is entirely different, since it is read «to the extent [at least] that...». The fragment of TL without weak negation and the implication operator is classical logic. TL is thus a logical blend or rather a crossbreed.

Peña's plan to investigate the grounds of his logical system as a nonclassical combinatory logic has thus far remained programmatic, but the combinatory account fits his metaphysical approach.

=== Cumulativism ===

Cumulativism is Peña's philosophical orientation as developed from 1996 onwards. Cumulativism is contradictorial gradualism with an added emphasis on six hitherto partly implicit components of his approach: (1) All transitions are either continuous or at least supervene on underlying continuous mutations, going through successive steps; hence change is always slow and implies a succession of stages, each of which keeps many qualities of the previous stage. (2) All transitions are either aggregations or disaggregations (processes of sedimentation or erosion) since cumulation, gathering, is reality's most prominent feature (ontophantics had already conceived of all entities as sets, but now the principle of togetherness is made the mainstay of the philosophical system). (3) Metaphysical isolationism is avoided by espousing collectivism both in metaphysics and political philosophy. (4) A programme of conceptual flexibilization is proposed, by which concepts become soft, fluid, with shifting borders. (5) The gatherings or clusters this approach advances are called ''cumuli'', ''cumulations''—so as not to be mistaken for sets in the sense of standard set-theory—the main idea remaining that not all things congregated by a cluster necessarily share the cluster's defining charasterictic (and, more generally, the Meinongian description principle fails, namely that the entity which is thus-and-so is indeed thus-and-so). (6) As a compendium, cumulativism is taken to be the philosophy of conjunction: A-and-B is a conjunctive state of affairs which exists to the extent A and B exist. A-and-B's own properties supervene on those held by A and B.

=== Nomological logic ===

Peña's work on [[deontic logic]] began short after his 1979 Ph.D. diss. The first paper he published on the issue appeared in 1988. At that time, he essentially clung to von Wright's standard approach, departing from it only by introducing degrees and admitting normative contradictions or antinomies. He soon became dissatisfied with that scheme which proved to be incompatible with serious applications of deontic logic to the practice of legal reasoning. He found out the flaw was to think of deontic logic as a species of the genus modal logic by stressing the similarities between duty and necessity, and between licitness and possibility.

The underlying mistake, according to Peña, is a wrong metaphysical assumption which denies the existence of deontic states of affairs connected by implications. That denial pushes deontic logicians to conceive of deontic logic as the logic of duty-compliances. Thus if A necessarily implies B, standard deontic logic believes that the duty to do A implies a duty to do B—this is the rule of logical closure. That rule is one of the first dogmas waived by Peña's deontic approach.

Peña was thus prompted to produce a new system of deontic logic, ''Nomological Logic'', or NL (also called 'Juristic Logic'), combining a number of particularities which make it unique:
*All standard deontic principles are relinquished except Bentham's law (namely that what is obligatory is also licit). More precisely, the two following rules are abandoned: logical closure and the usual distribution rules (the obligatoriness of A-and-B implies the obligatoriness of A and that of B, and conversely).
*Deontic detachment is embraced: If it is licit that either A or B, and in fact A happens not to be realized at all, then B is licit; and the same applies for obligatoriness. (Some restrictions are needed in order to avoid paradoxes.)
*The principle of co-licitness is espoused, namely that, to the extent A is licit and so is B, A-and-B is licit too.
*New deontic principles are introduced by resorting to two non-standard operators of hindering and causation: the causal effects of licit causes are licit and thwarting a licit behaviour is forbidden.
*A non-standard rule of liberty is added: if the prohibition of A cannot be proved, then A must be taken to be licit.
*Degrees of licitness and obligation are accounted for by apposite axioms involving implication; in particular a proportionality axiom is introduced linking degrees of realization of a factual antecedent with degrees of licitness or obligatoriness of the normative consequence.

Peña claims that the valid principles of logic in general and deontic logic in particular are found by induction, or rather abduction, through a circular holistic process. It is only by studying normative reasoning as it really happens in legal practice that sanitized sets of axioms and inference rules can be devised and then subject to the acid test of applicability.

=== Pluralistic axiology ===

Peña has proposed a pluralistic axiology in order to deal with the debate between deontological and consequentialist approaches in ethics.

Peña classifies ethical theories into two groups: [[internalism and externalism]], the former valuing conducts according to intrinsic features. Externalism comes in two ways: antecedentalism and [[consequentialism]]. There are two sorts of consequentialism: monistic and pluralistic, the former maintaining that there is one ethical property practical consequences of actions must have in order to render the action ethically valuable. Utilitarianism is a monist consequentialism.

Peña is a pluralist. He is inclined to a pluralistic consequentialism, but his approach can be taken to transcend the very dichotomy, since, once no unique criterion is looked for, actions ought to be assessed in a number of ways according to different values, some of which are not necessarily teleological. Since the approach is gradualistic, ethical valuations are taken to be scales with infinitely many degrees combined in infinitely complex compositions. Withal, the nearer a causal consequence of our action is, the higher its ethical significance. Peña implements ethical pluralistic gradualism through his paraconsistent fuzzy logic: actions can be regarded as both good and bad, better in certain respects and worse in other respects.

As for the units of behaviour to be assessed, Peña's ideas are close to virtue ethics in that he thinks isolated actions are generally too narrow unities to be reasonably appraised, although a whole course of life is too broad. Something in-between is a more adequate candidate, which means a span of one's life evincing a continuation of purposes, choices and habits.

Peña admits that a pluralistic axiology faces a serious difficulty, namely that it provides no clear guidance for action, unless there is an objective all-things-considered perspective. He claims that sometimes there is no such perspective and that in those cases choices are justified by one's previous allegiance to the prevalence of certain values. But even when an all-things-considered outlook is warranted, its existence does not mean that contradictory valuations are merely ''prima facie''. Thus ethical contradictions cannot be evaded.

=== Social evolutionism ===

As against all who claim that progress is a vapid concept and that there is no continuous improvement along history, Peña's philosophy of history argues that progress is the necessary outcome of our cultural rationality—weak and partial though it is—thanks to which any human society will tend to ameliorate its welfare by blending the scattered wisdom of its members into a combined collective purposive intelligence, thus increasing, little by little, its social accumulation of material and intellectual assets, establishing more workable, reliable and socially acceptable laws and making distribution practices more consonant with the public interest.

Human progress being continuous, no historic leaps are possible and so there is no objective ground for any periodization. Any delimitation of epochs is a matter of mere convenience. The law of human progress is not to be assimilated to grand schemes postulating a predetermined succession of ages, such as those of the Stoics, Vico, Hegel, A. Comte and K. Marx.

Peña's philosophy of history shares with those forerunners the view of human history as universal, both backwards and forwards. There is a common ancestry, which entails that at least a few elements of disparate human traditions go back to our shared origin. Those elements have been, time and again, strengthened by the mutual borrowing of concepts, techniques, institutions and procedures. There is also a common destination, owing to our shared Planet and a converging tendency, which needs no mysterious invisible hand but results from objective constraints.

Peña's philosophy of history acknowledges collective minds, which supervene on individual minds. No society can exist without a common memory and common plans of living-together and reaching common aims (which does not mean that all members of the body politic share those feelings; Peña rejects any mandatory imposition of beliefs or values).

Peña does not deny the existence of historic breaks caused by social involutions and disasters (wars, foreign subjugations, natural catastrophes) but thinks that every human society finds its way to restart the ascending march.

Peña maintains that future-oriented improvement is the sense of human life, both individual and collective; so much so that a fundamental right of man is the right to have a better life—as far as possible. This general right encompasses particular welfare rights, such as the rights to food, to work, to have a dwelling, to mobility and so on, all of which ought to be considered dynamically.

=== Republican republicanism ===

Peña's legal philosophy is a natural-law theory deriving from Aquinas's conception of law as an ordinance of reason for the common good. Some of those ordinances are promulgated by legislators by means of certain speech acts; others, natural-law norms, stem from the very nature of social relations. As against social-covenant views, Peña regards human beings as naturally social, antecedently banded together into a community under an established authority, whose duty is to pursue the public interest. Peña claims that inhabitants of the land enter a quasi-contract by growing up within society and benefiting from established social institutions, thus committing themselves to contribute to the common good and to subordinate their particular interests to those of society as a whole and to the needs of such people as are worse-off.

One of the main claims this social philosophy advances is the rejection of the dichotomy between State and civil society, a contrived duality which he blames as the root of serious misconceptions. The primeval meaning of «Republic» being the State, «republicanism» primarily means giving some prominence to the ''public'' mission vested in the State, by promoting or favouring the government's intervention and the domain of resources publicly managed—provided, that is, that such a State has no hereditary ruler.

Peña has coined the pleonasm «republican republicanism» (or its alternative wording «public republicanism») to designate his political ideas, according to which the State's job is to pursue the common welfare by organizing the public services. Peña claims that there has never been a minimal state concerned with keeping law and order and nothing else. On the contrary, all states have undertaken a broad range of productive activities without which no private enterprise would have been workable at all.

Republican republicanism is thus a political philosophy tending to increase the scope of activities entrusted to the State, by setting up a planned economy with a powerful public sector and a gradual socialization of property; in the meanwhile private ownership has to be fraught with legal burdens for the common good. This doctrine borrows a number of ideas from the traditions of the British [[Fabian Society]], French [[Corporatism#Corporate solidarism|solidarism]] and German chair-socialism as well as the Spanish school of Krausist philosophers and lawyers who inspired the II Republic (1931–1939), whose Constitution he takes as a paradigm.

Peña's republicanism implies the rejection of all forms of market economy, including [[market socialism]]. He contends that the State's patronage and intervention can alone bring a sense of directedness and unity of purpose, failing which the only practicable way is mercantile competition, with its dreary, ruthless consequences.

According to Peña, republican republicanism differs in four ways from civic neo-republicanism, or civicism. For one thing, it rejects monarchy, while civicism is not concerned over the political form of government. For another, it is statist, while civicists in the main agree with libertarians and liberals in viewing the public arena as a neutral ground within which private endeavours and undertakings are pursued by citizens, companies or other private clubs. Third, civicism promotes such private virtues as foster participation in public institutions, whereas Peña's republicanism recognizes the right of individuals not to be concerned with public issues. And fourth, civicism professes one value, freedom, understood as non-domination, while, as we have already seen, Peña espouses a plurality of values: thriving or welfare (akin to [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s flourishing), love, liberty, rationality, brotherhood, equality and living-together, owing to which normative and axiological contradictions are unavoidable. Dealing with those contradictions needs weighing and proportion (contradictorial gradualism bears out this proposal).

An essential component of Peña's republicanism is the proposal of an Earthian Republic. Peña views regional blocks as splits of the human family bringing about enmities and conflicts of interest rather than a fraternal union, which he champions on the ground of both prudential and axiological considerations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13138">'''Magna Carta of Chester''', or '''Cheshire''', was a charter of rights issued in 1215 in the style of the ''[[Magna Carta]]''. {{sfnp|Barraclough|1988}} The charter is primarily concerned with the relationship between the [[Earl of Chester]] and his barons, though the final clause states that the barons must allow similar concessions to their own tenants.{{sfnp|Lush|2015}}

==Background==
[[File:Wales 1234 (Marchia Wallie and Pura Wallia).svg|thumb|The location of the [[Earldom of Chester]] in relation to the Kingdom of England.&lt;ref name=wrexham&gt;[http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/medieval_exhibition/struggles.htm Wrexham County Borough Council: The Princes and the Marcher Lords]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Runnymede]] [[Magna Carta|Charter of Liberties]] did not apply to the shire of [[Chester]], which at the time was a separate feudal domain. At the petitions of his barons, the [[Earl of Chester]], [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Ranulf III]] set out his own charter.{{sfnp|Hewitt|1929|p=9}} The similarities between many of the clauses in the Magna Carta of Chester and those in the [[Magna Carta]] indicates that it was written after [[John, King of England|King John]] issued the latter on 19 June 1215.{{sfnp|Barraclough|1988|p=392}}

In the early 1200s, the [[Earldom of Chester]] was the only [[county palatine]] on the [[Welsh Marches]];&lt;ref name=wrexham/&gt;{{sfnp|Holt|1992|pages=379-380}} [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Ranulf III]] ruled [[Chester]] as a separate feudal domain. His barons living outside of Cheshire are referred to as his 'knights from England'.{{sfnp|Swallow|2014|p=289}} In the late 12th century manuscript ''[[De laude Cestrie]]'', Lucian of Chester describes the county as obedient, 'more to the sword of its prince than to the crown of the king.'

[[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Ranulf III]] had been loyal to [[John, King of England|the king]] during the [[First Barons' War]] and had supported the ''[[Magna Carta]]''.{{sfnp|Turner|1971}}{{sfnp|Carpenter|2004|p=290}} Ranulf III, [[William Marshal]], the [[Earl of Derby]] and [[Earl of Warwick]] were the only members of the nobility to support the king. In 1215, Ranulf was one of the few [[magnates]] to serve as a witness for the Magna Carta.

Before John's death in 1216, rebel barons offered the throne of England to [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]]. Louis arrived in England [[Louis_VIII_of_France#Pretender_to_the_English_throne|unopposed in the summer of 1216]] and took Winchester. Ranulf was an outspoken supporter for the re-issuing of the Magna Carta after [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Louis' retreat in 1217]]. He also witnessed the 1225 re-issue of the Runnymead ''Magna Carta''. His general support for John's ''Magna Carta'', makes the issuing of his own no surprise.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Content==
The charter is recorded as having been issued, 'at the petition of the barons of Cheshire,'{{sfnp|Barraclough|1988|p=388}} suggesting that they were sufficiently discontented that Ranulf III attempted to pacify them before taking the cross.{{sfnp|Barraclough|1988|p=392}}

The charter has 13 clauses, in contrast to the 60 of the ''Magna Carta''.{{sfnp|Lush|2015}}

===''Clauses 1 &amp; 4''===
Several clauses approach issues found in the Runnymede charter, but in a different way. Clauses 1 and 4 deal with the rival claims of the earl's court and barons' courts to jurisdiction over tenants living on baronial estates. Clause 1 acknowledges the earl's right to judge the most serious offences, but Clause 4 allows defendants of his court to plea 'thwetnic' (total denial), on which the defendant would be released to the jurisdiction of their baron.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

===''Clauses 2 &amp; 3''===
Clauses 2 and 3 refer to the system whereby fugitive [[Villein (feudal)|villeins]] from outside the county, including those fleeing justice, could take refuge on the estates of the earl or his barons. This was accompanied by an obligation on the part of male fugitives to provide labour and military service.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

===''Clauses 5 &amp; 6''===
Clause 5 limits penalties that the earl's court could apply, but Graeme White argues that this applied only to the specific of non-attendance by judges and suitors; a far more restricted context than that specified in ''Magna Carta'' clauses 20 and 21.{{sfnp|White|2015}} Clause Six grants various rights within the Cheshire forests: to [[assart]], cultivate land and sell dead wood. Clause 8 protects widows and heirs, but makes no specific mention of [[Ward (law)|wardship]].{{sfnp|White|2015}}

===''Clause 9''===
Clause 9 raises the issue whereby urban residence for a year and day would secure an individual freedom from [[Villein (feudal)|villeinage]]. Migration from the countryside into Chester - prospering as a port in the wake of Henry II’s acquisitions in Ireland - was of concern to the Cheshire barons, who wanted their entitlements to reclaim their villeins spelled out.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

===''Clause 10''===
Clause 10 concerns limits to military service and [[castle-guard]] duty, similar to ''Magna Carta'' clauses 16 and 29. However, Clause 10 goes into a level of detail befitting a frontier county accustomed to threatened or actual attack from the Welsh. Significant points here include the treatment of the [[Forest of Lyme|Lyme]] as a border beyond which Cheshire knights are not obliged to fight and the expectation that the garrisoning of Chester castle should fall primarily upon fees of the honour outside the county.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

===''Clause 11''===
Clause 11 limits the provisions that could be claimed by officials. This clause resembles ''Magna Carta'' Clause 28, although the Cheshire charter focusses specifically upon the entitlements of [[Serjeanty|itinerant law-enforcement officers]].{{sfnp|White|2015}}

===''Clause 12''===
Clause 12 of the charter has no counterpart in the ''Magna Carta''. Ranulf III was quite happy to itemise the petitions he had turned down, most of which were related to the aspirations of particular individuals or interest-groups, rather than the baronial community as a whole.

{{cquote|'''Clause 12''' {{sfnp|White|2015}}&lt;br&gt;
And may it be known that the aforesaid barons have completely remitted to me and my heirs, on behalf of themselves and their heirs, the following petitions which they were asking from me, so that they can claim nothing in relation to them henceforth, unless by my grace and mercy: namely, the steward his petition for wreck and fish washed up on his land by the sea, and for shooting in my forest with three bows, and for hunting with his dogs; and others the petition for the [[agistment]] of pigs in my forest and for shooting with three bows in my forest, or for the coursing of their hares in the forest on the way to, or returning from Chester in response to a summons; and the petition for the [[amercement]] of the judges of Wich thirty boilings of salt, but the amercement and laws in Wich shall be as they were before.
{{Hidden begin|title=Original Latin text}}
'''Clause 12'''&lt;br&gt;
Et sciendum est quod predicti barones peticiones subscriptas, quas a me requirebant, omnino mihi et heredibus meis de se et heredibus suis remiserunt, ita quod nihil in eis de cetero clamare poterunt, nisi per gratiam et misericordiam meam; scilicet, senescallus peticionem de wrec et de pisce in terram suam per mare deiecto, et de bersare in foresta mea ad tres arcus, et de percursu canum suorum; et alii peticionem de agistiamento porcorum in foresta mea et de bersare ad tres arcus in foresta mea, vel ad cursus leporariorum suorum in foresta in eundo versus Cestriam per summonitionem vel in redeundo; et petitionem de misericordia iudicum de Wich triginta bullonum salis, set erunt misericordia et leges in Wich tales quales prius fuerunt.

}}

The steward mentioned was Roger de [[Mold, Flintshire|Montalt]], who held land on the south-west side of the [[Dee estuary]]; he was well-placed to profit from accidents to ships using the port of Chester. The reference to, 'the coursing of their hares in the forest on the way to, or returning from Chester in response to a summons,' suggests that the barons were hoping that [[Hunting|sport]] would be laid on whenever they were summoned to Chester.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

==Comparison with the ''Magna Carta''==
Many phrases in the Cheshire charter are similar to those in the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and appear to have been adapted directly from it. Clause 1 in the Cheshire charter refers to 'pleas of the sword' (''exceptis placitis ad gladium meum pertinentibus''), similar to Clause One of the Magna Carta's 'pleas of the Crown.'{{sfnp|Swallow|2014|p=289}} Similarly, Clauses 1 and 4 conclude with references to a private prosecutor and witnesses respectively, paralleling the provisions made in ''Magna Carta'' Clause 38 to prevent unsupported allegations by local officials.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

Clause 6 grants the Cheshire barons rights within the Cheshire forests to: [[assart]]; cultivate land; and sell dead wood. In contrast to the 'forest clauses' of the ''Magna Carta'' (44, 47 and 48), there is no mention of disafforestation or curbing officials.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

Clause 8 protects widows and heirs, but makes no specific mention of [[Ward (law)|wardship]]. The clause is so brief that it suggests the outrage fuelling ''Magna Carta'' Clauses 2 - 8 were of less concern to the barons of Cheshire.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

Clause 13 contains the strongest link to the ''Magna Carta'', with its insistence that, ‘all [[Knight-service|common knights]] and free tenants of the whole of Cheshire,’ should enjoy the same treatment from the barons, as the barons would have from the earl. This parallels the ''Magna Carta's'' Clause 60, which extends its concessions to ‘all men of our realm’.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

==Reissue==
When the ''Magna Carta'' was [[Magna Carta#Confirmatio|reconfirmed in 1300]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], the Earldom of Chester had already belonged to the king for 63 years, thus the ''Magna Carta'' applied to Cheshire. However, the Cheshire charter was also confirmed on 30 March 1300.{{sfnp|Lush|2015}}{{sfnp|White|2015}} The charter had previously been reissued on 27 August 1265, after the [[Battle of Evesham]] to reward the county for its support.{{sfnp|White|2015}}

'''The Marietta seven''' were defendants on a murder charge who were subsequently exonerated. One, James Creamer, had been sentenced to death, and the others to life imprisonment. 

They had been convicted of the murder of Warren and Rosina Matthews, in May 1971 in [[Marietta, Georgia]]. The victims - two physicians -   were shot to death in their home, apparently during an attempted robbery. The principal evidence against them at the trial was the evidence  of Deborah Ann Kidd, who testified she was one of the group, and that Creamer was the shooter. In 1974, [[Georgia State Supreme Court]] unanimously upheld all the convictions and sentences.

In 1975, it emerged from an investigation by the [[Atlanta Constitution]] newspaper that Kidd's testimony was probably false. She said she was under the influence of drugs when the crime had occurred and remembered little of it, and her full account was recovered with the aid of an hypnotist. Although the tapes of the hypnosis session showed that the hypnotist had suggested the incriminating material to which Kidd confessed,  and one woman she named as participating in the crime was proven to be out of state at the time, the defense was not given transcripts of the sessions nor informed about her false identification. Kidd had also given many incompatible versions of events that transpired at the crime scene, which the defense team did not receive. It was later discovered that Kidd was romantically involved with one of the detectives assigned to the case.

During the course of appeals, Kidd admitted she lied in her original testimony, and Billy Birt, a death-row inmate, confessed that he and two other men had committed the murder. In 1975, the convictions of the seven were reversed and the state dropped the charges.

The '''Murder of Ofir Rahum''' was a shooting attack which occurred on 17 January 2001, in which Palestinian militants from the [[Tanzim]] faction of [[Fatah]] killed 16-year-old Israeli high school student Ofir Rahum on the outskirts of [[Ramallah]].

The murder was planned and initiated by 24-year-old Mona Jaud Awana from [[Bir Nabala]]. After many weeks in which Mona conducted long private conversations in English with Rahum through the instant messenger program [[ICQ]], during which she masqueraded as a Jewish immigrant from [[Morocco]] named Sally, Mona managed to gain his confidence and get him to meet with her in [[Jerusalem]], supposedly for romantic purposes. When he arrived for the meeting, she drove him through the border control into the Palestinian-controlled territory and towards a secluded area on the outskirts of Ramallah where Palestinian terrorists shot him at close range, with Mona standing aside and watching.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/01/41300 | title=Israel's 'First Internet Murder' | publisher=Wired | date=19 January 2001 | author=Hershman, Tania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSubjects/SafeSurfingEng/TeenagersEng/SSETSurfSafetly/SSETSTOphirRachum/ The Murder of Ofir Rahum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022111226/http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSubjects/SafeSurfingEng/TeenagersEng/SSETSurfSafetly/SSETSTOphirRachum/ |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L88wBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|title=Radicalization, Terrorism, and Conflict|last=Walters|first=Tali|last2=Monaghan|first2=Rachel|date=2013-07-26|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443850902|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ofir Rahum.jpg|thumb|250px|Ofir Rahum]]
Mona Awana, later arrested by the Israeli police, stated that on the day of the [[Lynching in Ramallah|lynching of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah]] in late 2000 by a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[crowd]], she decided to abduct an Israeli and murder him. Mona had been present at the Ramallah lynching, and said she was "excited" by what she saw. Soon after, she began contacting Israelis on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.il/children/page_21.htm education.gov.il] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501235850/http://www.education.gov.il/children/page_21.htm |date=1 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Awana chatted with several Israeli teenagers on [[chat rooms]] and engaged in an online romance with Rahum. In conversations over several months she pressed for a meeting in [[Jerusalem]]. When Rahum suggested a venue closer to his home, she claimed she had no car but promised to arrange for his return by 5 P.M. Employing sexual innuendos, she persuaded him to meet her.  Two days before the murder, she wrote, "You don't know how much I am waiting for Wednesday."&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72389156.html | title=Ofir's Fatal Attraction: An Israeli boy looks for love online and meets a vengeful Palestinian | publisher=Newsweek | date=2 April 2001 | accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they met, she convinced him to accompany her to Ramallah.&lt;ref name="Terror on the Internet"&gt;{{cite book | title=Terror on the Internet: the new arena, the new challenges | publisher=US Institute of Peace Press | author=Weimann, Gabriel | year=2006 | pages=71–74 | isbn=1929223714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
On 17 January 2001, Mona and Rahum met at the central bus station in Jerusalem, spoke briefly in English, and then got on a taxi which drove to the el-Ram intersection.  From there they drove in a [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] with Israeli license plates, through the border control into the Palestinian-controlled territory&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1318717/Peace-hope-buried-with-shot-boy.html | title=Peace hope buried with shot boy | publisher=The Telegraph | date=20 January 2001 | accessdate=29 September 2012 | author=Philps, Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and towards the outskirts of Ramallah.&lt;ref name="Jpost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keinon|first=Herb|title=The reasons for Hamas's 'flexibility' on Schalit swap|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=250412|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=14 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502175654/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=250412|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rahum questioned Mona why they were traveling through Arab-dominant areas, Mona replied that "that's the way it is in Jerusalem, which has both Arab and Jewish neighborhoods."&lt;ref name="Shin Bet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shabak.gov.il/publications/study/Pages/Internet-poison.aspx?webid=a3db3c16-25d8-423d-98df-eb1b9253ab93 | title=פיתיון האינטרנט - רצח הנער אופיר רחום (17 ינואר) 2001 | publisher=Shin Bet | accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:30, Mona stopped the car at a secluded area on the outskirts of Ramallah next to a car with Palestinian license plates, at a location which was chosen in advance with the Palestinian militant cell. Mona immediately jumped out of the vehicle,&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; while the militants, Hassan Alkadi and Abdul Fatah Doleh, armed with [[rifles]], got out of their car and shot Rahum from close range more than 15 times, while all along Mona was standing aside and watching. Afterwards, the assailants threw Rahum's body into the trunk and fled to Ramallah.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Memorial/2001/Ofir+Rahum.htm | title=Ofir Rahum | publisher=The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs | accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assailants secretly buried Rahum's body in the al-Tira neighborhood in Ramallah.&lt;ref name="Shin Bet"/&gt;

==Investigation==
After Rahum did not return home from school, his family began looking for him, and found out that he did not go to school that day. Following further investigation by the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] security agency and the Israeli International Crimes Unit, it was revealed that Rahum corresponded with Mona through the Internet and that she pressed Rahum to meet with her in [[Jerusalem]], and that she promised to have intimate relations with him.&lt;ref name="Internet lure"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shabak.gov.il/English/EnTerrorData/Reviews/Pages/Internet-poison-en.aspx | title=The Internet lure – the murder of Ofir Rahum, Jan. 17, 2001 | publisher=Shin Bet | accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=20832 נענע10 - נמשכת חקירת רצח הנער אופיר רחום - חדשות]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, an undercover Israeli [[Duvdevan Unit]] force, in conjunction with the Shin Bet, raided Mona's house in Bir Nabala and managed to apprehend Mona.&lt;ref name="Shin Bet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1128455.stm|title=BBC News - MIDDLE EAST - Woman denies internet murder|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later interrogated by the Shin Bet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-449309,00.html|title=ynet החשודה ברצח אופיר רחום מכחישה כל מעורבות ברצח - חדשות|work=ynet|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January, Palestinian security forces located Rahum's body and brought it to the Ramallah hospital. A short time later, his body was transferred to Israel.

Although Mona initially refused to cooperate with the investigators, she broke down after about four weeks and gave a full confession of her involvement in the murder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1189804.stm|title=BBC News - MIDDLE EAST - Woman 'confesses to internet murder'|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revealed the identities of her partners in crime – the senior Ramallah-area Fatah Tanzim operatives Hassan Alkadi and Abdul Fatah Doleh of [[Beitunia]].&lt;ref name="Shin Bet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2001/Senior+Fatah-Tanzim+operatives+responsible+for+mur.htm|title=Senior Fatah-Tanzim operatives responsible for murder of Ofir Rahum-25-Feb-2001|work=GxMSDev|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The murder caused great shock amongst the Israeli public.  The Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] stated in response to the murder that the attack was a "heinous crime committed by vile killers, lacking human dignity. The Security forces will not spare any effort to reach the murderers so that they would be punished severely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-445948,00.html|title=ynet "הם הצליחו להרוג את אופיר בגלל האינטרנט" - חדשות|work=ynet|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} of people attended Rahum's funeral which was held on 19 January at noon in the [[Ashkelon]] cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/9/38308|title=אופיר רחום הובא למנוחות|work=וואלה! חדשות|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahum's gravestone was built in the form of a [[personal computer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://halemo.net/edoar/0028/ofirrahumtomb01.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;
Israel's Permanent Representative to the [[United Nations]] wrote to the Secretary-General to protest the "recent acts of Palestinian terrorism directed against Israeli civilians".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/25bd7e256967d375852569e500476953!OpenDocument Letter dated 23 January 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awana was tried, and eventually convicted of murder in February 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2799917,00.html|title=ynet אמנה מונא הורשעה בגרימת מותו של אופיר רחום  - חדשות|work=ynet|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2813523,00.html|title=ynet מאסר עולם לאמנה מונא על רצח הנער אופיר רחום  - חדשות|work=ynet|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later transferred to the Neveh Tirza prison in 2006 after attacking another inmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben-Zur|first=Raanan|title=Female terrorist attacks fellow inmate|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3260643,00.html|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=[[Ynetnews]]|date=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Israeli government initially said that Awana would not be part of the deal,&lt;ref name="Jpost"/&gt; she was released to Gaza on 18 October 2011 as part of the [[Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange]] between Israel and Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shabas.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/09ED13AD-30EB-4F28-8FEA-7A9EDB0F9119/0/listeng1.xls|title=שרות בתי הסוהר|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awana is now residing in exile in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=241669|title=The reasons for Hamas’s ‘flexibility’ on Schalit swap|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbas-Awana meeting==
On 20 December 2011, Palestinian leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]] privately met Awana in [[Ankara]], for which he was criticized by Israel.  Abbas said that the release of the remaining Palestinian prisoners in Israel was at the top of the Palestinian agenda.  An Israeli government spokesman said that the Israeli government was "disappointed" by this decision, and that "instead of promoting peace and reconciliation, the Palestinian leadership seems to be putting extremist murderers up on a pedestal.  This raises serious questions as to their commitment and as to their desire to end the conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Elior|title=Abbas meets freed Palestinian prisoners in Ankara|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4165039,00.html|accessdate=21 December 2011|newspaper=YNET|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=ABU TOAMEH|first=KHALED|title=Abbas putting extremist murderers on pedestal|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=250412|accessdate=21 December 2011|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=21 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222004211/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=250412|archivedate=22 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mustahabb''' ({{Lang-ar|مستحبّ|lit=recommended}}) is an [[Islamic term]] referring to recommended, favoured or [[virtue|virtuous]] actions.

Mustahabb actions are those whose status of approval in Islamic law (''[[ahkam]]'') falls between ''[[mubah]]'' (neither encouraged nor discouraged) and ''[[wajib]]'' (compulsory). One definition is "duties recommended, but not essential; fulfilment of which is rewarded, though they may be neglected without punishment".&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Levy, ''The Social Structure of Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;202&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms of ''mustahabb'' include ''masnun'' and ''mandub''. The opposite of ''mustahabb'' is ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged).

A node stream is a method of transferring large amounts of data on mobile devices or websites (such as uploading detailed photographs) by breaking the file or data down into manageable chunks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93|title=Node.js Streams: Everything you need to know|first=Samer|last=Buna|date=22 May 2017|website=freeCodeCamp|access-date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The chunks of data do not use as much [[computer memory]], so they are less likely to slow down the device, allowing the user to do other things on it whilst waiting for the [[file transfer]] to complete.

In technical terms, in [[Node.js]] a '''node stream''' is a readable or writable continuous flow of data that can be manipulated [[asynchrony (computing)|asynchronously]] as data comes in (or out).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-streams/|title=Introduction to Node.js Streams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This API can be used in data intensive web applications where [[scalability]] is an issue.

A stream could be several things, not just a [[File Streaming Technology|file stream]], such as a [[Parser (CGI language)|parser]], [[HTTP request]], or a [[child process]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyjs.com/2012/09/10/streams/|title=Mastering Node Streams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongley of the Receiver General's Office in British Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt; was the beginning of a systematic land reform programme during the [[Tanzimat]] (reform) period of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the second half of the 19th century.  This was followed by the 1873 land emancipation act.
==History==
The Ottoman Land Code of 1858, prepared by the Tanzimat Council, was an original Ottoman creation, neither European nor entirely Islamic. It was founded on traditional land practices and included categories of land cited in Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=Xb0eAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=ottoman+land+code+1858&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a15r-cHR2L&amp;sig=eZ7lha2Byu8XrA8HFGaQvCBsb2E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCGoVChMI0NW5rNCyxwIVCdoaCh0mMQdf#v=onepage&amp;q=ottoman%20land%20code%201858&amp;f=false Islamic Law in Palestine and Israel: A History of the Survival of Tanzimat, Robert H. Eisenman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1858, land in [[Ottoman Syria]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] since 1516, was cultivated or occupied mainly by peasants. Land ownership was regulated by people living on the land according to customs and traditions. Usually, land was communally owned by village residents, though land could be owned by individuals or families.&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"&gt;[http://www.beki.org/landlaw.html Ottoman Land Registration Law as a Contributing Factor in the Israeli-Arab Conflict], Jon-Jay Tilsen, Congregation Beth El–Keser Israel (retrieved August 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire classified land into five categories:
"1)''Arazi Memluke''- Lands held in fee simple, freehold lands
2)''Arazi Mirie''- Crown lands belonging to the state exchequer
3)''Arazi Mevkufe''- Lands possessed in mortmain, but tenanted by a kind of copyhold
4)''Arazi Metruke''- Lands abandoned without cultivation or ostensible owner
5)''Arazi Mevat''- Dead lands, uncultivated and unappropriated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ottomanlandcode00turkuoft/ottomanlandcode00turkuoft_djvu.txt Full text of the Ottoman Land Code, Translated by F. Ongley of the Receiver General's Office in British Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arazi Memluke'' lands were properties that were owned by private individuals that were collected through conquest, state endowment, or inheritance. These lands were subject to taxation by the Ottoman Empire. ''Arazi Mirie'' lands were state owned properties that the Ottoman sultan could bestow to loyal subjects, [[vizier]]s, and military commanders (these lands were kept through payments to the Ottoman Empire).''Arazi Mevkufe'' is land constituting ''Arazi Memluke'' which has been made ''Vakf'' in accordance with the Sharia. ''Vakf'' means that the Ottoman Sultan has assigned the tithes or taxes to a specific object as opposed to an individual. ''Arazi Metruke'' is land that has been allocated for public use (ex. roads). ''Arazi Mevat'' is land that nobody has claimed ownership of which has subsequently been neglected and remains uncultivated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ottomanlandcode00turkuoft/ottomanlandcode00turkuoft_djvu.txt Full text of the Ottoman Land Code, Translated by F. Ongley of the Receiver General's Office in British Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858 the Ottoman Empire introduced ''The Ottoman Land Code of 1858'', requiring land owners to register ownership. The reasons behind the law were twofold. (1) to increase tax revenue, and (2) to exercise greater state control over the area. Peasants, however, saw no need to register claims, for several reasons:&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"/&gt;

* Land owners were subject to military service in the Ottoman Army
* General opposition to official regulations from the Ottoman Empire
* Evasion of taxes and registration fees to the Ottoman Empire

The registration process itself was open to manipulation. Land collectively owned by village residents was registered in the name of a single landowner, with merchants and local Ottoman administrators registering large stretches of land in their own name. The result was land that became the legal property of people who may have never lived there, while peasants, even those who had lived on the land for generations, became tenants of absentee owners.&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"/&gt;

Prior to the enactment of the Ottoman Land Code, 1858, land was held by virtue of Sultanic decrees, grants made by conquerors of various areas, judgments of both civil and Muslim religious courts, orders of administrative authorities and deeds of sale executed before the Muslim courts. Encroachment on unoccupied land belonging to the State and various other unauthorised methods accounted for large holdings. Land acquired by lawful means (such as grant from a competent authority) was, in theory at least, reported to [[Constantinople]], where an effort was made to maintain a series of registers known as the ''daftar khaqani'' (imperial land registers).&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920 – 1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, p. 237, chapter 8, section 3, paragraph 37&lt;/ref&gt; With the enactment of the Ottoman Land Code, that same year the Turkish Government also passed the Land Registration Law of 1858, for better regulation of its land tenure laws, and, by way of extension, a more efficient way of levying taxes on property.

The Ottoman land law classifies land under five kinds or categories. These, with suggested approximate counterparts in English, are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920–1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, p. 226–227, of chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 6 (Reprinted in 1991 by the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]).&lt;/ref&gt; 

# ''[[Mülk]]'' = private or [[allodial]] land (held in absolute ownership). 
# ''Miri'' = feudal or State land, but can also specifically refer to vacant State land, private [[usufruct]] State land. A sub-category of the same is ''mahlul'', or what is defined as escheated State land.&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920–1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, pp. 226 – ff., of chapter 8, section 1, paragraphs 6 &amp; 16(Reprinted in 1991 by the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]). There, it states: "...The 'owners' who hold land by ''miri'' tenure (i.e. conditional usufruct tenure of land held by grant from the State) can only exercise such rights as can be shown to have been accorded to them by the State, and these rights are laid down in the Ottoman law... Failure of successors brings the grant to an end and the land becomes ''mahlul''(option land) and returns to the State."&lt;/ref&gt; Most Ottoman registrations of ''miri'' (usufruct) titles existing in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] are based on a presumed or lost grant.&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920–1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, p. 229, of chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''[[Waqf]]'' = allodial land in mortmain tenure, being land assured to pious foundations or revenue from land assured to pious foundations; also usufruct State land of which the State revenues are assured to pious foundations.
# ''Matruka'' = communal ''[[Profit (real property)|profits-à-prendre]]'' land, being land subject to public easements in common, or servitude State land. Included in this class is ''Meraʿa'' land, meaning, pasture land reserved primarily for the use of the adjoining villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov.il/en/archives/#/Archive/0b071706800225ea/File/0b071706806f09da Israel Government Archives (Land Registry Office of Jerusalem - Register of Deeds)], p. 39 (Mandatory Organizations); letter written by M. Doukhan, Advocate, on 19 January, 1941. "Meraʿa lands," same as "Arazi Metruké" in the Ottoman Land Code, of which there were two kinds: the first being "pasture land" that has been allotted to a village or number of villages, and which cannot be cultivated or turned into private property or belong to individuals (Art. 97 of the Ottoman Land Code). Such lands were used principally as pasture land for grazing; the second being "pasture land" that was privately owned, and which could be used for general cultivation, such as ploughing and sowing (Article 5 of the Law of Disposition of Immovable Property of the year 1913 (1331)), without the necessity of obtaining special authority.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Mewat'' = dead and undeveloped land; unoccupied lands not held by title deed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Kark]] &amp; Michael Oren-Nordheim, ''Jerusalem and its Environs: Quarters, Neighborhoods, Villages, 1800–1948'', [[Hebrew University]]: Jerusalem 2001, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which each of these modes of law applied to the several countries under Ottoman rule varied, and was largely dependent upon the country itself. For example, not all of these modes of user were actually found in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The extent of ''mulk'' or allodial lands (privately owned property) in Palestine was limited, and was usually only found in the old cities or in garden areas. Rural land in this category was rare.&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920–1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, pp. 225–226 of chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 3 (Reprinted in 1991 by the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In nearly all cases (excluding only “Waqf” lands, and communal ''profits-à-prendre'' land, or dead and undeveloped land), lands were either ''mulk'' or ''miri'' tenures.&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920–1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, p. 225 of chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 3 (Reprinted in 1991 by the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Ottoman Land Code as applied in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]]==
When the [[United Kingdom|British]] assumed control over Palestine at the end of 1917 with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, they applied the Ottoman laws of the ''Ottoman Land Code of 1858'' to all inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920–1948'', British Mandate government printing office, Jerusalem 1946, vol. 1, p. 225, of chapter 8, section 1, paragraph 1 (Reprinted in 1991 by the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]), which reads: "The land law in Palestine embraces the system of tenures inherited from the Ottoman regime, enriched by some amendments, mostly of a declaratory character, enacted since the British Occupation on the authority of the Palestine Orders-in-Council."&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the British occupation the land tax was collected at the rate of 12 &lt;small&gt;1/2&lt;/small&gt; ''per cent.'' of the gross yield of the land. Crops were assessed on the threshing floor or in the field and the tithe was collected from the cultivators.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine'' (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]), chapter 8, section 4, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, additional legislation provided that taxation on crops and other produce not exceed 10%. In 1928, as a measure of reform, the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Government of Palestine]] began to apply an Ordinance for the "Commutation of Tithes," this tax in effect being a fixed aggregate amount paid annually. It was related to the average amount of tithe (tax) that had been paid by the village during the four years immediately preceding the application of the Ordinance to it.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine'' (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]), chapter 8, section 4, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, pp. 246 – 247&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pratt Cates Remmel, Sr.''' (October 26, 1915{{snd}}May 14, 1991), was the only 20th century [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] elected on a partisan ballot to have served as [[mayor]] of the capital city of [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]].

Remmel was elected to the first of two two-year terms in 1951, was reelected in 1953, and then defeated in 1955 by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Woodrow Wilson Mann]], who like Remmel was engaged in the [[insurance]] business. In 1954, Remmel was the unsuccessful Republican [[governor of Arkansas|gubernatorial]] candidate against the  Democrat [[Orval Faubus]], who won the first of his six consecutive two-year terms as the state's highest constitutional officer. Remmel's 37 percent of the [[general election]] vote was the greatest then attained by a Republican candidate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In some ways, he paved the beginning of a long route that would bring fellow Republican [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] to the governorship in 1967. Rockefeller moved into the state only a year before Remmel ran for governor.

==Family, education, military==
Remmel was born in Little Rock to former Arkansas Republican state chairman [[Augustus Caleb "Gus" Remmel]] (1882–1920) and the former [[Ellen Lucy "Nell" Cates]] (1888–1961), who was the Arkansas Republican national committeewoman, a position equivalent to membership on the [[Republican National Committee]], having served from 1928 until 1957. Remmel's father died when he was five, and his mother reared her children without a husband. One of Remmel's great-uncles, [[Harmon Liveright Remmel]] (1852–1927, usually known as [[H. L. Remmel]]), served as Republican state chairman from 1900 to 1925 and [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] national committeeman in 1924 and ran unsuccessfully for Arkansas governor in 1894, 1896, and 1900 and for the [[United States Senate]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', December 4, 1920; March 8, 1961; ''New York Times'', October 15, 1927; http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/reily-remsen.html#RY7155VBJ&lt;/ref&gt;

Remmel graduated from [[Little Rock High School]] in 1933. In 1937, he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[economics]] from the [[University of Virginia]] at [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Butler Allard, ed. ''Who Is Who in Arkansas, Vol. I (Little Rock, 1959), pp. 199-200; ''Who's Who in the South and Southwest'' (Chicago, 1952), p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Remmel was a [[United States Navy]] [[lieutenant]], a [[Aviator|pilot]], and flight instructor.&lt;ref name="Arkansas River Hall of Fame"&gt;[http://www.tulsaweb.com/port/hallfame96.htm Arkansas River Hall of Fame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Remmel married the former Catherine Couch (April 22, 1918 &amp;ndash; January 24, 2006), the daughter of [[Harvey C. Couch]] of [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], the founder of Arkansas Power &amp; Light (a subsidiary of [[Entergy]]) and the director the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]]. [[Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine|Lake Catherine]] near [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] in [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]] is named for Catherine Couch Remmel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Remmel spent decades trying to build the Arkansas Republican Party. In 1940, he became chairman of the [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]] (Little Rock) Republican Executive Committee. Thereafter, at various times he was treasurer of the Republican State Central Committee, finance director of the Arkansas Republican Party (1949–1951), chairman of the Young Republicans of Arkansas and vice chairman of the Young Republican National Federation. Remmel attended the national Republican conventions as a delegate in [[1952 Republican National Convention|1952]] and [[1956 Republican National Convention|1956]] and as an alternate in 1948 and 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Butler Allard, ed. ''Who Is Who in Arkansas, Vol. I (Little Rock, 1959), pp. 199-200; ''Who's Who in the South and Southwest'' (chicago, 1952), p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election as mayor, 1951==
In the 1951 mayoral race, Remmel unseated the Democrat Sam M. Wassell, who sought a rarely given third term. Not since Ben D. Brickhouse (1919–1925) had anyone served longer than four years as mayor of Little Rock.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Ferguson, ''Arkansas Lives: The Opportunity Land's Who's Who'' (Hopkinsville, Kentucky, 1965), p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; Wassell ignored Remmel, for he viewed the Republican nominee as too weak to warrant the reactivation of the [[precinct]] organization from the summer Democratic primary. Wassell claimed incorrectly that a Republican could not be elected in Little Rock because the party during Reconstruction had "left such an awful stink they haven't been back in seventy years."&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', October 16, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Remmel termed the Wassell administration "ineffectual, half-hearted, do-nothing government".&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', November 1, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the race when Wassell detected that Remmel was making rapid gains, the mayor listed his own accomplishments as (1) a newly constructed airport, (2) the establishment of a municipal budget system, (3) modern garbage disposal, (4) a revised building code, and (5) improvements in city-owned properties.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', November 4, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Arkansas Gazette'' (since the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'', a [[WEHCO Media, Inc.]], publication) remained neutral in the mayoral campaign but instead urged the establishment of a [[nonpartisan]] city commission-manager form of government. "We don't know what the Democratic Party or the Republican Party has to do with municipal taxation and revenue, streets, sewers, drainage, health and sanitation, parks and recreation," the [[newspaper]] declared.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', October 30, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Little Rock established a nonpartisan city manager government starting in January 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Democrat'', November 7, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Remmel's election victory as a Republican cannot be duplicated in Little Rock.

Remmel not only defeated Wassel: he won by a landslide, 7,794 votes (68 percent) to 3,668 (32 percent). He won all but three of the city's then twenty-six precincts. He was the first Republican to have sought the position in a quarter century. Then Democratic Governor [[Sid McMath]] attributed Remmel's victory to local factors, particularly a divisive Democratic primary between Massell and [[Alderman]] Franklin E. Loy (February 10, 1915 - February 6, 1999), also an insurance agent.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', November 7, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The Little Rock election caught the eye of Republican [[U.S. Senator]] [[Robert A. Taft]] of [[Ohio]] who told an audience in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Mississippi]], that he hoped Remmel's victory would be "indicative of a new trend in the South."&lt;ref&gt;Memphis, Tennessee, ''Press Scmitar (defunct), November 8, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1952 Republican convention in [[Chicago]], Remmel first favored a largely ceremonial choice, [[General officer|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], a fellow Little Rock native whom he had hosted when the general visited the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Democrat'', October 24, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;  Delegates Remmel, his mother "Nell" Remmel, National Committeeman [[Wallace Townsend]]  and state GOP chairman [[Osro Cobb]] all voted at the convention for Taft. The Arkansas delegation split 6-4 for Taft, and an eleventh delegate abstained.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', October 17, 1951; Robert A. Diamond, ed., ''Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections (Washington, 1975), p. 93, 166; interview with Remmel, September 7, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; When the nomination went to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a [[Texas]] native who grew up in [[Kansas]], Remmel worked for the national ticket, but the [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai E. Stevenson]] and [[John Sparkman|John J. Sparkman]] electors still won in Arkansas, a traditional Democratic political bastion at that time.

==Reelection, 1953==
Remmel announced that his second campaign would not accent the party issue, and the GOP declined even to offer an aldermanic slate. Remmel claimed that his record had been "fair to all and partial to none." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Arkansas Democrat'', November 1, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; He spent some $15,000 in his second race and, in a technological innovation, linked six Little Rock [[radio]] stations to carry a simultaneous rally.

In his bid for a second term, Mayor Remmel faced the Democrat Aubrey Robert Kerr (1912-2001). The race assumed broader ramifications in that Remmel was expected to run for the [[United States Senate]] in 1954, if former Governor McMath who was defeated for renomination in the 1952 primary by [[Francis A. Cherry]] should unseat Democratic Senator [[John L. McClellan]] of [[Camden, Arkansas|Camden]] in the senatorial primary. Or, Remmel was seen as a possible Republican of Congress from Little Rock.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Democrats denounced Remmel as the "silk-stocking candidate" and the "tool of the Republican Party." Such rhetoric came from Alderman Franklin Loy and Arkansas [[Attorney General]] Thomas J. Gentry, who had become hostile critics of the Remmel administration.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', October 15, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remmel defeated Kerr, 9,724 (59.2 percent) to 6,693 (40.8 percent). While Remmel claimed that his reelection had partisan implications because Kerr had emphasized party, state Republican Chairman Cobb said that the results merely reflected that Little Rock "places good government ahead of party labels."&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Democrat'', November 4, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerr's campaign manager, Frank H. Dodge, said, quite prematurely it turned out, that  Remmel's reelection meant that "the two-party system is now at work in Little Rock."&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', November 4, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remmel the Christian==
A devout [[Christian]], Remmel was a member of the board of stewards of the First United [[Methodist Church]] in Little Rock and the Methodist Men's Club. He was a former state president of the [[Gideons International]], the men's organization which distributes [[Bible]]s in public places, such as [[hotel]] and [[motel]] rooms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marvon Johansen Browning, "Pratt Remmel dies; GOP mayor of LR ran against Faubus", ''Arkansas Democrat'', May 16, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his mayoral reelection, Remmel said that one of his objectives would be to "help Little Rock grow more righteous."&lt;ref&gt;''Malvern (Arkansas) Daily Record'', November 20, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed a high school graduating class in [[Corning, Arkansas|Corning]] in 1953 and urged the young people to accept the "fundamental belief in God as the key to success."&lt;ref&gt;Corning, Arkansas ''Clay County Courier'', May 13, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[Mena, Arkansas|Mena]] civic club, Remmel warned that the [[United States]] was "moving farther away from the Constitution and is giving up freedoms which were bought by the blood of the founders of the country."&lt;ref&gt;''Mena (Arkansas) Evening Star'', March 28, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second inaugural address, Remmel quoted from [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and stressed that "in this era of our world's [[history]], we need to turn to God."&lt;ref&gt;Remmel's Second Inaugural Address as Little Rock mayor, Pratt Remmel Collection, University of Arkansas at Little Rock Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1954 gubernatorial race, Remmel conceded that "some folks have said that Remmel is too religious, but that's exactly why Remmel has a chance at all."&lt;ref&gt;Remmel speech at West Memphis, Arkansas, October 26, 1954, Pratt Remmel Collection&lt;/ref&gt; While campaigning for governor, Remmel sought the prayers of ministers he met, carried his Bible in his hip pocket, and read five chapters daily.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', October 10, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

==1954 gubernatorial results==
Faubus defeated Remmel, 208,121 (51.1 percent) to 172,004 (47.9 percent). The turnout was forty thousand fewer than in the Democratic runoff. Faubus polled just 16,793 more votes against Remmel than he had against Cherry. Theoretically, large numbers of Cherry supporters either stayed home in the general election or voted for Remmel. The Republican  won six counties: [[Arkansas County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski]], [[Sebastian County, Arkansas|Sebastian]], [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland]], [[Searcy County, Arkansas|Searcy]], and [[Newton County, Arkansas|Newton]]. He received at least 40 percent in five other counties, including Jefferson, [[Union County, Arkansas|Union]], and [[Washington County, Arkansas|Washington]]. He carried the cities of [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[El Dorado, Arkansas|El Dorado]], and [[Brinkley, Arkansas|Brinkley]] though he lost the respective counties.&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas Secretary of State, ''Election Statistics, 1954''&lt;/ref&gt;

Faubus recalled Remmel as "a most gracious loser. The day following the election, he and his brother, Roland (Roland R. Remmel, September 26, 1917 - July 2, 2006), came ... to congratulate me on my victory and to wish me well. Their attitude made a strong, favorable impression on me which I never forgot."&lt;ref&gt;Faubus, ''Down From the Hills'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Democrats supporting Remmel was governor was [[Odell Pollard]], an attorney from [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]], who switched parties himself in 1958 and later served as the GOP state chairman from 1966 to 1970.

==Defeat in 1955==
Woodrow Mann (November 13, 1916 &amp;ndash; August 6, 2002) won the Democratic mayoral nomination over the opposition of persistent Alderman Franklin Loy, who had campaigned more against Remmel than he did against Mann by asking voters why they would even consider giving Little Rock "a black eye" by reelecting Remmel.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', October 11, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Mann claimed that Remmel lacked interest in the office, had refused to allow the city attorney to oppose utility rate increases, had ignored the need for parks and playgrounds, and had failed to secure a third bridge across the [[Arkansas River]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', November 6, 8, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Remmel did not commit himself to seeking a third term until a month before the election.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', November 1, 8, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, Remmel said that he should have been contented with the customary two terms and not reached beyond his grasp, but he wanted voters to have a second choice in regard to Mann, whom he considered to have an unsavory reputation in the insurance business. Remmel spent $18,000 in his losing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Remmel, September 7, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-term bid brought out the united Democratic hierarchy, including Governor Faubus, Senator [[James William Fulbright]], and U.S. Representatives Brooks Hays, and [[Wilbur Mills|Wilbur Daigh Mills]]. All urged the rejection of a two-party system. Faubus later expressed regret over his support of Mayor Mann, whom he called the "mouthpiece" of anti-Faubus forces in the 1957 Little Rock [[desegregation]] crisis.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', October 15, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann upset Remmel by 1,128 votes in a moderately close outcome. Mann polled exactly 10,000 votes (53 percent) to Remmel's 8,872 (47 percent). After his tenure as mayor, Mann relocated to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], where he was engaged in the life insurance business. His primary rival, Franklin Loy, also in the life insurance business, later moved to [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', November 9, 1955; interview with Remmel, November 30, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his mayoral tenure, Remmel was a former member of the advisory committee to the [[United States Conference of Mayors]] and a former chairman of the Arkansas Municipal League. He was once a member of the United States National Commission for the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Remmel's obituary==
In addition to his Republican and religious affiliations, Remmel was a 32nd degree [[Masonic lodge|Mason]], a [[Shriner]], and a member of the [[American Legion]], Amvets, the [[Sertoma Club]], [[Optimist Club]], and the United Fund. He was a former Arkansas president of the American [[Red Cross]]. He was affiliated with [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and the Little Rock Country Club.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Remmel was a board member of the Arkansas River Basin Commission and chairman of the Arkansas Waterways Commission.&lt;ref name="Arkansas River Hall of Fame"/&gt;

Remmel died in Little Rock. Services were held in his First United Methodist Church. In addition to his wife and brother Roland, Remmel was survived by a son, Pratt Remmel, Jr. (born ca. 1948); two daughters, Catherine R. "Cathie" Matthews (born ca. 1942) and Rebecca Couch Remmel (born ca. 1950); another brother, Augustus C. Remmel, Jr. (June 14, 1914 - February 27, 2000); two sisters, Mrs. Richard C. Butler and Mrs. H. Tyndall Dickinson, and three granddaughters, all of Little Rock.&lt;ref&gt;Marvon Johansen Browning, "Pratt Remmel dies; GOP mayor of LR ran against Faubus", ''Arkansas Democrat'', May 16, 1991;http://ssdi.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt Remmel Park off Interstate 440 and Pratt Remmel Road are named in Remmel's honor. In addition, Pratt Remmel, Jr., the director of the Arkansas Ecology Center, is the founder of Dunbar Garden, an urban park and green space in Little Rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heifer.org/site/c.edJRKQNiFiG/b.201618/ Garden Stories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2999">{{for|the role of registered agent in the US|Registered Agent}}

A '''process agent''' is a [[agent (law)|representative]] upon whom [[court]] papers may be served. In the US, the role is generally a requirement of US State law and is known as a [[registered agent]], a resident agent or statutory agent. However, process agents are utilized in the US by [[truck drivers]], [[brokers]] or [[freight forwarders]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/process-agents&lt;/ref&gt; for similar purposes. Process agents that provide nationwide coverage for motor carriers are commonly referred to as blanket companies&lt;ref&gt;http://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov/LIVIEW/pkg_html.prc_limain&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In the UK, a process agent is a contractual relationship, permitted by the Civil Procedure Rules.

==England and Wales==

Under English Civil Procedure Rules,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil Civil Procedure Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to serve papers to start proceedings correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Procedure Rules, Part 6&lt;/ref&gt;  If a party does not have an address within the United Kingdom, the procedure for serving these papers can be lengthy and complicated, with proof of service particularly difficult in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Procedure Rules, Practice Direction 6A&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is therefore customary to appoint a process agent and contractually agree that service at the address of the agent will constitute proper service for the purposes of Rule 6.1.1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. In order to meet the requirements of Rule 6.1.1 an appropriate contractual clause needs to be inserted into the agreement specifying the details of the appointment.

It is also possible to appoint a Process Agent for the purposes of arbitration proceedings in a similar manner.

The role of a process agent&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawdebenture.com/our-services/united-kingdom/process-agent/what-is-the-role-of-a-process-agent/ What Is The Role of a Process Agent?]&lt;/ref&gt; is a vitally important service for many businesses dealing with suppliers, banks or tenders in the UK. Process agents accept service of notices, proceedings or documents on behalf of their overseas clients in situations where it is not possible for them to be served abroad. A process agent can act in a broad capacity for a company including but not limited to; acting as a process agent for court actions, receiving documents in connection with arbitration proceedings and receiving notices under contracts where an independent party is needed. 

A typical example of a process agency arrangement is where an overseas entity raises a loan from a city institution. Often the lending bank will require the appointment of a UK-based process agent&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawdebenture.com/our-services/united-kingdom/process-agent/ UK-based Process Agent]&lt;/ref&gt; to receive formal notices should the borrower default on the loan.

The '''Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] passed in February 2002, making [[Scotland]] the first part of the [[United Kingdom]] to ban traditional [[fox hunting]] and [[hare coursing]].

==Passage of the Act==
The bill was introduced into the Scottish Parliament in 1999 by [[Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Mike Watson]] MSP with support from SNP MSP [[Tricia Marwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1816168.stm |title=Timeline: Scotland's fox hunting bill |work=BBC News |date=13 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2001, the Scottish Parliament rejected a negative committee report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.parliament.scot/business/committees/historic/x-rural/reports-01/rar01-10-vol01-02.htm |title=Rural Development Committee. 10th Report 2001. Stage 1 Report on the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill. Volume 1 : Report |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |date=2000 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the Bill from its Rural Development Committee and voted to support the general principles of the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-01/sor0919-02.htm#Col2613]&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 2002 the Parliament voted by eighty three to thirty six to pass the legislation to ban hunting with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1819189.stm |title=Fox-hunting ban passed |work=BBC News |date=13 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-02/sor0213-02.htm#Col6513]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]s decided not to give compensation to those whose livelihoods or businesses might suffer as a result of the ban. The Scottish Countryside Alliance attempted to block introduction of the legislation by taking their case to the [[Court of Session]] in Edinburgh, although their appeal was not successful and in July the Judge recognised the will of the Parliament on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2162766.stm |title=Court backs hunting ban |work=BBC News |date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act came into effect on 1 August 2002.

==Impact of the ban==
An article in [[The Guardian]] on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the permitted exemption allowing them to use packs of hounds to flush foxes to guns (an exemption which is strongly opposed by people against hunting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/09/scotland.hunting |title=Legal rule helps hounds survive |first=Gerard |last=Seenan |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 September 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of convictions have taken place under the Act, two for people hunting foxes and ten for hare coursing. The only prosecution of a traditional fox hunt led to a not guilty verdict, but to a clarification of the law, with the sheriff saying that the activity of flushing foxes to guns "will require to be accompanied by realistic and one would expect, effective arrangements for the shooting of pest species. The use of what might be termed "token guns" or what was described by the Crown as paying lip service to the legislation is not available ... as a justification for the continuation of what was referred to in the evidence before me as traditional fox hunting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=6af686a6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7 |title=Judgement of Sheriff T A K Drummond, Q.C. in the cause Procurator Fiscal, Jedburgh Against Trevor Adams. Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 |publisher=Scottish Courts and Tribunals |date=10 December 2004 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is controversy over the impact on the number of foxes killed by hunts. Hunts say that the number killed by hunts has doubled because shooting is more effective than chasing with dogs.

Since the ban 2 new fox hunts have started in Scotland, the Strathappin and the Dumfriesshire and Stewartry.

==2016 review==
In December 2015, the Scottish Government announced that a review would be held that would look at legislation dealing with hunting with dogs, with the review to be led by [[Iain Bonomy, Lord Bonomy|Lord Bonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35182347 |title=Lord Bonomy to lead review of Scottish fox hunting legislation |work=BBC News |date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 a report was published with various recommendations, including making amendments to the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/21/scottish-foxhunting-review-legislation |title=Scottish foxhunting review calls for stronger legislation |first=Libby |last=Brooks |work=The Guardian |date=21 November 2016 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[political philosophy]], the '''right of revolution''' (or '''right of rebellion''') is the [[right]] or [[duty]] of the people of a nation to [[Revolution|overthrow]] a government that acts against their common interests and/or threatens the safety of the people without cause. Stated throughout history in one form or another, the belief in this right has been used to justify various revolutions, including the  [[French Revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution]], and the [[Iranian Revolution]].

==History==

===Early precedent===
To justify their overthrowing of the earlier [[Shang Dynasty]], the kings of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122 – 256 BC) of [[China]] promulgated the concept known as the [[Mandate of Heaven]], that [[Tian|Heaven]] would bless the authority of a just ruler, but would be displeased and withdraw its mandate from a despotic ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Elizabeth. [2002] (2002). Challenging the Mandate of Heaven: Social Protest and State Power in China.  Sharpe.  {{ISBN|0-7656-0444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandate of Heaven would then transfer to those who would rule best. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on. Throughout Chinese history, rebels who opposed the ruling dynasty made the claim that the Mandate of Heaven had passed, giving them the right to revolt. Ruling dynasties were often uncomfortable with this, and the writings of the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]] (372 – 289 BC) were often suppressed for declaring that the people have the right to overthrow a ruler that did not provide for their needs.

====Europe====
{{main|Resistance theory in the Early Modern period}}
[[File:Magna_Carta_(British_Library_Cotton_MS_Augustus_II.106).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Magna Carta]] marks one of the earliest attempts to limit a sovereign's authority and it is seen as a symbol of the rule of law.]]
In Europe, one example of the emergence of a right of revolution can be traced back to [[Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker]], who in 1018 had a dramatic confrontation with the King of Sweden. The lawspeaker claimed the King of Sweden was accountable to the people and would be overthrown by them if he continued with his unpopular war with Norway. Another example is [[Magna Carta]], an English charter issued in 1215, that required the King to renounce certain rights and accept that his will could be bound by the law. It included a "security clause" that gave the right to a committee of barons to overrule the will of the King through force if needed. Magna Carta directly influenced the development of parliamentary democracy and many constitutional documents, such as the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph V. Turner. ''Magna Carta''.  Pearson Education. (2003). {{ISBN|0-582-43826-8}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Golden Bull of 1222]] was a [[golden bull]], or [[edict]], issued by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]. The law established the rights of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary's]] noblemen, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (''jus resistendi''). The Golden Bull is often compared to the Magna Carta; the Bull was the first constitutional document of the nation of Hungary, while the Magna Carta was the first constitutional charter of the nation of England.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] also wrote of the right to resist tyrannical rule in the [[Summa Theologica]]. [[John of Salisbury]] advocated direct revolutionary assassination of unethical tyrannical rulers in his ''Policraticus''. This theological notion was expanded in the [[Early Modern Period]]. The [[Jesuits]], especially [[Robert Bellarmine]] and [[Juan de Mariana]], were widely known and often feared for advocating resistance to tyranny and often tyrannicide&amp;mdash;one of the implications of the [[natural law]] focus of the [[School of Salamanca]].

[[John Calvin]] believed something similar. In a commentary on the [[Book of Daniel]], he observed that contemporary monarchs pretend to reign “by the grace of God,” but the pretense was “a mere cheat” so that they could “reign without control.” He believed that “Earthly princes depose themselves while they rise up against God,” so “it behooves us to spit upon their heads than to obey them.” When ordinary citizens are confronted with tyranny, he wrote, ordinary citizens have to suffer it. But magistrates have the duty to “curb the tyranny of kings,” as had the Tribunes in ancient [[Rome]], the Ephori in [[Sparta]], and the Demarchs in ancient [[Athens]]. That Calvin could support a right of resistance in theory did not mean that he thought such resistance prudent in all circumstances. At least publicly, he disagreed with the Scottish Calvinist [[John Knox]]’s call for revolution against the Catholic Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davekopel.com/religion/calvinism.htm Dave Kopel: The Calvinist Connection, Liberty magazine, October 2008, pp. 27-31]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church shared Calvin's prudential concerns -  the Pope condemned [[Guy Fawkes]]' [[Gunpowder Plot]], and ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'' was widely considered to be a mistake. Instead, the safest course of action for the people was to endure tyranny for as long as it could be borne, rather than run the larger risks of armed revolution.

The right of revolution was expounded by the [[Monarchomachs]] in the context of the [[French Wars of Religion]], and by [[Huguenot]]s thinkers who legitimized [[tyrannicide]]s.

===Modern development===
[[File:LockeTreatiseAmerica.png|200px|thumb|right|''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', written by [[John Locke]], developed the idea of 'right of revolution'. This notion was used as a basis for the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.]]
The concept of the right of revolution was developed at the beginning of the [[Enlightenment era]] in the work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Written by the philosopher [[John Locke]], the right to revolution formed an integral part of his [[social contract|social contract theory]], in which he tried to define the origins and basis for social conditions and relationships. Locke declared that under [[natural law]], all [[people]] have the right to [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[estate (law)|estate]]; under the social contract, the people could instigate a [[revolution]] against the government when it acted against the interests of [[citizenship|citizens]], to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens. In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation. The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against [[tyrant|tyranny]].

Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'': “''whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People'', or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the ''Legislative'' shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, ''endeavor to grasp'' themselves, ''or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power'' over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust ''they forfeit the Power'', the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property#axzz2qx7Z9g7e Powell, Jim (01. August 1996): John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property. In: The Freemann. Publisher: The Foundation for Economic Education, Irvington, New York, USA.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in history====
Revolutionary movements subsequent to this, all drew on Locke's theory as a justification for the exercise of the right of revolution.

During the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Parliament of England]] effectively deposed [[James II of England]] and replaced him with [[William III of England|William III of Orange-Nassau]], due to the former's unacceptable leanings towards [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and [[Catholicism]]. Although Locke's treatise was published the year after, his ideas were already widely current in the English political system at the time.

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 has come to symbolize the [[French Revolution]], when a people rose up to exercise their right of revolution.]]
Although Locke claimed that his book's purpose was to justify [[William III of England|William III]]'s ascension to the throne, it has been argued that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 during the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion Crisis]], which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, Peter. "Introduction." ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the work is better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the [[Rye House Plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, ''Revolutionary Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to revolution played a large part in the writings of the [[American Revolution|American revolutionaries]] in the run up to the [[American Revolution]]. The political tract ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' used the concept as an argument for rejection of the British Monarchy and separation from the [[British Empire]], as opposed to merely self-government within it. It was also cited in the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] of the [[United States]], when a group of representatives from the various states signed a declaration of independence citing charges against King [[George III]]. As the American [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 expressed it, natural law taught that the people were “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” and could alter or abolish government “destructive” of those rights.

The right of revolution was also included in the 1793 preface to the [[French Constitution of 1793]] during the [[French Revolution]]. This preface from 24 June 1793 contained a declaration of the rights of man and citizen including right to rebellion in §35: "When the government violates the rights of the people, insurrection is for the people, and for every portion thereof, the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readings from the French Revolution - Chapter 13: Preface to the Constitution of 1793|work=Columbia University|publisher=Columbia University|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/frerev.htm|accessdate=11 December 2013|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the right==

===Individual or collective right===
Although some explanations of the right of revolution leave open the possibility of its exercise as an individual right, it was clearly understood to be a collective right under English constitutional and political theory.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America’s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2008), 14 (noting that under English constitutional law the right of revolution “belonged to the community as a whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract”). ''See also'' John Phillip Reid, ''Constitutional History of the American Revolution'' (4 vols., [[University of Wisconsin Press]], 1986-1993), I:111 (identifying the collective right of the people “to preserve their rights by force and even rebellion against constituted authority”), III:427n31 (quoting Viscount Bolingbroke that the “collective Body of the People” had the right to “break the Bargain between the King and the Nation”).&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Pauline Maier]] has noted in her study ''From Resistance to Revolution'', “private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers either for malice or because of private injuries....”&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain'', 1765-1776 (Alfred A. Knopf, 1972), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, “not just a few individuals, but the ‘Body of the People’ had to feel concerned” before the right of revolution was justified and with most writers speaking of a “ ‘whole people who are the Public,’ or the body of the people acting in their ‘public Authority,’ indicating a broad consensus involving all ranks of society.”&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution'', 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right versus duty===
Some philosophers argue that it is not only the right of a people to overthrow an oppressive government but also their ''duty'' to do so. Howard Evans Kiefer opines, "It seems to me that the ''duty'' to rebel is much more understandable than that ''right'' to rebel, because the right to rebellion ruins the order of power, whereas the duty to rebel goes beyond and breaks it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R8bi1m9NvIC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=%22duty+to+rebel%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=xdUGaHk_fz&amp;sig=KbTANyl6oRDdLrb736Hq1iK017s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA327,M1|title=Ethics and Social Justice|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morton White]] writes of the American revolutionaries, "The notion that they had a ''duty'' to rebel is extremely important to stress, for it shows that they thought they were complying with the ''commands'' of natural law and of nature's God when they threw off absolute despotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0thewbdTMsC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=%22duty+to+rebel%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=AmncN84fAl&amp;sig=f9RHPgKdL2XXRekmS6OXc2-gcgg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result|title=Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] states that "when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their ''duty'', to throw off such Government" (emphasis added). The phrase "long train of abuses" is a reference to John Locke's similar statement in Second Treatise of Government, where he explicitly established overthrow of a tyrant as an obligation. [[Martin Luther King]] likewise held that it is the duty of the people to resist unjust laws.

==Preconditions==
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence in [[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' depicts another idealization of the exercise of the right of revolution.]]

Some theories of the right of revolution imposed significant preconditions on its exercise, limiting its invocation to the most dire circumstances. In the American Revolutionary context, one finds expressions of the right of revolution both as subject to precondition and as unrestrained by conditions.

On the eve of the American Revolution, for example, Americans considered their plight to justify exercise of the right of revolution.  [[Alexander Hamilton]] justified American resistance as an expression of “the law of nature” redressing violations of “the first principles of civil society” and invasions of “the rights of a whole people.”&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, ''The Farmer Refuted'', [Feb. 23], 1775, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'', I:136&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Thomas Jefferson]] the Declaration was the last-ditch effort of an oppressed people—the position in which many Americans saw themselves in 1776. Jefferson’s litany of colonial grievances was an effort to establish that Americans met their burden to exercise the natural law right of revolution.

Certain scholars, such as legal historian [[Christian Fritz]], have written that with the end of the Revolution, Americans did not renounce the right of revolution.  In fact they codified it in their new constitutions&lt;ref&gt;See Christian G. Fritz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PA168&amp;amp;lpg=RA1-PA168&amp;amp;dq=christian+g+fritz+%22american+sovereigns%22&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=UjY_WKHNjv&amp;amp;sig=Y2_7OZMg6ksk_866oiD44FArH-w&amp;amp;hl=en#PRA1-PA1,M1 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War']' (In Chapter 2, entitled "Revolutionary Constitutionalism," Professor Fritz notes that after the Revolution, "[i]ncreasingly, as Americans included it in their constitutions, the right of revolution came to be seen as a constitutional principle permitting the people as the sovereign to control government and revise their constitutions without limit.")(Cambridge University Press, 2008) at p. 25 [{{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even today 35 constitutions of American states have the same or similar provisions on the right of revolution as in the preamble of the [[American Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Marsavelski, A. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2329401 ''The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law']', Connecticut Journal of International Law, Vol. 28, at p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, constitutions considered to be "conservative," such as those of post-revolutionary [[Massachusetts]] in 1780, preserved the people's right "to reform, alter, or totally change" government not only for their protection or safety but also whenever their "prosperity and happiness reduire[d] it."&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts 1780 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Art. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This expression was not unusual in the early American constitutions.  [[Connecticut]]'s 1818 constitution articulated the people's right "at all times" to alter government "in such a manner as they may think expedient."&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut 1818 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritz, in ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'', describes a duality in American views on preconditions to the right of revolution: "Some of the first state constitutions included 'alter or abolish' provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution" in that they required dire preconditions to its exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America’s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2008), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryland]]'s 1776 constitution and [[New Hampshire]]'s 1784 constitutions required the perversion of the ends of government and the endangering of public liberty and that all other means of redress were to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;See Maryland 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 4; New Hampshire 1784 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Art. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; But in contrast, other states dispensed with the onerous preconditions on the exercise of the right.  In the 1776 [[Virginia]] constitution the right would arise simply if government was "inadequate" and [[Pennsylvania]]'s 1776 constitution required only that the people considered a change to be "most conducive" to the public welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 3; Pennsylvania 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural law or positive law==
Descriptions of the Right of Revolution also differ in whether that right is considered to be a [[natural law]] (a law whose content is set by nature and that therefore has validity everywhere) or [[positive law]] (law enacted or adopted by proper authority for governing of the state).

An example of the dual nature of the right of revolution as both a natural law and as positive law is found in the American revolutionary context. Although the [[American Declaration of Independence]] invoked the natural law right of revolution, natural law was not the sole justification for American independence. English constitutional doctrine also supported the colonists’ actions, at least up to a point. By the 1760s, English law recognized what [[William Blackstone]]’s ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' called “the law of redress against public oppression.”&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' (4 vols., Oxford, 1765-1769, Facsimile ed., repr., 1979), I:238.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the natural law’s right of revolution, this constitutional law of redress justified the people resisting the sovereign. This law of redress arose from a contract between the people and the king to preserve the public welfare. This original contract was “a central dogma in English and British constitutional law” since “time immemorial.”&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, “The Irrelevance of the Declaration,” in Hendrik Hartog, ed., ''Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law'' (1981), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration’s long list of grievances declared that this bargain had been breached.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey 1776 Constitution, Preamble in Francis Newton Thorpe, ed., T''he Federal and State Constitutions Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws of the ... United States of America'', V:2594 (noting that the King breached his contract with the people).&lt;/ref&gt;

This well-accepted law of redress justified a people resisting unconstitutional acts of government. Liberty depended upon the people’s “ultimate” right to resist. Unconstitutional commands breaching the “voluntary compact between the rulers and the ruled” could be “ignored” and arbitrary commands opposed with force.&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''Constitutional History of the American Revolution'' (4 vols., 1986-1993), III:140.&lt;/ref&gt; This right implied a duty on the part of the people to resist unconstitutional acts. As Alexander Hamilton noted in 1775, government exercised powers to protect “the absolute rights” of the people and government forfeited those powers and the people could reclaim them if government breached this constitutional contract.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, “The Farmer Refuted,” [Feb. 23], 1775, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'', I:88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of redress had limits like the right of revolution under natural law. The law of redress, like the right of revolution, was not an individual right. It belonged to the community as a whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract.&lt;ref&gt;See Reid, ''Constitutional History'', I:111 (identifying the collective right of the people “to preserve their rights by force and even rebellion against constituted authority”), III:427n31 (quoting Viscount Bolingbroke that the “collective Body of the People” had the right to “break the Bargain between the King and the Nation”); Pauline Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain'', 1765-1776, 33-34 (“Private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers either for malice or because of private injuries, even if no redress for their grievances were afforded by the regularly constituted government”).&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a means of first resort, or response to trivial or casual errors of government.&lt;ref&gt;Some commentators endorsed the right of resistance if Parliament “jeopardized the constitution,” but most identified the need for oppression and tyranny before its exercise. See Reid, ''Constitutional History'', III:121, 427n31; Maier, ''Resistance'', 33-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone’s ''Commentaries'' suggested that using the law of redress would be “extraordinary,” for example applying if the king broke the original contract, violated “the fundamental laws,” or abandoned the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries'', I:243 and 238.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Stamp Act crisis of the 1760s the Massachusetts Provincial Congress considered resistance to the king justified if freedom came under attack from “the hand of oppression” and “the merciless feet of tyranny.”&lt;ref&gt;Reid, ''Constitutional History'', I:112&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later the “indictment” of George III in the Declaration of Independence sought to end his sovereign reign over the colonies because he violated the original constitutional contract.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, “Irrelevance of the Declaration,” 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained in legal historian Christian Fritz’s description of the role of the right of revolution in American Revolution, American independence was justified by conventional theories under Anglo-American constitutional thought at the time about the people’s collective right to cast off an arbitrary king. “Both natural law and English constitutional doctrine gave the colonists a right to revolt against the sovereign’s oppression.”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, ''American Sovereigns'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt; But these understandings about the right of revolution on the eve of the American Revolution rested on a traditional model of government. That model posited the existence of a hypothetical bargain struck in the mists of antiquity between a king and a people. “In this bargain, the people were protected by the monarch in exchange for the people giving the king allegiance. This was a contractual relationship. American revolutionaries accused George III of breaching his implied duty of protection under that contract, thereby releasing the people in the colonies from their allegiance. The sovereign’s breach of the hypothetical contract gave rise to the subjects’ right of revolution”—grounded on both natural law and English constitutional doctrine.”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, ''American Sovereigns'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples as positive law===
Although many [[declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] seek legitimacy by appealing to the right of revolution, far fewer [[constitution]]s mention this right or guarantee this right to citizens because of the destabilizing effect such a guarantee would likely produce. Among the examples of an articulation of a right of revolution as positive law include:

*The [[szlachta]], nobles of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], also maintained a right of rebellion, known as [[rokosz]].
*[[New Hampshire]]'s [[Constitution of New Hampshire|constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/constitution/billofrights.html|title=NH.gov - The Official Web Site of New Hampshire State Government - State Constitution, Bill of Rights|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees its citizens the right to reform government, in Article 10 of the New Hampshire constitution's [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]]:
*:''Whenever the [[Purpose of government|ends of government]] are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.''
*The [[Kentucky]] [[Constitution of Kentucky|constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.ky.gov/research/history.htm Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703062053/http://courts.ky.gov/research/history.htm |date=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also guarantees a right to alter, reform or abolish their government in the Kentucky Bill of Rights:
*:''All power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their peace, safety, happiness and the protection of property. For the advancement of these ends, they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may deem proper.''
*Similar wording is used in [[Pennsylvania]]'s [[Constitution of Pennsylvania|constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Constitution.html Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; under Article 1, Section 2 of the Declaration of Rights:
*:''All power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their peace, safety and happiness. For the advancement of these ends they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think proper.''
*Article I, §1 of the [[Tennessee]] [[Constitution of Tennessee|constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://state.tn.us/sos/bluebook/05-06/46-tnconst.pdf Constitution of the State of Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt; states:
*:'' That all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness; for the advancement of those ends they have at all times, an unalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper''
*[[North Carolina]]'s [[Constitution of North Carolina|constitution]] of November 21, 1789 also contains in its Declaration of Rights:&lt;ref&gt;[http://friesian.com/nullif.htm#dread Randy Barnett, The Rights Retained by the People, The History and Meaning of the Ninth Amendment, George Mason University Press, 1989), p. 364]&lt;/ref&gt;
*:''3d. That Government ought to be instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people; and that the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavish, and destructive to the good and happiness of mankind.''
*The [[Constitution of Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlc.state.tx.us/pubslegref/TxConst.pdf The Texas Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; also contains similar wording in Article 1, Sect 2:
*:''All political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their benefit.

* The preface to the [[French Constitution of 1793]] is a "Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen" with several right of revolution provisions which stated in 
*: Article 11:  ''Any act directed against a person, apart from the cases and without the forms determined by law, is arbitrary and tyrannical; if attempt is made to execute such act by force, the person who is the object thereof has the right to resist it by force.''&lt;ref name="1793PrefaceConstitution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preface to the Constitution of 1793 (Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen) |url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/sites/core/files/text/Preface%20to%20the%20Constitution%20of%201793.pdf |work=National Assembly of France |publisher=college.columbia.edu |accessdate=5 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227022845/http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/sites/core/files/text/Preface%20to%20the%20Constitution%20of%201793.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*: Article 12: ''Those who incite, dispatch, sign, or execute arbitrary acts, or cause them to be executed, are guilty and must be punished.''&lt;ref name="1793PrefaceConstitution" /&gt; 
*: Article 27: ''Let any individual who would usurp sovereignty be put to death instantly by free men.''&lt;ref name="1793PrefaceConstitution" /&gt;
*: Article 33-35: ''Resistance to oppression is the consequence of the other rights of man. There is oppression against the social body when a single one of its members is oppressed. There is oppression against every member when the social body is oppressed. When the government violates the rights of the people, insurrection is for the people, and for every portion thereof, the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties.''&lt;ref name="1793PrefaceConstitution" /&gt;
*The 1949 [[Grundgesetz]], the Constitution of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], contains both entrenched, un-amendable clauses protecting human and [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]], as well as a clause in its Article 20 (since 1968) recognizing the right of the people to resist unconstitutional tyranny, if all other measures have failed:
*: ''All Germans shall have the right to resist any person seeking to abolish this constitutional order, if no other remedy is available.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf ''Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany''] (English translation; PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;
*All [[Greece|Greek]] constitutions since the [[Greek Revolution]] have contained a right to resist in their concluding article. The current [[Greek Constitution]] states in Article 120:
*: ''Observance of the constitution is entrusted to the patriotism of the Greeks who shall have the right and the duty to resist by all possible means against anyone who attempts the violent abolition of the Constitution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of May 27, 2008] on the website of Hellenic Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]], a part of the constitutional systems of both the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovak Republic]], states in Article 23:
*: ''Citizens have the right to resist anybody who would do away with the democratic order of human rights and fundamental freedoms, established by this Charter, if the actions of constitutional bodies or the effective use of legal means have been frustrated.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usoud.cz/en/charter-of-fundamental-rights-and-freedoms/ English translation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613083740/http://www.usoud.cz/en/charter-of-fundamental-rights-and-freedoms |date=2013-06-13 }} on the website of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt;
*This right is inferred in the third paragraph of the preamble to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which states:
*: ''Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that [[human rights]] should be protected by [[rule of law]].''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], United Nations website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern relevance==
Some have argued that because in modern times [[Democracy|democratic governments]] can be overthrown by [[election|popular vote]], the right of the people to remove the government has become embedded into the [[political system]]. In a study of the idea of rule by the people in the American Revolution and in early post-revolutionary America, legal historian [[Christian G. Fritz]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The constitutional logic of recognizing the people, not a king, as the sovereign implied the irrelevance of a right of revolution in America. This did not develop instantly or uniformly after the establishment of American governments. Some of the first state constitutions included ‘alter or abolish’ provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution....  Other state constitutions adopted different versions of this right to ‘alter or abolish’ government that did not sound like the traditional right of revolution. In these provisions, the ability of the people to revise constitutions existed regardless of the traditional preconditions for the right of revolution....  Increasingly, as Americans included it in their constitutions, the right of revolution came to be seen as a constitutional principle permitting the people as the sovereign to control government and revise their constitutions without limit. In this way, the right broke loose from its traditional moorings of resistance to oppression. The alter or abolish provisions could now be interpreted consistent with the constitutional principle that in America, the sovereign was the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, American Sovereigns, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the [[Arab Spring]] is clear evidence that revolutions are still happening, which raises the importance of the right of revolution in 21st century. As [[terrorism]] is gaining recognition as a crime under [[international law]], the right of revolution is seen as an instrument to distinguish terrorists from [[freedom fighter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Aleksandar Marsavelski, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2329401 ''The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law']' (In Chapter II.A.4., entitled "Criteria for the Use of Revolutionary Force" Marsavelski notes that there are certain limits to the right of revolution, guided by four principles: (1) principle of democracy, (2) principle of proportionality, (3) principle of just cause, and (4) principle of distinction), (Connecticut Journal of International law, Vol. 28) at pp. 278-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SANZAAR''' (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is the body which operates [[Super Rugby]] and [[The Rugby Championship]] competitions in [[Rugby Union]]. SANZAAR meets annually and is composed of the CEOs from its member unions.

It was formed as SANZAR in 1996 as a joint venture of the [[South African Rugby Union]], the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] and the [[Australian Rugby Union]]. From the 2016 season, its name was changed to SANZAAR following the inclusion of the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] as a full member of the organisation.&lt;ref name="SANZAR changes name to SANZAAR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/sanzar-changes-name-to-sanzaar-20160202 | title=SANZAR changes name to SANZAAR | work=Sport24 | date=2 February 2016 | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Tri-Nations and Super 12: 1996 ===
[[File:SANZAR logo old.svg|150px|thumb|left|{{nowrap|SANZAR logo up to 2015.}}]]

SANZAR was formed in 1995, shortly after rugby's move to professionalism, to counter the threat of Australia's [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], a new [[rugby league]] competition that offered large salaries to players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howitt|first=Bob |year=2005| title=SANZAR Saga: Ten Years of Super 12 and Tri-Nations Rugby| publisher=Harper Collins Publishers |ISBN=1-86950-566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SANZAR proposed the [[Super Rugby|Super 12]], an annual provincial competition with teams from all three countries, and the [[The Rugby Championship|Tri Nations Series]], an annual competition between each country's Test teams. This concept was developed by [[Queensland Rugby Union]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Terry Doyle, [[New South Wales Rugby Union]] CEO [[David Moffett]] and [[Australian Rugby Union]] CEO Bruce Hayman.&lt;ref name = smh-2002/&gt; [[Rian Oberholzer]] was the first CEO of SANZAR.

SANZAR's proposals were under serious threat from the World Rugby Corporation (WRC), a company formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby competition funded by [[Kerry Packer]], who had already developed professional cricket. At one point the WRC had a majority of the All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to their competition. However, the South African Rugby Union told the Springboks players that they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC, and they remained with the SARU. Most of the All Blacks then followed them, and finally the Wallabies did too.

To fund the competitions, SANZAR looked to [[News Limited]], who was the Super League's broadcaster, eventually being offered $555 million over 10 years for worldwide television rights.

=== Expansion to Super 14 ===

In 2002, a proposal to expand the Super 12 to fourteen teams, supported by Australia and South Africa, was vetoed by the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]].&lt;ref name = espn-19-02-2002/&gt; This led to calls for the Australian and South African teams to withdraw from the competition,&lt;ref name = espn-19-02-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name = espn-21-02-2002/&gt; but the partnership continued and the issue was revisited before the end of the original 10-year broadcasting deal.

For the 2006 season, SANZAR agreed to expand the Super 12 competition with two new teams and to increase the number of Test matches played in the Tri-Nations.&lt;ref name = espn-6-9-2004/&gt; Licences were granted for franchises based in Bloemfontein and Perth,&lt;ref name= cheetahs/&gt;&lt;ref name = espn-10-12-2004/&gt; creating the [[Cheetahs (rugby union)|Cheetahs]] and [[Western Force]] teams for the expanded Super 14 competition.

The SANZAR partnership was tested in 2007 after New Zealand removed its top 22 players from the Super 14 competition,&lt;ref name = smh-2007/&gt; and South Africa's removal of players from the Tri-Nations prompted calls for the [[Australian Rugby Union]] to cancel future matches against the Springboks.&lt;ref name = aus-2007/&gt;

==== Potential South African departure ====
In 2009 there emerged concerns that [[South African Rugby Union]] might opt to break away from the alliance over a dispute about the proposed plan to expand [[Super Rugby]] to fifteen teams in 2011, voicing its support for the concept generally but disagreeing over its length and format.  On 6 May 2009, however, ARU Chief Executive [[John O'Neill (sport administrator)|John O'Neill]] warned that the South Africans would be the real losers, missing out altogether and potentially losing players if they went ahead with the split. "The joint venture must remain intact", he urged. "I have dealt with the South Africans for years in [[business]] and [[sport]].  Part of their [[DNA]] is to take it to the brink.  There's a moment when they will realise they have taken it far enough."&lt;ref name= reuters-2009/&gt; On 20 May 2009, SANZAR announced it had reached agreement on a new deal involving all three nations beginning in the 2011 season.&lt;ref name= deal-2009/&gt;

=== The Rugby Championship and Super Rugby: 2011 ===
The deal for 2011 to 2015 included:&lt;ref name= deal-2009/&gt;
* Super Rugby expanded to 15 teams, and split into three conferences, each with five teams and based in one of the three nations. The four current Australian teams would be joined by a new team in the Australia conference; this license was later awarded to the [[Melbourne Rebels]].
* At the same time, the regular season expanded to include 16 matches (8 home, 8 away) per team, with each country playing a double round-robin within its home conference, and playing single matches against four teams from each of the other conferences.
* Super Rugby taking three weeks off in June for the mid-year Tests.
* The play-offs expanded to six teams, with the conference winners joined by the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation. The two conference winners with the most competition points received a first-round bye in the play-offs.
* [[The Rugby Championship]] opening each year in South Africa, and concluding with the two of the three [[Bledisloe Cup]] matches between Australia and New Zealand that fall within the Rugby Championship. This allowed Springboks to be released early for their domestic competition, the [[Currie Cup]].

=== Super Rugby to Argentina and Japan: 2016 ===
Further expansion was agreed in 2015 to include the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] as a full member of SANZAAR from 2016.&lt;ref name = nyt-2015/&gt; Three additional teams were included in the Super Rugby competition, one each from South Africa, Argentina and Japan. Two regional groupings were formed: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentinean team and one Japanese team split into a four-team Africa 1 Conference a four-team Africa 2 Conference.&lt;ref name="Outline of the Super Rugby competition structure"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://files.allblacks.com/comms/new-era-super-rugby/Outline-%20Super-Rugby-Comp-Structure-infographic.pdf | title=Outline of the Super Rugby competition structure | publisher=All Blacks | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a Japanese team has been invited to participate in the [[Super Rugby]] competition from 2016, Japan is not a member of SANZAAR at this stage.

'''Sanatogen''' was a "[[Patent medicine|brain tonic]]" invented by the Bauer Chemical Company, in [[Germany]] in 1898 and sold worldwide&lt;ref name=print&gt;Pei-yin Lin and Weipin Tsai (eds) (2014), ''Print, Profit, and Perception: Ideas, Information and Knowledge in Chinese Societies, 1895-1949'',  Brill Academic Pub, {{ISBN|978-9004259102}}, pp.128-135 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LCPvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Bauer+Sanatogen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=itCi_bCSzX&amp;sig=fnt52N8WtFnwwdcijD_RbyrDfd4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iycjVInGMcLksASQsYHIBQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Bauer%20Sanatogen&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US it was advertised as a "nerve revitaliser". The medicine was prohibited in [[Australia]] in 1915 during  [[World War I]] and a British-made substitute "Sanagen" was introduced to the Australian market the following year, claiming to be "identical to Sanatogen". The product became fashionable in [[China]] in the early 20th century and won the favour of many renowned people.&lt;ref name=print/&gt;

The indications or uses for this product provided by the manufacturer were: "Food tonic. A concentrated nutrient with tonic properties. It is very easily digested and absorbed and is recommended as an effective means of reinforcing the daily diet of aneamic and convalescent patients, including children, and in cases of weakness and exhaustion from overwork or illness."&lt;ref name=american&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_714696|title=Sanatogen - National Museum of American History|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shurṭa''''' ({{lang-ar|شرطة}}) is the common Arabic term for [[police]], although its precise meaning is that of a "picked" or elite force. Bodies termed ''shurṭa'' were established in the early days of the [[Caliphate]], perhaps as early as the caliphate of [[Uthman]] (644–656). In the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]]s, the ''shurṭa'' had considerable power, and its head, the ''ṣāḥib al-shurṭa'' ({{lang-ar|صاحب الشرطة}}), was an important official, whether at the provincial level or in the central government. The duties of the ''shurṭa'' varied with time and place: it was primarily a police and [[internal security]] force and also had judicial functions, but it could also be entrusted with suppressing brigandage, enforcing the ''[[hisbah|ḥisbah]]'', customs and tax duties, rubbish collection, acting as a bodyguard for governors, etc. From the 10th century, the importance of the ''shurṭa'' declined, along with the power of the central government: the army—now dominated by foreign military castes (''[[ghilman|ghilmān]]'' or ''[[mamluk|mamālīk]]'')—assumed the internal security role, while the cities regained a measure of self-government and appropriated the more local tasks of the ''shurṭa'' such as that of the [[watchman (law enforcement)|night watch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9431">'''Technology transfer''', also called '''transfer of technology''' ('''TOT'''), is the process of transferring (disseminating) [[technology]] from the places and [[ingroups and outgroups|ingroups]] of its origination to wider distribution among more people and places. It occurs along various axes: among [[universities]], from universities to businesses, from large businesses to smaller ones, from [[government]]s to businesses, across [[border]]s, both formally and informally, and both openly and surreptitiously. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing, and facilities among [[government]]s or [[University|universities]] and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) [[knowledge transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another. At present{{when|date=July 2014}} transfer of technology (TOT) is primarily horizontal. Vertical transfer occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grosse|first=Robert|title=international Technology Transfer in Services|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=1996|volume=27|page=782|jstor=155512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology transfer is promoted at conferences organized by such groups as the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]] and the Association of University Technology Managers, and at "challenge" competitions by organizations such as the [[Center for Advancing Innovation]] in Maryland. Local venture capital organizations such as the Mid-Atlantic Venture Association (MAVA) also sponsor conferences at which  investors assess the potential for commercialization of technology.

[[Technology brokering|Technology brokers]] are people who discovered how to bridge the emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Hargadon, Andrew. [http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3613.html ''Harvard Business School Working Knowledge for Business Leaders''], August 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  A related term, used almost synonymously, is "technology [[valorisation]]". While conceptually the practice has been utilized for many years (in ancient times, [[Archimedes]] was notable for applying science to practical problems), the present-day volume of research, combined with high-profile failures at [[Xerox PARC]] and elsewhere{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, has led to a focus on the process itself.

Whereas technology transfer can involve the dissemination of [[high tech|highly complex technology]] from capital-intensive origins to low-capital recipients (and can involve aspects of dependency and fragility of systems), it also can involve [[appropriate technology]], not necessarily high-tech or expensive, that is better disseminated, yielding [[robustness]] and [[autonomy|independence]] of systems.

==Transfer process==
Many companies, universities and governmental organizations now have an Office of Technology Transfer (TTO, also known as "Tech Transfer" or "TechXfer") dedicated to identifying research which has potential commercial interest and strategies for how to exploit it.  For instance, a research result may be of scientific and commercial interest, but [[patent]]s are normally only issued for practical processes, and so someone—not necessarily the researchers—must come up with a specific practical process.&lt;ref&gt;Miron-Shatz, T., Shatz, I., Becker, S., Patel, J., &amp; Eysenbach, G. (2014). [http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Promoting-Business-and-Entrepreneurial-Awareness-in-Health-Care-Professionals.pdf "Promoting business and entrepreneurial awareness in health care professionals: lessons from venture capital panels at medicine 2.0 conferences"]. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16(8), e184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another consideration is commercial value; for example, while there are many ways to accomplish [[nuclear fusion]], the ones of commercial value are those that generate more energy than they require to operate.

The process to commercially exploit research varies widely.  It can involve licensing agreements or setting up joint ventures and partnerships to share both the risks and rewards of bringing new technologies to market.  Other corporate vehicles, e.g. spin-outs, are used where the host organization does not have the necessary will, resources or skills to develop a new technology.  Often these approaches are associated with raising of [[venture capital]] (VC) as a means of funding the development process, a practice more common in the [[United States]] than in the [[European Union]], which has a more conservative approach to VC funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/monitoring/statistical01_en.htm EU Report on EU/global comparisons in the commercialisation of new technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research spin-off]] companies are a popular vehicle of commercialisation in [[Canada]], where the rate of licensing of Canadian university research remains far below that of the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/h_00011.html State of The Nation 2008 - Canada's Science, Technology and Innovation System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology transfer offices may work on behalf of research institutions, governments and even large multinationals.  Where start-ups and spin-outs are the clients, commercial fees are sometimes waived in lieu of an equity stake in the business.  As a result of the potential complexity of the technology transfer process, technology transfer organizations are often multidisciplinary, including economists, engineers, lawyers, marketers and scientists. The dynamics of the technology transfer process has attracted attention in its own right, and there are several dedicated societies and journals.

There has been a marked increase in technology transfer intermediaries specialized in their field since 1980, stimulated in large part by the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] and equivalent legislation in other countries, which provided additional incentives for research exploitation.

== Drawbacks ==

Despite incentives to move research into production, the practical aspects are sometimes difficult to perform in practice.  Using DoD Technology Readiness Levels as a criterion (for example), research tends to focus on TRL (technology readiness level) 1–3 while readiness for production tends to focus on TRL 6–7 or higher.  Bridging TRL-3 to TRL-6 has proven to be difficult in some organizations.  Attempting to rush research (prototypes) into production (fully tested under diverse conditions, reliable, maintainable, etc.) tends to be more costly and time-consuming than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08467sp.pdf|title= Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity''' is a declaration adopted by the General Conference of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] at its thirty-first session on 2 November 2001&lt;ref name="UNCommiss01"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/diversity.htm Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights 'Universal Declaration of Cultural Diversity' webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Declaration is constituted by 12 Articles; Article 1 titled "Cultural diversity, the common heritage of humanity" states that "As a source of exchange, [[innovation]] and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as [[biodiversity]] is for the nature. In this sense, it is the common [[cultural heritage|heritage]] of humanity and should be recognized and affirmed for the benefit of present and future generations." Article 4 describes that cultural diversity may not infringe upon [[human rights]] guaranteed by [[international law]]. Article 5 affirms [[linguistic rights]] as [[cultural rights]] in accordance with [[International Bill of Human Rights]]. Article 6 affirms the [[freedom of expression]], [[media pluralism]] and [[multilingualism]]. And Article 12 defines on the role of the UNESCO.

'''Unissued stock''' is stock that has been authorized in a company's [[charter]], but has never been sold. It differs from [[Treasury stock]] (in the UK, Treasury shares, as treasury stock means something else), in that treasury stock has been issued, and bought back by the company, whereas unissued stock has never been issued.

'''United States criminal procedure''' derives from several sources of law: the baseline protections of the [[United States Constitution]], [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] statutes; federal and state rules of criminal procedure (such as the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]); and state and federal [[case law]]. Criminal procedures are distinct from [[United States civil procedure|civil procedures]] in the [[United States of America|US]].

==Sources of law==

===U.S. Constitution===
{{main|United States constitutional criminal procedure}}
The [[United States Constitution]], including the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and subsequent amendments, contains the following provisions regarding criminal procedure. Due to the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]], all of these provisions apply equally to criminal proceedings in state courts, with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the [[Excessive Bail Clause]] of the Eighth Amendment.
*[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three, Section Two, Clause Three]]:

**[[Assistance of Counsel Clause]]
*[[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]:
**Excessive Bail Clause
*[[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]:
**[[Due process]] clause
**[[Equal Protection Clause]]

===Federal statutes and rules===
Federal statutes and rules apply to criminal proceedings in federal courts, such as:
*[[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]
*[[Jencks Act]]

===State statutes and rules===
Each state has its own statutes and rules of criminal proceeding applying to proceedings in its courts.

==Charging instruments==
In a criminal case, the government generally brings charges in one of two ways: either by accusing a suspect directly in a "[[bill of information]]" or other similar document, or by bringing evidence before a [[grand jury]] to allow that body to determine whether the case should proceed. If the grand jury determines that there is enough evidence to justify the bringing of charges, then the defendant is [[indictment|indicted]]. In the federal system, a case must always be brought before a grand jury for indictment if it is punishable by death or more than one year in prison;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule7.htm&lt;/ref&gt; some states, however, do not require indictment.

==Petit juries==
Once charges have been brought, the case is then brought before a [[petit jury]], (or what is commonly recognized as the normal courtroom jury of six to twelve members), or is tried by a judge alone, if the defense requests it.  Any petit jury is selected from a pool by the prosecution and defense.

After both sides have presented their cases and made closing arguments, the judge gives the jury legal instructions; the jury then adjourns to deliberate in private.  The jury generally must unanimously agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty; however, the Supreme Court has upheld non unanimous jury verdicts, so long as the jury is larger than 6 people.  In 1972, the Court upheld convictions in Apodaca v. Oregon &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_69_5046&lt;/ref&gt; and Johnson v. Louisiana &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_69_5035&lt;/ref&gt; where Oregon and Louisiana convicted Petitioners on 10-to-2 and 9-to-3 verdicts respectively.  In 1979, the Court ruled in Burch v. Louisiana that where a jury was made of 6 people, the verdict must be unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1978/1978_78_90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation of evidence==
{{main|United States evidence law}}
The prosecution gives an opening statement that summarizes its general arguments. The defense can then present its opening statement or may opt to wait until the prosecution has finished presenting its complete case. The prosecution presents its case first. This is done by calling witnesses to give testimony and by presenting physical evidence that will prove the defendant is guilty of the crime.  Witnesses are people who can give testimony that will help prove the guilt of the defendant. They may have actually seen events related to the crime, may have relevant information about the defendant, or may be able to give expert testimony concerning the evidence or have other important information. After the prosecution finishes, it is the time for the defense to address the court. 

The defense may start by asking the judge to dismiss the case for lack of evidence. If the judge agrees the evidence is insufficient to prove the defendant committed the crime without a reasonable doubt, the case will be dismissed and the defendant will be free of the charges. Usually, the judge does not dismiss the case. At this time, the defense will give its opening statement if it has not already done so. The defense then proceeds to present its case by calling witnesses and submitting evidence that will prove the defendant did not commit the crime.  All witnesses may be [[cross-examination|cross-examined]] by the opposing side while testifying. Under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the defendant is not required to be a witness in his own defense. If he does not testify, the jury can not hold this against him. Also under the Fifth Amendment, a witness  has the right not to incriminate himself. This means the witness is not required to answer any question if doing so would incriminate himself. After the defense finishes presenting its case, each side gives a closing statement summarizing the evidence that supports its position of either guilt or innocence. The closing statements are given in the same order, with the defense going last. Then the deliberation phase of the trail begins.

==Verdict==

===Burden of proof===
The [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the prosecution in a criminal trial. This means the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime. As the defense does not have this burden, it must only prove that it is reasonably possible that the defendant did not commit the crime. The defense does not have to prove the defendant definitely did not commit the crime, only that it is possible he did not do it.

===Deliberation===
Once the prosecution and defense present their cases, the judge will give the case to the jury. First the judge will instruct the jury about any legal rules that may affect their decision. The judge then sends the jury to the jury room to deliberate about whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charges. During the trial the jury is not allowed to read about the case or discuss it with anyone even each other. Sometimes juries are sequestered or kept together away from their homes and any media coverage of the trial. 

Once deliberation begins the jurors are allowed to talk to each other. They are to remain together, except overnight, until they either reach a decision or determine they cannot reach a decision. In the later occurrence, the jury is said to be deadlocked and is called a hung jury. If the jury decides, this is called the verdict. They inform the judge and return to the courtroom where the verdict is read. The judge may either accept the verdict or overrule it. It is rare for the verdict to be overruled. This happens when the judge thinks the verdict is unlawful. Often this is because the jury does not follow the legal instructions. It can also happen if the judge thinks the jury interpreted the evidence in a manner that was not legal. Once the verdict is determined, the trial moves to the punishment phase. This can simply be the judge issuing the punishment sentence or, in more serious cases, can involve a separate hearing.

==Sentencing==
If a defendant is found guilty, sentencing follows, often at a separate hearing after the prosecution, defense, and court have developed information based on which the judge will craft a sentence.  The United States Sentencing Commission has promulgated guidance on what restitution and prison terms should be assessed for different crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussc.gov |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812131028/http://www.ussc.gov/ |archivedate=August 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In capital cases, a separate "penalty phase" occurs, in which the jury determines whether to recommend that the death penalty should be imposed.  As with the determination of guilt phase, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case, and the defendant is entitled to take the stand in his or her own defense, and may call witnesses and present evidence.

==Appeals==
After sentencing, the case enters the [[Post conviction |post conviction phase]]. Usually the defendant begins serving the sentence immediately after the sentence is issued. The defendant may appeal the outcome of his trial to a higher court.  American appellate courts do not retry the case. These courts  only examine the record of the proceedings of the lower court to determine if errors were made that require a new trial, resentencing, or a complete dismissal of the charges.  The prosecution may not appeal after an acquittal, although it may appeal under limited circumstances before the verdict is rendered. The prosecution may also appeal the sentence itself.  Increasingly, there is also a recognition that [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]] may result from the sentence that are not explicitly part of the sentence itself.
