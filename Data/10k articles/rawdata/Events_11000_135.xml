      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2961">'''Amphitheatre Auditorium''' or just the '''Auditorium''' was a theatre building in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], United States at the corner of 4th and Hill Streets. Upon its completion in 1889, the large wooden structure boasted the second largest stage in the United States. The New York Opera House was the largest stage at the time.

==History==
The Louisville theater was built with materials from the nearby dismantled remains of the [[Southern Exposition]] building, which was located just a block away. It contained over 2,000 electric lights, could seat 3,072, and had a stage was 90 feet across and 60 feet deep. The theater opened on September 23, 1889.&lt;ref name="theater"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Louisville'' (John E. Kleber) pages 31-32 {{ISBN|0-8131-2100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was operated by [[philanthropist]] William Norton, Jr., who went by the name Daniel Quilp, a villain in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.&lt;ref name="theater"/&gt; He promoted the auditorium with the phrase "Only for great attractions". Norton also used the theatre as a place for the poor to collect handouts once a week. Upon his death he willed that his theatre workers receive three months' salary. He also gave 900,000 dollars of his estate to the Louisville Baptists' Orphans' Home.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

On March 6, 1890, the highly acclaimed opera singer [[Adelina Patti]] gave her first performance of a three-day stop in Louisville during a six-city tour in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''The Atlanta Constitution'' February 7, 1890 page 5 Patti in Louisville&lt;/ref&gt; The theater began having significant success following her performance. The summer season was the most productive.

Many of the day's great actors and political figures performed there, including [[Edwin Booth]], [[Lawrence Barrett]], [[John Philip Sousa]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Booker T. Washington]].&lt;ref name="theater"/&gt; The theater was part of a large entertainment complex that included a bike riding park, a man-made lagoon, a promenade, and a ten-thousand-seat outdoor amphitheatre used for fireworks shows, including ''The Last Days of Pompei'' and ''Americus''.

After Norton's death in 1903, no buyers could be found for the Auditorium or surrounding attractions. The last event, the ''Children's Floral Ball'', was held on April 30, 1904. Later, the site was purchased for $900 and razed on May 5, 1905, only 16 years after its completion.&lt;ref name="theater"/&gt;

{{Eastern Slavic name|Stepanovich|Dyatlov}}

'''Anatoly Stepanovich Dyatlov''' ({{lang-ru|Анатолий Степанович Дятлов}}; March 3, 1931 – December 13, 1995) was deputy chief-engineer of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], and the supervisor of the fatal experiment which resulted in the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

Dyatlov was born in 1931 in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Russia]] (in the then [[Soviet Union]]). In 1959, he graduated from the [[Moscow Engineering Physics Institute]]. After graduation, he worked in a shipbuilding plant in [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]], installing reactors into submarines. He received a [[radiation dose]] of 200 [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]], a dose which typically causes mild [[radiation sickness]], vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and reduction in resistance to infections,&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Dennis P. ''Loss Prevention and Safety Control: Terms and Definitions'', CRC Press,LLC (2016); Boca Raton,  Florida;  p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; during a nuclear accident there. His son died of [[Leukemia]]. In 1973, he moved to [[Pripyat, Ukraine]] to work at the newly constructed [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]].

On April 26, 1986, Dyatlov supervised a test at Reactor 4 of the nuclear plant, which resulted in the worst nuclear plant accident in history. In 1987, he was found guilty "of criminal mismanagement of potentially explosive enterprises" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He was released after five years. He wrote a book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ru/MEMUARY/CHERNOBYL/dyatlow.txt Anatoly Dyatlov, ''"Chernobyl. How it happened"''] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;
in which he claimed that poor plant design, rather than plant personnel, was primarily responsible for the accident. 

During the accident, Dyatlov was exposed to a [[radiation dose]] of 390&amp;nbsp;[[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]] (3.9&amp;nbsp;[[Sievert|Sv]]), which causes death to 50% of affected persons after 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He died of [[heart failure]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accidont.ru/memo/ChNPP.pdf] http://accidont.ru/memo/ChNPP.pdf (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
In the '''Battle of Shaizar''' in 1111, a [[Crusades|Crusader]] army commanded by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] and a [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] army led by [[Mawdud]] ibn Altuntash of [[Mosul]] fought to tactical draw but a withdrawal of Crusader forces.

==Background==
Beginning in 1110 and lasting until 1115, the Seljuk [[Muhammad I of Great Seljuk|Sultan Muhammad I]] in [[Baghdad]] launched annual invasions of the Crusader states. The first year's attack on [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was repelled. Prodded by the pleas of some citizens of [[Halab|Aleppo]] and spurred by the Byzantines, the Sultan ordered a major offensive against the Frankish possessions in northern Syria for the year 1111. The Sultan appointed Mawdud ibn Altuntash, governor of Mosul, to command the army. The composite force included contingents from [[Diyarbakir]] and [[Ahlat]] under [[Sökmen of Ahlatshahs|Sökmen]] al-Qutbi, from Hamadan led by [[Bursuq ibn Bursuq]] and from [[Mesopotamia]] under Ahmadil and other emirs.

==Edessa to Aleppo==
At the approach of the large Muslim army, the small Frankish forces of the [[County of Edessa]] withdrew within the walls of their two major towns. Although the Seljuks moved with impunity though the lands of the Latin state, they were unable to make an impression on first [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and later [[Turbessel]] (Tell Bashir). Soon the thwarted Seljuk host moved to Aleppo. At that city, the forces of [[Damascus]] led by [[Toghtekin]] joined Mawdud's army.

Even though the majority of Aleppo's citizens were well disposed to the Seljuk army, the ruler of the city, [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] refused to open the city's gates. Radwan regarded the Sultan's army as a threat to his authority. Both Bursuq and Sukman al-Qutbi were ill and quarreled with each other. When Sukman's health failed, he withdrew from the army with his followers, but died before he got home. Bursuq also quit the army and took his contingent home. Anxious to receive Sukman's territories, Ahmadil left the army to press his claims with the Sultan.

==Aleppo to Shaizar==
By this time Tancred had called up his Antiochene army and based it at the castle of Rugia near Jisrash Shughur, a bridge over the Orontes about 50 kilometers south of [[Antioch]]. Receiving a plea for help from the independent Munqidh rulers of [[Shaizar]], Mawdud's army moved 120 kilometers south-southwest from Aleppo to camp outside that town.

At Tancred's call for assistance, King Baldwin I brought both his own army from the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and Count Bertrand's forces from the [[County of Tripoli]]. They were joined at Rugia by a contingent from Edessa under [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Count Baldwin]]. After uniting their forces, the Crusaders advanced first to the Christian-held town of [[Apamea (Syria)|Afamiya]], then toward the Muslim host outside Shaizar.

==Battle==
Mawdud's army "employed their normal harassing tactics, which were directed to the objects of cutting off supplies from the Franks, and of preventing their watering their horses in the Orontes."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 142&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian host refused to be provoked into battle, but instead moved in a closed up array. When the Turkish horse archers pressed them too closely, they fought to push them back. Rather than a battle, the action was a constant running skirmish in which the Seljuks failed to stop the advance of Baldwin's army.

The Franks camped near Shaizar but within two weeks they were forced to fall back on Afamiya because the Turks cut off their supplies. During the withdrawal, they were harassed again, but did not allow themselves to be drawn into a pitched battle. At this, Mawdud's warriors, discouraged by their lack of success and plunder, dispersed for home.

The future poet and diplomat [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]], then 16 years old, was a participant in the battle, and later reminisced about it in his ''[[Kitab al-I'tibar]]''.

==Results==
This drawn battle, really a running skirmish, allowed King Baldwin I and Tancred to successfully defend the Principality of Antioch. No Crusader towns or castles fell to the Seljuk Turks during the campaign. The next major action in northern Syria was the [[Battle of Sarmin]] in 1115.

The '''Blue Panther 40th Anniversary Show''', or more properly '''Funcion Homenaje Festejano los 40 Años de Blue Panther''' (Spanish for "Tribute and celebration of 40 years of Blue Panther") was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Card (sports)#Supercard|super card]] held on October 19, 2018. The show was produced and scripted by the Mexican [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL: Spanish for "World Wrestling Council") and took place at [[Arena México]] in Mexico City, Mexico. The special edition of CMLL's [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] show honored CMLL wrestler [[Blue Panther]] for his 40th anniversary as a professional wrestler.

As part of the show Blue Panther himself helped book two of the matches on the show. Firstly a match between wrestlers who was trained in the ''Laguneros'' area (Blue Panther, [[Euforia (wrestler)|Euforia]], [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]] and [[Ephesto|Panterita del Ring]] and wrestlers from the Tapatía area ([[Máscara Año 2000]], [[El Cuatrero]], [[Forastero]] and [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]]), which was won by Blue Panther. The other featured match was the first-ever ''Copa Halcón Suriano'' ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination match. The ''Copa Halcón Suriano'' was won by [[Ángel de Oro]] who was presented with a trophy by [[Stukita|Halcón Suriano Jr.]] who made his first appearance under that name, having previously worked under the name Stukita. In the main event [[Bárbaro Cavernario]] and ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' ([[Rush (wrestler)|Rush]] and [[El Terrible]]) defeated [[Carístico]], [[Penta el 0M]], David Finlay

==Production==
===Background===
Genaro Vazquez Nevarez, better known under the [[Ring name]] [[Blue Panther]], made his professional wrestling debut on October 8, 1978.&lt;ref name=BP30/&gt; His first break came working for the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] in the early 1980s. In the UWA he won the [[UWA World Welterweight Championship]],&lt;ref name=UWAWLBook&gt;{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter = MEXICO: Universal Wrestling Federation Welterweight Title |page = 398 |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship]] twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter = Mexico: Universal Wrestling Federation Junior Light Heavyweight Title |page = 397 |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later moved on to [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), the promotion he worked for for most of his career. In CMLL he became involved in the storyline feud that would not only bring him to national and international attention but also helped cement his reputation as highly talented wrestler, a feud against [[Art Barr|"Love Machine" Art Barr]], The feud spanned two promotions (CMLL and [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]]), included two high profile ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet matches, where Blue Panther won the mask, and then the hair of Barr, as well as a long series of main event matches.&lt;ref name=BP30&gt;{{cite news|title=Luchas 2000|work=Blue Panther 30 Años: La Historia|publisher=Publicaciones citem, S.A. de C.V.|location=[[Ciudad Juárez|Juárez]], [[Mexico]]|id=Especial 34|pages=1–35|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnHistory"&gt;{{cite news | author = Lucha 2000 Staff | title = Arena México: 50 anos de Lucha Libre  | work =Lucha 2000 | id = Especial 28 | date = April 2006 |  language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In CMLL Blue Panther's won the [[CMLL World Middleweight Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Royal | last1=Duncan | first2=Gary | last2=Will | title=Wrestling title histories: professional wrestling champions around the world from the 19th century to the present | year=2000 | publisher=Archeus Communications | location=Waterloo, ON | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[CMLL World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]],&lt;ref name=Reign19&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=5&amp;nr=96&amp;page=5&amp;reign=19 | title=CMLL World Tag Team Championship &gt;&gt; Title Reigns &gt;&gt; 25.07.004 - 02.04.2005: Atlantis &amp; Blue Panther  | work=CageMatch | accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] twice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter = Mexico: EMLL CMLL Trios Title | page = 396 |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reign11&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=5&amp;nr=1028&amp;page=5&amp;reign=11 | title=CMLL World Trios Championship &gt;&gt; Title Reigns &gt;&gt; 17.06.2002 - 16.06.2002:Blue Panther, Dr. Wagner Jr. &amp; Fuerza Guerrera | work=CageMatch | accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter = Mexico: National Trios Title | page = 393 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he won the mask of [[Lizmark Jr.]],&lt;ref name=BP30/&gt; but lost his own mask the following year to [[Villano V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Ocampo, Ernest | title = Anniversario 75 de CMLL | work =SuperLuchas | pages= 2&amp;ndash;7 | id = issue 282 | date =  December 26, 2007 | url=http://superluchas.net/2008/09/23/super-luchas-282-22-de-septiembre-de-2008/ | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his 35th Anniversary Show in 2013 Vazquez introduced two of his sons to the wrestling world, [[Blue Panther Jr.]] and [[The Panther (wrestler)|Black Panther]]. For the 40th-anniversary show, Vazques was involved in booking two matches for the show, including creating the ''Copa Halcón Suriano'' in honor of his wrestling trainer.

===Storylines===
[[File:Blue Panther Jr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Blue Panther Jr.]], one of the sons of Blue Panther]]
The Blue Panther 40th Anniversary Show featured five [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.&lt;ref name="Mondo"&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = "Okay... what is Lucha Libre?" | page = 31 | quote=featuring clearly distinguished good guys and bad guys, or técnicos and rudos | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the celebration, Blue Panther wanted to honor his trainer Halcón Suriano, who had had a hand in training many of the wrestlers from the Lagunero area. To that end, CMLL created the ''La Copa Halcón Suriano'', a 10-man tournament where all the competitors came from the Lagunero area. As part of the celebration, CMLL announced that [[Stukita]], the grandson of Halcón Suriano would from that point on be known as "Halcón Suriano Jr." and move from the [[Mini-Estrella]] to the regular division. Halcón Suriano Jr. would also present the trophy bearing the name of his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/CMLL_OFICIAL/status/1052671780781998098 | title=Stukita evoluciona a Halcón Suriano Suriano Jr. | date=October 17, 2018 | accessdate=October 24, 2018 | author=CMLL Oficial | publisher=[[Twitter]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soberano Jr.]] was originally scheduled to be part of the match, but since he was committed to working in Japan at the time he was replaced by [[Templario]]. While Templario was not actually from the Lagunero area his trainer [[Último Guerrero]] explained that he had become "adopted" by the Laguneros, which was a storyline explanation to cover for the fact that CMLL needed a replacement for Sobereano Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YanGuFtnbU | title=CMLL Informa 17 de Octubre de 2018 | author=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|VideosOficialesCMLL]] | publisher=[[YouTube]] | date=October 17, 2018 | accessdate=October 27, 2018 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening match, [[Pegasso]] was the first of many wrestlers to wear a Blue Panther inspired mask and ring gear specifically  for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah297/Gladiatores6/Empresas/CMLL/Arena%20Mexico%2019%20de%20Octubre%202018/DSC_0141_zpssp2nt603.jpg?687 | title=Picture of Pegasso | work=The Gladiatores | date=October 20, 2018 | accessdate=October 26, 2018 | first=José |last=Lázaro Rodríguez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pegasso and [[Stigma (luchador)|Stigma]] defeated [[Cancerbero]] and El Coyote, two falls to one in 9 minutes and 57 seconds.&lt;ref name=40Gladiatores/&gt;&lt;ref name=40Esto/&gt;

For the ''Copa Halcón Suriano'' introduction ceremony, the five ''tecnico'' participants ([[Ángel de Oro]], [[The Panther (wrestler)|Black Panther]], [[Blue Panther Jr.]], [[Niebla Roja]] and [[Stuka Jr.]]) all wore masks where one side was their normal mask and the other was a replica of the Blue Panther mask.

Prior to the fourth match of the night Sofia Alonso, granddaughter of CMLL founder [[Salvador Lutteroth]], presented Blue Panther with a plaque commemorating his 40th anniversary in professional wrestling. Afterward, Panther introduced "El Hijo de Blue Panther" (Literally "The Son of Blue Panther"), younger brother of Blue Panther Jr. and Black Panther, to the audience, revealing that Hijo de Blue Panther was preparing for an in-ring career. For the match, both Blue Panther and Máscara Año 2000 wore their wrestling masks, getting special permission from the lucha libre commission to wear their masks after losing them in 2008 and 1993 respectively. For the night [[Ephesto]] worked under his previous ring character "Panterita del Ring" as an homage to his Lagunero beginnings. In the end, Blue Panther forced Máscara Año 2000 to submit to an arm bar, winning the match for the "Laguneros'" team two falls to one.&lt;ref name=40Gladiatores/&gt;&lt;ref name=40Esto/&gt;&lt;ref name=40MT/&gt;

In the main event, the ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' team of [[Bárbaro Cavernario]], [[El Terrible]] and [[Rush (wrestler)|Rush]] defeated the trio of [[Carístico]], David Finlay and [[Penta 0M]] two falls to one after Rush pinned Penta 0M after executing a "Rush Driver" ([[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Double underhook piledriver|Double underhook piledriver]]) on Penta 0M.&lt;ref name=40Gladiatores/&gt;&lt;ref name=40Esto/&gt;&lt;ref name=40MT/&gt;

'''Boe-OFT''' (Boeing Orbital Flight Test) is the first orbital mission of the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It is an uncrewed flight test.

== Mission ==
The first [[United Launch Alliance]] [[Atlas V]] N22 rocket, designated AV-080, will launch the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft on an unpiloted Orbital Test Flight (OFT) to the [[International Space Station]]. The capsule will dock with the space station, then return to Earth to land in the Western United States after an orbital shakedown cruise ahead of [[Boe-CFT]].

The '''Book of [[Veles (god)|Veles]]''' (also: '''Veles Book''', '''Vles book''', '''Vlesbook''', '''Isenbeck's Planks''', {{lang|ru|Велесова книга}}, {{lang|ru|Велесова књига}}, {{lang|ru|Велес книга}}, {{lang|ru|Книга Велеса}}, {{lang|ru|Дощечки Изенбека}}, {{lang|ru|Дощьки Изенбека}}) is a [[literary forgery]]&lt;ref name="sichinava"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arzamas.academy/materials/152|title=Почему "Велесова книга" — это фейк|last=Sichinava|first=Dmitry|publisher=Arzamas|language=Russian|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; purporting to be a text of ancient [[Slavic mythology|Slavic religion]] and [[history]] supposedly written on wooden planks.

It contains [[religion|religious]] passages and accounts of history interspersed with religious morals. The earliest events in the book could be dated around the 7th century BC and the latest happened in the 9th century AD.

The book was allegedly discovered in 1919 and lost in 1941. It is widely held by scholars to be a [[forgery]] made in the 1940s–1950s or, less likely, in the early 19th century. The main decisive evidence is the language of the text which is a mixture of different modern Slavic languages with erroneous and invented forms and no regular grammar. Moreover, different modern editions of the book have different versions of its text. Regardless, some [[Slavic neopaganism|Slavic neopagans]] use it as their [[sacred text]].

==Authenticity==
Most of the [[scholar]]s that specialize in the field of mythological studies and Slavic linguistics (such as [[Boris Rybakov]], [[Andrey Zaliznyak]], [[Leo Klejn|Leo Klein]], and all Russian academic historians and linguists) consider it a forgery.&lt;ref name=think&gt;[http://knigavelesa.narod.ru/knigi/Chto_dymaiyt_uchenye_o_VK/soder.html What scientists think about the «Veles book»] // Compiled by A. Alexeyev (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these scholars the thorough analysis of the book shows that it was written sometime in the 20th century. The history of the book can be reliably traced only as far as mid-1950s, when the transcribed book and the photograph of one of the planks first appeared in a [[San Francisco]]-based, Russian émigré newspaper. Several scholars believe that the entire book is a product of collaboration of the editors of this newspaper and Yuriy Mirolyubov, who later claimed to have found the book. Others believe that either the entire book or the only plank available, were forged in the early 19th century by the Russian collector and forger Alexander Sulakadzev.

The book is written in a language using for the most part Slavic roots and different affixes found also in [[old East Slavic]]. Consequently, a large part of the book's text, once transcribed into a modern alphabet, is readable (albeit with some difficulty) by modern speakers of [[Slavic languages]]. However, professional linguists and historians, particularly the specialists in ancient Slavic, question many features of its language &amp;mdash; vocabulary (modern or medieval Slavic words occasionally and unwittingly used in place of their ancient equivalents), spelling, phonetics (distinct reflections of the nasal vowels, both following Polish and Serbian patterns in different places, the haphazard handling of reduced vowels, etc., etc.), grammar (grammatical forms incompatible with early Slavic languages, combinations of affixes that contradict each other in meaning), etc. These features seem to indicate that the text was artificially "aged" by someone with superficial knowledge of ancient Slavic, and cannot be adequately translated because of lack of any consistent grammar system. In the words of the philologist O.V. Tvorogov:
{{quotation|This analysis leads us to a definite conclusion: we are dealing with an artificial language, "invented" by a person unacquainted with the history of Slavic languages and one who could not create his own language system.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://janaberestova.narod.ru/kozlov.html Козлов В.П.

In Ukraine, whereas academic scholars agree that the book is a hoax, it became very popular among politicians who consider it genuine and believe it describes real historical facts relevant for establishing Ukrainian ethnicity. In particular, [[Levko Lukyanenko]] was citing the Book of Veles as historical. In 1999, the book was included in the high school program in Ukraine as a genuine literary and historical piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|title=Фоменко — жертва фанатизма|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the inclusion was considered controversial in academic circles, the book remained on the program as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodna.pravda.com.ua/history/48259d5bd6b31/view_print/|title=Початок кінця "велесовщини"|last=Рудницький|first=Юрій|publisher="Главред" magazine, no. 18, 2008|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Planks===

The planks were alleged to be 38&amp;nbsp;cm wide, 22&amp;nbsp;cm tall and about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm thick. The edges and surfaces of the planks are uneven and near the top there are two holes for joining the planks. The text is carved into the planks and later covered with some coloring. Text alignment lines (roughly straight and parallel) are drawn across the planks and the tops of letters are aligned with these lines. The text is written below the lines, rather than above. The size and shape of the letters are different, suggesting that more than one person wrote the text. Some planks were partially or mostly rotten.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===History of the book's discovery according to Mirolyubov===

In 1919, a lieutenant of the [[White Army|White Russian Army]], Fedor Arturovich Izenbek, found a bunch of wooden planks written in strange script in a looted mansion of [[Kurakins]] near [[Kharkiv]] ([[Ukraine]]). After the defeat of the Army, Isenbeck emigrated to [[Belgrade]], where in 1923 he unsuccessfully tried to sell the planks to the [[Belgrade]] library and museum. In 1925 he settled in [[Brussels]], where he gave the planks to Yuriy Mirolyubov, who was the first to study them seriously.&lt;ref name="sichinava"/&gt; Izenbek treated the planks very carefully, did not allow them to be taken out of his house and refused a suggestion by a professor of [[University of Brussels]] to hand them over for studying. Later this refusal to permit others to study these texts would lead people to suspect them as [[forgery|forgeries]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

For fifteen years Mirolyubov restored, [[photography|photographed]], transcribed (as photographs proved to be unreadable) and finally translated the text. He managed to transcribe most of the planks.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In August 1941 [[Nazi Germany]] occupied Brussels, Izenbek died and the planks were lost. Mirolyubov emigrated to the [[United States]] and passed the materials in 1953 to professor A. A. Kurenkov (Kur) who then published them in the magazine ''Zhar-Ptitsa'' (Жар-птица, "[[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]]") from March 1957 until May 1959. Later the text was studied by [[Sergey Paramonov (entomologist)|Sergey Paramonov]] (Lesnoy).&lt;ref&gt;[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2r3khZ1092STWt6YW9NQXAxNDA/view Valery Korneyev, The Real Life of Sergey Lesnoy]&lt;br/&gt;{{lang-uk|[[:uk:Корнєєв Валерій Олексійович|Корнєєв В.

===Contents===

According to the Book of Veles, in the 10th century BC ("thirteen hundred years before [[Ermanaric]]"), pre-Slavic tribes lived in the "land of seven rivers beyond the sea" (possibly corresponding to [[Semirechye]], southeastern [[Kazakhstan]]). The book describes the migration of the Slavs through [[Syria]] and eventually into the [[Carpathian mountains]], during the course of which they were briefly enslaved by the king "Nabsur" ([[Nabonassar]]?). They settled in the Carpathian mountains in the 5th century BC ("fifteen hundred years before [[Askold and Dir|Dir]]"). Several centuries appear to pass without much commotion. The 4th century is described in some detail: during this time the Slavs fought a number of wars with the [[Goths]], [[Huns]], Greeks, and Romans. Many references to [[Ermanaric]] and his relatives are present (placing this section of Book of Veles in the same historical context as the story of [[Jonakr's sons]], referenced in numerous European legends and sagas). The Slavs eventually emerged victorious. The period of the 5th to 9th centuries is described briefly; [[Khazars]] and [[Bulgars]] are mentioned.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The book ends with the Slavic lands descending into disarray and falling under [[Normans|Norman]] rule.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Excerpts===

====Plank 2/B====
''We were forced to retreat to woods and live as hunters and fishermen. So we could&lt;br /&gt;
get away from danger. We survived one darkness and started to build cities&lt;br /&gt;
and houses everywhere. After the second darkness there was great frost and we moved&lt;br /&gt;
to south for many places there were grassy ... and then [[Ancient Rome|Romei]] were taking our cattle&lt;br /&gt;
at a good price and were true to their word. We went&lt;br /&gt;
to southern ... greengrassland and had a lot of cattle ...''
{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====From Plank 7/A====
''Enemies are not as numerous as we are, for we are [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] and they are not.''
{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Plank 11/A====
''We pray and bow to the first [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] and to him we sing a great glory. &lt;br /&gt;
We praise [[Svarog]], grandfather of gods who is to whole gods' kin forefather&lt;br /&gt;
and creator of everything living, eternal spring that flows in the summer&lt;br /&gt;
and everywhere and in winter and never it freezes. And with that living water he nourishes&lt;br /&gt;
and life gives to us until we reach the blessed fields of [[paradise]]. And to god [[Perun]], the thunderer, god of battle and fight we say:&lt;br /&gt;
"You hold us in life by neverending turning of the circle and lead to path&lt;br /&gt;
of [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Prav]] through battles to Great [[Trizna]]". And all who got killed in the battle -&lt;br /&gt;
may they live forever in the Perun's [[regiment]]. To god [[Svetovid]] glory we&lt;br /&gt;
are exalting for he is the god of Prav and [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Jav]] and to him we sing the song for he is the [[light]]&lt;br /&gt;
with which we see the world. We are looking and in Jav we are, and he from [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Nav]]&lt;br /&gt;
guards us and therefore praise we sing him. We sing and dance to him and call&lt;br /&gt;
god of ours to [[Earth]], [[Sun]] and [[star]]s constantly in light keeps.&lt;br /&gt;
And glory all to Svetovid, god of ours that&lt;br /&gt;
hearts ours opens for us to admit bad deeds ours&lt;br /&gt;
and to good we turn. May he hug us like children for this has been said:&lt;br /&gt;
what is created with half of the mind could not be seen,&lt;br /&gt;
for it is a great secret how can Svarog be at the same time both Perun and Svetovid.&lt;br /&gt;
Two beings in skies [[Belobog]] and [[Crnobog]] are&lt;br /&gt;
And both of them Svarog holds and commands them.&lt;br /&gt;
After them come [[Hors]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] and [[Stribog]] and then Visenj, Lelj and Letic.''
{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====From Plank 26/B====
''...As time passes, we come to the [[Volga|blue river]] as time ours&lt;br /&gt;
is not endless. There we meet&lt;br /&gt;
forefathers our and mothers that in [[Svarga]] herds are grazing and trusses&lt;br /&gt;
fastening. Their life is just as ours, only there are no [[Huns]] nor&lt;br /&gt;
[[Greeks]]...''
{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====From Plank 16 (sample text)====

First two lines, literal text:

Probable spacing (Mirolyubov):

Modern Russian interpretation:

''{{lang|ru|Велесову книгу эту посвящаем богу нашему, который есть наше прибежище и сила (lit. в боге котором есть прибежище и сила).}}&lt;br /&gt;

Translation into English:

''This book of Veles we dedicate to our god, in whom is [our] refuge and [our] strength. In those years there was a man, who was good and valiant, and [he] was called the father of [[Tivertsi|Tiverians]].''

'''Calgary Animated Objects Society (CAOS)''' is a non-profit charitable arts organization based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Founded in 2003, CAOS is dedicated to the arts of mask, puppetry and animated objects, and to building community through art.  CAOS's major projects include the biennial [[International Festival of Animated Objects]], and "Spirit of White Buffalo" a giant animated puppet and arts residency.

==Origins and Goals==
CAOS provides artistic opportunities through its activities, and initiates youth and community activities such as Young Spirit Voices, an aboriginal youth drama project, the [[Ramsay, Calgary|Ramsay]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[Ramsay, Calgary]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Halloween Scream" and "The Great Ramsay&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Kinetic Sculpture Race".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animatedobjects.ca/ Animated Objects]&lt;/ref&gt;

CAOS is led by founder Xstine Cook, a [[mask]] and [[puppet]] artist, who also makes short films, plays the saw, performs spoken word, and is a fire artist.  Xstine co-founded and was co-artistic director of Green Fools Theatre for 13 years prior to founding CAOS.  Xstine trained at the [[Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre]] in [[Blue Lake, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dellarte.com/dellarte.aspx?id=103# |title=Dellarte |access-date=2007-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209115901/http://dellarte.com/dellarte.aspx?id=103# |archive-date=2007-12-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAOS and the festival propel a very active local mask and puppetry tradition into an international arena, all the while bringing international attention to the city of Calgary. Extensive coverage for the organization can be found in FFWD magazine-Calgary's weekly arts &amp; culture publication: "Calgary is a hotbed of original, unorthodox puppet work" (quote from an article written to cover CAOS's festival).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/2005/0120/cover.htm# |title=FFWD Weekly |access-date=2007-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108095441/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/2005/0120/cover.htm# |archive-date=2009-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/2007/0118/fest3.htm# |title=FF Weekly |access-date=2007-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525125408/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/2007/0118/fest3.htm# |archive-date=2011-05-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgary Animated Objects Society has received national coverage for its activities consistently since 2005. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', one of Canada's most respected national daily newspapers accredited CAOS with putting "Calgary in the pop-culture vanguard" in recognition of the International Festival of Animated Objects' programming, the same Globe &amp; Mail article also drew attention to how "Calgary...has become one of the most fertile spots in North America for ground-breaking puppetry".&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20050127.PUPPETS27%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3Dchris%2Bturner%2Bpuppet&amp;ord=2147520&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true The Globe and Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;

CAOS was recently awarded the "Innovative Business Practices Award" from the Rozsa Foundation for Arts Management, a prestigious honour from Calgary's business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calsun.canoe.ca/Showbiz/2007/10/28/pf-4611665.html|title=Calsun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirit Of White Buffalo==

CAOS also produces original art works, such as ''Spirit of White Buffalo''.  Guided by artist Xstine Cook, this giant [[kinetic sculpture]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kinetic sculpture race]]&lt;/ref&gt; was built by incarcerated men in [[Drumheller Institution]], in collaboration with local artists, Jeff De Boer, and youth.  "Spirit of White Buffalo" appeared at the 2007 [[Calgary Stampede Parade]], and was awarded first place in "Best Western Theme".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/canada/AB/story.html?id=8839e51e-6bf3-45ca-a3db-e513a8fb48b6# |title=Travel Canada |access-date=2007-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825015658/http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/canada/AB/story.html?id=8839e51e-6bf3-45ca-a3db-e513a8fb48b6# |archive-date=2007-08-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.animatedobjects.ca/ifaoNews.php# |title=Animated Objects |access-date=2007-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820093437/http://www.animatedobjects.ca/ifaoNews.php# |archive-date=2007-08-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in jail, now free to roam the earth, Spirit of White Buffalo is a 12 foot tall human powered kinetic sculpture.  CAOS founder Xstine Cook worked with native artists and elders, metal wizard Jeff De Boer, bike experts, and inmates from Drumheller Institution, who created her.

We acknowledge the teachings and words of Chief Arvol Looking Horse, 19th Generation Keeper of the White Buffalo Calf Maiden Bundle, and thank him for sharing Lakota stories with us.

About 2000 years ago, the Lakota people of the great plains were going through a time of starvation. A holy woman came to them, bringing a bundle with seven sacred teachings.

These teachings became the foundation of Lakota spiritual practice. The holy woman told the Lakota she would return in a time of great need, as a white buffalo.

White buffalo have been born every year since 1994.

SPIRIT OF WHITE BUFFALO in CULTURE CAMPS

Spirit of White Buffalo travels Turtle Island with a group of professional artists from many backgrounds and walks of life, sharing art practices from around the world with children, youth, and interested adults.   While sharing experiences and skills, the people of Spirit of White Buffalo grow by learning about the traditions and cultures of the communities they visit.

"My people will sleep for one hundred years, when they awake it will be the artists who give them their spirit back."
—Louis Riel

After leaving the Navy, Page completed a fellowship at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and in 2001 he received an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree from [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="Gidda1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lucas |first=Ryan |date=November 7, 2017 |title=Carter Page Tells House Intel Panel He Spoke To Sessions About Russia Contacts |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/07/562537269/inquiry-widens-following-disclosure-of-trump-aides-told-about-russia-contacts |page=Transcript, page 41 |work=NPR.org |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he began work as an investment banker with [[Merrill Lynch]] in the firm's [[London]] office, was a vice president in the company's Moscow office,&lt;ref name="Politico 23 September 2016" /&gt; and later served as [[Chief operating officer|COO]] for Merrill Lynch's energy and power department in New York.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post 8 July 2016" /&gt; Page has stated that he worked on transactions involving [[Gazprom]] and other leading Russian energy companies. According to business people interviewed by ''[[Politico]]'' in 2016, Page's work in Moscow was at a subordinate level, and he himself remained largely unknown to decision-makers.&lt;ref name="Politico 23 September 2016" /&gt;

After leaving Merrill Lynch in 2008, Page founded his own investment fund, Global Energy Capital, with partner James Richard and a former midlevel Gazprom executive, Sergei Yatsenko.&lt;ref name="Politico 23 September 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=58104064 |title=Capital Markets: Company Overview of Global Energy Capital LLC |date=2017 |publisher=Bloomberg News |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund operates out of a Manhattan [[Coworking|co-working space]] shared with a booking agency for wedding bands, and as of late 2017, Page was the firm's sole employee.&lt;ref name="nyt-what" /&gt; Other businesspeople working in the Russian energy sector said in 2016 that the fund had yet to actually realize a project.&lt;ref name="nyt-what" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico 23 September 2016" /&gt;

Page received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from [[SOAS, University of London]] in 2012, where he was supervised by [[Shirin Akiner]].&lt;ref name="nyt-what" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gidda1" /&gt; His doctoral dissertation on the transition of Asian countries from communism to capitalism was rejected twice before ultimately being accepted by new examiners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sabur |first=Rozina |date=December 22, 2017 |title=Carter Page, Donald Trump's former adviser, blamed British academics after two failed PhD attempts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/22/carter-page-donald-trumps-former-adviser-blamed-british-academics/ |work=The Telegraph |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his original examiners later said Page "knew next to nothing" about the subject matter and was unfamiliar with "basic concepts" such as [[Marxism]] and [[state capitalism]].&lt;ref name="phd-bias"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harding|first=Luke |date=December 22, 2017 |title=Ex-Trump adviser Carter Page accused academics who twice failed his PhD of bias |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/trump-carter-page-phd-thesis-trump |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought unsuccessfully to publish his dissertation as a book; a reviewer described it as "very analytically confused, just throwing a lot of stuff out there without any real kind of argument."&lt;ref name="nyt-what" /&gt; Page blamed the rejection on anti-Russian and anti-American bias.&lt;ref name="phd-bias" /&gt; He later ran an [[International relations|international affairs]] program at [[Bard College]] and taught a course on energy and politics at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=Shane |date=April 19, 2017 |title= Trump Adviser's Visit to Moscow Got the F.B.I.'s Attention |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/politics/carter-page-russia-trump.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-recruit/&gt; In more recent years, he has written columns in ''Global Policy Journal'', a publication of [[Durham University]].&lt;ref name="Politico 23 September 2016" /&gt;

===Foreign policy and ties to Russia===
In 1998, Page joined the [[Eurasia Group]], a strategy consulting firm, but left three months later.  In 2017, Eurasia Group president [[Ian Bremmer]] recalled on his [[Twitter]] feed that Page's strong pro-Russian stance was "not a good fit" for the firm and that Page was its "most wackadoodle" alumnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/14/carter-page-trump-adviser-pro-kremlin-views-1998-consulting-russia-ties |title=Former Trump adviser Carter Page held 'strong pro-Kremlin views', says ex-boss |author=Stephanie Kirchgaessner |author2=Spencer Ackerman |author3=Julian Borger |author4=Luke Harding |date=April 14, 2017 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Sestanovich]] later described Page's foreign-policy views as having "an edgy Putinist resentment" and a sympathy to Russian leader [[Vladimir Putin]]'s criticisms of the United States.&lt;ref name="nyt-what" /&gt; Over time, Page became increasingly critical of United States foreign policy toward Russia, and more supportive of Putin, with a United States official describing Page as "a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did".&lt;ref name="Yahoo!

In August 2013, Page wrote, "Over the past half year, I have had the privilege to serve as an informal advisor to the staff of the Kremlin in preparation for their Presidency of the G-20 Summit next month, where energy issues will be a prominent point on the agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5132126/carter-page-russia-2013-letter/|title=Carter Page Touted Kremlin Contacts in 2013 Letter|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page described his role differently in 2018: "I sat in on some meetings, but to call me an advisor is way over the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/22/politics/donald-trump-fisa-tweet/index.html|title=Carter Page says FISA warrant accusations 'so ridiculous' and 'misleading'|last=Tatum|first=Sophie|date=|work=CNN|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, [[Evgeny Buryakov|Russian intelligence operatives]] attempted to recruit Page, and one of them, Victor Podobnyy, described Page as enthusiastic about business opportunities in Russia but an "idiot".&lt;ref name="nyt-what" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-recruit"&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html | title = Russian Spies Tried to Recruit Carter Page Before He Advised Trump | date = April 4, 2017 | first = Adam | last = Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "I also promised him a lot," Podobnyy reported to a fellow Russian intelligence officer at the time, according to an FBI transcript of their conversation, which was covertly recorded.

===Trump 2016 presidential campaign===

Trump announced Page as a foreign policy adviser in his campaign on March 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/21/a-transcript-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/|title=Opinion - A transcript of Donald Trump’s meeting with The Washington Post editorial board|website=Washington Post|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2016, U.S. intelligence officials investigated [[Links between Trump associates and Russian officials|alleged contacts between Page and Russian officials subject to U.S. sanctions]], including [[Igor Sechin]], the president of state-run Russian oil conglomerate [[Rosneft]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo!

Shortly after Page resigned from the Trump campaign, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] obtained another warrant (he was subject to one beginning in 2014) from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) in October 2016 to surveil Page's communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Matthew|last1=Rosenberg|authorlink1=Matthew Rosenberg|first2=Matt|last2=Apuzzo|authorlink2=Matt Apuzzo|title=Court Approved Wiretap on Trump Campaign Aide Over Russia Ties|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/us/politics/carter-page-fisa-warrant-russia-trump.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 April 2017 |page=A13 |access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To issue the warrant, a federal judge concluded there was [[probable cause]] to believe that Page was a [[foreign agent]] knowingly engaging in clandestine intelligence for the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Beckwith |first1=Ryan Teague |last2=Abramson |first2=Alana |date=February 1, 2018 |title=Who Is Carter Page?

[[File:Eswgeneric-1.jpg|thumb|right|The Earth Science Week logo]]

'''Earth Sciences Week''' is a yearly event run by the [[American Geosciences Institute]] to promote the knowledge of Earth sciences at local, state, national, and international levels. It is typically held in the second week of October. The 2018 date is October 14-20. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthsciweek.org/about-esw&lt;/ref&gt;

The events are partially funded and sponsored by the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]], the [[National Park Service]], and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]. 

== Earth Science Week objectives ==
* To engage students in discovering the Earth sciences.
* To remind people that Earth science is all around us.
* To encourage Earth stewardship through understanding.
* To motivate geoscientists to share their knowledge and enthusiasm about the Earth.

== Web resources ==
The [http://www.earthsciweek.org Earth Science Week website] is updated regularly to reflect the new theme, contests, proclamations, events, and classroom activities for each year’s Earth Science Week.

== Events ==
The Earth Science Week website maintains a listing of groups in the Earth Science World Network, as well as a state-by-state listing of Earth Science Week events. These events are sponsored by member societies, state geological surveys, colleges and universities, public and private schools, museums,  parks, and other organizations and businesses with interests in Earth Science.

== Toolkits ==
Earth Science Week Toolkits feature AGI’s traditional event poster and school-year calendar showcasing geoscience careers, classroom investigations, and important dates of Earth science events. Also included are posters, flyers, electronic disks, bookmarks, and activities from AGI and its member societies and sponsors. Toolkits are distributed to state geological surveys, Earth Science Week sponsors and may be purchased through the ESW website.

== National contests ==
AGI has held national contests in connection with Earth Science Week for five consecutive years. The contests are designed to encourage K-12 students, teachers, and the general public to get involved in the celebration by exploring artistic and academic applications of Earth science. 

There are three mediums in which contests are held: Photography, Visual Arts, and Essay. Each contest explores a new theme every year; past themes have included "People Discovering Earth's Treasures" and "Extreme Earth Science" for Photography, "Changing Earth" and "Earth Science in Your Home Town" for Visual Arts, and "Be A Citizen Scientist" and "Studying the Active Earth" for Essays.

== Official proclamations ==
The [http://www.stategeologists.org/ Association of American State Geologists] adopted a resolution designating the second full week of October as Earth Science Week. In July, 1998, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) read a statement containing this resolution into the Congressional Record. In 2002, AASG passed a motion to reaffirm their support of Earth Science Week.

AGI currently works with each state geological survey to encourage proclamations to be made on the state and national level for each year's Earth Science Week. 

Seven states have issued perpetual proclamations: Alaska, Delaware, Illinois, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.
 
=== Presidential recognition ===
AGI has obtained Presidential proclamations for Earth Science Week in past years from Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

== Newsletters ==
Earth Science Week releases a monthly Update Newsletter to teacher, student, and geoscientist subscribers. This electronic newsletter keeps planners and participants up-to-date on Earth Science Week planning at the national level and encourages participation in local areas.

The '''Erasmus Prize''' is an annual prize awarded by the board of the [[Praemium Erasmianum Foundation]] to individuals or institutions that have made exceptional contributions to [[culture]], [[society]], or [[social science]] in [[Europe]] and the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="EP2015" /&gt; It  is one of Europe's most distinguished recognitions.&lt;ref name="wmfblog" /&gt; The prize is named after [[Desiderius Erasmus]], the Dutch Renaissance humanist.

==Prize and adornment==
{{As of|2015}}, the prize consists of €150,000&lt;ref name="EP2015" /&gt; and an adornment that was designed by [[Bruno Ninaber van Eyben]] in 1995. The adornment is a ribbon folded in the style of a [[harmonica]], with ends made of [[titanium]] plates. The ribbon bears a text in the handwriting of Erasmus taken from a letter to [[Jean Carondelet]] written on 5 January 1523. The text reads "variae sunt ingeniorum dotes multae seculorum varietates sunt. quod quisque potest in medium proferat nec alteri quisquam invideat qui pro sua virili suoque modo conatur publicis studiis utilitatis aliquid adiungere.", which translates as "Diverse are the gifts of men of genius and many are the different kinds of ages. Let each one reveal the scope of his competence and let no one be envious of another who in keeping with his own ability and style tries to make a useful contribution to the education of all."&lt;ref name="prize" /&gt;

==Ceremony==
The award ceremony typically takes place at the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]], where the prize is presented by the [[patron]] of the Foundation (King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]] {{as of|2015|lc=y}}). A wide range of academic and cultural activities are organised around the Erasmus Prize award ceremony, in cooperation with other academic and cultural organisations. These have included [[lecture]]s, [[Academic conference|conference]]s, [[workshop]]s, [[exhibition]]s, performances of dance, music and theatre, and other educational activities. An essay on the topic of the laureate and their work is also published.&lt;ref name="organisation" /&gt;

The prize was first awarded in 1958. {{As of|2015}} it has been awarded a total of 73 times in 53 years.&lt;ref name="EP2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EP-prev" /&gt; The area in which the Erasmus prize will be awarded is decided upon in advance by the Foundation's board. An advisory committee then consults with Dutch and foreign experts before proposing a laureate; the final choice of the laureate is then made by the Foundation's board.&lt;ref name="organisation" /&gt;

==Young researchers==
The Erasmus prize is not intended to stimulate young researchers.&lt;ref name="organisation" /&gt; However, the Praemium Erasmianum Foundation has awarded from 1988 yearly "studyprizes" for exceptionally high quality PHD studies on the field of [[humanities]] or [[social science]]s.

'''Escapade Music Festival''' is an annual [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) festival usually held on [[Canada Day]] (July 1) in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and hosts some of the biggest names in the electronic dance music industry.&lt;ref name="Escapade Music Festival"/&gt;

==History==
Escapade Music Festival made its debut in 2010 as a one day event in the Byward Market with Deadmau5 headlining it and a few hundred attendees.

In 2011, Escapade Music Festival grew in size to accommodate the growth of the festival, taking place in a large market parking space and featuring 3 Major headlining DJs,
Tiesto, Laidback Luke and Calvin Harris (Estimated 5000 in attendance).

In 2012, Escapade grew exponentially in size and scale to accommodate an estimated 15,000 people over 2 days (June 30 – July 1) at the Ottawa Baseball Stadium in East Ottawa, 
with 40+ DJs performing over 3 stages. Headliners included: Avicii, Afrojack, Excision, Aly &amp; Fila, Project 46, OVERWERK, Alesso, Tommy Trash, Dada Life, Marcus Schossow, 
Kill The Noise, Dillon Francis and Zeds Dead (Note: Chuckie could not make his flight on time to perform his set and ended up not performing).

In 2013, Escapade moved to the RA Centre Grounds in Central Ottawa and expanded to host an estimated 20,000+ attendees over 3 days in 2 locations (June 29 – June 30, 
RA Centre Grounds, July 1, Downtown in the Byward Market). This new location allowed for bigger production (Fireworks being the most notable as the RA Centre borders the Rideau River, thereby providing a safer place to launch them and expanded facilities across the festival grounds). 40+ DJs performed over 2 stages at the main event, plus several more on the 3rd, Canada Day stage in the market. Headliners included: Ferry Corsten, Steve Angello, Mark Knight, Krewella, Above &amp; Beyond, Markus Schulz, Ben Gold, [[3LAU]], Wolfgang Gartner, Benny Benassi, Candyland and Seven Lions (Notes: Bingo Players was to perform but because of Paul's bout with cancer, Project 46 was brought in as a last minute replacement. Hard Rock Sofa also didn't show due to Visa complications and Rusko failed to show due to illness, thereby allowing Krewella to play an extended set. Umek also arrived late for his set on the Tech Stage, thereby allowing Mark Knight to play later into his already extended set). Tiesto headlined the Canada stage downtown on July 1, along with Quintino and Alvaro.

In 2014, Escapade celebrated its 5th year anniversary at the Rideau Carleton Raceway in Southeast Ottawa. 
The festival expanded in size and attendance with 30,000+ attendees and expansion to a 4-day format (June 28 - June 29, Main Festival at R.C.R, June 30, Club Series, Multiple Downtown venues, July 1, Downtown in the Byward Market). This years rendition featured 40+ DJs performing over 3 stages at the main event, plus several more on the 4th, Canada Day stage in the market. Headliners included: Main Stage: Eric Prydz, [[Kaskade]], Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike, Fedde Le Grand, Nervo (Note: Chuckie failed to show for the 2nd time) On Day 1: "#Goldrush" stage (Trance): Andrew Rayel, Orjan Nilsen, Ben Gold, "The Deep End" stage (Deep House/Chill House): Lee Foss with Anabel Englund, [[The Martinez Brothers]]. On Day 2: "Tech Fusion Tent" stage (Tech House): Danny Tenaglia, Nicole Moudaber, "Temple of Bass" stage (Bass Music): Zeds Dead, Noisia, Zomboy (Note: [[Grandtheft]] also failed to show). Dada Life headlined the Canada stage downtown July 1, alongside Project 46 and GTA (Surprise guests Stafford Brothers showed up alongside Joe Ghost during his Canada stage set).

This year hosted a 4th extra day called the "Escapade Club Series" between the Main Festival and the Canada Day event at various Downtown Ottawa Nightclubs. Artists included Borgeous, The Stafford Brothers, Victor Calderone, Alvin Risk, Figure, and Simon Patterson.

The festival has been supported by such sponsors as: Hot 89.9 FM, Heineken, Jägermeister, Smirnoff, Smart Set, TD Bank, Casino Lac Leamy and Courtyard Marriott. Escapade Music Festival is a DNA Presents Production, 
a merger of two of Ottawa's biggest EDM event producers, [[Projekt Events]] and [[A-list Entertainment]], which hosted the 2010 and 2011 editions of the music festival.&lt;ref name="Escapade Music Festival"/&gt;

In 2018, the festival hosted many big names including: [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Zedd]], [[Fetty Wap]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Alesso]], [[Kaskade]], [[Rezz]], [[Carnage (DJ)]], [[Brohug]], [[Mac (rapper)|MAC]], [[Quintino]], [[Tchami]], [[Robotaki]], [[Sander Van Doorn]], [[Joe Ghost]], [[Ryan Shepherd]], [[Markus Schulz]], [[Zomboy]], [[Mark Knight]], [[Borgore]] and many others.

{{seealso|United Kingdom European Constitution referendum}}

The '''European Union Bill 2004–05''' (Bill 45) was a [[Bill (law)|bill]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]] which proposed to ratify the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] and to incorporate it into the domestic law of the United Kingdom and to amend the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] to include it in the list of Treaties and hold a [[United Kingdom European Constitution referendum|referendum]] throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Gibraltar]] on whether to approve the proposed Constitution which would be overseen by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]].

The bill was first introduced during the parliamentary session of 2004/05 and received a second reading. It fell at the end of that parliament. The bill was reintroduced in the new parliament and the 2005/06 session, however it was withdrawn after its first reading by [[Jack Straw]] on 6 June 2005 following "no" votes in referendums that were held on ratifying the European Constitution in  [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|France]] and in the [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |title=Debates |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050606/debtext/50606-05.htm#50606-05_head0 |house=House of Commons |date=6 June 2005 |column=991 |speaker=Jack Straw |position= Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the referendum had gone ahead it would have been the first UK-wide referendum to have been held since the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 European Communities membership referendum]] which at the time had been the only nationwide referendum to be held.. No date for the proposed referendum was ever set however the expectation was at the time that it would have been held sometime in the first six months of 2006 with the possibility that it could have been held on the same day as the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|2006 UK local elections]] which were scheduled and duly held on 4 May 2006.

==Proposed referendum question==
The bill gave the question to appear on ballot papers:
{{Quotation|
'''Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?'''
}}
and in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]:
{{Quotation|
'''A ddylai’r Deyrnas Unedig dderbyn y Cytuniad a fyddai’n sefydlu Cyfansoddiad i’r Undeb Ewropeaidd?'''
}}
permitting a simple '''YES'''/'''NO''' answer

The festival is primarily funded by the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[Scottish Government]].  It also involves partnerships with a variety of organisations including the [[University of Strathclyde]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|MRC]], [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery &amp; Museum]], the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RPSB]], [[Glasgow School of Art]], the [[British Science Association]], [[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]] and [[Glasgow Science Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Event Partners |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/events/sciencefestival/partners/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621093109/http://www.gla.ac.uk/events/sciencefestival/partners/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 June 2012 |publisher=Glasgow Science Festival |accessdate=16 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival director is Dr Deborah McNeill, a [[marine biologist]] and Head of Public Engagement in [[STEM fields|STEM]] at the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref name="University of Glasgow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Life Sciences - Dr Deborah McNeill - Staff Profile|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/lifesciences/staff/deborahmcneill/|publisher=University of Glasgow|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the festival was launched on a [[barge]] on the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]], chartered by The Clipperton Project and attended by Scottish Minister [[Alasdair Allan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Step aboard the Clipperton Project's floating lab on the Clyde|url=http://news.stv.tv/west-central/228108-the-clipperton-project-on-the-clyde-for-glasgow-science-festival/|newspaper=STV News|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science sets sail from Glasgow|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/06/Science-festival|newspaper=Scottish Government|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the festival was awarded a Herald Higher Education Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Community for gravitational waves-inspired show 'Chasing the Waves'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15395869.In_pictures__Glasgow_University_takes_main_prize_at_The_Herald_Higher_Education_Awards/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Other projects ==

Outside of the festival period in June, the festival delivers a range of public engagement projects that bring [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects to new audiences:

•  'A Shed Load of Science', funded by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], involved working with scientists and artists to deliver free arts-science activities for communities in the North of Glasgow, including [[Possilpark]] and [[Lambhill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Catriona|title=Chemistry workshops going off with a bang|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13525459.Chemistry_workshops_going_off_with_a_bang/|accessdate=20 January 2016|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•  'Cleaner Canal Science' was a collaboration with [[Scottish Canals]] and the [[Scottish Waterways Trust]], funded by Zero Waste Scotland. This project engaged primary schools, community groups and local businesses in hands-on science, as a means of tackling the problem of litter on canals in Maryhill, Firhill and Clydebank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scottish Waterways Trust|title=Maryhill Schoolchildren Become ‘Citizen Scientists’ for the Day to Tackle Litter on the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal|url=https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/news/maryhill-schoolchildren-become-citizen-scientists-for-the-day-to-tackle-litter-on-the-forth-clyde-canal/|website=Scottish Canals|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•  'CLAN' (Community Led Ambassador Network) was funded by a Scottish Government Talking Science grant and connected University of Glasgow researchers with communities in the top 0.5% most deprived in Scotland, through free community-led public engagement activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLAN: Community Led Ambassadors Network  (Scottish Government Talking Science Award for 2013-14)|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/publicengagementgroupinstemm/clan/|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•  'Panto Science: The Periodic Fable' is a theatre show which blends pantomime with science. The idea was conceived by Dr Zara Gladman, Public Engagement Co-ordinator for Glasgow Science Festival,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow Science Festival: Meet the Team|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/events/sciencefestival/aboutus/meettheteam/|website=University of Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was developed by Dr Gladman with University of Glasgow researchers and comedian Bruce Morton, who wrote the script for a live show. The show aims to promote the message of gender equality in STEM to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Panto Science|url=http://www.pantoscience.co.uk/?page_id=7|website=Panto Science|title=Panto Science|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•  'Chasing the Waves' was a live, musical show co-written by Dr Zara Gladman and Emily Benita which shared the story of how Glasgow scientists helped detect gravitational waves. The show was the first of its kind to bring gravitational waves to the theatre. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gla.ac.uk/events/sciencefestival/eventsandprojects/projects/chasingthewaves/&lt;/ref&gt;

North America was one of the focal points of the global, [[Great Recession]]. While Canada has managed to return its economy nearly to the levels it enjoyed prior to the recession,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conferenceboard.ca/reports/cmaag/2010/cmaag082010.aspx Canada's Economy Takes a Break]&lt;/ref&gt; the United States and Mexico are still under the influence of the worldwide economic slowdown. The cost of staple items dropped dramatically in the United States as a result of the recession.

===Canada===
Canada was one of the last industrialized nations to enter into a downturn.  GDP growth was negative in Q1, but positive in Q2 and Q3 of 2008.  The recession officially started in Q4. The almost 1-year delay of the start of the recession in Canada relative to the U.S. is largely explained by two factors.  First, Canada has a strong banking sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081009/canadian_banks_081009/20081009?hub=TopStories|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011224312/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081009/canadian_banks_081009/20081009?hub=TopStories|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-11|title=Canadian banks are the soundest in the world: report|accessdate=2008-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not weighed-down by the same degree of consumer-related debt issues that existed in the United States.&lt;ref name=RBC&gt;[http://www.rbc.com/investorrelations/pdf/presentation04292008.pdf RBC 2008 Investor Day], [[Royal Bank of Canada]], URL accessed 28 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States economy collapsed from within, while the Canadian economy was being hurt by its trade relationship with the United States.  Second, commodity prices continued to rise through to June 2008, supporting a key component of the Canadian economy and delaying the start of recession. In early December 2008, the [[Bank of Canada]], in announcing that it was lowering its central bank interest rate to the lowest level since 1958, also declared that Canada's economy was entering in recession.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5ia5C99Ii_uqnHOU7Jladal5X55qA |title=Canada 'entering a recession,' central bank slashes key rate to 1.5 per cent |publisher=The Canadian Press |location=OTTAWA |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2009-01-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217012645/https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5ia5C99Ii_uqnHOU7Jladal5X55qA| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bank of Canada has since announced that it has two consecutive months of GDP decline (Oct -0.1% &amp; Nov -0.7%). The country's unemployment rate could rise to 7.5% in the next two years, according to the latest [[OECD]] report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081125/recession_economy_081125/20081125?hub=TopStories Canada's jobless rate could hit 7.5 per cent: OECD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203025544/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081125/recession_economy_081125/20081125?hub=TopStories |date=2008-12-03 }}, CTV.ca, November 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, 2009, the Bank of Canada officially declared the recession to be over in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/670645 Bank declares recession over, The Toronto Star, July 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the true economic recovery did not begin until November 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.ca.msn.com/investing/news/business-news/article.aspx?cp-documentid=22757932 Gross domestic product sees first gain in a year this quarter]&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian economy would expand at an annualized rate of 6.1% in the first quarter (January–April) of 2010, surpassing analyst expectations and marking the best growth rate since 1999.&lt;ref name="canbestecononomy10years"/&gt; Economists had expected annualized GDP growth of 5.9% in the last quarter, up from 5% in last year's fourth quarter (September–December 2009).&lt;ref name="canbestecononomy10years"/&gt; The growth in the first quarter is the third straight quarter of economic expansion in Canada, coming on the heels of three consecutive quarters of contraction.&lt;ref name="canbestecononomy10years"/&gt; March growth came in at 0.6%, ahead of the 0.5% estimate.&lt;ref name="canbestecononomy10years"&gt;[http://baystreet.money.ca.msn.com/quotedata/partners/msn/ca/the_economy.aspx Canadian economic growth best in 10 years - May 31, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529180821/http://baystreet.money.ca.msn.com/quotedata/partners/msn/ca/the_economy.aspx |date=May 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 215,900 new jobs have been created in the winter and early spring months of 2010 alone - in the traditional period of time where the Canadian economy is at its most stagnant.

===Mexico===
Despite the solid financial system of Mexico, the effects of the financial crisis originated in the United States impacted Mexico's export sector by a significant amount considering that 85% of the country's exports go to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usembassy-mexico.gov/eng/eataglance_trade.html US Embassy data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512224742/http://usembassy-mexico.gov/eng/eataglance_trade.html |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced demand, the highest unemployment rate in almost a decade and the depreciation of the Mexican peso caused analysts to revise growth estimates officially from 1.8% to somewhere closer to 0% for 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elisabeth Malkin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/business/worldbusiness/30peso.html?_r=1&amp;ref=worldbusiness&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Mexico's Prudence Fails to Avert a Slowdown |location=Mexico; United States |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=New |first=The |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/nationworld/stories/123008dnintmexico.3e9839c.html |title=Recession is spreading from U.S. to Mexico's economy |work=Dallas Morning News |date=December 29, 2008 |agency=The New York Times |location= |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recession did not show up until 2009, but the recession already slowed down in 2008. The country had a positive growth of 1.5% in 2008 compared to a 3.3% in 2007, by 2009 the economy had shrunk by 6.5%, a percentage bigger than that of the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|1994-1995 crisis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html CIA Factbook Data]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the largest in almost eight decades and registering an inflation of 3.57%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banxico.org.mx/informacion-para-la-prensa/comunicados/inflacion/mensual/%7B36697BC5-386D-BD1D-25C5-538C090383C7%7D.pdf Bank of Mexico official data '{{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic recovery from the historic downturn started in the late 2009 with exports rising 22.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mexidata.info/id2544.html abstract of Mexico's recovery]&lt;/ref&gt; The economic prospects for 2010 in the early 2009 were of a positive growth of 3.5 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/482572.html Bank of Mexico {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and some saw a steady recovery by the second quarter of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.finetik.com/2010/04/02/mexico-economic-recovery-slowly-materializing-%E2%80%93-april-2010-ixe-banif-monthly-analysis/ Ixe-Banif monthly analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2010, the OECD revealed an estimated growth of 4.5 percent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/714569.html OECD, 22 0ct 2010 {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  while the Mexican government estimated a growth of over 5 percent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milenio.com/node/616842 Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit estimate {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the creation of 730 thousand jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;id_nota=701210 National Institute of Statistic and Geography official data {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated growth for 2011 range from 3.9 to 4.8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2011/262991/6/banamex-eleva-estimacion-de-crecimiento-economico-de-mexico.htm National Bank of Mexico (Banamex-Citi Group) estimate {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the sustained growth in 2010, it was not enough to cover up the loss of 2009.

==South America==
{{main|Great Recession in South America}}
As it mainly consists of commodity exporters, South America was not directly affected by the financial turmoil, even if the bond markets of Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela have been hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/business/newsid_6922000/6922832.stm |title= "Subprime": lejos de A. Latina |publisher= BBC Mundo|language= spanish| date= August 1, 2007 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the continent experienced a tough [[2008 global rice shortage|agricultural crisis]] at the beginning of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/prensa/noticias/comunicados/0/34740/P34740.xml&amp;xsl=/prensa/tpl-i/p6f.xsl&amp;base=/tpl-i/top-bottom.xsl Poverty Declines Slightly in Latin America and the Caribbean, in Spite of Global Financial Crisis], ECLAC Notes Nº 59 (9 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Food prices have increased a lot, due to a lack of arable land. One of the main reasons for the loss of agricultural land was the high value offered by the production of [[biofuels]]. Food prices, rising since 2002, ascended from 2006, reaching a peak during the first quarter of 2008. In one year the average price of food rose by about 50%.

Then South American countries were affected by both the global slowdown and the decrease in food prices due to the declining demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.eclac.org/prensa/noticias/notas/3/34963/Notes59ENGFinal.pdf |title= Latin America risks reverting progress in poverty reduction / Global financial crisis will affect region's trade with the rest of the world| publisher = ECLAC |date=December 2008| accessdate= 6 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC) declared it expected a 4% growth for 2009.

According to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), forced labour alone (one component of human trafficking) generates an estimated $150 billion in profits per annum as of 2014.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour|title=Profits and poverty: The economics of forced labour|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---declaration/documents/publication/wcms_243027.pdf|website=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 October 2016|page=4|format=PDF|date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the ILO estimated that 21 million victims are trapped in modern-day slavery.

Statistics shows that over half of the world’s 215 million young workers are observed to be in hazardous sectors, including forced sex work and forced street begging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/@publ/documents/publication/wcms_155428.pdf '' International Labor Organization.

Human trafficking is thought to be one of the fastest-growing activities of trans-national criminal organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Shelley|title=Human Trafficking: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XY8uJoYkNBsC|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-1-139-48977-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XY8uJoYkNBsC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human trafficking is condemned as a violation of human rights by international conventions. In addition, human trafficking is subject to a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DIRECTIVE 2011/36/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH  |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF |format=PDF |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the U.S. State Department, [[Belarus]], [[Iran]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkmenistan]] remain among the worst countries when it comes to providing protection against human trafficking and forced labour. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/the-worst-countries-for-human-trafficking/29327857.html|title=The Worst Countries For Human Trafficking|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Although human trafficking can occur at local or domestic levels, it has international implications, as recognized by the [[United Nations]] in the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the ''Trafficking Protocol'' or the ''Palermo Protocol''), an international agreement under the UN [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (CTOC) which entered into force on 25 December 2003.  The protocol is one of three which supplement the CTOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html |title=Convention on Transnational Organized Crime |publisher=Unodc.org |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Trafficking Protocol'' is the first global, legally binding instrument on trafficking in over half a century, and the only one with an agreed-upon definition of trafficking in persons.  One of its purposes is to facilitate international cooperation in investigating and prosecuting such trafficking.  Another is to protect and assist human trafficking's victims with full respect for their rights as established in the [[UDHR|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  The ''Trafficking Protocol'', which had 117 signatories and as of November, 2018 173 parties,&lt;ref name="treaties.un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-12-a&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en%7ctitle=UNTC%7cwork=un.org%7ctitle=UNTC%7cwork=un.org|title=UNTC|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines human trafficking as:
{{quote|(a) [...] the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having [[Abusive power and control|control]] over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the [[prostitution]] of others or other forms of [[sexual exploitation]], [[unfree labour|forced labour]] or services, [[slavery]] or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the [[Organ harvesting|removal, manipulation or implantation of organs]];&lt;br /&gt;
(b) The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in sub-paragraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used;&lt;br /&gt;
(c) The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered "trafficking in persons" even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in sub-paragraph (a) of this article;&lt;br /&gt;
(d) "Child" shall mean any person under eighteen years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf |title=United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime And The Protocols Thereto |format=PDF |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Revenue==


In 2014, the [[International Labour Organization]] estimated $150 billion in annual profit is generated from forced labour alone.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The average cost of a human trafficking victim today is USD $90 whereas the average slave in 1800 America cost the equivalent of USD $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Slaves|url=http://www.freetheslaves.net/about-slavery/slavery-today/|publisher=Free The Slaves|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term==

Human trafficking differs from [[people smuggling]], which involves a person voluntarily requesting or hiring another individual to covertly transport them across an international border, usually because the smuggled person would be denied entry into a country by legal channels. Though illegal, there may be no deception or coercion involved.  After entry into the country and arrival at their ultimate destination, the smuggled person is usually free to find their own way. According to the [[International Centre for Migration Policy Development]] (ICMPD), people smuggling is a violation of national immigration laws of the destination country, and does not require violations of the rights of the smuggled person. Human trafficking, on the other hand, is a crime against a person because of the violation of the victim's rights through coercion and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-trafficking.net/differencebetweensmugglingand.html |title=Difference between Smuggling and Trafficking |publisher=Anti-trafficking.net |accessdate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221065500/http://www.anti-trafficking.net/differencebetweensmugglingand.html |archivedate=21 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While smuggling requires travel, trafficking does not. Trafficked people are held against their will through acts of coercion, and forced to work for or provide services to the trafficker or others. The work or services may include anything from bonded or forced labour to commercial sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="Unodcvhhhorg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty.org.au"/&gt; The arrangement may be structured as a work contract, but with no or low payment, or on terms which are highly exploitative.  Sometimes the arrangement is structured as [[debt bondage]], with the victim not being permitted or able to pay off the debt.

'''[[Bonded labor|Bonded labour]]''', or [[debt bondage]], is probably the least known form of labour trafficking today, and yet is the most widely used method of enslaving people.  Victims become "bonded" when their labour, the labour which they themselves hired and the tangible goods they have bought are demanded as a means of repayment for a loan or service whose terms and conditions have not been defined, or where the value of the victims' services is not applied toward the liquidation of the debt. Generally, the value of their work is greater than the original sum of money "borrowed".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/trafficking/about/fact_labor.pdf|format=PDF|title=Labor trafficking fact sheet|work=National Human Trafficking Resource Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527205216/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/trafficking/about/fact_labor.pdf|archivedate=27 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Forced labor|Forced labour]]''' is a situation in which victims are forced to work against their own will under the threat of violence or some other form of punishment; their freedom is restricted and a degree of ownership is exerted. Men are at risk of being trafficked for unskilled work, which globally generates 31 billion USD according to the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;"A global alliance against forced labour", ILO, 11 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forms of forced labour can include domestic servitude, agricultural labour, [[sweatshop|sweatshop factory laboir]], janitorial, food service and other service industry labour, and begging.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Some of the products that can be produced by forced labour are: clothing, cocoa, bricks, coffee, cotton, and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Ryan|title=13 Products Most Likely to Be Made By Child or Forced Labor|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/18/child-labor-products_n_798601.html#s210960title=13_Carpets|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 October 2013|date=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM), the single largest global provider of services to victims of trafficking, reports receiving an increasing number of cases in which victims were subjected to forced labour. A 2012 study observes that "… 2010 was particularly notable as the first year in which IOM assisted more victims of labour trafficking than those who had been trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iom.int/files/live/sites/iom/files/What-We-Do/docs/Annual_Report_2011_Counter_Trafficking.pdf|format=PDF|title=Counter-Trafficking and Assistance to Vulnerable Migrants, Annual Report of activities 2011|location=Geneva|work=International Organization for Migration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOMs' main focus is "to provide secure, reliable, flexible and cost-effective serviced for persons who require international migration assistance. To enhance the humane and orderly management of migration and the effective respect for the human rights of migrations in accordance with international law. To offer advice, research, technical cooperation and operational assistance to States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders, in order to build national capacities and facilitate international, regional and bilateral cooperation on migration matters..." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/mission|title=Mission|date=2014-07-08|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Child labour]]''' is a form of work that may be hazardous to the physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development of children and can interfere with their education. According to the International Labour Organization, the global number of children involved in child labour has fallen during the past decade{{snd}} it has declined by one third, from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million children in 2012.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/child-labour/lang--en/index.htm#a2|title=Child Labour|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest incidence of child labour, while the largest numbers of child-workers are found in Asia and the Pacific.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The [[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) has further assisted many [[non-governmental organizations]] in their fight against human trafficking. The 2006 armed conflict in [[Lebanon]], which saw 300,000 domestic workers from [[Sri Lanka]], [[Ethiopia]] and the [[Philippines]] jobless and targets of traffickers, led to an emergency information campaign with NGO Caritas Migrant to raise human-trafficking awareness. Additionally, an April 2006 report, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, helped to identify 127 countries of origin, 98 transit countries and 137 destination countries for human trafficking. To date, it is the second most frequently downloaded UNODC report. Continuing into 2007, UNODC supported initiatives like the Community Vigilance project along the border between [[India]] and [[Nepal]], as well as provided subsidy for NGO trafficking prevention campaigns in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/prevention.html?ref=menuside |title=Preventing Human Trafficking |publisher=Unodc.org |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]] (UN.GIFT) was conceived to promote the global fight on human trafficking, on the basis of international agreements reached at the UN. UN.GIFT was launched in March 2007 by UNODC with a grant made on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. It is managed in cooperation with the International Labour Organization (ILO); the International Organization for Migration (IOM); the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF); the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).


UNODC efforts to motivate action launched the [[Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking]] on 6 March 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/what-is-human-trafficking.html?ref=menuside#UNODC%27s_Response |title=What is human-trafficking |publisher=Unodc.org |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Mexico launched its own national version of in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/blueheart/en/mexico_campaign.html |title=Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking – Mexico Campaign |publisher=Unodc.org |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/unodc#p/u/2/VgBgbKcUGyw |title=Kanaal van UNODCHQ |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign encourages people to show solidarity with human trafficking victims by wearing the blue heart, similar to how wearing the red ribbon promotes transnational [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2010, U.N. [[Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] launched the [[United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons]] to provide [[humanitarian]], legal and financial aid to victims of human trafficking with the aim of increasing the number of those rescued and supported, and broadening the extent of assistance they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2010/November/demi-moore-and-ashton-kutcher-join-secretary-general-to-launch-trust-fund-for-victims-of-human-trafficking.html?ref=fs1 |title=Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher join Secretary-General to launch Trust Fund for victims of human trafficking |publisher=Unodc.org |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, UNODC published the new edition of the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/data-and-analysis/glotip.html?ref=menuside |title=Global report on trafficking in persons |publisher=Unodc.org |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2012 has revealed that 27 per cent of all victims of human trafficking officially detected globally between 2007 and 2010 are children, up 7 per cent from the period 2003 to 2006.

The Global Report recorded victims of 136 different nationalities detected in 118 countries between 2007 and 2010, during which period, 460 different flows were identified.  Around half of all trafficking took place within the same region with 27 per cent occurring within national borders.  One exception is the Middle East, where most detected victims are East and South Asians. Trafficking victims from East Asia have been detected in more than 60 countries, making them the most geographically dispersed group around the world. There are significant regional differences in the detected forms of exploitation. Countries in Africa and in Asia generally intercept more cases of trafficking for forced labour, while sexual exploitation is somewhat more frequently found in Europe and in the Americas. Additionally, trafficking for organ removal was detected in 16 countries around the world.The Report raises concerns about low conviction rates{{snd}} 16 per cent of reporting countries did not record a single conviction for trafficking in persons between 2007 and 2010. As of February 2018, 173 countries have ratified the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol, of which UNODC is the guardian.&lt;ref name="treaties.un.org"/&gt; Significant progress has been made in terms of legislation: as of 2012, 83 per cent of countries had a law criminalizing trafficking in persons in accordance with the Protocol.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2012/December/increase-in-global-child-trafficking-gives-cause-for-concern-says-new-unodc-report.html?ref=menuside |title=Global report on trafficking in persons |publisher=Unodc.org |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Derek Ellerman]] and [[Katherine Chon]] founded a [[non-government organization]] called [[Polaris Project]] to combat human trafficking. In 2007, Polaris instituted the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) where&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarisproject.org/index.php |title=Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery |publisher=Polaris Project |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; callers can report tips and receive information on human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarisproject.org/what-we-do/national-human-trafficking-hotline/the-nhtrc/overview |title=National Human Trafficking Resource Center &amp;#124; Polaris Project &amp;#124; Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery |publisher=Polaris Project |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polaris' website and hotline informs the public about where cases of suspected human trafficking have occurred within the United States. The website records calls on a map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarisproject.org/state-map |title=State Map &amp;#124; Polaris Project &amp;#124; Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery |publisher=Polaris Project |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the U.S. Senate designated 11 January as a National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness in an effort to raise consciousness about this global, national and local issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Holly Austin|title=Walking Prey: How America's Youth Are Vulnerable to Sex Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqGfAgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-137-43769-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aqGfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 16]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, President Barack Obama proclaimed January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/12/31/presidential-proclamation-national-slavery-and-human-trafficking-prevent|title=Presidential Proclamation – National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, The White House.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these initiatives libraries across the United States are beginning to contribute to human trafficking awareness. Slowly, libraries are turning into educational centers for those who are not aware of this issue. They are collaborating with other organizations to train staff members to spot human trafficking victims and find ways to help them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Library-Staff-Trained-to-Identify-Sex-Trafficking-Victims-366243441.html|title=Library Staff Trained to ID Sex Trafficking Victims|website=NBC 7 San Diego|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[DARPA]] funded the [[Memex#DARPA's Memex program|Memex]] program with the explicit goal of combating human trafficking via domain-specific search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Memex.aspx|title=Memex|publisher=DARPA|accessdate=20 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423174856/http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Memex.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advanced search capacity, including its ability to reach into the [[dark web]] has already allowed for prosecution of human trafficking cases, although they can be difficult to prosecute due to the fraudulent tactics of the human traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-traffickers-caught-on-hidden-internet/|title=Human Traffickers Caught on Hidden Internet|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its size and the access to its large airport, Atlanta, Georgia is known as the core of trafficking in the United States. A 2014 study by [[Urban Institute]] showed that some traffickers, or "pimps", in Atlanta grossed over $32,000 in one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Estimating the Size and Structure of the Underground Commercial Sex Economy in Eight Major US Cities|url = http://www.urban.org/research/publication/estimating-size-and-structure-underground-commercial-sex-economy-eight-major-us-cities/view/full_report|website = www.urban.org|access-date = 10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline received reports of more than 5,000 potential human trafficking cases in the U.S. Children comprise up to one-third of all victims, while women make up more than half. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/health-fitness/article206847674.html|title=Human trafficking, modern-day slavery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Human trafficking is a big business and it is a major problem in South Florida and one of the hotspots of this crime is on Miami Beach. Police in the city say they arrested 3 dozen suspected human traffickers in 2017. That’s believed to be the most in the South Florida area and investigators say in addition to focusing on arresting traffickers they’re focusing on providing help to victims. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/05/02/miami-beach-human-trafficking/|title=Miami Beach Police Focused On Combating Human Trafficking|date=2 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Europe===
On 3 May 2005, the Committee of Ministers adopted the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] (CETS No. 197).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/197.htm |title=Council of Europe – Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CETS No. 197) |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention was opened for signature in [[Warsaw]] on 16 May 2005 on the occasion of the 3rd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe. On 24 October 2007, the Convention received its tenth ratification thereby triggering the process whereby it entered into force on 1 February 2008. As of June 2017, the Convention has been ratified by 47 states (including Belarus, a non-Council of Europe state), with Russia being the only state to not have ratified (nor signed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197/signatures?p_auth=Gn9RcCwG|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While other international instruments already exist in this field, the Council of Europe Convention, the first European treaty in this field, is a comprehensive treaty focusing mainly on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights. It also aims to prevent trafficking and to prosecute traffickers. In addition, the Convention provides for the setting up of an effective and independent monitoring mechanism capable of controlling the implementation of the obligations contained in the Convention.

The Convention is not restricted to Council of Europe member states; non-member states and the European Union also have the possibility of becoming Party to the Convention. In 2013 [[Belarus]] became the first non-Council of Europe member state to accede to the Convention.&lt;ref name="conventions.coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=197&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=24/10/2005&amp;CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/default_en.asp|title=Action against Trafficking in Human Beings|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention established a Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) which monitors the implementation of the Convention through country reports. As of 1 March 2013, GRETA has published 17 country reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/Docs/Publications/default_en.asp |title=Council of Europe – Action against Trafficking in Human Beings: Publications |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementary protection against [[sex trafficking]] of children is ensured through the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] (signed in [[Lanzarote]], 25 October 2007). The Convention entered into force on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=201&amp;CM=1&amp;CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, the Convention has been ratified by 44 states, with another 3 states having signed but not yet ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201/signatures|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] of the Council of Europe in [[Strasbourg]] has passed judgments concerning trafficking in human beings which violated obligations under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]: Siliadin v. France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=siliadin&amp;sessionid=87516515&amp;skin=hudoc-en |title=Council of Europe – European Court of Human Rights |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; judgment of 26 July 2005, and Rantsev v.

===Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe===
{{Main|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe}}

In 2003, the OSCE established an anti-trafficking mechanism aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within participating states to tackle it effectively.

The OSCE actions against human trafficking are coordinated by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe#Human dimension (third dimension)|Office of the Special Representative for Combating the Traffic of Human Beings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/cthb |title=Combating Trafficking in Human Beings – Secretariat – Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings |publisher=Osce.org |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2010, [[Maria Grazia Giammarinaro]] became the OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. Dr. Giammarinaro (Italy) has been a judge at the Criminal Court of Rome since 1991. She served from 2006 until 2009 in the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security in Brussels, where she was responsible for work to combat human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, as well as for penal aspects of [[illegal immigration]] within the unit dealing with the fight against organized crime. During this time, she co-ordinated the Group of Experts on Trafficking in Human Beings of the European Commission. From 2001 to 2006 she was a judge for preliminary investigation in the Criminal Court of Rome. Prior to that, from 1996 she was Head of the Legislative Office and Adviser to the Minister for Equal Opportunities. From 2006 to December 2009 the office was headed by [[Eva Biaudet]], a former Member of Parliament and Minister of Health and Social Services in her native Finland.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The activities of the Office of the Special Representative range from training law enforcement agencies to tackle human trafficking to promoting policies aimed at rooting out corruption and organised crime. The Special Representative also visits countries and can, on their request, support the formation and implementation of their anti-trafficking policies. In other cases the Special Representative provides advice regarding implementation of the decisions on human trafficking, and assists governments, ministers and officials to achieve their stated goals of tackling human trafficking.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===India Anti Human Trafficking Portal===
In India, the trafficking in persons for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced marriages and domestic servitude is considered an organized crime. The Government of India applies the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013, active from 3 February 2013, as well as Section 370 and 370A IPC, which defines human trafficking and "provides stringent punishment for human trafficking; trafficking of children for exploitation in any form including physical exploitation; or any form of sexual exploitation, slavery, servitude or the forced removal of organs." Additionally, a Regional Task Force implements the SAARC Convention on the prevention of Trafficking in Women and Children.&lt;ref name="Port"&gt;{{cite web|title=Launching of Web Portal on Anti Human Trafficking|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=104002|website=Print Release Print Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=15 December 2014|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shri R.P.N. Singh, India's Minister of State for Home Affairs, launched a government web portal, the Anti Human Trafficking Portal, on 20 February 2014. The official statement explained that the objective of the on-line resource is for the "sharing of information across all stakeholders, States/UTs[&lt;nowiki /&gt;[[Union Territories]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;] and civil society organizations for effective implementation of Anti Human Trafficking measures."&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt; The key aims of the portal are:

* Aid in the tracking of cases with inter-state ramifications.
* Provide comprehensive information on legislation, statistics, court judgements, United Nations Conventions, details of trafficked people and traffickers and rescue success stories.
* Provide connection to "Trackchild", the National Portal on Missing Children that is operational in many states.&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt;

Also on 20 February, the Indian government announced the implementation of a Comprehensive Scheme that involves the establishment of Integrated Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in 335 vulnerable police districts throughout India, as well as capacity building that includes training for police, prosecutors and judiciary. As of the announcement, 225 Integrated AHTUs had been made operational, while 100 more AHTUs were proposed for the forthcoming financial year.&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt;

===The Anti-trafficking Policy Index===
The '3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index' measured the effectiveness of government policies to fight human trafficking based on an evaluation of policy requirements prescribed by the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Seo-Young, Axel Dreher, and Eric Neumayer. "The Spread of Anti-trafficking Policies-Evidence from a New Index." Available at SSRN 1776842 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy level was evaluated using a five-point scale, where a score of five indicates the best policy practice, while score 1 is the worst. This scale was used to analyze the main three anti-trafficking policy areas: (i) prosecuting (criminalizing) traffickers, (ii) protecting victims, and (iii) preventing the crime of human trafficking. Each sub-index of prosecution, protection and prevention was aggregated to the overall index with an unweighted sum, with the overall index ranging from a score of 3 (worst) to 15 (best). It is available for up to 177 countries annually for 2000 to 2015 (the 2015 report, published in 2016, is the last as of 26.11.2018).

In 2015, three countries demonstrated the highest possible rankings in policies for all three dimensions (overall score 15). These countries were Austria, Spain and the United Kingdom. There were four countries with a near perfect score of 14 (Belgium, Philippines, Armenia, and South Korea). Four more scored 13 points, including the USA. The worst score, the minimum possible, is 3. In addition to North Korea, Libya, Syria, Eritrea and the BES Islands scored 3 with both Iran and Russia scoring only 4 (along with Kiribati, Yemen, and Equatorial Guinea).

===Religious declaration===
In 2014, for the first time in history major leaders of many religions, Buddhist, Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim&lt;!--alphabetical--&gt;, met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6256640|title=Pope Francis And Other Religious Leaders Sign Declaration Against Modern Slavery|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signatories were: [[Pope Francis]], [[Mata Amritanandamayi|Mātā Amṛtānandamayī]] (also known as Amma), Bhikkhuni Thich Nu [[Chân Không]] (representing Zen Master [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]), Datuk K Sri Dhammaratana, Chief High Priest of Malaysia, Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]], Rabbi David Rosen, Abbas Abdalla Abbas Soliman, Undersecretary of State of Al Azhar Alsharif (representing Mohamed Ahmed El-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar), Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi, Sheikh Naziyah Razzaq Jaafar, Special advisor of Grand Ayatollah (representing Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Basheer Hussain al Najafi), Sheikh Omar Abboud, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Metropolitan Emmanuel of France (representing Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.)&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;

===Anti-trafficking initiatives===
[[File:CBP, DOT, AND MAJOR AIRLINES TO ANNOUNCE IMPLEMENTATION OF PARTNERSHIPS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING (8970602236).jpg|thumb|The Blue Campaign collaborates with law enforcement, government, non-governmental, and private organizations to end human trafficking and protect victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign|title=Blue Campaign {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One of the organizations taking the most active part in the anti-trafficking is the United Nations. In early 2016 the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the United Nations held an interactive discussion entitled "Responding to Current Challenges in Trafficking in Human Beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Responding to current challenges in trafficking in human beings’ discussion in New York|url=http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2869222|website=inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the current efforts being done to combat human trafficking is an app called TraffickCam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://traffickcam.com/about|title=TraffickCam {{!}} About|website=traffickcam.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This app was created by the Exchange Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exchangeinitiative.com/|title=Exchange Initiative {{!}} Real Resources to End Trafficking|website=www.exchangeinitiative.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers at Washington University. TraffckCam was launched on June 20, 2016 and enables anyone to take photos of their hotel rooms, which then gets uploaded to a large database of hotel images. Since human trafficking victims are often found in hotel rooms for online advertisements, law enforcement and investigators can use these photos to help find and prosecute traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/07/01/how-simply-snapping-a-photo-of-your-hotel-room-could-save-trafficked-children/|title=An incredibly simple way your phone may help save sex trafficked children|last=Itkowitz|first=Colby|date=2016-07-01|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-18|last2=Itkowitz|first2=Colby|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-trafficking awareness and fundraising campaigns constitute a significant portion of anti-trafficking initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://combathumantrafficking.org/2017/02/the-importance-of-responsible-public-awareness-campaigns-for-human-trafficking/|title=Responsible Public Awareness Campaigns for Human Trafficking|date=2017-02-13|work=Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 24 Hour Race is one such initiative that focuses on increasing awareness among high school students in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.24hourrace.org/|title=Home|website=24 Hour Race|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Campaign is another anti-trafficking initiative that works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to combat human trafficking and bring freedom to exploited victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/about-blue-campaign|title=About the Blue Campaign {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vulnerable groups ===
''Trafficking in Persons Report'' released in June 2016 states that "refugees and migrants; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals; religious minorities; people with disabilities; and those who are stateless" are the most at-risk for human trafficking. Governments best protect victims from being exploited when the needs of vulnerable populations are understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2016/index.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2016|website=www.state.gov|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in its [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children]], the United Nations notes that women and children are particularly at risk for human trafficking and [[revictimization]]. The Protocol requires State Parties not only to enact measures that prevent human trafficking but also to address the factors that exacerbate women and children's vulnerability, including "poverty, underdevelopment and lack of equal opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/ProtocolTraffickingInPersons.aspx|title=OHCHR Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trafficking of children]] involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of children for the purpose of exploitation.

IOM statistics indicate that a significant minority (35%) of trafficked persons it assisted in 2011 were less than 18 years of age, which is roughly consistent with estimates from previous years. It was reported in 2010 that [[Thailand]] and [[Brazil]] were considered to have the worst child sex trafficking records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libertadlatina.org/LA_Brazils_Child_Prostitution_Crisis.htm |title=LatAm – Brazil – Child Prostitution Crisis |publisher=Libertadlatina.org |accessdate=22 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603204047/http://www.libertadlatina.org/LA_Brazils_Child_Prostitution_Crisis.htm |archivedate=3 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffickers in children may take advantage of the parents' extreme poverty. Parents may sell children to traffickers in order to pay off debts or gain income, or they may be deceived concerning the prospects of training and a better life for their children. They may sell their children into labour, sex trafficking, or illegal adoptions.

The adoption process, legal and illegal, when abused can sometimes result in cases of trafficking of babies and pregnant women from developing countries to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-technology/china-sets-up-website-to-recover-trafficked-children-report-20091028-hj9w.html |title=The Age: China sets up website to recover trafficked children: report |publisher=News.theage.com.au |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=22 March 2011 |location=Melbourne |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427175539/http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-technology/china-sets-up-website-to-recover-trafficked-children-report-20091028-hj9w.html |archivedate=27 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[David M.

===Sex trafficking===
{{Main|Sex trafficking}}
[[File:USFK Prostitution Warning.jpg|thumb|Warning of [[Prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military|Prostitution and Human trafficking in South Korea for G.I.]] by United States Forces Korea.]]

The [[International Labour Organization]] claims that sex trafficking affects 4.5 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm|title=Forced labour, human trafficking and slavery|work=ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most victims find themselves in coercive or abusive situations from which escape is both difficult and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Siddharth Kara|title=Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trafficking for sexual exploitation was formerly thought of as the organized movement of people, usually women, between countries and within countries for sex work with the use of physical coercion, deception and bondage through forced debt. However, the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000]] (US),&lt;ref name="State.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/laws/61124.htm |title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not require movement for the offence. The issue becomes contentious when the element of coercion is removed from the definition to incorporate facilitation of consensual involvement in prostitution. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] incorporated trafficking for sexual exploitation but did not require those committing the offence to use coercion, deception or force, so that it also includes any person who enters the UK to carry out sex work with consent as having been "trafficked."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaatw.net/Collateral%20Damage_Final/CollateralDamage_UK.pdf |format=PDF |title=Colla UK_Sarah_final |publisher=Gaatw.net |accessdate=22 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304151334/http://www.gaatw.net/Collateral%20Damage_Final/CollateralDamage_UK.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, any minor involved in a commercial sex act in the US while under the age of 18 qualifies as a trafficking victim, even if no force, fraud or coercion is involved, under the definition of "Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons" in the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.&lt;ref name="State.gov"/&gt;

Sexual trafficking includes coercing a migrant into a sexual act as a condition of allowing or arranging the migration. Sexual trafficking uses physical or sexual coercion, deception, abuse of power and bondage incurred through forced debt. Trafficked women and children, for instance, are often promised work in the domestic or service industry, but instead are sometimes taken to [[brothel]]s where they are required to undertake [[sex work]], while their passports and other identification papers are confiscated. They may be beaten or locked up and promised their freedom only after earning&amp;nbsp;– through prostitution&amp;nbsp;– their purchase price, as well as their travel and visa costs.&lt;ref&gt;Migration Information Programme.

===Forced marriage===
{{Main|Forced marriage}}

A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml|title=BBC – Ethics – Forced Marriages: Introduction|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Servile marriage'' is defined as a marriage involving a person being sold, transferred or inherited into that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rip/21-40/rip32.html|title=Forced and servile marriage in the context of human trafficking|work=aic.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[ECPAT]], "Child trafficking for forced marriage is simply another manifestation of trafficking and is not restricted to particular nationalities or countries".&lt;ref name="ecpat.org.uk"/&gt;

A forced marriage qualifies as a form of human trafficking in certain situations. If a woman is sent abroad, forced into the marriage and then repeatedly compelled to engage in sexual conduct with her new husband, then her experience is that of ''sex trafficking''. If the bride is treated as a domestic servant by her new husband and/or his family, then this is a form of ''labour trafficking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://give.theahafoundation.org/blog-0/bid/149715/Forced-Marriage-and-the-Many-Faces-of-Human-Trafficking|title=Forced Marriage and the Many Faces of Human Trafficking|work=theahafoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour trafficking===
{{Further|Unfree labour}}

Labour trafficking is the movement of persons for the purpose of forced labour and services.&lt;ref name="Trafficking for Forced Labour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/en/about/trafficking-for-forced-labour.html|title=Trafficking for Forced Labour|work=ungift.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404020310/http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/en/about/trafficking-for-forced-labour.html|archivedate=4 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[bonded labor|bonded labour]], [[involuntary servitude]], [[domestic servitude]], and [[child labor|child labour]].&lt;ref name="Trafficking for Forced Labour"/&gt; Labour trafficking happens most often within the domain of [[domestic work]], [[agriculture]], [[construction]], [[manufacturing]] and [[entertainment]]; and
migrant workers and indigenous people are especially at risk of becoming victims.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; People smuggling operations are also known to traffic people for the exploitation of their labour, for example, as transporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|last2=Missbach|first2=Antje|date=2017-09-06|title=Trafficking within migrant smuggling operations: Are underage transporters ‘victims’ or ‘perpetrators’?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0117196817726627|journal=Asian and Pacific Migration Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=287–307|doi=10.1177/0117196817726627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking for organ trade===
Trafficking in organs is a form of human trafficking. It can take different forms. In some cases, the victim is compelled into giving up an organ. In other cases, the victim agrees to sell an organ in exchange of money/goods, but is not paid (or paid less). Finally, the victim may have the organ removed without the victim's knowledge (usually when the victim is treated for another medical problem/illness{{snd}} real or orchestrated problem/illness). Migrant workers, homeless persons, and illiterate persons are particularly vulnerable to this form of exploitation. Trafficking of organs is an organized crime, involving several offenders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/en/about/trafficking-for-organ-trade.html|title=Trafficking for organ trade|work=ungift.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109112345/http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/en/about/trafficking-for-organ-trade.html|archivedate=9 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the transporter
* the medical staff
* the middlemen/contractors

Trafficking for organ trade often seeks [[kidney]]s. Trafficking in organs is a lucrative trade because in many countries the waiting lists for patients who need transplants are very long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Trafficking-in-human-beings/Types-of-human-trafficking|title=Types of human trafficking|work=interpol.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts==
There are many different estimates of how large the human trafficking and sex trafficking industries are. According to scholar Kevin Bales, author of Disposable People (2004), estimates that as many as 27 million people are in "modern-day slavery" across the globe.&lt;ref name="bales"&gt;Bales, Kevin. Disposable People : New Slavery In The Global Economy / Kevin Bales. n.p.: Berkeley, Calif. : University of California Press, c2004., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="free the slaves"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Free the Slaves |title=Top 10 Facts About Modern Slavery |url=http://www.freetheslaves.net/Page.aspx?pid=375 |accessdate=8 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621054549/http://www.freetheslaves.net/Page.aspx?pid=375 |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the U.S. Department of State estimates that 2 million children are exploited by the global commercial sex trade.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, Trafficking in Persons Report, 8th ed. (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of State, 2008), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a study classified 12.3 million individuals worldwide as "forced laborers, bonded laborers or sex-trafficking victims." Approximately 1.39 million of these individuals worked as commercial sex slaves, with women and girls comprising 98% of that 1.36 million.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

The enactment of the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act]] (TVPA) in 2000 by the [[United States Congress]] and its subsequent re-authorizations established the Department of State's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]], which engages with foreign governments to fight human trafficking and publishes a [[Trafficking in Persons Report]] annually. The Trafficking in Persons Report evaluates each country's progress in anti-trafficking and places each country onto one of three tiers based on their governments' efforts to comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking as prescribed by the TVPA.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State. Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, n.d. Web. 1 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, questions have been raised by critical anti-trafficking scholars about the basis of this tier system, its heavy focus on compliance with state department protocols, and its failure to consider "risk" and the likely prevalence of trafficking when rating the efforts of diverse countries.&lt;ref name="Horning, A. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horning | first1 = A. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = C. | last3 = Henninger | first3 = A. M. | last4 = Marcus | first4 = A. | year = 2014 | title = The Trafficking in Persons Report: a game of risk | url = | journal = International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice | volume = 38 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, there were three main components of the TVPA, commonly called the three P's:

PROTECTION: The TVPA increased the US Government's efforts to protect trafficked foreign national victims including, but not limited to:
Victims of trafficking, many of whom were previously ineligible for government assistance, were provided assistance; and a non-immigrant status for victims of trafficking if they cooperated in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers (T-Visas, as well as providing other mechanisms to ensure the continued presence of victims to assist in such investigations and prosecutions).

PROSECUTION: The TVPA authorized the US Government to strengthen efforts to prosecute traffickers including, but not limited to: Creating a series of new crimes on trafficking, forced labour, and document servitude that supplemented existing limited crimes related to slavery and involuntary servitude; and recognizing that modern-day slavery takes place in the context of fraud and coercion, as well as force, and is based on new clear definitions for both trafficking into sexual exploitation and labour exploitation: Sex trafficking was defined as, "a commercial sex act that is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age". Labour trafficking was defined as, "the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labour or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery".

PREVENTION: The TVPA allowed for increased prevention measures including: Authorizing the US Government to assist foreign countries with their efforts to combat trafficking, as well as address trafficking within the United States, including through research and awareness-raising; and providing foreign countries with assistance in drafting laws to prosecute trafficking, creating programs for trafficking victims, and assistance with implementing effective means of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endslaveryandtrafficking.org/fy2014/Relevant-Authorization-Statutes.php|title=ATEST GUIDE 2014: Summary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and Reauthorizations|work=endslaveryandtrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131121205448/http://www.endslaveryandtrafficking.org/fy2014/Relevant-Authorization-Statutes.php|archivedate=21 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] later identified a fourth P, "partnership", in 2009 to serve as a, "pathway to progress in the effort against modern-day slavery."

--&gt;

==Structural factors==
A complex set of factors fuel sex trafficking, including [[poverty]], unemployment, social norms that discriminate against women,  commercial demand for sex, institutional challenges, and [[globalization]].

===Poverty and globalization===
[[Poverty]] and lack of educational and economic opportunities in one's hometown may lead women to voluntarily migrate and then be involuntarily trafficked into sex work.&lt;ref name="berger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = Stephanie M | year = 2012 | title = No End In Sight: Why The "End Demand" Movement Is The Wrong Focus For Efforts To Eliminate Human Trafficking | url = | journal = Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 523–570 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weitzer"&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. "The social construction of sex trafficking: ideology and institutionalization of a moral crusade." Politics &amp; Society 35.3 (2007): 447–475.&lt;/ref&gt; As globalization opened up national borders to greater exchange of goods and capital, labour migration also increased. Less wealthy countries have fewer options for livable wages. The economic impact of globalization pushes people to make conscious decisions to migrate and be vulnerable to trafficking. [[Gender inequality|Gender inequalities]] that hinder women from participating in the formal sector also push women into informal sectors.&lt;ref name="janie"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chuang | first1 = Janie | year = 2006 | title = Beyond a snapshot: Preventing human trafficking in the global economy | url = | journal = Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 137–163 | doi=10.1353/gls.2006.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long waiting lists for organs in the United States and Europe created a thriving international black market. Traffickers harvest organs, particularly kidneys, to sell for large profit and often without properly caring for or compensating the victims. Victims often come from poor, rural communities and see few other options than to sell organs illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheper-Hughes|first=Nancy|title=Organs Without Borders|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2005/01/05/organs_without_borders|work=Foreign Policy|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wealthy countries' inability to meet organ demand within their own borders perpetuates trafficking. By reforming their internal donation system, Iran achieved a surplus of legal donors and provides an instructive model for eliminating both organ trafficking and -shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry-Revere |first=Sigrid |title=The Kidney Sellers:A Journey of Discovery in Iran |publisher=Carolina Academic Press|year=2014 |url=http://www.cap-press.com/books/isbn/9781611635126/The-Kidney-Sellers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization and the rise of Internet technology has also facilitated sex trafficking. Online classified sites and social networks such as Craigslist have been under intense scrutiny for being used by johns and traffickers in facilitating sex trafficking and sex work in general. Traffickers use explicit sites and underground sites (e.g. Craigslist, Backpage, MySpace) to market, recruit, sell, and exploit females. Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites are suspected for similar uses. For example, Randal G. Jennings was convicted of sex trafficking five underage girls by forcing them to advertise on Craigslist and driving them to meet the customers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}  According to the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]], online classified ads reduce the risks of finding prospective customers.&lt;ref&gt;Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: Hearings on H.R. 5575, Before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, 111th Cong. 145 (2010) (statement of Ernie Allen, president and CEO, National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children).&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have identified the Internet as the single biggest facilitator of commercial sex trade, although it is difficult to ascertain which women advertised are sex trafficking victims.&lt;ref&gt;Shared Hope International, Demand: A Comparative Examination of Sex Tourism and Trafficking in Jamaica, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States, n.d., 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Traffickers and pimps use the Internet to recruit minors, since Internet and social networking sites usage have significantly increased especially among children.&lt;ref&gt;Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, "Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences", Australian Institute of Criminology Research and Public Policy Series 103, 2009, ii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized criminals can generate up to several thousand dollars per day from one trafficked girl, and the Internet has further increased profitability of sex trafficking and child trafficking. With faster access to a wider clientele, more sexual encounters can be scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Justice, Project Safe Childhood, The National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction, August 2010, 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims and clients, according to a New York City report on sex trafficking in minors, increasingly use the Internet to meet customers. Because of protests, Craigslist has since closed its adult services section. According to authorities, Backpage is now the main source for advertising trafficking victims.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, telephone interview by CCLP research staff, 14 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators also frequently browse online classified ads to identify potential underage girls who are trafficked.

While globalization fostered new technologies that may exacerbate sex trafficking, technology can also be used to assist law enforcement and anti-trafficking efforts. A study was done on online classified ads surrounding the [[Super Bowl]]. A number of reports have noticed increase in sex trafficking during previous years of the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/30/the-superbowl-of-sex-trafficking.html|title=Michelle Goldberg, "The Super Bowl of Sex Trafficking", Newsweek, January 30, 2011.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2011 Super Bowl held in Dallas, Texas, the Backpage for Dallas area experienced a 136% increase on the number of posts in the Adult section on Super Bowl Sunday, where as Sundays typically have the lowest amount of posts. Researchers analyzed the most salient terms in these online ads, which suggested that many escorts were traveling across state lines to Dallas specifically for the Super Bowl, and found that the self-reported ages were higher than usual. Twitter was another social networking platform studied for detecting sex trafficking. Digital tools can be used to narrow the pool of sex trafficking cases, albeit imperfectly and with uncertainty.&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;Latonero, Mark. "Human Trafficking Online: The Role of Social Networking Sites and Online Classifieds." USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership &amp; Policy. Available at SSRN 2045851 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there has been no evidence found actually linking the Super Bowl{{snd}} or any other sporting event{{snd}} to increased trafficking or prostitution.&lt;ref name="blogs.villagevoice.com"&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2014/01/just_in_time_fo.php Anna Merlan, "Just in Time for February, the Myth of Sex Trafficking and the Super Bowl Returns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202171511/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2014/01/just_in_time_fo.php |date=2 February 2014 }}, Village Voice Blogs, 30 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaatw.org/publications/WhatstheCostofaRumour.11.15.2011.pdf|format=PDF|first=Julie |last=Ham|title=What's the Cost of a Rumour?|work= Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional challenges===
Corrupt and inadequately trained police officers can be complicit in sex trafficking and/or commit violence against sex workers, including sex trafficked victims.&lt;ref name="holly"/&gt; Human traffickers often incorporate abuse of the legal system into their control tactics by making threats of deportation &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258756.htm 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report], U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; or by turning victims into the authorities, possibly resulting in the incarceration of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/a-victim-centered-approach-to-sex-trafficking-cases A Victim-Centered Approach to Sex Trafficking] Alvarez, Larry MS and Cañas-Moreira, Jocelyn. &lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-trafficking agendas from different groups can also be in conflict. In the movement for [[Sex worker rights|sex workers rights]], sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has "self-regulatory boards" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations.&lt;ref name="holly"&gt;Burkhalter, Holly. "Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability." Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 122133-. Anti Trafficking Review. Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, June 2012. Web. 10 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that since sex trafficking is an economic and violent crime, it calls for law enforcement to intervene and prevent violence against victims.

Criminalization of sex work also may foster the underground market for sex work and enable sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="berger"/&gt;

Difficult political situations such as civil war and social conflict are push factors for migration and trafficking. A study reported that larger countries, the richest and the poorest countries, and countries with restricted press freedom are likely to engage in more sex trafficking. Specifically, being in a transitional economy made a country nineteen times more likely to be ranked in the highest trafficking category, and gender inequalities in a country's labour market also correlated with higher trafficking rates.&lt;ref name="rao"&gt;Rao, Smriti, &amp; Christina Presenti, ''Understanding Human Trafficking Origin: A Cross-Country Empirical Analysis'', in ''Feminist Economics'', vol. 18, no. 2 (April 2012), pp. 231–263, esp. pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual US State Department report in June 2013 cited [[Russia]] and [[China]] as among the worst offenders in combatting forced labour and sex trafficking, raising the possibility of US sanctions being leveraged against these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=U.S. cites Russia, China among worst in human trafficking: report | author=Susan Heavey| publisher=Reuters| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/19/us-usa-humantrafficking-idUSBRE95I1LC20130619|  date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 alone as many as 175,000 young women from Russia, as well as the former Soviet Union, were sold as commodities in the sex markets of the developed countries in Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Granville,[https://www.academia.edu/3541545/From_Russia_without_Love_The_Fourth_Wave_of_Global_Human_Trafficking "From Russia without Love: The ‘Fourth Wave’ of Global Human Trafficking."] ''Demokratizatsiya'', vol. 12, no. 1 (Winter 2004): pp. 147–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared the laws which effectively prohibited prostitution illegal. It delayed the implementation of this ruling for one year to give the [[Canadian parliament|parliament]] time to enact replacement laws, if it so desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/canada-anti-prostitution-law_n_4480105.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Big Victory For Canada's Sex Workers | date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial demand for sex===
Abolitionists who seek an end to sex trafficking explain the nature of sex trafficking as an economic supply and demand model. In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.&lt;ref name="berger"/&gt;

==Consequences==
[[File:Stop Human Trafficking.jpg|thumb|Traffickers use physical, emotional, and psychological abuse to control and exploit their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://polarisproject.org/victims-traffickers|title=The Victims &amp; Traffickers|date=2015-10-12|work=Polaris|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===For victims ===
Sex trafficking victims face threats of violence from many sources, including customers, pimps, brothel owners, madams, traffickers, and corrupt local law enforcement officials. Raids as an anti-sex trafficking measure have the potential to help, and also to protect sex trafficked victims. Because of their potentially complicated legal status and their potential language barriers, the arrest or fear of arrest creates stress and other emotional trauma for trafficking victims. Victims may also experience physical violence from law enforcement during raids.&lt;ref name="ditmore"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cianciarulo, Marisa Silenzi. "Modern-Day Slavery and Cultural Bias: Proposals for Reforming the US Visa System for Victims of International Human Trafficking." Nev. LJ 7 (2006): 826.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges facing victims often continue of course, after their experience of "rescue" or removal from coercive sexual exploitation. In addition to coping with their past traumatic experiences, former trafficking victims often experience [[social alienation]] in the host and home countries. [[Stigmatization]], [[social exclusion]], and [[Toleration|intolerance]] often make it difficult for former victims to integrate into their host community, or to reintegrate into their former community. Accordingly, one of the central aims of protection assistance, is the promotion of (re)integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bearup|first=Luke S|date=2016-08-01|title=Reintegration as an Emerging Vision of Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/imig.12248/abstract|journal=International Migration|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|pages=164–176|doi=10.1111/imig.12248|issn=1468-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ia-forum.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ia-forum.org/Content/ViewInternalDocument.cfm?ContentID=8625|title=Interview with Dr. Luke S.

As the victims are also pushed into [[drug trafficking]], many of them face criminal sanctions also.&lt;ref name="zheng"&gt;Zheng, Tiantian, ed. Sex trafficking, human rights, and social justice. Vol. 4. Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===

====Short-term impact – psychological coercion====
The use of coercion by perpetrators and traffickers involves the use of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of [[psychological stress]] induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics of coercion are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and indoctrination.&lt;ref name=Hopper&gt;Hopper, E. and Hidalgo, J. (2006). Invisible chains: Psychological coercion of human trafficking victims. "Intercultural Human Rights Law, 1", 185–209.&lt;/ref&gt; During the initiation phase, traffickers use [[foot-in-the-door]] techniques of [[persuasion]] to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt; Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of childhood abuse to psychologically manipulate women and children into the trafficking industry.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, B. and Butler, L. D. (2013). Running a gauntlet: A review of victimization and violence in the pre-entry, post-entry, and peri-/post-exit periods of commercial sexual exploitation. ''Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, Advance online publication.'' {{DOI|10.1037/a0032977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of psychological coercion particularly common in cases of [[sex trafficking]] and [[forced prostitution]] is [[Stockholm syndrome]]. Many women entering into the sex trafficking industry are minors whom have already experienced prior sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=McClain&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McClain | first1 = N. M. | last2 = Garrity | first2 = S. E. | year = 2011 | title = Sex trafficking and the exploitation of adolescents | url = | journal = JOGNN | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 243–252 | doi =  10.1111/j.1552-6909.2011.01221.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffickers take advantage of young girls by luring them into the business through force and coercion, but more often through false promises of love, security, and protection. This form of coercion works to recruit and initiate the victim into the life of a sex worker, while also reinforcing a "[[trauma bond]]", also known as [[Stockholm syndrome]].  Stockholm syndrome is a psychological response where the victim becomes attached to his or her perpetrator.&lt;ref name=McClain/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardy&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = V. L. | last2 = Compton | first2 = K. D. | last3 = McPhatter | first3 = V. S. | year = 2013 | title = Domestic minor sex trafficking: Practice implications for mental health professionals | url = | journal = Affilia | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 8–18 | doi = 10.1177/0886109912475172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a trafficker is to turn a human being into a slave. To do this, perpetrators employ tactics that can lead to the psychological consequence of [[learned helplessness]] for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], or withhold food or sleep.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[self-blame]], anger and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]], and sleep disturbances, [[PTSD]], numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Segerstron&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segerstron | first1 = S. C. | last2 = Miller | first2 = G. E. | year = 2004 | title = Psychological stress and the human immune system: A meta-analytic study of 30 years of inquiry | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.4.601| journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 601–630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Zimmerman, C., Hossain, M., Yun, K., Roche, B., Morison, L., and Watts, C. (2006). Stolen Smiles: A summary report on the physical and psychological health consequences of women and adolescents trafficked in Europe. ''The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine: Daphne'', 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

For victims of specifically trafficked for the purpose of forced prostitution and sexual slavery, initiation into the trade is almost always characterized by violence.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Traffickers hunt down their victims and employ practices of sexual abuse, torture, [[brainwashing]], repeated rape and physical assault until the victim submits to his or her fate as a sexual slave. Victims experience verbal threats, [[social isolation]], and [[intimidation]] before they accept their role as a prostitute.&lt;ref name=Hodge&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = D. R. | last2 = Lietz | first2 = C. A. | year = 2007 | title = The international sexual trafficking of women and children: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Affilia | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 163–174 | doi = 10.1177/0886109907299055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those enslaved in situations of forced labor, learned helplessness can also manifest itself through the trauma of living as a slave. Reports indicate that captivity for the person and financial gain of their owners adds additional psychological trauma. Victims are often cut off from all forms of social connection, as isolation allows the perpetrator to destroy the victim's sense of self and increase his or her dependence on the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt;

====Long-term impact====
Human trafficking victims may experience complex trauma as a result of repeated cases of intimate relationship trauma over long periods of time including, but not limited to, [[sexual abuse]], [[domestic violence]], forced prostitution, or gang rape. [[Complex trauma]] involves multifaceted conditions of depression, anxiety, self-hatred, dissociation, substance abuse, self-destructive behaviors, medical and somatic concerns, despair, and [[revictimization]]. Psychology researchers report that, although similar to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), Complex trauma is more expansive in diagnosis because of the effects of prolonged trauma.&lt;ref name=Courtois&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtois | first1 = C. A. | year = 2004 | title = Complex trauma, complex reactions: Assessment and treatment | url = | journal = Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 412–425 | doi = 10.1037/0033-3204.41.4.412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sex trafficking often get "branded"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/31/us/sex-trafficking-branding/index.html|title=Old mark of slavery is being used on sex trafficking victims|last=CNN|first=Sara Sidner|website=CNN|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; by their traffickers or pimps. These tattoos usually consist of bar codes or the trafficker's name or rules. Even if a victim escapes their trafficker's control or gets rescued, these tattoos are painful reminders of their past and results in emotional distress. To get these tattoos removed or covered-up can cost hundreds of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ink180.com/the-ink180-story/|title=Ink180  » The INK 180 Story|website=ink180.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological reviews have shown that the chronic stress experienced by many victims of human trafficking can compromise the immune system.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Several studies found that chronic stressors (like trauma or loss) suppressed cellular and humoral immunity.&lt;ref name=Segerstron/&gt; Victims may develop STDs and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Galjic-Veljanoski&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galjic-Veljanoski | first1 = O. | last2 = Steward | first2 = D.

Children are especially vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking due to their age. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy physical and mental health of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse.&lt;ref name=Rafferty2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Y | year = 2008 | title = The impact of trafficking on children: Psychological and social policy perspectives | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 13–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2008.00035.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims experience severe trauma on a daily basis that devastates the healthy development of [[self-concept]], [[self-worth]], biological integrity, and cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=Rafferty3&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Y | year = 2007 | title = Children for sale: Child trafficking in Southeast Asia | url = | journal = Child Abuse Review | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 401–422 | doi=10.1002/car.1009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who grow up in constant environments of exploitation frequently exhibit antisocial behavior, over-sexualized behavior, self-harm, aggression, distrust of adults, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, complex trauma, and attention deficit disorders.&lt;ref name=Hardy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rafferty2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rafferty3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Browne | first1 = A. | last2 = Finkelhor | first2 = D. | year = 1986 | title = Impact of child sexual abuse: A review of the research | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 66–77 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.99.1.66 | pmid=3704036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholm syndrome is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.&lt;ref name=Rafferty1/&gt;

Although 98% of the sex trade is composed of women and girls&lt;ref name=Rafferty1/&gt; there is an effort to gather empirical evidence about the psychological impact of abuse common in sex trafficking upon young boys.&lt;ref name=Rafferty3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkelhor&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Finkelhor | first1 = D | year = 1990 | title = Early and long-term effects of child sexual abuse: An update | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 325–330 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.5.325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys often will experience forms of post-traumatic stress disorder, but also additional stressors of social stigma of homosexuality associated with sexual abuse for boys, and externalization of blame, increased anger, and desire for revenge.

On one hand, child-prostitutes are sought by customers because they are perceived as being less likely to be HIV positive, and this demand leads to child sex trafficking. On the other hand, trafficking leads to the proliferation of HIV, because victims, being vulnerable and often young/inexperienced, cannot protect themselves properly, and get infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santac.org/eng/Human-Trafficking/Human-Trafficking-and-HIV-AIDS|title=Human Trafficking and HIV &amp; AIDS|work=santac.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623201859/http://www.santac.org/eng/Human-Trafficking/Human-Trafficking-and-HIV-AIDS|archivedate=23 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic impacts===
According to estimates from the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), every year the human trafficking industry generates 32 billion USD, half of which ($15.5 billion) is made in industrialized countries, and a third of which ($9.7 billion) is made in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Labor Office |title=A Global Alliance Against Forced Labor, Global Report Under the Follow-up to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work |location=Geneva |year=2005 |page= 55 |url=http://www.ilo.org/global/publications/ilo-bookstore/order-online/books/WCMS_081882/lang--en/index.htm |accessdate= 9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 paper published in ''Human Rights Review'', "Sex Trafficking: Trends, Challenges and Limitations of International Law", notes that, since 2000, the number of sex-trafficking victims has risen while costs associated with trafficking have declined: "Coupled with the fact that trafficked sex slaves are the single most profitable type of slave, costing on average $1,895 each but generating $29,210 annually, [there are] stark predictions about the likely growth in commercial sex slavery in the future."&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Heather M.

===Popular culture===
{{Main|Human trafficking in popular culture}}

==Criticism==
Both the public debate on human trafficking and the actions undertaken by the anti-human traffickers have been criticized by Zbigniew Dumienski, a former research analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.&lt;ref name="rsis.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dumienski|first=Zbigniew|year=2011|url= http://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NL110531_NTS_Alert_May2011_Issue2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Critical Reflections on Anti-human Trafficking: The Case of Timor-Leste|work= NTS Alert, May, Issue 2, Singapore: RSIS Centre for Non-Traditional Security (NTS) Studies for NTS-Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism touches upon statistics and data on human trafficking, the concept itself, and anti-trafficking measures.

===Problems with statistics and data===
According to a former Wall Street Journal columnist, figures used in human trafficking estimates rarely have identifiable sources or transparent methodologies behind them and in most (if not all) instances, they are mere guesses.&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl, 2010, '[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704289504575312853491596916 Suspect Estimates of Sex Trafficking at the World Cup]', The Wall Street Journal, 19 June.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also: US Government Accountability Office, 2006, [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06825.pdf Human Trafficking: Better Data, Strategy and Reporting Needed to Enhance U.S. Antitrafficking Efforts Abroad], Highlights of GAO-06-825 Report, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumienski and [[Laura María Agustín|Laura Agustin]] argue that this is a result of the fact that it is impossible to produce reliable statistics on a phenomenon happening in the shadow economy.&lt;ref name="rsis.edu.sg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agustin, Laura 2008"&gt;Agustin, Laura, 2008, Sex at the Margins: Migration, Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry, London and New York: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[UNESCO]] Bangkok researcher, statistics on human trafficking may be unreliable due to overrepresentation of sex trafficking. As an example, he cites flaws in Thai statistics, who discount men from their official numbers because by law they cannot be considered trafficking victims due to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, David A. (2010) '[https://books.google.com/books?id=HmkhqVRxVNIC&amp;pg=PA46 Trafficking in Numbers]' in P. Andreas and K. M. Greenhill (eds) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HmkhqVRxVNIC Sex, Drugs, and Body Counts]'' (London: Cornell University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 article in the [[International Communication Gazette]] examined the effect of two communication theories (agenda-building and agenda-setting) on media coverage on human trafficking in the United States and Britain. The article analyzed four newspapers including the Guardian and the Washington Post and categorized the content into various categories. Overall, the article found that sex trafficking was the most reported form of human trafficking by the newspapers that were analyzed (p.&amp;nbsp;154). Many of the other stories on trafficking were non-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/74/2/145.abstract|title=International human trafficking: An agenda-building analysis of the US and British press|journal=International Communication Gazette|year=2012|volume=74|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1177/1748048511432600 | last1 = Marchionni | first1 = D. M.}} {{subscription required|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems with the concept===
According to Zbigniew Dumienski, the very concept of human trafficking is murky and misleading.&lt;ref name="rsis.edu.sg" /&gt; It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it may be an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal.&lt;ref name="rsis.edu.sg" /&gt; [[Laura María Agustín|Laura Agustin]] argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'.&lt;ref name="Agustin, Laura 2008"/&gt; Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref name="rsis.edu.sg" /&gt; Furthermore, anti-humantrafficking actors often conflate clandestine migratory movements with forms of exploitation covered in human trafficking definitions, ignoring the fact that a migratory movement is not a requirement for human trafficking victimization.

The critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by illegal migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gülçür | first1 = Leyla | last2 = İlkkaracan | first2 = Pınar | title = The "Natasha" experience: Migrant sex workers from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in Turkey | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 411–421 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00278-9 | date = July–August 2002 | ref = harv |url=http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/NATASHA.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international [[Save the Children]] organization also stated: "The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se…trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other…On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti-trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking – Save the Children Nepal |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudia Aradau of Open University claims that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ "politics of pity," which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering. One critic identifies two strategies that gain pity: denunciation{{snd}} attributing all violence and suffering to the perpetrator{{snd}} and sentiment{{snd}} exclusively depicting the suffering of the women. NGOs' use of images of unidentifiable women suffering physically help display sex trafficking scenarios as all the same. She points out that not all trafficking victims have been abducted, abused physically, and repeatedly raped, unlike popular portrayals.&lt;ref name="aradau"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aradau | first1 = Claudia | title = The perverse politics of four-letter words: risk and pity in the securitisation of human trafficking | journal = Millennium: Journal of International Studies | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 251–277 | doi = 10.1177/03058298040330020101 | date = March 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the relationships between individuals who are defined as sex-trafficking victims by virtue of having a procurer (especially minors) concluded that assumptions about victimization and human trafficking do not do justice to the complex and often mutual relationships that exist between sex workers and their third parties.&lt;ref name="marcus"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marcus | first1 = Anthony | title = Conflict and agency among sex workers and pimps: A closer look at domestic minor sex trafficking | journal = The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science | volume = 653 | issue = 1 | pages = 225–246 | doi = 10.1177/0002716214521993 | date = May 2014 | ref = harv |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems with anti-trafficking measures===
Groups like [[Amnesty International]] have been critical of insufficient or ineffective government measures to tackle human trafficking. Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking{{snd}} identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government's new anti-trafficking measures "not fit for purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-trafficking measures 'not fit for purpose' and breach international law – new report |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18820 |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Victim identification and protection in the UK====
In the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status.&lt;ref&gt;Stepnitz, Abigail. "A Lie More Disastrous than the Truth: Asylum and the Identification of Trafficked Women in the UK." Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 104–19. Anti Trafficking Review. Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, June 2012. Web. 10 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the asylum system is linked to the trafficking victim protection system.

[[Laura Agustin]] has suggested that, in some cases, "anti-traffickers" ascribe victim status to [[immigrants]] who have made conscious and rational decisions to cross the borders knowing they will be selling sex and who do not consider themselves to be victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kerry Howley |date=26 December 2007 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2007/12/26/the-myth-of-the-migrant |title=The Myth of the Migrant – Reason Magazine |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been instances in which the alleged victims of trafficking have actually refused to be rescued&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/article831672.ece/Chinese-prostitutes-resist-effort-to-rescue-them-from-Africa Chinese Prostitutes Resist Efforts to Rescue Them from Africa]', 2011, Times LIVE, 1 January.&lt;/ref&gt; or run away from the anti-trafficking shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siddharth |first=Kumar |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2010/oct/231010-sex-workers-rescue-shelter-Hadapsar.htm |title=Sex Workers Don't Want Rescue |publisher= Mid-day.com |date=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law enforcement and the use of raids====
In the U.S., services and protections for trafficked victims are related to cooperation with law enforcement. Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle "criminal networks", and to rescue victims from abuse.&lt;ref name="ditmore"&gt;Ditmore, Melissa, and Juhu Thukral. "Accountability and the Use of Raids to Fight Trafficking." Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 134–48. Anti Trafficking Review. Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, June 2012. Web. 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The [[Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005]] (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.&lt;ref name="ditmore" /&gt;

Law enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful.
Social workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.&lt;ref name="ditmore" /&gt;

As raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.&lt;ref name="ahmed"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu|title="We Have the Right Not to Be 'rescued'…"*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|work=Anti Trafficking Review|volume=1|date=June 2012|page=149-19|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812011153/http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars Aziza Ahmed and [[Meena Seshu]] suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model.&lt;ref name="ahmed"/&gt;

===="End Demand" programs====
Critics argue that [[End Demand]] programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, "[[John school]]s" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers because of the higher risk nature of their work. No proper citation given for this study. The conclusion is strongly disputed. Other studies indicate that the policy is successful.The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of john schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some john schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.&lt;ref name="desiree"&gt;Wortley, S., Fischer, B., &amp; Webster, C.

==Modern feminist perspectives==

There are different feminist perspectives on sex trafficking. The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on "sexualized domination", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Johanna|title=Selling Sexual Services: A Socialist Feminist Perspective|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article34256|website=Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières|publisher=Système de Publication pour un Internet Partagé}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shelley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Manifesto in Support of Sex Workers’ Rights|url=https://feministsforsexworkers.com/|website=Feminists for Sex Workers|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Third-wave feminism]] harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shelley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

[[Third-wave feminism|Third-wave]] feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to [[Amartya Sen]]'s and [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims.  Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.&lt;ref name="shelley"&gt;CAVALIERI, SHELLEY. "[http://ilj.law.indiana.edu/articles/86/86_4_cavalieri.pdf Between Victim And Agent: A Third-Wave Feminist Account Of Trafficking For Sex Work.]" Indiana Law Journal86.4 (2011): 1409–1458. Legal Collection. Web. 6 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social norms===
According to modern Feminists, women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of [[social norms]] that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead people to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="yvonne"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Yvonne | year = 2007 | title = Children for sale: Child trafficking in Southeast Asia | url = | journal = Child Abuse Review | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 401–422 | doi=10.1002/car.1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
As of 2016, Singapore acceded to the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol and affirmed on 28 September 2015 the commitment to combat people trafficking, especially women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Accedes to the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol|url=https://www.mha.gov.sg/Newsroom/press-releases/Pages/Singapore-Accedes-to-the-United-Nations-Trafficking-in-Persons-Protocol.aspx|website=Ministry of Home Affairs|publisher=Singapore Inter-Agency Taskforce on Trafficking in Persons|accessdate=20 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303154607/https://www.mha.gov.sg/Newsroom/press-releases/Pages/Singapore-Accedes-to-the-United-Nations-Trafficking-in-Persons-Protocol.aspx|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Infierno en el Ring'' (2008)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Inferno in the ring") was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Pay-Per-View]] (PPV) produced by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), which took place on June 13, 2008 in [[Arena México]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]]. The main event was the eponimous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match that CMLL traditionally holds at least once a year. In 2008 the match was given its own event, whereas previously it had been a part of other events. The ''Infierno en el Ring'' match is a multi-man [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage]] match where all the competitors risked their hair, with the last wrestler in the ring being shaved bald. The 2008 event saw ten men risk their hair: [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]], [[El Texano Jr.]], [[Damián 666]], [[Mr. Águila]], [[El Terrible]], [[Perro Aguayo Jr.]], [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]], [[Marco Corleone]], [[Negro Casas]] and [[Alex Koslov]]. The event also featured 5 [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six-man "Lucha Libre rules" tag team match]], including the finals of a tournament to determine the next holders of the [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] as ''Los Ángleles'' (Spanish for "The Angels; [[Héctor Garza]], [[El Hijo del Fantasma]] and [[La Mascara (wrestler)|La Máscara]] faced [[Blue Panther]], [[Dos Caras Jr.]] and [[Místico]].

==Production==
===Background===
The Mexican [[wrestling promotion|wrestling company]] ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker ''Infierno en el Ring'' ("Inferno in the Ring"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man [[steel cage match]], the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match. CMLL has use the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as ''Infierno en el Ring'', with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All ''Infierno en el Ring'' shows have been held in [[Arena México]] in [[Mexico City, Mexico]] which is CMLL's main venue, its "home".&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the ''Infierno en el Ring'' '' shows replace their regularly scheduled ''[[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]]'' show.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt; The 2008 ''Infierno en el Ring'' show was the first show to use the name.

===Storylines===
The event featured five [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The '''International Computer Music Conference''' ('''ICMC''') is a yearly international conference for computer music researchers and composers.  It is the annual conference of the [[International Computer Music Association]] (ICMA).

==History==

See the [http://www.computermusic.org/page/23/ CMA History Page] for a list.

In 1986, the [[Institute of Sonology]] institute was moved to the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]], hosting the International Computer Music Conference there during its inaugural year.&lt;ref&gt;Sani, N. and Bernardini, N. (1987), '1986 International Computer Music Conference, Den Haag: Review in Two Parts,' ''Perspectives of New Music'', 25 (1/2): 618-637&lt;/ref&gt;
Each year there is a specific theme.  For example, in 2007, the theme was "Immersed Music" and immersive media. ICMC 2007 took place in Copenhagen.  On Tuesday August 28, there was an "[http://www.icmc2007.net/?page_id=184 Underwater/Water Concert]" at the  [[DGI-byen]] swimcenter, in the hundred-metre DGI-byen pool, as well as the various other pools of the [[Vandkulturhuset]].

This [http://www.aaue.dk/~niklas/ICMC/ "Immersed Music"] theme of ICMC 2007 explored important issues in [[Musical instrument classification#Physics-based classification scheme|musical instrument classification]] and immersion.

2014 40th ICMC is organised joint with the 11th [[Sound and Music Computing Conference]] in Athens, Greece 14–20 September 2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20140224122305/http://www.icmc14-smc14.net/].

[[File:River in the Amazon rainforest.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Brazil]]]]

The year 2011 was declared the '''International Year of Forests''' by the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name="UN official site"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/iyof2011/ UN official site]&lt;/ref&gt; to raise awareness and strengthen the [[sustainable forest management|sustainable management]], conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests for the benefit of current and future generations.

==Background==
[[Forests]] are an integral part of global [[sustainable development]].  According to [[World Bank]] estimates, more than 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihoods with some 300 million living in them.&lt;ref name="UN official site"/&gt; The forest product industry is a source of economic growth and employment, with global forest products traded internationally is estimated at $327 billion.

The UN’s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that every year 130,000&amp;nbsp;km² of the world's forests are lost due to [[deforestation]]. Conversion to agricultural land, unsustainable harvesting of timber, unsound land management practices, and creation of human settlements are the most common reasons for this loss of forested areas.

According to the World Bank, deforestation accounts for up to 20 percent of the global [[greenhouse gas emissions]] that contribute to [[global warming]]. FAO data estimates that the world's forests and forest [[soil]] store more than one trillion tons of carbon – twice the amount found in the atmosphere. The World Bank estimates that forests provide [[habitats]] to about two-thirds of all species on earth, and that deforestation of closed [[tropical]] [[rainforests]] could account for [[biodiversity loss]] of as many as 100 [[species]] a day.

According to the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration, “Across the globe lie more than a billion hectares of lost and degraded forest land that could be restored”.

==Campaign==
The Secretariat of the [[United Nations Forum on Forests]] is the focal point for implementation of the International Year in collaboration with Governments, the [http://www.fao.org/forestry/cpf Collaborative Partnership on Forests] and other relevant organizations and processes.

Governments, regional and international organizations and civil society organizations are expected to create national committees and designate focal points in their respective countries to facilitate organization of activities in support of the International Year of Forests.

==Celebrations==
[[File:5794513057 bef09874c3 o - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|Woodsy Owl and Smokey Bear give each other a [[fist bump]] at the International Year of Forests celebration for U.S. Department of Agriculture employees, on Friday, June 3, 2011 in the Patio of the Whitten Building, Washington, D.C.]]
The [http://celebrateforests.com “Celebrate Forests. Celebrate Life.”] campaign is the official U.S. celebration. Coordinated by the [http://stateforesters.org National Association of State Foresters] in partnership with the [http://www.fs.fed.us U.S. Forest Service], the U.S. celebration aims to elevate awareness and understanding of the value of America’s forests and showcase the connections between healthy forests, people, ecosystems and economies. The goal is to provide all forestry stakeholders with ideas and resources to participate in the celebration over the year.

On 9 February 2011, Deputy Director-General of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Ann Tutwiler, and Assistant Director-General of the Forestry Department, Eduardo Rojas-Briales, launch the 2011 edition of the FAO flagship publication [http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2000e/i2000e00.htm State of the World’s Forests (SOFO).] The State of the World's Forests reports on the global status of forests, recent major policy and institutional developments and key issues concerning the forest sector. 

On 9 March 2011, New Zealand's Minister of Forestry, Hon David Carter, [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/launch-international-year-forests launched the International Year of Forests at Parliament Buildings in Wellington, New Zealand.] Hon Carter said, “They [forests] are an integral part of our natural resource-based economy, they provide a range of environmental benefits, and they have cultural significance.”

On May 5, 2011, at the Romanian Academy has been a national debate regarding the "2011- The International Year of Forests".&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Victor Giurgiu |title=Dezbaterea națională "Starea și viitorul pădurilor României", dedicată Anului Internațional al Pădurilor – 2011 |journal=Revista pădurilor |issue=3–4 |pages=97–101 |date=Sep 2011 |url=http://www.revistapadurilor.ro/(1)Colectia-pe-ani/(16714)anul-2011/(16738)nr-3-4-2011/(16749)Cronica/(16751)Dezbaterea-nationala-Starea-si-viitorul-padurilor-Romaniei-dedicata-Anului-International-al-Padurilor-2011 |accessdate = 2011-10-15}}(in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], webpage has a translation button)&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2011, in honor of International Year of Forests The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Division of Lands and Forests kicked off the [http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/75396.html Celebrating New York's Forests Photo Contest.] This contest is an effort to increase awareness of and appreciation for all types of forests, urban and rural, large and small, public and privately owned, across the state.

==History==
The UN General Assembly proclaimed 2011 as the "International Year of Forests" with Resolution 61/193 on 20 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly 61/193.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6176">'''Interplay Europe''' is one of the most important festivals for young playwrights in [[Europe]].
It is organized by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]; an international, not-for-profit arts organisation for the furtherance of young playwrights aged 18 to 26. It was founded in [[Sydney]] in 1985. Every two years Interplay organises the largest and most prestigious festival of its kind, [[World Interplay]], in [[Australia]]. 
Every other year a European country hosts '''Interplay Europe'''. The first Interplay Europe was held in 1995 in [[Mainz]] organized by the playwrights [[Antje Rávic Strubel]] and Tobias Rausch and Interplay Europe e.V became official in 1998, which was also in [[Berlin]]. 
Participants from all over [[Europe]] discuss their plays for two inspiring, practical and creative weeks in classes, workshops, forums and events with experienced international tutors. Through workshops and small-scale productions, they have the opportunity to improve their work. Interplay also supports international youth exchange and seeks to contribute to better understanding between nations.

'''Interplay Festivals''' are held in order to: 
* celebrate the creative richness of young playwrights
* provide an international meeting place where their work can be discussed, workshopped and performed
* provide an international forum for the ideas of young playwrights
* offer the general public access to the works of young writers
* contribute to regional, national and international cultural development.

== Alumni ==

Many highly respected and international award-winning European playwrights started their career with Interplay. For example: [[Ivana Sajko]] and [[Tena Stivicic]] from [[Croatia]], [[Katharina Schlender]] and [[Kristo Šagor]] from [[Germany]], [[Ali Taylor]] and [[Sarah Kane]] from the [[UK]], [[Enver Husicic]] and [[Esther Gerritsen]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Vera Filo]] and [[Anna Haraszti]] from [[Hungary]], [[Darja Stocker]] and [[Simon Froehling]] from [[Switzerland]] or [[Ignacio Pajón Leyra]] and [[Antonio Rojano]] from [[Spain]].

'''James Allen Hydrick''' (born February 28, 1959) is an American former stage performer and self-described [[psychic]], and a convicted [[child molestation|child molester]]. Hydrick claimed to be able to perform acts of [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], such as his trademark trick of moving a pencil resting at the edge of a table.&lt;ref name="Regal"&gt;[[Brian Regal|Regal, Brian]] (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''. Greenwood. p. 89. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a nationally televised demonstration of his abilities on the American [[Reality television|reality show]] ''[[That's Incredible!]]'', he was unable to prove his supernatural abilities on another show, ''[[That's My Line]]'', hosted by [[Bob Barker]], and Hydrick subsequently confessed the fraud to an investigative reporter.&lt;ref name="Baker and Nickell"&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert]]; [[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]] (1992). ''Missing Pieces: How To Investigate Ghosts, UFOs, Psychics, &amp; Other Mysteries''. Prometheus Books. p. 80. {{ISBN|0-87975-729-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hydrick was born in South Carolina to a 30-year-old father and teenage mother. His father was allegedly abusive.&lt;ref name="koreminterfview" /&gt; In 1989, he told an interviewer that he started learning [[karate]] at age six to protect himself from his father after seeing one of his brothers beaten to death. He and his other siblings later lived in a series of foster homes and orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-07/local/me-302_1_molest-man-denies|title=Suspect With Many Images:  Man Denies Guilt in Molestations|last=Rivera|first=Carla|date=January 7, 1989|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrick was convicted of [[kidnapping]] and torture in 1977.&lt;ref name="Pemberton"/&gt; He escaped incarceration three times: he kicked through a concrete wall in a Georgia jail, broke through gates at a South Carolina prison, and finally, in 1982, he pole-vaulted over a fence at a state prison in Utah.&lt;ref name="Patrick S. Pemberton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2013/05/22/2518304/james-hydrick-molestation-trial.html#storylink=cpy|title=1980s TV 'psychic' and sex offender wants to be freed from mental hospital|author=Patrick S. Pemberton|date=2013-05-22|publisher=sanluisobispo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to fame==
Throughout the 1970s, Hydrick was arrested repeatedly for crimes ranging from burglary to assault.&lt;ref name="Patrick S. Pemberton"/&gt; Despite his difficult background and ongoing legal troubles, Hydrick gained prominence for his karate and sleight-of-hand tricks, earning national television exposure and a cult following.  He claimed he was able to use [[psychokinesis]] to turn the pages of books and make pencils spin around on desks, among other feats.&lt;ref name="Regal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker and Nickell"/&gt;  Hydrick also set up martial arts classes and claimed he could pass on the gift of psychokinesis to children through special training techniques, which was shown in 1989 to be a front for his coercing children into performing sexual favors for him, and was a factor in his conviction for sexual assault of a minor.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]] (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''. Pan Macmillan. pp. 81-95. {{ISBN|978-0-230-75298-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hydrick's most visible demonstration of his skills was on the series ''That's Incredible!'' The episode originally aired in December 1980 and was later repeated in 1981. He performed the pencil-spinning trick with the host [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]]'s hand on his mouth to block him from exhaling (after Davidson suggested that he could hear Hydrick blowing).&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; However, Hydrick had readjusted the pencil beforehand so that it was as precarious as possible and would move with the slight manipulation of his hands. He also caused a page from a telephone book to turn over, allegedly by telekinesis.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; Magician and paranormal skeptic [[James Randi]] awarded the program a 1980 Uri Award, later renamed the [[Pigasus Award]], "for declaring a simple magic trick to be genuine."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]] (1982). ''[[The Truth About Uri Geller]]''. Prometheus Books. p. 329. {{ISBN|0-87975-199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure as fraud==
[[James Randi]] replicated the pencil trick on ''That's My Line'', demonstrating that it was a simple illusion and not the product of telekinesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html#i11 |title=A Look at the Past |last=Randi |first=James |authorlink=James Randi |date=September 22, 2006 |work=Swift |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |type=Newsletter |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709213130/http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html#i11 |archivedate=July 9, 2009 |accessdate=2006-11-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up episode, Randi and Hydrick both appeared. When Randi placed small pieces of polystyrene on the table around the phone book (to show if Hydrick was actually turning the pages by blowing on them), Hydrick's "powers" suddenly failed him. Hydrick claimed that the stage lights were giving the foam pieces a [[static electricity|static electric]] charge which, when added to the weight of the page, required more force than he was able to generate to turn the page. Randi and the judges, though, declared that this hypothesis had no scientific basis.&lt;ref name="Regal"/&gt;

Without any results, Hydrick finally admitted that he was unable to complete the challenge. The judging panel, which included a [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]], stated that, in their opinion, no supernatural phenomenon had taken place.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; The failed stunt effectively ended Hydrick's television career.  To further discredit Hydrick, Randi was shown performing the same trick.

In 1981, Hydrick's psychic powers were conclusively exposed as frauds by investigative journalist and professional magician [[Dan Korem]]. Hydrick confessed to Korem that he had developed his trick in prison, and that he had not learned it from a Chinese master as he originally claimed.&lt;ref name="Regal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koreminterfview"&gt;[[Dan Korem|Korem, Dan]] (1983). {{YouTube|id=SSIlEAAEfXk|title=''Psychic Confession''|link=no}} [http://www.unexplainable.net/artman/publish/article_2685.shtml (also transcript)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/32730880|title=''Psychic Confession'' - Part 2|last=Korem|first=Dan|year=1983|website=[[Vimeo]]|accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrick confessed, "My whole idea behind this in the first place was to see how dumb America was. How dumb the world is."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Korem|Korem, Dan]] (1988). ''Powers: Testing the Psychic and Supernatural''. InterVarsity Press. p. 149. {{ISBN|0-8308-1277-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
Wanted on an outstanding warrant, Hydrick was apprehended after police saw him discussing psychic powers on the ''[[Sally (1983 TV series)|Sally Jessy Raphael]]'' talk show.&lt;ref name="Patrick S. Pemberton"/&gt; In 1989, Hydrick was sentenced to 17 years for molesting five boys in [[Huntington Beach, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Receives 17 Years for Molesting 5 Boys|first=Ted|last=Johnson|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-19/local/me-634_1_child-molestation|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 19, 1989|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving his sentence, he was remanded to [[Atascadero State Hospital]] for treatment under the state's sexually violent predator law. Psychologist Jesus Padilla described Hydrick as "an extremely difficult patient" who suffers from [[pedophilia]], [[paraphilia]], and [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1980s TV "psychic" and sex offender wants to be freed from mental hospital|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/crime/article39444981.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|The Tribune]]|location=San Luis Obispo, CA|date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrick petitioned for release in May 2013, but a trial resulted in a [[hung jury]].&lt;ref name="Pemberton"/&gt; He now resides at the [[Coalinga State Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Pemberton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury deadlocked on whether to free purported psychic from custody|first=Patrick S.|last=Pemberton|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2013/06/06/2536018/james-hydrick-trial-sex-offender.html|work=[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|The Tribune]]|location=San Luis Obispo, CA|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convicted Calif.

'''''James v. United States''''', 366 U.S. 213 (1961),&lt;ref&gt;''James v. United States'', {{ussc|volume=366|page=213|pin=|year=1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that [[Taxation of illegal income in the United States|the receipt of money obtained by a taxpayer illegally]] was [[taxable income]], even though the law might require the taxpayer to repay the ill-gotten gains to the person from whom they had been taken.

==Facts==
The defendant, Eugene James, was an official in a [[labor union]] who had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] more than $738,000 in union funds, and did not report these amounts on his tax return. He was [[criminal trial|tried]] for [[tax evasion]], and claimed in his defense that embezzled funds did not constitute taxable income. His argument was that just as the receipt of [[loan]] proceeds is not taxable to the borrower (because of the borrower's corresponding obligation to repay the loan), the person who embezzles money should not be treated as having received income, since that person is legally obligated to return those funds to their rightful owner. Indeed, Eugene James pointed out, the Supreme Court had previously made such a determination in ''[[Commissioner v. Wilcox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Wilcox|volume=327|page=404|pin=|year=1946}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this defense was unavailing in the [[trial court]], where Eugene James was convicted and sentenced to three years in [[prison]].

==Issue==
The Supreme Court was called upon to determine whether the receipt of embezzled funds constitutes income taxable to the wrongdoer, even though an obligation to repay exists.

==Holding==
The Supreme Court ruled that under section 22(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and section 61(a) of the [[Internal Revenue Code|Internal Revenue Code of 1954]], the receipt of embezzled funds was includable in the gross income of the wrongdoer and was taxable to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer had an obligation to return the funds to the rightful owner.

==Rationale==
The Court was divided between several different rationales. The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], joined by Justices Brennan and Stewart. That opinion held that if a taxpayer receives income – legally or illegally – without consensual recognition of obligation to repay, that income is taxable.

The Court noted that the scope of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] was not limited to "lawful" income, a distinction which ''had'' been found in the [[Revenue Act of 1913]]. The absence of the "lawful" modifier indicated that the framers of the Sixteenth Amendment had intended no safe harbor for illegal income. The Court expressly overruled ''Commissioner v. Wilcox'' and ruled that James was therefore liable for the federal income tax due on his embezzled funds. The Court also ruled, however, that Eugene James could not be held liable for the willful tax evasion because it is not possible to willfully violate laws that were not established at the time of the violation.

==Effect of the decision==

Although Eugene James avoided criminal liability, the opinion of the Court left James in a situation where he would be required not only to repay the embezzled $738,000 to the union, but would also be required to pay federal income taxes on the receipt of those funds, just as though he had been able to keep them.

==Concurrences and dissents==

Justice Whittaker, joined by Justice Black and Justice Douglas, wrote an opinion concurring in the dismissal of the indictment against James, but dissenting from the overruling of ''Wilcox''. Justice Black raised a [[Federalism]] argument, arguing that this ruling constituted a preemption of state criminal jurisdiction.

Justice Harlan, joined by Justice Frankfurter, wrote an opinion concurring with the overruling of ''Wilcox'', but contending that James should have been set for a new trial, rather than set free of criminal liability. Justice Clark wrote a brief concurrence, also agreeing with the overruling of ''Wilcox'', but stating that James' conviction should also have been upheld.

&lt;/ref&gt; is celebrated on December 31 (New Year's Eve)

It is a [[France|French]] [[medieval]] New Year's Eve tradition that is still practiced in two towns in the United States.&lt;ref name="pbsros"/&gt; The tradition related to poor people being able to ask the more wealthy for food and drink at the celebrations of winter. Customarily  a troupe of traveling male singers went from door to door to entertain and ring in the new year. Hosts were expected to give them food and drink. Other sources say the young men were seeking donations for [[Twelfth Night]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekberg, Carl J., Colonial Ste. Genevieve: An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier, Tucson, AZ: Patrice Press, 1996, {{ISBN|1-880397-14-5}}, pp.320-321&lt;/ref&gt; Begun as a way for the poor to be given gratuities by the rich, it also became a community social event for young men to visit with the families of young women.

Over time, the practice became an occasion for visiting with relatives and friends and was more or less a traveling feast. At first it was carried on only by young men, often in costume; women joined the party in the 20th century. In many years, the people appeared in disguise, as part of the celebration was a kind of overturning of the common order.

This tradition has been practiced annually since 1722 in [[Prairie du Rocher, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="illtim"/&gt;  It has been revived in [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri]]. Both were former French colonial villages settled by French Canadians in the eighteenth century.

In the latter town, current celebrations feature singers and musicians, attired in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] dress, who begin their night's journey at the local [[American Legion]] Hall. They make their way through all the restaurants, bars, nursing homes and high school gyms, ending at midnight at the [[Knights of Columbus]] Hall.

Translation of the words of the traditional song, ''La Guignolée'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Good evening master and mistress,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And all who live with you.''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''For the first day of the year, ''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''You owe us La Guignolée.''

  ''If you have nothing to give, ''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''A chine of meat or so will do.''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''A chine of meat is not a big thing, ''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''Only ninety feet long.''

  ''Again, we don't ask for very much,''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''Only the oldest daughter of the house.''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''We will give her lots of good cheer,''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''And we will surely warm her feet.''

  ''Now, we greet you,''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''And beg you to forgive us please.''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''If we have acted a little crazy, ''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''We meant it in good fun.''

  ''Another time we'll surely be careful''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''To know when we must come back here again.''&lt;br /&gt;
  ''Let us dance La Guenille, ''&lt;br /&gt;
    ''-- La Guenille, La Guenille!''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 11 November 1918, The [[Tautas padome]] (People's council), which was a coalition of competing Latvian political factions, proclaimed the independence of the Latvian region from the [[Russian Empire]] and established a new state, the [[Republic of Latvia]]. This decision was made following a summit held inside the [[Latvian National Theatre]] the day before. A [[Latvian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] was immediately created, with [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] acting as it's first [[Prime Minister of Latvia|Prime Minister]]. 2 and a half weeks later, [[Latvian War of Liberation]] began, with the [[Red Army]] and the [[Imperial German Army]] invading the country in order to have a foothold in the [[Baltic states]]. The war ended with a Latvian/pan-baltic victory in August 1920 and the signing of the [[Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty|Treaty of Riga]].

== Events ==
The centennial will be the biggest event in the history of modern Latvia. More than 800 wide range celebratory events and festivities were planned to take place from May 2017 to January 2021 in Latvia and in more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.km.gov.lv/en/ministry/centenary-of-the-republic-of-latvia&lt;/ref&gt; The 5-year span will include events that mark the centenaries of different stages of Latvia's path to independence, as well as Latvia's accomplishments after it's statehood was achieved. The official celebrations started on May 4, 2017, Latvia' restoration day, with the Embrace Latvia initiative when citizens planted exactly 100 oaks along the country's outer border.&lt;ref&gt;http://latvia.eu/latvias-centenary-0&lt;/ref&gt;

As per events on its actual centennial anniversary on 11 November 2018, many high level government officials, dignitaries, military leaders, and public figures laid wreaths and flowers at the [[Freedom Monument]] in the capital. A musical concert was held at the [[Latvian National Theatre]], where Latvia decalred it's sovereignty in 1918. A special meeting of the [[Saeima]] was also at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rferl.org/amp/latvia-marks-100-years--independence-russian-empire/29607304.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lollapalooza''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɑː|l|ə|p|ə|ˈ|l|uː|z|ə}} is an annual [[music festival]] including but not limited to [[alternative rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[electronic music]] bands and artists, with dance and comedy performances, and craft booths. It has also provided a platform for non-profit and political groups and various visual artists.

Conceived and created in 1991 by [[Jane's Addiction]] singer [[Perry Farrell]] as a farewell tour for his band, Lollapalooza ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997 and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the festival organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the 2004 tour to be cancelled.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;The Associated Press. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-06-22-festival-canceled_x.htm "Lollapalooza 2004 cancels all dates"]. ''[[USA Today]]''. June 22, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Farrell and the [[William Morris Agency]] partnered with [[Austin, Texas]]–based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now [[C3 Presents]]) and retooled it into its current format as a weekend destination festival in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Chicago]]. In 2014, [[Live Nation Entertainment]] bought a controlling interest in C3 Presents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6414053/live-nation-completes-deal-for-c3-presents Live Nation Completes Deal for C3 Presents] - Billboard, 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it was announced that Lollapalooza would debut outside the United States, with a branch of the festival staged in [[Chile]]'s capital [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on April 2–3, 2011 where they partnered up with Santiago-based company Lotus. In 2011, the company Geo Events confirmed the Brazilian version of the event, which was held at the Jockey Club in [[São Paulo]] on 7 and 8 April 2012.&lt;ref name="Folha de S.Paulo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/938604-festival-lollapalooza-deve-ter-edicao-em-sp-em-2012.shtml |title=Festival Lollapalooza deve ter edição em SP em 2012 |publisher= [[Folha de S.Paulo]] |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lollapalooza Brasil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lollapaloozabr.com/ |title=Lollapalooza Brasil |publisher=Lollapaloozabr.com |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, [[Buenos Aires]] was selected as the third Lollapalooza in [[South America]], starting on April 2014, and in November 2014, the first European Lollapalooza was announced, which was held at the former [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="announce Berlin"&gt;[http://www.lollapalooza.com/2014/announcing-lollapalooza-berlin-2015/ lollapalooza.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318125031/http://www.lollapalooza.com/2014/announcing-lollapalooza-berlin-2015/ |date=2015-03-18 }}, Announcing Lollapalooza Berlin 2015, retrieved 7 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Perry handpicked and debuted a new artist to emerge as the face of the festival. The artist, collectively known as [http://www.futurebones.com The Future Bones], or Juan Marco, rebranded the festival with funky characters and a colorful palette, inherently representing the culture of the music and festival-goers today.

The music festival hosts more than 160,000 people over a two or three day period.  Lollapalooza has featured a diverse range of bands and artists such as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Kanye West]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Lana Del Rey]], 
[[Wiz Khalifa]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Eminem]], [[MGMT]], [[Coldplay]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]], [[Atlas Genius]], [[Dev (singer)|Dev]], [[Rollins Band]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Imagine Dragons]], [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[Foster The People]], [[The Cure]], [[Of Monsters and Men]], [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], [[The Killers]], [[The National (band)|The National]], [[Living Colour]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[We the Kings]], [[Paramore]], [[Green Day]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Beyonce]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[X Japan]], [[Audioslave]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Cage the Elephant]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Björk]], [[Lorde]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[The Black Keys]], [[deadmau5]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], [[Ice-T]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Cupcakke]], [[The Drums]], [[The Strokes]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Thenewno2]], [[Fishbone]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Lucius (band)|Lucius]], [[Betty Who]], [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Grouplove]], [[Marina And The Diamonds]], [[Haley Reinhart]], [[Scramble Campbell]], [[Zara Larsson]], [[The Weeknd]], and [[Radiohead]].

Lollapalooza is broadcast live and globally on [[Red Bull TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/2016/07/red-bull-tv-lollapalooza-music-festival/|title=Red Bull TV Brings The 2016 Lollapalooza Music Festival To You|date=2016-07-30|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word—sometimes alternatively spelled and pronounced as ''lollapalootza'' or ''lalapaloosa''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appleton |first=Victor |title=Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel |year=1916 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/19tom10.txt |chapter=Chapter XIV: Mysterious Disappearances}}&lt;/ref&gt;—or "lallapaloosa" ([[P.G. Wodehouse]], "Heart of a Goof") dates from a late 19th-/early 20th-century American [[idiomatic]] phrase meaning "an extraordinary or unusual thing, person, or event; an exceptional example or instance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lollapalooza |title=Lollapalooza &amp;#124; Define Lollapalooza at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its earliest known use was in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lollapalooza |title=Lollapalooza |publisher=Merriam-Webster |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In time the term also came to refer to a large lollipop.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Hilburn, Robert. [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-22/entertainment/ca-30_1_pop-music-review "POP MUSIC REVIEW – 'Lollapalooza' – Festival Concert With '60s Concept Isn't the Hoped-For Happening"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. July 22, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Farrell, searching for a name for his festival, liked the [[Phonaesthetics|euphonious]] quality of the by-then-antiquated term upon hearing it in a [[Three Stooges]] short film.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Grimes, Taylor and Longton, Jeff. [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/lollapalooza/2007/story.jsp "Lollapalooza History Timeline"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Paying homage to the term's double meaning, a character in the festival's original logo holds one of the lollipops.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

The word has also caused a slang suffix to appear in event-planning circles as well as in news and opinion shows that is used synonymously with other suffixes like "a-go-go", "o-rama", etc.  The suffix "(a)palooza" is often used to imply (often in hyperbolic language) that an entire event or crowd was made over that term, e.g.: "Parks"-apalooza, popular Chicago sushi restaurant "Roll"-apalooza, etc.

==History==

===Creation===
[[File:Trent Reznor Lollapalooza 1991.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]] during the 1991 Lollapalooza festival.]]

Inspired by events such as Britain's [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] – which Lollapalooza cofounder [[Perry Farrell]] had been due to play in 1990 &lt;ref&gt;janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes-addiction/1990-08-24/1091/&lt;/ref&gt; – Farrell, [[Ted Gardner]], Don Muller, and [[Marc Geiger]] conceived the festival in 1990 as a farewell for Farrell's band [[Jane's Addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/arts/pop-music-a-woodstock-for-the-lost-generation.html "POP MUSIC; A Woodstock for the Lost Generation"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. August 4, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike previous festivals such as [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]], [[A Gathering of the Tribes]] (also an influence on Lollapalooza) and the [[US Festival]], which were one-time events held at single venues, Lollapalooza toured across the United States and Canada from mid-July until late August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Janey. [http://www.nme.com/reviews/bloc-party/9846 "Lollapalooza 2008"]. ''[[NME]]''. August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural lineup was made up of artists from [[alternative rock]] (such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]),  [[industrial music]] (such as [[Nine Inch Nails]]) and [[hip hop music|rap]] ([[Ice-T]] rapped and used the platform to launch [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], his [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band).

Another key concept was the inclusion of nonmusical features.&lt;ref&gt;Parvaz, D. [http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/136299_lollapalooza23.html "Lollapalooza: Then and Now"]. ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. August 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers such as the [[Jim Rose Circus|Jim Rose Circus Side Show]], an alternative freak show, and the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks stretched the boundaries of rock culture. There was a tent for display of art pieces, [[virtual reality]] games, and information tables for political and environmental non-profit groups, promoting counter-culture and political awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhorn, Jon. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459531/20030114/farrell_perry.jhtml "Corporate Sponsors May Be Key To Lollapalooza's Return"]. [[MTV]].com. January 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; "Basically, I'm bored," Farrell said at the time. "I just want to see things that are unexpected and slightly bizarre. The way [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey]] perceived putting on a show… well, they had a different angle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Halbert |title= Nasy habits |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success and decline===
It was at Lollapalooza where Farrell coined the term "Alternative Nation".&lt;ref name="altguitar"&gt;di Perna, Alan. "Brave Noise—The History of Alternative Rock Guitar". ''Guitar World''. December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion of [[alternative rock]] in the early 1990s propelled Lollapalooza forward; the 1992 and 1993 festivals leaned heavily on [[grunge]] and alternative acts, and usually featured an additional rap artist.&lt;ref&gt;Nager, Larry. [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/07/13/tem_wwwtem1ahist13.html "A History of Lollapalooza"]. ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]''. July 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Punk rock standbys like [[Moshing|mosh pits]] and [[crowd surfing]] became part of the canon of the concerts. These years saw great increases in the participatory nature of the event with the inclusion of booths for open-microphone readings and oratory, television-smashing pits and tattooing and piercing parlors.&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Robert. [http://thephoenix.com/Boston/News/24935-Lotta-palooza/ "Lotta-palooza"]. ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]''. August 14, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;du Pre, Jolie. "2009 Lollapalooza Hits Chicago's Grant Park". [[Associated Content]]. August 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1991, the festival included a second stage (and, in 1996, a third stage) for up-and-coming bands or local acts.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, David. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307050,00.html "Lollapalooza's Second Stage"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Jun 25, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Attendee complaints of the festival included high ticket prices as well as the high cost for food and water at the shows.&lt;ref&gt;Volpi, Matt. [http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1994/08/08-01-94tdc/08-01-94darts-column.asp "Lollapalooza festival alternates cool music with dumb people"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225182341/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1994/08/08-01-94tdc/08-01-94darts-column.asp |date=2007-12-25 }}. ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''. August 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival played at the Alpine Valley festival in East Troy, Wisconsin on August 29, 1992, and also at [[World Music Theater]] in [[Tinley Park, Illinois|Tinley Park, IL]] (near Chicago), where concertgoers ripped up chunks of sod and grass and threw them at each other and at the bands, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in damages to the venue.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Grunge band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] was scheduled to headline at the festival in 1994, but the band officially dropped out of the festival on April 7, 1994.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s body was discovered in [[Seattle]] the next day. Cobain's widow, [[Courtney Love]], made guest appearances at several shows, including the [[Philadelphia]] show at [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park|FDR Park]] (usually taking time given to her by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] vocalist/guitarist [[Billy Corgan]]), speaking to the crowds about the loss, then singing a minimum of two songs.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Farrell worked with rock poster artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans (T.A.Z.)]] to create a series of posters and the complete graphic decoration for the 1994 event, including two 70 foot tall Buddha statues that flanked the main stage.

In 1996, Farrell, who had been the soul of the festival, decided to focus his energy to produce his new festival project, [[Enit Festival|ENIT]], and did not participate in producing Lollapalooza.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Many fans saw the addition of [[Metallica]] in 1996 as contrary to the festival's prior practice of featuring "non-mainstream" artists,&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and described the crowds attracted by Metallica as being singularly focused on the headliner without respect for the other performing artists.&lt;ref name=rolling-stone-australia-oct-1996&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=Andrew|title=You Am I: "Time is on Our Side"|journal=Rolling Stone Australia|date=October 1996|issue=527|url=http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/flashback-you-am-i-time-is-on-our-side/2633-page-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, festival cofounder Farrell felt that Metallica's macho image violated his peaceful vision for the festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farber|first=Jim|title=Perry Farrell brings back Lollapalooza &amp; legendary band,too|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2003-07-13/entertainment/18248130_1_sacred-acts-classic-albums-strays|newspaper=Daily News|date=July 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; for alternative culture of the early 1990s was generally against macho behavior.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Mimi Schippers, ''Rockin' out of the Box: Gender Maneuvering in Alternative Hard Rock''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 2002. (Especially Chapter 1, and page 14.)&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell quit the tour in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Pillsbury, Glenn T. ''Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity''. New York: Routledge, 2006. See page 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the controversial Metallica tour, Lollapalooza made efforts to revive its relevance to audiences. The festival booked eclectic acts such as [[country music|country]] superstar [[Waylon Jennings]] in 1996, and emphasized heavily [[electronica]] groups such as [[The Orb]] and [[The Prodigy]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; 1997, however, would prove to be the final tour from the initial series of Lollapalooza tours. The festival failed to find a suitable headliner in 1998, and therefore announced Lollapalooza's cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4613736-1.html "Lollapalooza Cancelled"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. April 6, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation served as a signifier of alternative rock's declining popularity. In light of the festival's troubles that year, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said, "Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now."&lt;ref&gt;Weisbard, Eric. "This Monkey's Gone to Heaven". ''Spin''. July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival and rebirth===
In 2003, Farrell reconvened Jane's Addiction and scheduled a new Lollapalooza tour. The festival schedule included venues in 30 cities through July and August. The 2003 tour achieved only marginal success with many fans staying away, presumably because of high ticket prices.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Another tour scheduled for 2004 was to consist of a two-day festival taking place in each city. It was cancelled in June due to weak ticket sales across the country.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Farrell partnered with Capital Sports &amp; Entertainment (now [[C3 Presents]]), which co-owns and produces the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], to produce Lollapalooza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63172/pixies-weezer-panic-set-for-lollapalooza "Pixies, Weezer, Panic Set For Lollapalooza"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE, Farrell and the [[William Morris Agency]]—along with Charles Attal Presents—resurrected Lollapalooza as a two-day destination festival in 2005 in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], with an even greater variety of performers (70 acts on five stages) than that of the touring festival.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The festival was generally successful, attracting over 65,000 attendees, despite a 104 degree Fahrenheit Sunday (40 degrees Celsius) [[heat wave]] (two people were hospitalized for heat related illness).&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Whitney. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2005-07-23-lollapalooza-blog_x.htm "Live from Lollapalooza: An hour-by-hour report"]. ''[[USA Today]]''. July 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wehrle, Drew. [https://www.spin.com/2005/07/choose-or-lollapalooza/ "Choose or Lollapalooza"]. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. July 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It returned to Chicago on August 4–6, 2006. On October 25, 2006, the Chicago Park District and Capital Sports &amp; Entertainment agreed to a five-year, $5 million deal, keeping Lollapalooza at Grant Park in Chicago until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Andrew. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20061026/ai_n16803612 "Lollapalooza to rock city for 5 more years"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017171647/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20061026/ai_n16803612 |date=2007-10-17 }}. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' October 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Lollapalooza ran August 3–5 in 2007, August 1–3 in 2008, August 7–9 in 2009, August 6–8 in 2010, August 5–7 in 2011, August 3–5 in 2012, August 2–4 in 2013 and August 1–3 in 2014.   After a successful 2008 festival, another deal was signed to keep Lollapalooza in Chicago through 2018, guaranteeing the city $13 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kot, Greg.

Turn It Up (blog). ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, it was announced that Lollapalooza 2016 would be four days long, July 28 to July 31, to celebrate the event's 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alicia |last=Adamczyk |date=December 3, 2015 |title=Lollapalooza 2016 Will Last 4 Days, Cost 20% More |url=http://time.com/money/4135166/lollapalooza-2016-tickets-more-expensive-extra-day/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the festival kicked off on the 3rd of August celebrating its 26th year of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pick-your-stage-lollapalooza-2017-w492437|title=Pick Your Stage: Lollapalooza 2017|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the festival began on August 2 with a line-up of 180 bands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/lollapalooza/ct-lollapalooza-2018-best-and-worst-day-1-20180802-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tickets and pricing ===
Tickets to the biggest Lollapalooza edition, in [[Chicago]], are usually sold out extremely quickly. In the 2016 Lollapalooza, the four-day general passes sold out in about one day after they started the sale. The one-day passes sold even more quickly: they were gone less than three hours after organizers revealed the lineup for the four-day music festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Tracy |last=Swartz |date=March 23, 2016 |title=Lollapalooza 1-day general admission passes sell out in under 3 hours |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-lollapalooza-one-day-passes-sell-out-20160323-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this phenomenon, people who can not buy the passes try to get them through alternatives sources such as [[Craigslist]] and [[StubHub]]. This is a common practice, although the prices tend to be significantly higher on these websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/C-Notes/July-2013/Lollapalooza-Tickets/ |title=Where to Buy Lollapalooza Tickets Online |work=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]] |access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the festival experienced unusually slower sales so they released the lineup about 8 hours earlier.

In its earliest editions, the official passes used to cost $31.50. However, with its growth and prominent relevance on the music scenario, Lollapalooza passes' prices have been increasing substantially over the years. Comparing the weekend passes for Lollapalooza 2016, which cost $335, not including taxes and fees, with the ones for Lollapalooza 2015, which cost $275, the increase was more than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Adamczyk|first=Alicia |title=Lollapalooza 2016 Will Last 4 Days, Cost 20% More |url=http://time.com/money/4135166/lollapalooza-2016-tickets-more-expensive-extra-day/ |website=[[Money (magazine)|Money]] |access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price from 2015 to 2018 has remained the same without any increases.

==International expansion==

===Chile===
In 2010, it was announced that Lollapalooza would debut in South America, with a branch of the festival staged in [[Chile]]'s capital [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on April 2–3, 2011.

It is scheduled for September 12–13, 2015, the proposed location is the historical airport ground of [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Berlin-Tempelhof]]. In true Lollapalooza fashion, this urban location serves to incorporate regional partners in presenting international events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lollapalooza Heading to Berlin in 2015 {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6304575/lollapalooza-heading-to-berlin-in-2015|website = Billboard|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the official press release, festival founder [[Perry Farrell]] stated that, "Berlin's energy, [[Culture in Berlin|vibrant art]], [[German fashion|fashion]] and [[Music in Berlin|music]] scenes are a mirror reflection of what Lollapalooza is all about and I can’t wait to share in this cultural exchange".&lt;ref name="announce Berlin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pitchfork.com/news/57345-lollapalooza-announces-berlin-festival/ Lollapalooza Announces Berlin Festival: Taking place at Tempelhof Airport September 2015], pitchfork.com, 6 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lollapalooza Germany was produced by the Lollapalooza U.S. team in addition to Melt!

At change.org an on-line petition against the festival in the Treptower Park gathered over 6400 supporters. Citizens from the area have created working groups to stop the festival taking place in the Treptower Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/treptow-koepenick/buergerinitiative-will-lollapalooza-festival-verhindern|title=Bürgerinitiative will Lollapalooza-Festival verhindern|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been little communication with local inhabitants from either festival organizers or local government. People living directly next to the event location have received an invitation to move to a nearby hotel for the duration of the festival.

Fifty artists from around the world joined [[Theater Oobleck]] to create "Baudelaire In A Box."&lt;ref name="NPR: Poetry Of Failure Comes To Life At Chicago's 'Baudelaire In A Box'"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weissman|first1=Dan|title=Poetry Of Failure Comes To Life At Chicago's 'Baudelaire In A Box'|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/05/541844712/poetry-of-failure-comes-to-life-at-chicagos-baudelaire-in-a-box|publisher=NPR|accessdate=6 August 2017|date=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
On August 7, 2012, Perry Farrell announced that Lollapalooza will be debuting in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]]. Farrell described Israel as an "international music community that listens to everything we all listen to, but the artists weren’t traveling there so it was an opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lollapalooza music festival coming to Israel|url = http://www.jta.org/2012/08/08/arts-entertainment/lollapalooza-music-festival-coming-to-israel|website = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was scheduled for August 20–22, 2013 in [[Hayarkon Park]], the city's largest urban park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/perry-farrell-will-bring-lollapalooza-2013-israel/|title=Perry Farrell Will Bring Lollapalooza 2013 to Israel|publisher=Daniel Kreps |date=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the event has been postponed to an unknown date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=300707 |title=Report: Lollapalooza festival cancels Israel plans |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there was no definitive reasoning for the cancellation of the Israel date, various news sources report there are often financial challenges that attribute to producing a large-scale show with international artists within the political situation in the Mideast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lollapalooza Israel Canceled: 'We're Sorry' {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1521648/lollapalooza-israel-canceled-were-sorry|website = Billboard|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Recording engineer, guitarist, and journalist [[Steve Albini]] has criticized Lollapalooza for its corporatization of popularized "alternative" music.  In a 1993 interview, Albini commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Lollapalooza is the worst example of corporate encroachment into what is supposed to be the underground. It is just a large scale marketing of bands that pretend to be alternative but are in reality just another facet of the mass cultural exploitation scheme. I have no appreciation or affection for those bands and I have no interest in that whole circle. If Lollapalooza had [[The Jesus Lizard|Jesus Lizard]] and the [[Melvins]] and [[Fugazi]] and [[Slint]] then you could make a case that it was actually people on the vanguard of music. What it really is the most popular bands on MTV that are not heavy metal.&lt;ref name="obsolete.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/bigblack.html |title=Steve Albini 1993 |publisher=Obsolete.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981205205919/http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/bigblack.html |archivedate=1998-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both [[The Jesus Lizard]] and the [[Melvins]] have subsequently performed at the event.&lt;ref name="Lollapalooza 1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1995 |title=Lollapalooza 1995 |publisher=Lineup.lollapalooza.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806172859/http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1995 |archivedate=2013-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lollapalooza 1996"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1996 |title=Lollapalooza 1996 |publisher=Lineup.lollapalooza.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806185026/http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1996 |archivedate=2013-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, it was reported that [[Illinois Attorney General]] [[Lisa Madigan]] had launched an [[antitrust]] investigation into the festival for imposing [[radius clause]]s on acts, contractually stipulating that they could not perform in cities within 300 miles of Chicago—including cities as far as [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Milwaukee]]—for up to six months prior, and three months after Lollapalooza.&lt;ref name=rollingstone-lolla&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorney General Investigates Lollapalooza|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/attorney-general-investigates-lollapalooza-20100625|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall&gt;{{cite web|title=So maybe Coachella's booking rules aren't so egregious after all|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/so-maybe-coachellas-booking-rules-arent-so-egregious-after-all.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5066">The '''London Games Festival''' is an annual [[video gaming]] [[festival]] for both consumers and trade specialists held annually in April.

==Previous Years==

A previous London Games Festival ran until 2012 featuring a series of diverse events from the world of interactive entertainment. Video games publishers, developers, partners, personalities, trade organisations, media organisations and individuals were all involved in the week-long celebrations. The LGF provided the industry with the opportunity to showcase creativity and artistry, from script-writers to animators, musicians to programmers.

The Festival also worked to enhance perceptions of interactive entertainment and the industry by engaging with existing institutional advocates ([[BAFTA]], [[ELSPA]], [[DfES]], [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|DCMS]], [[BBFC]], [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]], LDA) and illustrating compelling and positive research while promoting future vision and horizons of the games industry. Alongside the week of media and/or consumer-facing events were a number of B2B events organised by the industry’s trade bodies and other organisations.

The festival was also complemented by a Fringe, an offshoot of the more mainstream and commercially focused Festival, with an abundance of interesting and diverse events for games and non-gamers alike.  Highlights in 2007 included:

The [[Soho Project]], that offered players a chance to take part in a mass ‘reality game’ on the streets of [[Soho, London|Soho]], via the website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fictionalmedia.co.uk |title = Fictional Media : The Soho Project |accessdate = 2008-06-27 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703202723/http://fictionalmedia.co.uk/ |archivedate = 2008-07-03 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games AV - a live concert, screening and club night features musicians, DJs, VJs, filmmakers, animators and digital artists whose work has been shaped by video games culture.

Sense of Play ran annually as part of the Fringe from 2005 - 2007. Each event was a one-day symposium which looked at the future of games design in its broadest sense featuring some of the most inspiring voices working in, around and beyond the games industry. The event was directed, curated and produced by Toby Barnes and Jon Weinbren. Plans are afoot for a relaunch which will look at the interplays and crossovers between games, film, television, theatre and other creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.senseofplay.com |title = senseofplay.com |accessdate = 2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, London Games Skills Week offered a week long series of seminars designed to attract new talent into the games industry from a broad spectrum of creative disciplines. A pop-up Games Fringe Cafe and drop-in lounge was set up at Soho TV and post-production training facility 01zero-one which was open to all festival attendees. 01zero-one also housed the ZeroGamer exhibition which featured "...games that play themselves, video documents of in-game performance, game engine experiments and challenging documentaries on gameplay."

[[File:Reginald Hine Minsden Chapel.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Memorial to [[Reginald Hine]] at Minsden Chapel]]
'''Minsden Chapel''' is an isolated ruined [[chapel]] in the fields above the hamlet of Chapelfoot, near [[Preston, Hertfordshire|Preston]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Today it is a roofless shell, partly surrounded by a small wood, and accessible only by footpath. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is Grade II Listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1347462|desc=|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It was built in the 14th century, and by the 17th century had
fallen into disrepair. Marriages continued here into the 18th century, until the crumbling masonry became too dangerous. One story says that a piece of falling stonework knocked the prayer-book out of a [[curate]]'s hand during the marriage ceremony of Enoch West and Mary Horn on the 11th of July 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Puttick, B. ''Ghosts of Hertfordshire'' (1994, Countryside Books) - chapter 14: "The Haunting of Minsden Chapel" p83 {{ISBN|1-85306-292-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century the chapel was closely associated with the historian [[Reginald Hine]] from nearby [[Hitchin]]. He frequently visited here, and eventually obtained a lifetime lease of the building from the vicars of Hitchin. So fond of the chapel was he, that he even bid ''"trespassers and sacrilegious persons take warning, for I will proceed against them with the utmost rigour of the law, and, after my death and burial, I will endeavour, in all ghostly ways, to protect and haunt its hallowed walls".''&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Reginald L. ''The History of Hitchin'', Vol II page 38 (1929, Allen and Unwin (London))&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief Hine is not buried at Minsden. His body was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium|Golders Green]] (London) and his ashes were subsequently scattered at the chapel. His family erected a memorial stone at the site, which was subsequently re-laid in its current grave-like horizontal position by them after it was damaged by vandals in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Richard ''The Ghosts of Reginald Hine'' (2007, Mattingley Press (Hitchin))&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Thomas William Latchmore, a local professional photographer and friend of Hine, took a photograph of a [[ghost]]ly monk at the Chapel. Rumours of [[paranormal activity]] first appeared around this time. The haunting most frequently reported is that of a single monk climbing stairs (which no longer exist) to the north-east area of the chapel; this is said to occur at midnight on [[Halloween]].
Other reported experiences include the sighting of a glowing cross on the wall, and the hearing of distant music or the ringing of the stolen bells. Legends also exist of a lost subterranean tunnel built during the time of the Crusades that extends to nearby [[Temple Dinsley]] and another of a murdered nun.

In an interview given in 1930 to [[Elliott O'Donnell]], a well-known contemporary writer on occult matters, Latchmore finally admitted that his 'Minsden Ghost' photograph was a hoax. He explained that the picture was the deliberate result of an experiment in the techniques of [[multiple exposure|double exposures]], a subject that interested him greatly at the time. Although Latchmore refused to disclose the identity of the individual who had posed as the ghostly figure, it seems likely that it was a young man well known for practical jokes, Latchmore's good friend Reggie Hine. Hine re-published the photograph in 1929 in his ''History of Hitchin'' but never admitted it was a fake nor his own part in it.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Richard ''The Ghosts of Reginald Hine'' pp113-116&lt;/ref&gt;

Paranormal investigator [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]] once spent a night there in the late 1940s, during which he claimed to have heard the sound of distant music and to have seen a white glowing cross on one of the walls, which disappeared and then reappeared, although he suggested "it could possibly have been a trick of the moonlight, as a full moon was shining down through the trees at the time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=No Common Task: Autobiography of a Ghost Hunter|last=Underwood|first=Peter|date=1983-11-16|publisher=George G.Harrap &amp; Co Ltd|year=|isbn=9780245539596|edition=1st|location=London|page=53|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconic arch of Minsden Chapel finally fell in 2008 due to time and erosion from the elements. In 2017, it was reported that the Church Commissioners for England, who own the site, were intending selling it to a "surrounding landowner", sparking fears that the public could lose access to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecomet.net/news/are-church-plans-to-sell-off-14th-century-grade-ii-listed-haunted-chapel-near-hitchin-an-own-ghoul-1-5013140|title=Are church plans to sell off 14th century Grade II-listed ‘haunted chapel’ near Hitchin an own ghoul?|last=Yousif|first=Layth|date=11 May 2017|work=[[The Comet (newspaper)|The Comet]]|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manafort often lobbied on behalf of foreign leaders such as former [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]], former dictator of the [[Philippines]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], former dictator of [[Zaire]] [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], and [[Angola]]n [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[UNITA|leader]] [[Jonas Savimbi]].&lt;ref name="Mufson-WP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients|title=Trump's new right-hand man has history of controversial clients and deals|last=Stone|first=Peter|date=April 27, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-04-13/trump-just-hired-his-next-scandal-lobbyist-paul-manafort|title=Trump Just Hired His Next Scandal|last=Lake|first=Eli|date=April 13, 2016|website=Bloomberg View|access-date=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying to serve the interests of foreign governments requires registration with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA); however, as of June 2, 2017, Manafort had not registered.&lt;ref name="Time_2017_Mueller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/exclusive-doj-won-t-say-if-sessions-is-recused-on-manafort-942096451556|title=Exclusive: DoJ won't say if Sessions is recused on Manafort|publisher=MSNBC|access-date=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On June 27, he retroactively registered as a [[foreign agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-trump-campaign-chairman-paul-manafort-files-as-foreign-agent-for-ukraine-work/2017/06/27/8322b6ac-5b7b-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html|title=Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort files as foreign agent for Ukraine work|last=Hamburger|first=Tom|website=The Washington Post|access-date=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manafort has been under investigation by multiple federal agencies. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) has had an active criminal investigation on him since 2014 regarding business dealings while he was lobbying for Yanukovych.

====Chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign====
In February 2016, Manafort approached [[Donald Trump]] through a mutual friend, [[Thomas J.

On June 9, 2016, Manafort, [[Donald Trump Jr.]], and [[Jared Kushner]] were participants in [[Trump campaign–Russian meeting|a meeting]] with Russian attorney [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]] and several others at [[Trump Tower]]. A British music agent, saying he was acting on behalf of [[Emin Agalarov]] and the Russian government, had told Trump Jr. that he could obtain damaging information on [[Hillary Clinton]] if he met with a lawyer connected to the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref name=NYT11july17&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Matt Apuzzo]]|last2=[[Jo Becker]]|last3=[[Adam Goldman]]|last4=[[Maggie Haberman]]|title=Trump's Son Heard of Link To Moscow Before Meeting – Russian Government Sought to Help Father and Hurt Clinton, Email Suggested|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html|accessdate=July 11, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 11, 2017|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Trump Jr. said the meeting had been primarily about the Russian ban on international adoptions (in response to the [[Magnitsky Act]]) and mentioned nothing about Mrs. Clinton; he later said the offer of information about Clinton had been a pretext to conceal Veselnitskaya's real agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Jo Becker]]|last2=[[Matt Apuzzo]]|last3=[[Adam Goldman]]|title=Trump Team Met Russian Offering Dirt on Clinton – Key Time in Campaign – Account Shows an Inner Circle Open to Using Foreign Help|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html|accessdate=July 11, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 10, 2017|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Manafort's connections to former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and his pro-Russian [[Party of Regions]] drew national attention in the US, where it was reported that Manafort may have received $12.7 million in off-the-books funds from the Party of Regions.&lt;ref name="ukraine"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html|title=Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump's Campaign Chief|last=Kramer|first=Andrew E.|date=August 14, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 15, 2016|last2=McIntire|first2=Mike|last3=Meier|first3=Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that members of Trump's family, particularly Jared Kushner who had originally been a strong backer of Manafort, had become uneasy about his Russian connections and suspected that he had not been forthright about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCaskill |first=Nolan |display-authors=etal |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/paul-manafort-resigns-from-trump-campaign-227197 |title=Paul Manafort resigns from Trump campaign |work=[[Politico]] |date=August 19, 2016 |quote=The [Trump] family was particularly troubled by reports of Manafort's involvement with Russia and felt he hadn't been entirely forthright about his activities overseas, the source said.

===Lobbying career===
In 1980, Manafort was a founding partner of Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm Black, Manafort &amp; Stone, along with principals [[Charles R. Black Jr.]], and [[Roger J. Stone]].&lt;ref name="NYT_Edsall_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_1989_BMSK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960803-1,00.html |title=The Slickest Shop in Town |first=Evan |last=Thomas |date=March 3, 1996 |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Peter G. Kelly]] was recruited, the name of the firm was changed to [[Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly]] (BMSK) in 1984.&lt;ref name="Choate_1990"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

Manafort left BMSK in 1996 to join [[Richard H. Davis]] and Matthew C.

====Association with Jonas Savimbi====
[[File:Jonas Savimbi.jpg|thumb|right|Manafort has represented Angolan rebel leader [[Jonas Savimbi]].]]
In 1985, Manafort's firm, BMSK, signed a $600,000 contract with [[Jonas Savimbi]], the leader of the Angolan rebel group [[UNITA]], to refurbish Savimbi's image in Washington and secure financial support on the basis of his anti-communism stance. BMSK arranged for Savimbi to attend events at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (where [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] gave him a laudatory introduction), [[The Heritage Foundation]], and [[Freedom House]]; in the wake of the campaign, Congress approved hundreds of millions of dollars in covert American aid to Savimbi's group.&lt;ref name="Foer"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/paul_manafort_isn_t_a_gop_retread_he_s_made_a_career_of_reinventing_tyrants.html|title = The Quiet American|last = Foer|first = Franklin|newspaper = Slate|date=April 28, 2016|access-date = August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, Manafort's continuing lobbying efforts helped preserve the flow of money to Savimbi several years after the Soviet Union ceased its involvement in the Angolan conflict, forestalling peace talks.&lt;ref name="Foer"/&gt;

====Lobbying for other foreign leaders====

[[File:Mobutu.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Manafort lobbied on behalf of former Zairean President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]].]]
Between June 1984 and June 1986, Manafort was a [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|FARA]]-registered lobbyist for [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Reagan Administration refused to grant Manafort a waiver from federal statutes prohibiting public officials from acting as foreign agents; Manafort resigned his directorship at OPIC in May 1986. An investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] found 18 lobbying-related activities that were not reported in FARA filings, including lobbying on behalf of [[The Bahamas]] and [[Saint Lucia]].&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/2018/07/11/mueller-wants-manafort-jury-to-hear-of-saudi-lobbying-in-1984 |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=July 12, 2018 |title=Mueller Wants Manafort Jury to Hear of Lobbying Decades Ago |first=David |last=Voreacos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Involvement in the Karachi affair====
Manafort wrote the campaign strategy for [[Édouard Balladur]] in the 1995 French elections, and was paid indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130804-karachi-affair-karachigate-us-political-consultant-new-clues-balladur-france-pakistan|title=US Consultant Admits Role in Karachi Affair|last=|first=|date=August 24, 2013|work=[[France 24]]|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money, at least $200,000, was transferred to him through his friend, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] arms-dealer Abdul Rahman al-Assir, from middle-men fees paid for arranging the sale of three French {{sclass-|Agosta|submarine|1}}s to Pakistan, in a scandal known as the [[Karachi affair]].&lt;ref name="Foer"/&gt;

====Association with Pakistani Inter-Service Intelligence Agency====
Manafort received $700,000 from the [[Kashmir]]i American Council between 1990 and 1994, supposedly to promote the plight of the Kashmiri people. However, an FBI investigation revealed the money was actually from Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] (ISI) agency as part of a disinformation operation to divert attention from terrorism. A former Pakistani ISI official claimed Manafort was aware of the nature of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/top-trump-aide-lobbied-for-1409744144007222.html|title=Top Trump aide lobbied for Pakistani spy front|last1=Isikoff|first1=Michael|date=April 18, 2016|work=[[Yahoo!

====HUD scandal====
In the late 1980s, Manafort was criticized for using his connections at [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] to ensure funding for a $43 million rehabilitation of dilapidated housing in [[Seabrook, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Riley |url=https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958215-2,00.html |title=Where Were the Media on HUD? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 24, 1989 |accessdate=August 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manafort's firm received a $326,000 fee for its work in getting HUD approval of the grant, largely through personal influence with [[Deborah Gore Dean]], an executive assistant to former HUD Secretary [[Samuel Pierce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-21/news/mn-2408_1_hud-housing-authority-housing-for-low-income-people|title = GOP Consultant Admits Using Influence to Obtain HUD Grant but Defends Action|last = Eaton|first = William J.|date = June 21, 1989|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|issn = 0458-3035|access-date = March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition to Ukraine====
Manafort's involvement in Ukraine can be traced to 2003, when [[Russian oligarch]] [[Oleg Deripaska]] hired [[Bob Dole]], Manafort's prior campaign candidate, to lobby the State Department for a waiver of his visa ban, primarily so that he could solicit otherwise unavailable institutional purchasers for shares in his company, RusAL.&lt;ref name="DMP"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/mccains-kremlin-ties/|title=McCain’s Kremlin Ties|last=Ames|first=Mark|date=October 1, 2008|website=[[The Nation]]|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSimpson"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117674837248471543|title=How Lobbyists Help Ex-Soviets Woo Washington|last=Simpson|first=Glenn|date=April 17, 2007|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920212025/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117674837248471543|archive-date=2015-09-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in early 2004, Deripaska met with Manafort's Partner, [[Rick Davis]], also a prior campaign advisor to [[Bob Dole]], to discuss hiring Manafort and Davis to return the former Georgian Minister of State Security, Igor Giorgadze, to prominence in Georgian politics.&lt;ref name="OVD"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-manaforts-overseas-political-work-had-a-notable-patron-a-russian-oligarch-1504131910|title=Paul Manafort’s Overseas Political Work Had a Notable Patron: A Russian Oligarch|last=Forrest|first=Brett|date=August 30, 2017|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830222840/https://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-manaforts-overseas-political-work-had-a-notable-patron-a-russian-oligarch-1504131910|archive-date=2017-08-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2004, however, Deripaska shelved his plans in Georgia and dispatched Manafort to meet with [[Rinat Akhmetov]] in Ukraine to help Akhmetov and his holding firm, System Capital Management, weather the political crisis brought by the [[Orange Revolution]].&lt;ref name="OVD" /&gt; [[Rinat Akhmetov|Akhmetov]] would eventually flee to Monaco after being accused of murder, but during the crisis Manafort shepherded [[Rinat Akhmetov|Akhemtov]] around Washington, meeting with U.S. Officials like [[Dick Cheney]].&lt;ref name="DMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GSimpson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OVD" /&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Orange Revolution]] would push Deripaska to also hire Davis-Manafort, this time to work for [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the [[Party of Regions]].&lt;ref name="pmsuOB" /&gt;

====Lobbying for Viktor Yanukovych and involvements in Ukraine====
[[File:Agência Brasil 2011 Viktor Yanukovich.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]], for whom Manafort lobbied]]
Manafort also worked as an adviser on the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Ukrainian presidential campaign]] of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (and his [[Party of Regions]] during the same time span) from December 2004 until the February [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]],&lt;ref name=YamontU&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politifact.com/global-news/article/2016/may/02/paul-manafort-donald-trumps-top-adviser-and-his-ti/ |first=Aleksandra |last=Kharchenko |title=Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's top adviser, and his ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine |work=[[PolitiFact.com]] |date=May 2, 2016 |accessdate=August 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/world/europe/30ukraine.html|title=Ukrainian Prime Minister Reinvents Himself|last=Levy|first=Clifford J.|date=September 30, 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmsuOB"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/us/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html|title=How Paul Manafort Wielded Power in Ukraine Before Advising Donald Trump|last=Myers|first=Steven Lee|date=July 31, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 31, 2016|last2=Kramer|first2=Andrew E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; even as the U.S. government (and U.S. Senator [[John McCain]]) opposed Yanukovych because of his ties to Russia's leader [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Manafort was hired to advise Yanukovych months after massive street demonstrations known as the [[Orange Revolution]] overturned Yanukovych's victory in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703630404575053850989810346|title=Candidates Sought Guidance From American Consultants|last=Boudreaux|first=Richard|date=February 9, 2010|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124215920/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703630404575053850989810346|archive-date=2016-01-24|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Borys Kolesnikov]], Yanukovych's campaign manager, said the party hired Manafort after identifying organizational and other problems in the 2004 elections, in which it was advised by Russian strategists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Manafort rebuffed U.S. Ambassador [[William B.

Returns from the presidential election gave Yanukovych a narrow win over Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], a leader of the 2004 demonstrations. Yanukovych owed his comeback in Ukraine's presidential election to a drastic makeover of his political persona, and—people in his party say—that makeover was engineered in part by his American consultant, Manafort.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2007 and 2008, Manafort was involved in investment projects with [[Russian oligarch]] Oleg Deripaska (the acquisition of a Ukrainian telecoms company) and [[Ukrainian oligarch]] [[Dmytro Firtash]] (redevelopment of the site of the former [[Drake Hotel (New York City)|Drake Hotel]] in [[New York City]]).&lt;ref name="MuinvG16816"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich |title=How Trump's campaign chief got a strongman elected president of Ukraine |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 16, 2016 |accessdate=August 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] has reported that Manafort negotiated a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska to promote Russian interests in politics, business, and media coverage in Europe and the United States, starting in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a/Manafort's-plan-to-'greatly-benefit-the-Putin-Government|title=Trump campaign chief linked to Putin interests|last=Horwitz &amp; Day|date=March 22, 2017|agency=Associated Press|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A witness at Manafort's 2018 trial for fraud and tax evasion testified that Deripaska loaned Manafort $10 million in 2010, which to her knowledge was never repaid.&lt;ref name="risefall" /&gt;

At Manafort's trial, federal prosecutors alleged that between 2010 and 2014 he was paid more than $60 million by Ukrainian sponsors, including Rinat Akhmetov, believed to be the richest man in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="risefall" /&gt;

In 2013, Yanukovych became the main target of the [[Euromaidan]] protests.&lt;ref name=VYBBCp/&gt; After the February [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] (the conclusion of Euromaidan), Yanukovych fled to Russia.&lt;ref name=VYBBCp&gt;{{cite news |date=February 28, 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182830 |title=Profile: Viktor Yanukovych |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=August 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26304842 |title=Ukrainian MPs vote to oust President Yanukovych |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 22, 2014 |accessdate=August 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 activities===
====Registering as a foreign agent====
Lobbying for foreign countries requires registration with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA). Manafort did not do so at the time of his lobbying. In April 2017, a Manafort spokesman said Manafort was planning to file the required paperwork; however, according to [[Associated Press]] reporters, as of June 2, 2017, Manafort had not yet registered.&lt;ref name="Time_2017_Mueller"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On June 27, he filed to be retroactively registered as a [[foreign agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-trump-campaign-chairman-paul-manafort-files-as-foreign-agent-for-ukraine-work/2017/06/27/8322b6ac-5b7b-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html|title=Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort files as foreign agent for Ukraine work|last=Hamburger|first=Tom|first2=Rosalind S.|last2=Helderman|date=June 27, 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, he disclosed that he made more than $17 million between 2012 and 2014 working for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/27/manafort-foreign-agent-ukraine-240027|title=Manafort registers as foreign agent|last=Meyer|first=Theodoric|date=June 27, 2017|work=Politico|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/28/politics/manafort-registers-foreign-agent/index.html|title=Former Trump campaign chairman registers as a foreign agent|last1=Perez|first1=Evan|date=June 28, 2017|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 2, 2017|last2=Devine|first2=Curt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kurdish independence referendum====
In mid-2017, Manafort left the United States in order to help organize the September 25, 2017, [[Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017|Kurdish independence referendum]], something that surprised both investigators and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/9/26/how-paul-manafort-is-profiting-from-kurdistans-independence-referendum|title=How Paul Manafort is profiting from the Kurdish independence referendum|last=Fouad|first=Sam|date=September 26, 2017|website=The New Arab|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927124626/https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/9/26/how-paul-manafort-is-profiting-from-kurdistans-independence-referendum|archive-date=2017-09-27|dead-url=yes|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hired by the [[President of Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraqi Kurdish Leader]] [[Masoud Barzani]]'s son [[Masrour Barzani]] who heads the [[Kurdistan Region Security Council|Kurdish Security Council]].&lt;ref name=NYT2017-09-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill2017-09-20&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/news/351679-manafort-working-on-kurdish-independence-referendum-report|title=Manafort working on Kurdish independence referendum: report|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=September 20, 2017|last=Greenwood|first=Max|access-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help Manafort's efforts in supporting Kurdish freedom and independence, his longtime associate Phillip M.

Since 2012, Manafort has taken out seven home equity loans worth approximately $19.2 million on three separate New York-area properties he owns through holding companies registered to him and his then son-in-law Jeffrey Yohai, a real estate investor.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/02/24/former-trump-campaign-manager-paul-manafort-took-out-19-million-in-puzzling-real-estate-loans/|title=Former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort Took Out $19 Million in Puzzling Real Estate Loans|last=Dayen|first=David|date=February 24, 2017|website=The Intercept|access-date=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Yohai declared [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] for [[Limited liability company|LLC]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s tied to four residential properties; Manafort holds a $2.7 million claim on one of the properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/la/2016/12/23/paul-manaforts-son-in-law-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-for-four-la-properties/|title=Paul Manafort's son-in-law files for bankruptcy protection for four LA properties|last=Chen|first=Cathaleen|date=December 23, 2016|newspaper=The Real Deal (Los Angeles)|access-date=February 24, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017|February}}, Manafort had about $12 million in home equity loans outstanding. For one home, loans of $6.6 million exceeded the value of that home; the loans are from the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, Illinois, whose CEO, [[Stephen Calk]], was a campaign supporter of Donald Trump and was a member of Trump's economic advisory council during the campaign.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In July 2017, New York prosecutors subpoenaed information about the loans issued to Manafort during the 2016 presidential campaign. At the time, these loans represented about a quarter of the bank's equity capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-seeks-bank-records-of-former-trump-associate-paul-manafort-1500327062|title=New York Seeks Bank Records of Former Trump Associate Paul Manafort|last=Rothfeld|first=Michael|date=July 17, 2017|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=July 21, 2017|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mueller investigation is reviewing a number of loans that Manafort has received since leaving the Trump campaign in August 2016, specifically, $7 million from Oguster Management Limited, a British Virgin Islands-registered company connected to Russian billionaire [[Oleg Deripaska]], to another Manafort-linked company, Cyprus-registered LOAV Advisers Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/paul-manafort-russia-trump.html|title=Manafort Was in Debt to Pro-Russia Interests, Cyprus Records Show|last=McIntire|first=Mike|date=July 17, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entire amount was unsecured, carried interest at 2%, and had no repayment date. Additionally, NBC News found documents that reveal loans of more than $27 million from the two Cyprus entities to a third company connected to Manafort, a limited-liability corporation registered in Delaware. This company, Jesand LLC, bears a strong resemblance to the names of Manafort's daughters, Jessica and Andrea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/manafort-had-60m-relationship-russian-oligarch-n810541|title=Manafort Had $60 Million Relationship With a Russian Oligarch|last=Petropoulos|first=Aggelos|date=October 13, 2017|publisher=NBC News|access-date=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
===FBI and special counsel investigation===
{{Main|Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)}}

===Congressional investigations===
In May 2017, in response to a request of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI), Manafort submitted over "300 pages of documents...included drafts of speeches, calendars and notes from his time on the campaign" to the Committee "related to its investigation of Russian election meddling".&lt;ref name="CNN_Perez_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/23/politics/manafort-documents-senate-intelligence/index.html |title=Manafort turns over hundreds of pages of documents to Senate intelligence |first=Evan |last=Perez |publisher=CNN|date=May 23, 2017 |access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, he met privately with the committee.&lt;ref name = Perez&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez|first1=Evan|title=Manafort subpoenaed by judiciary panel, met with Senate intel|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/paul-manafort-senate-russia-investigation/index.html|accessdate=July 25, 2017|publisher=CNN|date=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[congressional hearing]] on Russia issues, including the [[Trump campaign-Russian meeting]], was scheduled by the [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] for July 26, 2017.

''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper subsequently reported from a "well-placed source" that Manafort had met with [[Wikileaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] at least three times, including in the spring of 2016, around the time that Manafort was appointed convention manager by Trump. Assange, at the time taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, also reportedly met with a number of Russian nationals.

Manafort has "denied taking part in any collusion with the Russian state, but registered himself as a foreign agent retroactively after it was revealed his firm received more than $17m working as a lobbyist for a pro-Russian Ukrainian party."&lt;ref name="Borger_10/7/2017"/&gt;

On January 3, 2018, Manafort filed a lawsuit challenging Mueller's broad authority and alleging the Justice Department violated the law in appointing Mueller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/manafort-lawsuit-robert-mueller-authority/index.html|title=Manafort sues Mueller in Russia probe|last=Correspondent|first=Evan Perez, CNN Justice|work=CNN|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the department replied that "The lawsuit is frivolous but the defendant is entitled to file whatever he wants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/manafort-lawsuit-robert-mueller-authority/index.html|title=Manafort sues Mueller in Russia probe|first=Evan Perez, CNN Justice|last=Correspondent|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, Mueller asked U.S. District Judge [[Amy Berman Jackson]] to set Manafort's trial date for May 14, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/prosecutors-seek-may-14-trial-date-for-manafort-and-gates/2018/01/12/edc4655e-f7d0-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html|title=Prosecutors seek May 14 trial date for Manafort and Gates|last=Hsu|first=Spencer S.|date=January 12, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=January 13, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2018, Jackson denied the government's date for trial indicating that the criminal trial appeared likely to start in September at the earliest.&lt;ref name = Jackson&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/16/paul-manafort-trial-timeline-341128|title=Manafort trial likely to start in September at the earliest|work=POLITICO|access-date=January 17, 2018|first=Josh |last=Gerstein |date=January 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson revealed that a letter from Manafort's physician was submitted to the court, asking for changes in the conditions of Manafort's confinement. "While he's subject to home confinement, he's not confined to his couch, and I believe he has plenty of opportunity to exercise," Jackson said.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

On February 2, 2018, the Department of Justice filed a motion seeking to dismiss the civil suit Manafort brought against Mueller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Morin |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/02/justice-manafort-civil-suit-mueller-389077|title=DOJ seeks dismissal of Manafort civil suit against Mueller |work=[[Politico]] |date=February 2, 2018 |access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Jackson dismissed the suit on April 27, 2018, citing precedent that a court should not use civil powers to interfere in an ongoing criminal case.

Manafort allegedly used funds in these offshore accounts to purchase real estate in the United States, in addition to personal goods and services.&lt;ref name = Apuzzo/&gt;

On February 23, 2018, Gates pleaded guilty in federal court to lying to investigators and engaging in a conspiracy to defraud the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/us/politics/rick-gates-guilty-plea-mueller-investigation.html |title=Rick Gates, Trump Campaign Aide, Pleads Guilty in Mueller Inquiry and Will Cooperate |last=Mazzetti |first=Mark |date=February 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times |access-date=February 24, 2018 |last2=Haberman |first2=Maggie |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a spokesman, Manafort expressed disappointment in Gates' decision to plead guilty and said he had no similar plans.

On February 28, 2018, Manafort entered a not guilty plea in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Jackson subsequently set a trial date of September 17, 2018, and reprimanded Manafort and his attorney for violating her [[gag order]] by issuing a statement the previous week after former co-defendant Gates pleaded guilty.&lt;ref name="gile&amp;tracey"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/paul-manafort-pleads-not-guilty-charges-filed-after-gates-plea-n851936|title=Judge reprimands Paul Manafort for speaking out after Gates plea deal|last = Gile|first = Charlie|last2 = Connor|first2 = Tracey|work=NBC News|access-date=February 28, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 2018, Manafort also pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.

'''Priyadarshini Mattoo''' (July 23, 1970 - January 23, 1996) was a 25-year-old law student who was found [[rape]]d and [[murder]]ed at her house in [[New Delhi]] on January 23, 1996. On October 17, 2006, the [[Delhi High Court]] found Santosh Kumar Singh guilty on both counts of rape and murder and on October 30 of the same year [[Capital punishment|sentenced him to death]]. On October 6, 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment.
Santosh Kumar Singh, the son of a Police Inspector-General, had earlier been acquitted by a trial court in 1999, and the High Court decision was widely perceived in India as a landmark reversal. This decision went in favor because the facts were not presented correctly in the lower court.

==Significance of the case==

The acquittal of Santosh Singh in 1999 led to the investigating agency [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]], challenge the judgment in the [[Delhi high court]] on February 29, 2000.

Justices RS Sodhi and PK Bhasin of [[Delhi High Court]] shifted from a traditional lax pace, with hearings every few months, to a day-to-day trial and judgment was reached in 42 days. The original acquittal was overturned and Santosh Singh was found guilty of murder and rape.

The case is one of several in India that highlight the ineffectiveness of traditional criminal law system, especially when it comes to high-profile perpetrators, including the [[Murder of Jessica Lall]] and [[Sanjeev Nanda]] acquittals.

== Childhood ==

After Priyadarshini finished school from the Presentation Convent School in [[Srinagar]], she migrated with her family to [[Jammu]]. Priyadarshini received her [[BCom]] while in Jammu from MAM College, before being accepted to [[Delhi University]] to earn an [[LLB]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-07-23/delhi/27785034_1_priyadarshini-mattoo-indu-jalali-chaman-lal-mattoo | work=The Times Of India | title=Mattoo birthday: Memories, march for justice-Delhi-Cities-The Times of India | date=July 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during her time as a student in Delhi that Santosh Singh became besotted with her, and made indecent proposals. However, at one point, he started stalking her, and her family lodged several [[First Information Report|FIR]]s with the police. A police escort was provided for some time, but the stalking continued.

== The murder ==
Priyadarshini was in the third-year of her law program, when she was found strangled in her uncle’s  residence. She had been raped, struck 14 times with a motorcycle helmet, and finally strangled with a wire. Santosh Kumar Singh, her senior in college, had been stalking and harassing her for several years, and was the immediate suspect. But Santosh came from an influential family - his father J.P. Singh was then Inspector General of Police in Pondicherry &lt;ref&gt;indiankanoon.org&lt;/ref&gt; - in the course of the trial he served as Joint Commissioner of Police in Delhi, where the crime had been committed. In view of these connections, the court handed over investigation of the case to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI). In 1995, Priyadarshini had complained that Santosh Singh was harassing and stalking her. She had been provided with a personal security officer at the time. In retaliation, Santosh had lodged a complaint with the university alleging that she was pursuing two degrees simultaneously. However, it turned out that Priyadarshini had passed M.Com in 1991 and the complaint was merely malicious. On the morning of January 23, 1996, Santosh was seen knocking for entrance into Priyadarshini's uncle's house, where she was living, in the Vasant Kunj area of Delhi. A servant saw Santosh entering her house, apparently saying that he wanted a compromise in their legal complaints. Subsequently he raped her, strangled her with an electric wire and then battered her face beyond recognition with a motorcycle helmet. Santosh's presence in the house after the murder was also established by the prosecution.

==Trial Court Judgment==

Delivering the ironical and widely criticized judgment in the trial court proceedings in 1999, the Additional Sessions Judge. G.P. Thareja said of Santosh, that though he knew that "he is the man who committed the crime," he was forced to acquit him, giving him the benefit of doubt.

In a 450-page judgment the judge came down heavily on the role of Delhi Police; “There has been particular inaction by Delhi Police”, he said, while commenting that the accused’s father may have used his official position to influence the agencies. “The influence of the father has been there in the matter and there was deliberate inaction” (at the time his father was second in command of the police forces in Delhi).

The helmet was found with a shattered [[visor]] - however the evidence was so poorly presented that the defense was able to discount it.

He further stated that the rule of law doesn’t seem to apply to the children of those who enforce it.

The Delhi police according to the judge, attempted to assist the accused during the investigation and trial. "Lalit Mohan, the Inspector was instrumental in creating false evidence and false defense for the accused. The witnesses of the police including a Sub-Inspector deposed falsely".

The judgment held the CBI responsible for unfair investigation and failure to produce Virender Prasad, Mattoo’s household help, which resulted in the obstruction of justice.  The police had claimed Prasad had gone missing and was not traceable, yet  in the aftermath a journalist could easily find him in his Bihar village.

The judge added that the CBI fabricated the DNA test in the rape case as it was not obtained in accordance with the judicial procedure and could not therefore be admitted in evidence in view of Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act.

The "state  had failed to bring home the charge of rape against the accused", and while indicting Santosh as "the man who committed the crime", the judge was constrained to acquit him, because of "the benefit of doubt".

==High Court Appeal==
Following a public outcry, the CBI then appealed the district court's verdict in Delhi High Court on February 29, 2000. Initially, the trial was not a priority, and there was no presentation of evidence or hearings in the Delhi High Court well into 2006.  However, intense public scrutiny was mounted in the case after the acquittals in the [[Jessica Lal]] case, with Priyadarshini's aged father Chaman Lal Matoo making frequent appearances on TV, bringing the judiciary under intense pressure.

On August 31, 2006, six years after the initial appeal by CBI,  justices RS Sodhi and PK Bhasin took up the case on a day-to-day hearing basis, which is extremely rare in India. Judgment was reached within 42 days which is quite unprecedented.

===Verdict===
On October 17, 2006, Santosh Singh, who meanwhile had married and become a practising lawyer in Delhi itself, was found guilty under [[Indian Penal Code]] sections 302 (murder) and 376 (rape). The verdict blames G.P. Thareja's original judgment:
{{cquote|The trial judge acquitted the accused amazingly taking a perverse approach. It murdered justice and shocked judicial conscience.}}

In particular, the verdict held that there were no [[lacuna (law)|lacunae]] in the DNA testing, and that the combination of the forensic and circumstantial evidence was clinching. However, the bench agreed with the trial's court observation that police were reluctant to act on repeated complaints of harassment and stalking against Singh as his father was the senior [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officer (now retired) Director-General of Police J.P. Singh.

The verdict says "junior staff do not react to complaints against the relatives of their fraternity" and referred to the trial court's observation that the approach and working of the subordinate staff of Delhi Police clearly reflected that the rule of law "is not meant for those who enforce the law nor for their near relatives".

The verdict was reached on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence. Santosh's father J.P. Singh was in court. Priyadarshini's father expressed satisfaction that justice had been achieved ten years after the gruesome murder.

===Death penalty===

As recommended by the Central Bureau of Investigation the [[death penalty]] was awarded to Santosh Singh on October 30, 2006.&lt;ref name=death_penalty&gt;{{cite news 
 |last=Jain |first=Sandhya
 |title=Mattoo case: Justice delayed, denied and awarded

 |accessdate=20 May 2011 |date=12 November 2006
 |newspaper=Organiser
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronouncing its verdict, the court said the mitigating circumstances under which leniency was begged for Santosh was not enough and the brutal rape and murder does fall in the bracket of "rarest of rare" cases. Santosh was sitting just five-feet away from the jam-packed court. The court had convicted Santosh of the crime earlier that month.

The two-judge bench, comprising Justice R. S. Sodhi and Justice P. K. Bhasin, heard both sides before pronouncing the verdict. The court said Santosh Singh had been given many chances to reform by the police when Priyadarshini had complained that he was stalking her. However, he didn't mend his ways and eventually raped and killed her.

"There is absolutely no doubt in our mind that what was required of Singh was exemplary behaviour being a son of police officer and a lawyer himself. Yet with a pre-meditated approach, he continued to harass the victim for two years," the Bench said.

"In spite of repeated warnings by the police and his undertakings to them, he went about committing the most ghastly act. The act itself sent ripples in society and showed how insecure a citizen can get against this kind of a person," the Bench remarked.

==Supreme Court appeal==
Santosh Singh appealed against the death penalty sentence to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of India on February 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/20/stories/2007022017311100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Mattoo case: death sentence stayed | date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also issued a notice to the Central Bureau of Investigation on an appeal filed by the convict against the high court's judgment. The defense lawyers of the accused Santosh Singh questioned the validity of the [[DNA]] report, one of the main causes for which he was given the benefit of doubt in the Trial court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid-day.com/news/nation/2006/october/145832.htm Mid-Day - National News, Indian News, Complete coverage of news from India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Further the issue of [[Trial by Media]] is likely to be raised and whether excessive media coverage has influenced the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/mattoo-verdict-can-the-activist-media-take-a-bow/24221-3.html |title=Mattoo case: Media take a bow? |publisher=Ibnlive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Santosh Kumar Singh but reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/we-expected-death-sentence-mattoos-father/132474-3.html We expected death sentence: Mattoo's father] - IBN, 6 Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Priyadarshini's father expressed disappointment with the CBI for failing to appeal against this decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/priyadarshini-mattoos-father-blames-the-cbi/134472-3.html Priyadarshini Mattoo's father blames the CBI] - IBN, 6 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-conviction==
Santosh Singh, post conviction, barely spent 4 years behind bars and was out on parole in March 2011. Upon return, he subsequently filed another application for grant of parole (subject matter of Criminal Writ Petition 224/2012) before Delhi High Court. The High Court granted him a parole of another month on March 6, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhc_case_status_oj_list.asp?pno=608556 |title=Welcome to High Court of Delhi |publisher=Delhihighcourt.nic.in |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
"Seren Taun" is derived from [[Sundanese language]] ''seren'' that means "to give" and ''taun'' which means "year". Seren taun means the last year has given way to the new year, which means the transition between agriculture years. In Sundanese agriculture community, Seren Taun is the festival to express gratitude and thanksgiving to God for the blessing of rice harvest abundance, as well as to pray for the successful rice harvest in the next agriculture cycle.

Another specific definition of Seren Taun is to give the rice harvest and present it to community leader to be stored in communal barn ({{lang-su|leuit}})&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of ''leuit'': the main barn and the secondary barn. The main barn is held in high importance and considered sacred; it can be called ''leuit sijimat'', ''leuit ratna inten'', or ''leuit indung'' (mother barn). The secondary barns are called ''leuit pangiring'' or ''leuit leutik'' (small barn). ''Leuit indung'' contained the sacred rice seed, the ''pare ambu'' or ''pare indung'' (mother rice seed) covered in white cloth, and ''pare bapa'' or ''pare abah'' (father rice seed) covered in black cloth. ''Leuit pangiring'' (secondary barns) are rows of barns to store the offering rices when the main barn is already full.

== History ==

According to historical records as well as local traditions, Seren Taun is held annually since the era of [[Sunda Kingdom]]. The ceremony was started as a dedication to [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]], the goddess of rice in ancient Sundanese beliefs. Ancient Sundanese religion was influenced by animism and dynamism that revered the spirit of ''karuhun'' (ancestors) as well as unseen natural power identified as [[hyang]], and it is also influenced by [[Hinduism]]. Since ancient times Sundanese are agricultural community that revered natural power that give fertility in plants and animals, this natural divine power is identified as Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice and fertility. According to Sundanese beliefs her husband is Kuwera, the god of wealth. Both are symbolize in ''Pare Abah'' (father rice) and ''Pare Ambu'' (mother rice), signify the union of man and woman as the primordial symbol of fertility and family happiness. There is two kind of harvest ceremony in Sunda Kingdom; Seren Taun Guru Bumi that is held annually and Seren Taun Tutug Galur that is held only once every eight years. Seren Taun Guru Bumi held in Pakuan Pajajaran capital and various villages, while the Seren Taun Tutug Galur or also called Kuwera Bakti only held in Pakuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informasibogor.com/berita-utama/mengenal-upacara-seren-taun/ |title=Mengenal Upacara Seren Taun &amp;#124; Informasi Bogor &amp;#124; Berita &amp;#124; Kuliner &amp;#124; Wisata &amp;#124; Penginapan |publisher=Informasi Bogor |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seren Taun annually held in Sunda Kingdom and ceased after the fall of Sunda Pajajaran kingdom. Several decades later the ceremony revived in Sindang Barang, Kuta Batu and Cipakancilan village, and continued until it ceased in the 1970s. After 36 years pause, the ceremony was revived again in 2006 at Sindang Barang cultural village, Pasir Eurih, Sari,Bogor. The Seren Taun Guru Bumi celebrated again to revived cultural identity of Sundanese people.&lt;ref name="tempo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/2011/03/21/IMZ/mbm.20110321.IMZ136225.id.html |title=Majalah Tempo Online |publisher=Majalah.tempointeraktif.com |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cigugur, Kuningan, Seren Taun is held every 22 Rayagung, the last month of Sundanese calendar. The ceremony is concentrated in [[pendopo]] Paseban Tri Panca Tunggal, the residence of prince Djatikusumah, constructed in 1840. The adherents of native [[Sunda Wiwitan]] belief still celebrate this annual harvest festival, such as Kanekes ([[Baduy people|Baduy]]) people, Kasepuhan Banten Kidul, and Cigugur. Today most of Sundanese are Muslim, however this tradition is still survived and celebrated although the prayer is now conducted in Islamic way.

== Rituals ==

The Seren Taun rituals are different and varied among each villages, however the main ritual is the procession to presenting the rice to community leader. This rice are put into main ''leuit'' (rice barn) and secondary rice barns. The community leader later gave ''indung pare'' (mother of rice) that already blessed to the villages leaders to be planted in next agriculture cycle.

In some villages the rituals usually started with the collections of waters from several sacred water springs. Usually the water are collected from seven water springs in small jars to be united in one large water vessel, the water is blessed through prayers and considered sacred. The sacred water is later sprinkled upon people present in the festival, it is considered potent and would bring good luck and good fortunes for the people. The next rituals is ''sedekah kue'', people brought traditional cakes, delicacies and also [[tumpeng]] on wooden palanquin. The cake later is fought among villagers as it is believed to bring good luck, and the tumpeng rice is distributed among the people to be consumed together. The slaughtering of water buffalo might also become the part of rituals, the meat is later distributed to the poor families in the village. Later in the night the [[wayang golek]] performance is held in the village main communal building.&lt;ref name="tempo"/&gt;

The main ritual of seren usually started in 08.00 in the morning, started with ''ngajayak'' procession (procession to bring and presenting the rice), continued with three mass performances; ''buyung'' dance, ''angklung baduy'' and ''angklung buncis'' [[angklung]] music performance, usually performed during seren taun in Cigugur. The ritual started with prayer to express gratitude to God for the abundance of harvest. Ngajayak main ritual is the presenting of rice from villagers to community leader to be stored in main barn, the rest is stored in secondary barns. Some of the rice is later rhythmically pounded together by women using wooden mortars and pestles. Some of blessed rice seed is placed in pavilion called ''Pwah Aci Sanghyang Asri'' ([[Sri|Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]]), and this rice seed is sought and fought by villagers as it is also believed to bring good fortune.

In Cigugur, Kuningan, Seren Taun is started on 18 Rayagung. Several traditional Sundanese cultural performances is also demonstrated, such as [[pencak silat]], Sundanese dances, nyiblung (water music), suling rando, tarawelet, karinding, and suling kumbang of [[Baduy people|Baduy]] people.

[[File:Te Matatini 2015 028.jpg|thumb|Te Matatini in 2015 in [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]], Christchurch]]
'''Te Matatini''' is a national Māori performing arts festival in which ''[[kapa haka]]'' performers from all around Aotearoa (New Zealand) compete in the Te Matatini festival. The name was given by Professor Wharehuia Milroy, a composite of ''Te Mata'' meaning ''the face'' and ''tini'' denoting ''many'' — hence the meaning of ''Te Matatini'' is ''many faces''.

The Te Matatini festival is held every two years in different regions of New Zealand. Authority (''mana'') is given to different tribes (''iwi'') to host the festival. For example, in 2017 the ''mana'' was given to [[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]] on behalf of the [[Ngāti Kahungunu]] (''Heretaunga'') region.

Mead (2003) explains, Mana is undergone by a set of rules before it is given, the people or person in charge has to accept these constraints and strive to rise above them in order to do the job that is set before them.

Te Matatini is seen as playing a very important role within Maoridom in promoting the tikanga of the Māori culture and ''Kapa Haka.'' It provides a valuable experience for the people of New Zealand and others from all around the world, with the festival attracting up to 30,000 participants and spectators. Te Matatini celebrates the Maori culture, its beauty, and its core values. Kapa Haka is a form of Maori identity and contributes to New Zealand being unique.

The Te Matatini Society is the driving force behind Te Matatini National Kapa Haka Festival. Initially emerging in the late 1960s, it has evolved into the sponsor of a variety of Maori festivals and Polynesian events. The society in its current form was established in 1972 and has focused on the long term nurturing of Maori performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Te Matatini Society, "Te Matatini National Kapa Haka Festival," ''Bay of Plenty Times,''  February, 19-22, 2009, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

They must perfect every discipline in a polished 25-minute performance.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Discipline !! Explanation
|-
| '''Waiata tira (optional)''' || The choral is used to warm up the group or is good to put ''rangimarie (peace)'' upon the group to settle nerves. This item is optional and not compulsory.
|-
| '''Whakaeke(entrance song)'''  || This is where groups can make a statement in which who they are, where they come from, what the purpose is. It involves a lot of movement and choreography around the stage, and involves much discipline.
|-
| '''Moteatea''' || The moteatea is a traditional chant or dirges, however there are more contemporary styles being used in the more present times.
|-
| '''Waiata-a-ringa''' || The action song is where performers are using hand and body actions, much emphasis is placed on the hands, face, body and eyes to combine actions to words of the song. Ngata &amp; Armstrong (2002) state that, ''“the action song is not a series of drill movements but a rhythmic expression of moods and emotions”'' (p.&amp;nbsp;9).
|-
| '''Poi'''  || The [[Poi (juggling)|Poi]] is an item that is done mostly by women, but can be done by men. This item is known for its gracefulness and poise, utilising a poi (round ball) connected to a plaited cord that exhibits beauty and style. 
|-
| '''Haka''' || ''Tanerore'', “the offspring of Te Ra and Hineraumati gave the personification of hot quivering air,who danced in the summer heat, which was known as ''Te Haka a Tanerore'' (the haka of Tanerore” (Reed, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;399). The [[Haka]] is also used to make a statement against political matters, issues in Maori society, and barriers and challenges that Maori face today. It is also known as an expression of New Zealand identity. Karetu (1993) states that “of the Maori dance repertoire it can be said that the haka is the most eagerly anticipated wherever there is a performance” (pg. 80).
|-
| '''Whakawatea''' || The item is the exit song for the group. This gives the group the opportunity to leave a final statement, and reinforce what they came to do, who they are and thank the ''tangata whenua ‘home people’'' for hosting the event.
|-
| '''Te Reo''' || Also known as the Maori language, this discipline is the pinnacle of all disciplines.
|-
| '''Manukura Wahine/Manukura Tane or Kaitataki Wahine/Kaitataki Tane'''|| Female and male leaders where both show their roles from on and off the stage. These include; [[Karanga (Māori culture)|karanga]] (the calling), ''mihimihi'' (speeches), how the leaders present themselves within their groups in terms of leadership and how they carry themselves for the group.
|-
| '''Kakahu''' || This is the dress form, groups are judged on dress style. This item recognises the skills of weavers, moko and tuhi kiri (tattoo) artists, and carvers.

'''The Great British Cheese Festival''', is a [[festival]] held in Wales (previously held in the South or West of England) on the last weekend of every September.

== History ==
The first annual event was held in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodfestival.co.uk/page.php?Plv=2&amp;P1=3&amp;P2=26&amp;P3|title=Ludlow Food Festival – the original food festival|website=Ludlow Food Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oxfordshire]], and was founded by Juliet Harbutt. Each year it is preceded by the ''[http://www.thecheeseweb.com/british-cheese-awards British Cheese Awards]'', a ceremony which she created in 1994, judged by food experts and farmers, in which the best cheeses are awarded bronze, silver and gold medals.  All cheeses are tasted blind, and the winners can then display their awards during the public-attended festival.  There are usually a variety of events at the festival such as seminars, masterclasses, and cheesemaking demonstrations. &lt;ref&gt;http://epicurean-traveler.com/cardiff-and-the-great-british-cheese-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years in Oxfordshire the event moved to [[Cheltenham]] in Gloucestershire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/festivals/2005/cheese_festival.shtml|title=BBC – Gloucestershire Festivals – The Cheese Olympics come to Cheltenham|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 2006 the Sunday of the weekend was cancelled at great cost after the venue experienced flooding, and the decision was made to return to Oxfordshire in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dine-online.co.uk/foodie/great-british-cheese-festival-2007/|title=Great British Cheese Festival 2007|date=17 September 2007|website=dine-online.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2008 the festival was sold to Cardiff Council; subsequently the event has been in the grounds of [[Cardiff Castle]] in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

The 2012 Great British Cheese Festival will be held at Cardiff Castle on Saturday, September 22, and Sunday, September 23.

'''Triplemanía I''' (Referred to as just "Triplemanía" the first year) was the first ever [[Triplemanía]] ''[[lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]] show promoted by [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). The show took place on April 30, 1993 in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]'s [[Plaza México|Plaza de Toros]] [[bullfighting]] arena. The Main event featured a "Retirement" match between [[Konnan]] and [[Cien Caras]], where the [[Narrative thread|storyline]] was that the person that lost would have to retire from professional wrestling. The match was billed as the first time such a stipulation had ever been used in ''Lucha Libre'', while it was rare, retirement matches had happened in Mexico before that time. The semi-main event featured the zenith of the storyline feud between [[Perro Aguayo]] and [[Máscara Año 2000]] as the two fought in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, where Aguayo put his hair on the line and Máscara Año 2000 bet his [[wrestling mask]] on the outcome of the match.

The show was the first major show for AAA, taking place just short of a year after [[Antonio Peña]] and a number of wrestlers broke away from [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) to establish AAA. With time the annual Triplemanía show(s) would become AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of [[WrestleMania]] or their [[Super Bowl]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April, 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña's ideas included playing up the show aspects of wrestling, elaborate entrances, fireworks and shows that would rival those put on by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), particularly their [[WrestleMania]] shows. Originally he wanted to hold three shows of that caliber close together, which combined with the nickname for AAA, Triple A, led to him creating the [[Triplemanía]] concept. In 1993 they only put on one Triplemanía show but in subsequent years Peña's vision for multiple Triplemanías would come true.&lt;ref name="Trip2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-a | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = July 11, 2015| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2B"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-b | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = July 11, 2015| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2C"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-c | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = July 11, 2015| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peña and the AAA management staff booked the ''[[Plaza México|Plaza de Toros]]'' [[bullfighting]] arena for the first Triplemanía event, which was considered a huge financial gamble for a promotion that was not even one year old.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena could normally accommodate 41,262 spectators for bullfighting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lamexico.com/historia.php |title=Historia de la Plaza México |publisher=Plaza México |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with additional seats on the actual floor of the arena around the ring the capacity grew to over 48,000.

===Storylines===
[[Image:LaParka.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[La Parka]] challenged for the [[Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship]].]]
The Triplemanía I event featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

To help make the show a success Peña relied greatly on the rivalry between [[Konnan]] and [[Cien Caras]] to sell tickets. Konnan and Cien Carasa had been rivals back when both were in CMLL, in fact Konnan had defeated Cien Caras in a tournament final to become the first [[CMLL World Heavyweight Championship|CMLL World Heavyweight Champion]] and Caras had later won the title from Konnan, holding the title when they both jumped from CMLL to AAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter = MEXICO: EMLL CMLL Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre heavyweight Title | page = 395 |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had previously wrestled each other in the main event of the [[EMLL 58th Anniversary Show]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;CMLL was previously known as Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre but changed their name in 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rivalry was a natural one between the charismatic ''tecnico'' Konnan and the cheating ''rudo'' Cien Caras, especially when he brought his brothers [[Universo 2000]] and [[Máscara Año 2000]] to help him gain an unfair advantage during matches. With his growing popularity Konnan was offered several roles on TV and had hopes of pursuing an acting career, which led to Peña and Konnan devising the idea of a "retirement match" stipulation for the Triplemanía main event. It was billed as if it was the first time ever such a stipulation had been used in Mexico, which was more a work of marketing than fact but was a stipulation that helped sell out the ''Plaza del Toros'' stadium.&lt;ref name=TripleMania1SL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2009/02/20/imagenes-del-pasado-se-acercaba-el-aniversario-de-triple-a/ | title=1993: Se acercaba Triplemanía I | date=February 20, 2009 | accessdate=July 11, 2015 | work=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish | first=Sergio | last=Ssio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The under-card matches were all held under "single fall" rules and not the traditional [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls match|best two-out-of-three falls]] rule that most ''lucha libre'' matches used at that point. That stipulation was saved for the championship match, the ''Apuesta'' match and the main event. Prior to the show opening Televisa commentator Arturo Rivéra showed shots from outside the ''Plaza del Toros'' where people were being turned away as the bullfighting arena was at maximum capacity. Besides the paid attendance in ''La Plaza del Toros'' an estimated 6,000 fans watched the show from the arena's parkinglot where AAA had erected giant screen televisions to accommodate the additional fan interest.&lt;ref name=YIR1993/&gt;

For the [[Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship]] match between [[Lizmark]] and [[La Parka]] Lizmark had [[Super Parka|Volador]] in his corner, who was the uncle of La Parka. La Parka had Solomon Grundy in his corner for the match. The title match originally ended in a 15-minute time limit draw without either wrestler even winning a single fall. Both Lizmark and La Parka requested five more minutes, which was approved by a representative of the Mexico City boxing and wrestling Commission. During the final five minutes Lizmark is able to pin La Parka and retain the championship.&lt;ref name=YIR1993/&gt; The mixed ''Trios'' match that pitted [[Máscara Sagrada]], [[Art Barr|Love Machine]], and [[Mascarita Sagrada]] against [[Jerry Estrada]], [[Blue Panther]], and [[Mini Psicosis|Jerrito Estrada]] was broken down into the two main storylines; Love Machine/Blue Panther and the Sagradas against the Estradas for most of the match. In a call back to the ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match between Blue Panther and Love Machine the previous year Panther used a [[piledriver (professional wrestling)#kneeling reverse piledriver|Kneeling reverse piledriver]], a move that according to ''lucha libre'' traditions is outlawed and led to Pather's disqualification. To underscore the "lethal" nature of the move Love Machine was checked on by ringside physicians and removed from the ring on a stretcher.&lt;ref name=YIR1993/&gt;

During the main event cameras panned to the front row where former [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) wrestler [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] was seated, with the storyline explanation being that he bought a ticket to the show and was supposedly just there as a fan. During the first fall of the match Roberts kept distracting Konnan, yelling loudly and reaching out towards him as he passed by on the outside of the ring. After losing the first fall to Cien Caras Konnan got into a fight with Roberts at ringside, diverting his attention from the referee's count and failed to get back in the ring before he was counted out. Due to the count out Konnan was forced to retire and Jake Roberts immediately became one of the most hated ''rudo'' wrestlers in AAA by the end of the show.&lt;ref name=YIR1993/&gt;

In 2016 [[La Parka II|La Parka]] (second version) revealed that he was one of the wrestlers who worked the security detail for the first show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2016/07/28/rumbo-a-triplemania-xxiv-grandes-sorpresas-en-el-cartel/ | title=Rumbo a Triplemanía XXIV, grandes sorpresas en el cartel | date=July 28, 2016 | accessdate=July 29, 2016 | first=Jose | last=Vaca | publisher=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Eddie Guerrero on SmackDown cropped.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Eddy Guerrero]], became a major ''rudo'' in AAA after teaming up with [[Art Barr|Love Machine]].]]
Konnan took time off from wrestling to pursue his acting career, but it did not turn out as he had expected and Konnan returned to AAA four months later. Peña and AAA used the controversial finish to the match as a storyline to explain that Konnan had petitioned the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission to reinstate his wrestling license and allow him to return.&lt;ref name=YIR1993/&gt; He returned to AAA and immediately continued his feud with Cien Caras as well as continue the storyline with Jake Roberts, facing and defeating both of them at AAA's ''La Revencha'' show on August 28, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=43090 | title=AAA LA Revencha | date=August 28, 1993 | accessdate=July 12, 2015 | publisher=Cagematch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline would expand and pit Konnan against Robers as well as his newfound allies [[Eddy Guerrero]] and Love Machine, better known as ''[[Los Gringos Locos|La Pareja del Terror]]'' ("The Terror Team") while Konnan had back up in the form of [[Blue Panther]] and [[Perro Aguayo]]. Roberts and ''La Pareja del Terror'' defeated Konnan, Aguayo and Blue Panther in the main event of ''La Lucha del Honor'' in the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=43138 | title=AAA La Lucha del Honor | date=November 12, 1993 | accessdate=July 12, 2015 | publisher=Cagematch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline with Jake Robers culminated a year after it started at [[Triplemanía II-C]], as Konnan defeated Jake Roberts in a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match, forcing Roberts to be shaved bald.&lt;ref name="Trip2C"/&gt;

The storyline between Blue Panther and Love Machine continued past Triplemanía, with the two facing off in another ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match two months after Triplemanía. During the match the previously ''tecnico'' Love Machine began to act more and more like one of the bad guys, berating his opponent during the match, pulling Panther's shoulders off the mat during pinfalls etc. In the end he intentionally and in full view of the referee Love Machine used the piledriver move on Blue Panther, drawing both the disqualification and disapproving boos from the crowd. While he was shaved bald as a result Love Machine did not seem to care, celebrating that he hurt Blue Panther. With one match AAA flipped the roles of Love Machine and Blue Panther, turning Panther ''tecnico'' out of sympathy and making Love Machine an arrogan anti-Mexican ''rudo''. In a subsequent match where Love Machine and a partner wrestled ''La Pareja Atomica'' ("The Atomic Team") of [[El Hijo del Santo]] and Eddy Guerrero, Love Machine stole El Hijo del Santo's mask, put it on and then attacked Guerrero pretending to be El Hijo del Santo. Moments later he returned the mask to El Hijo del Santo and ducked out of the ring as Guerrero came to. At this point Guerrero attacked his own partner, leaving with Love Machine after the match. Together Guerrero and Love Machine would become known as ''La Pareja del Terror'' ("The Terror Team") and formed the basis of a group known as ''[[Los Gringos Locos]]'' that became the most hated  ''rudo'' team, not just in AAA but in all of Mexico at the time.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;&lt;ref name=EGBook94&gt;{{cite book | last1=Guerrero | first1=Eddie| first2=Michael | last2=Krugman | title=Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story | page=94 | date=December 20, 2005 | publisher=Simon and Schuster | isbn=0-7434-9353-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAOficial&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/historia/when-worlds-collide.html | title= El evento que comenzo la revolucion mundial | publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] | accessdate=June 27, 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
John Molinario, who writes about wrestling for the [[Canadian Online Explorer]], stated that the first Triplemanía show demonstrated that AAA "had arrived and they weren't going anywhere."&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that it was a "stellar card" and set the standard for ''lucha libre'' from that point on.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; Wrestling commentator and ''lucha libre'' expert [[Mike Tenay]] noted that  "To be able to take the lion's share of the market like that so immediately sort of put AAA as a promotion on the map. Pena's own marketing plan for Mexican wrestling was so revolutionary he was on top for that era. With a promotion that was less than a year old he did a tremendous job of creating stars."&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

'''White Wonderland''' is an [[electronic music]] [[music festival|festival]] co-organized by [[Insomniac Events]] and fellow club promoter Giant. The event was first held for [[New Year's Eve]] in 2011, following the announcement that Insomniac had pulled out of co-organizing the New Year's Eve festival [[Together as One (festival)|Together as One]] due to conflicts with its fellow organizer Go Ventures.

==History==
From 1999 to 2011, Insomniac had partnered with Go Ventures to organize [[Together as One (festival)|Together as One]], an annual festival historically held on New Year's Eve at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]. Shortly prior to the 2011 event, Insomniac founder Pasquale Rotella announced that they would no longer co-produce Together as One, due to "various issues" surrounding Go Ventures' commitments to "safety, production quality and the overall value of our fans' experience." Rotella also felt that there were conflicts between his creative visions and those of Go Ventures' Reza Gerami.&lt;ref name=latimes-split/&gt;

At the same time, Rotella announced that Insomniac would partner with the club promoter Giant to form a new, competing New Year's Eve event known as White Wonderland, a two-night festival which would be held at the [[Anaheim Convention Center]] on December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2012.&lt;ref name=latimes-split&gt;{{cite web|last=Amter|first=Charlie|title=Together as One promoters split|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/23/entertainment/la-et-night-together-as-one23-20111223|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocr-ww&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Eric|title=Up to 29,000 to attend O.C.

==Editions==
The inaugural 2011–12 edition of White Wonderland was a two-night event, headlined by [[Benny Benassi]], [[Dada Life]], [[Paul Van Dyk]], and [[Steve Angello]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]].&lt;ref name=thr-ww11&gt;{{cite web|last=Amter|first=Charlie|title=Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia's Steve Angello to Headline New Insomniac NYE Event|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kaskade-steve-angello-white-wonderland-268252|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event concluded with a total of 24,000 attendees across both nights, with Saturday night hosting a sell-out crowd of 14,000 attendees.&lt;ref name=ocr-ww11post&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Eric|title=24,000 attend Anaheim rave; 1 minor arrest|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/year-334102-white-anaheim.html|work=Orange County Register|date=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012–13 edition would be reduced to a one-night event on New Year's Eve, and featured performances by [[Above &amp; Beyond (band)|Above &amp; Beyond]], [[Avicii]], [[Bingo Players]], [[Dash Berlin]], Dannic, [[Ferry Corsten]], [[Hardwell]], [[Madeon]], [[Sebastian Ingrosso]], and [[Tritonal (band)|Tritonal]].&lt;ref name=ocw-top52013&gt;{{cite web|last=Loera|first=Alejandra|title=The Top Five EDM Parties on New Year's Eve|url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/12/the_top_five_edm_nye_parties.php?page=2|work=OC Weekly|date=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
