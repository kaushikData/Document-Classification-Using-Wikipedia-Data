'''''2000 Weeks''''' (also known as '''''Two Thousand Weeks''''') is a 1969 Australian [[drama film]] directed by [[Tim Burstall]].

==Plot==
Will, a writer in his thirties, faces a crisis in his life when he has to choose between his wife and mistress. He is also on the fence about choices in his professional life, something that is accentuated when he meets a childhood friend who has become a successful TV producer in England. He calculates he has two thousand weeks left in his life to achieve success.

==Cast==
*Mark McManus as Will Gardiner
*Jeanie Drynan as Jacky Lewis
*Eileen Chapman as Sarah Gardiner
*David Turnbull as Noel Oakshot
*Michael Duffield as Will's father
*Stephen Dattner as Sir George Turnbull
*Bruce Anderson as Rex Stapleton

==Production==
Eltham Films was a production company formed by Tim Burtstall and Patrick Ryan which had made a number of short films and TV series. They made the film as a co-production with Senior Films, a large production house in Melbourne who specialised in making commercials.&lt;ref name="pike"&gt;Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Burstall later said that 45% of the budget came from Eltham Films, 45% from Senior Films and 10% from Peter Lord at Victorian Film Laboratories.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;Murray, Scott 'Tim Burstall', ''Cinema Papers'' Sept-Oct 1979 p491-493&lt;/ref&gt; His idea was to make a movie for the international art house market.&lt;ref name="tim"&gt;[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Tim+Burstall&amp;bl&amp;PHPSESSID=b84a60315abeb35485367633c6533d29 Interview with Tim Burstall, 30 March 1998] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115011440/http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Tim+Burstall&amp;bl&amp;PHPSESSID=b84a60315abeb35485367633c6533d29 |date=15 November 2013 }} accessed 14 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming started on 2 January 1968 and took eleven weeks with a crew of fourteen.&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt;

The film was autobiographical, with "two thousand weeks" being an expression Burstall used in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanreviewmag.com/books/Australian-exotica Peter Coleman, 'Australian Exotica: A rare glimpse into the daily routine of a bohemian from Down Under', ''American Review''] accessed 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Burstall secured Columbia Pictures as a distributor and they agreed to split the $10,000 in marketing costs with Elthan Films, but it took them seven months to release it, but Burstall put this down to the reluctance of Australian exhibitors to show local films.&lt;ref name="murray"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film was poorly received by Australian critics such as [[Colin Bennett (critic)|Colin Bennett]] of ''The Age'' and at Australian film festivals. It received a better critical reception overseas. The experience encouraged Burstall to move in a more commercial direction for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt; However he did later explore many of the themes from ''2000 Weeks'' again in ''Petersen'' (1974).&lt;ref name="tim"/&gt;

Burstall later said of the film:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have a special place in my heart for it, because it was my first feature and in some ways autobiographical. But I wince when I see it, except for the few energy points which are mainly in the flashbacks. I think of the first ten years of my film work, up to and including ''2000 Weeks'' as my apprenticeship... I don't believe the acting in ''2000 Weeks'' is bad so much as a question of actors being asked to say unsayable things, and act unactable things. It was too deficient in energy and too much of it was in an intellectualised form, instead of action.&lt;ref name="murray"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[David Stratton]] wrote of it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''2,000 Weeks'' was an important film; important for what it had to say, important in the courage it took to make it in the first place. It deserved a fair go, and it didn't get it. Doubtless Collin Bennett would try to justify his attitude by saying that he judges every film by the same inviolable standard of excellence, and that in the light of this rigid philosophy, ''2,000 Weeks'' was found wanting. Doubtless. But his attitude was unbearable righteous and helped create a climate in which  good film could be destroyed. No wonder Burstall never forgave, or forgot. No wonder he never made the mistake of trying to produce a "serious" film again.&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1980 p23-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film was also entered into the [[6th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1969"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1969 |title=6th Moscow International Film Festival (1969) |accessdate=2012-12-20 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194825/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1969 |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Byrnes from the [[NFSA]] comments: "''2000 Weeks'' was one of the first features of the modern era in [[Australian cinema]], after decades in which almost the only productions were British and American films in search of exotic locales. ... There was an intense desire amongst a few people to restart an Australian film industry, and Burstall was one of the leaders. Indeed, he made nationalist artistic longings the main theme of the film, although it didn’t help the film’s reception. It was booed when it screened at the 1970 [[Sydney Film Festival]] and damned by some influential critics. The box office was poor and Burstall became determined to make films for a wide commercial audience, rather than an art-house few. Many of these later films, starting with ''[[Stork (film)|Stork]]'' (1971) and ''[[Alvin Purple]]'' (1973), were great popular successes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/2000-weeks/notes/ Australianscreen &gt; 2000 Weeks.] Viewed 10.03.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Anno 1602: Creation of a New World''''' (released as '''''1602 A.D.''''' in North America and Australia) is a [[real-time strategy]] and [[city-building game|city building]] [[video game]] developed by [[Max Design]], published by [[Sunflowers Interactive]] and distributed by [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Infogrames]]. It was published in 1998 (2000 in North America) and is the first game of the [[Anno (series)|''Anno'' series]]; it was re-released in 2015 on [[GOG.com]].

The game is set in the Early Modern period of history and play entails colony building and resource management on a series of small islands. It includes aspects of exploration, combat, diplomacy and trade. ''Anno 1602'' is an economic, rather than combat, orientated strategy game. Players are rarely challenged in battle. The game design is noteworthy for its attempt to implement a 'progressive' [[artificial intelligence]], meaning that the pace of the game changes in response to how quickly players act.

The sequels of the game are ''[[Anno 1503]]'', ''[[Anno 1701]]'', ''[[Anno 1404]]'', ''[[Anno 2070]]'', ''[[Anno 2205]]'' and ''[[Anno 1800]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Anno 1602'' aims to be a mix of simulation and strategy gaming, giving players the chance to create a realistic and lively world, modeling it to their liking. The ultimate goal of the game is to discover chains of islands, settle them, develop on them, and then trade with other players. Players can also trade with their own colonies, and various neutral CPU controlled players such as native tribesmen. Even though the game focuses heavily on an economic standpoint, on various occasions the player will be forced (or will bring it upon others) to defend their islands against possible enemies.

''Anno 1602'' is a colony building and trading [[simulation]]. The player controls an unnamed European nation in 1602 AD that is looking to expand their power into the New World. As the game starts, the player will need to find a nearby island, colonize it, and start building up an economy. The US release contains all 6 scenarios (in addition to the tutorial and training game) that were included in the original European release, as well as 9 new scenarios, along with a "free play role".

In ''Anno 1602'', the player can choose to play out one of the game's many scenarios or engage in a free form game. The game also features [[online]] and [[Computer networking|network]] play with up to 4 other players simultaneously. Because the network play is less sophisticated than that of modern games, lags and disconnections often occur. Despite this, ''Anno 1602'' is still occasionally played by small groups of LAN PC gamers, or by players over the internet. The game is also playable via [[null modem]] connection.

===Civilizations===
''Anno 1602'' is designed to be as nationalistically neutral as possible. After entering a character name, the player is asked to pick one of four different colored banners to represent their country. The absence of different civilizations with different characteristics contrasts with other games such as ''[[The Settlers]]'', and ''[[Age of Empires]]''.

===Technology===
Unlike other games where technology plays a major role in one player defeating another, ''Anno 1602'' instead makes technology upgrades more relevant in inner-colony affairs. Instead of buying upgrades to ships to perform better in huge naval battles, it is often the case that upgrades are made so that the ships can carry more cargo, and therefore make the colony more money. The majority of the buildings in the game also can / must be technologically upgraded throughout the game to please the colony's citizens, which produces more cash for the colony, with which the player can continue upgrading their nation and expand to other islands.

===Buildings===
''Anno 1602'' is about discovery. As the colony grows and spreads, the player gains access to more and more building types and citizens construct bigger and more impressive housing for themselves. The player is required to reach a certain [[population]] level before access is gained to weapons factories. Once the player has the factories, a large number of buildings are needed to produce weapons, and additional buildings to construct units. After the buildings are constructed, the player must pay a constant flow of money to keep each building running. This "line of production", though difficult, has been incorporated into newer games such as ''[[Stronghold (2001 video game)|Stronghold]]''.

===Custom scenarios===
''Anno 1602'' allows for the creation of user-made maps, using the Scenario Builder. This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities. This, along with instant "Random Maps", keeps many players coming back to ''Anno 1602''.

Not all versions of ''Anno 1602'' shipped with a map editor, therefore several [[fan-made]] editors were created.

==History==

===Atari Inc. (1972–1984)===
{{Main|Atari, Inc.}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In 1971, [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]] founded a small engineering company, Syzygy Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade70.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030703021923/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade70.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-07-03 |title=Atari Coin-Op/Arcade Systems |website=www.atarimuseum.com |access-date=2016-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that designed and built ''[[Computer Space]]'', the world's first commercially available arcade video game, for Nutting Associates. On June 27, 1972, the two incorporated Atari, Inc. and soon hired [[Al Alcorn]] as their first design engineer.  Bushnell asked Alcorn to produce an arcade version of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]]'s Tennis game,&lt;ref name="nolanmagnavox"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ador Yano |url=http://www.ralphbaer.com/video_game_history.htm |title=Video game history |publisher=Ralphbaer.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223011401/http://www.ralphbaer.com/video_game_history.htm |archivedate=December 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be named [[Pong]].  While Bushnell incorporated Atari in June 1972, Syzygy Company was never formally incorporated.  Before Atari's incorporation, Bushnell considered various terms from the game [[Go (board game)|Go]], eventually choosing ''[[Atari (go)|atari]]'', referencing a position in the game when a group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent.  Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27, 1972.&lt;ref name="inc1972"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kepler.ss.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C0654542|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016062150/http://kepler.ss.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C0654542|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 16, 2007|title=California Secretary of State – California Business Search – Corporation Search Results|date=October 16, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a competitor called [[Kee Games]], headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent [[pinball]] distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market virtually the same game to different distributors, each getting an "exclusive" deal.  Joe Keenan's management of the subsidiary led to him being promoted president of Atari that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monfort |first1=Nick |last2=Bogost |first2=Ian |title=Racing the Beam |publisher=MIT Press |date=March 31, 2009 |origyear=1st.

In 1976, Bushnell, through [[Grass Valley, CA]] firm Cyan Engineering, started development of a flexible console that was capable of playing the four existing Atari games.  The result was the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]], or VCS (later renamed 2600 when the 5200 was released).  The introductory price of $199 ({{Inflation|US|199|1976|fmt=eq}}) included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles, and the Combat game cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toytales.ca/atari-2600/ |title=Atari 2600 {{!}} Toys with a History {{!}} Toy Tales – Todd Coopee |date=2015-12-28 |language=en-US |access-date=2016-07-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619185554/https://toytales.ca/atari-2600/ |archivedate=June 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive.  Looking for outside investors, Bushnell sold Atari to [[Time-Warner|Warner Communications]] in 1976 for an estimated $28–32 million, using part of the money to buy the [[Peter Folger|Folgers]] Mansion.  Nolan continued to have disagreements with Warner Management over the direction of the company, the discontinuation of the pinball division, and most importantly, the notion of discontinuing the 2600.  In 1978, Kee Games was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/atari.html |title=A History of Syzygy / Atari |publisher= |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117063609/http://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/atari.html |archivedate=November 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December of that year, [[Nolan Bushnell]] was fired following an argument with Manny Gerard.  "[W]e started fighting like cats and dogs.  And then the wheels came off that fall.  Warner claimed they fired me," recalled Bushnell.  "I say I quit.  It was a mutual separation."&lt;ref name="ramsay"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramsay |first=Morgan |year=2012 |title=Gamers at Work: Stories Behind the Games People Play |isbn=978-1430233510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of a successor to the 2600 started as soon as it shipped.  The original team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years; it then set forth to build the most powerful machine possible within that time frame.  Mid-way into their effort the [[home computer]] revolution took off, leading to the addition of a keyboard and features to produce the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]] and its smaller sibling, the 400.  The new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.  From this platform Atari released their next-generation game console in 1982, the [[Atari 5200]].  It was unsuccessful due to incompatibility with the 2600 game library, a small quantity of dedicated games, and notoriously unreliable controllers.

Under Warner and Atari's chairman and CEO, [[Raymond Kassar]], the company achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers.  At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest growing company in US history at the time.  However, it ran into problems in the early 1980s as interference from the New York-based Warner management increasingly affected daily operations. Its [[home computer]], [[video game console]], and [[Video arcade|arcade]] divisions operated independently and rarely cooperated.  Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.

These problems were followed by the [[video game crash of 1983]], with losses that totaled more than $500 million.  Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. In 1983, Ray Kassar had resigned and executives involved in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] merger lost track of negotiations, eventually killing the deal.  With Atari's financial problems and the Famicom's runaway success in Japan after its July 16, 1983, release, [[Nintendo]] decided to remain independent.

Financial problems continued to mount and Kassar's successor, [[James J. Morgan]], had less than a year in which to tackle the company's problems.  He began a massive restructuring of the company and worked with Warner Communications in May 1984 to create "NATCO" (an acronym for New Atari Company).  NATCO further streamlined the company's facilities, personnel, and spending.  Unknown to James Morgan and the senior management of Atari, Warner had been in talks with Tramiel Technology to buy Atari's consumer electronics and home computer divisions.  Negotiating until close to midnight on July 1, 1984, [[Jack Tramiel]] purchased Atari.  Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to Tramiel for $50 cash and $240 million in promissory notes and stocks, giving Warner a 20% stake in Atari Corporation&lt;ref name="sale"&gt;{{Cite news

Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name [[Atari Games]], but sold it to [[Namco]] in 1985.  Warner also sold the fledgling '''Ataritel''' to [[Mitsubishi Electric|Mitsubishi]].

===Logo===
The Atari [[logotype|logo]] was designed by [[George Opperman]] who was Atari's first in-house graphic designer. The design is known as "[[Mount Fuji|Fuji]]" for its resemblance to the Japanese mountain, although the design's origins are unrelated to it. Opperman designed the logo intending for the silhouette to look like the letter A as in Atari, and for its three "prongs" to resemble players and the midline of the "court" in company's first hit game, Pong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glory of Atari's Original Logo |url=http://kotaku.com/5864035/the-glory-of-ataris-original-logo |website=Kotaku |accessdate=11 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312002909/http://kotaku.com/5864035/the-glory-of-ataris-original-logo |archivedate=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Tramiel's ownership, '''Atari Corp.''' used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a 16/32-bit computer system, the [[Atari ST]]. ("ST" stands for "sixteen/thirty-two", referring to the machines' 16-bit bus and 32-bit processor core.) In April 1985, they released the first update to the 8-bit computer line&amp;nbsp;— the Atari 65XE, the [[Atari XE]] series. June 1985 saw the release of the Atari 130XE; Atari User Groups received early sneak-preview samples of the new Atari 520ST's, and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September 1985 of Atari's new 32-bit [[Atari ST]] computers. In 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner&amp;nbsp;— the Atari 2600jr and the [[Atari 7800]] console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, earning a $25 million profit that year.

In 1987, Atari acquired [[Federated Group]] for $67.3 million, securing shelf space in over 60 stores in California, Arizona, Texas and Kansas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-24/business/fi-2005_1_atari |title=Atari to Acquire Federated Group for $67.3 Million : Deal Would Give Video Pioneer Access to a Retail Network |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 25, 1987 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402085921/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-24/business/fi-2005_1_atari |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when major American electronics outlets were reluctant to carry Atari-branded computers, and two-thirds of Atari's PC production was sold in Europe.&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollack |first=Andrew |title=Atari to Acquire Electronics Retailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/business/atari-to-acquire-electronics-retailer.html |work=New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=14 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213084721/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/business/atari-to-acquire-electronics-retailer.html |archivedate=December 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federated Group (not related to [[Federated Department Stores]]) was sold to [[Silo (store)|Silo]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=APPublished: November 11, 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/11/business/company-news-atari-is-selling-26-federated-stores.html |title=COMPANY NEWS; Atari Is Selling 26 Federated Stores |work=New York Times |date=November 11, 1989 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517223923/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/11/business/company-news-atari-is-selling-26-federated-stores.html |archivedate=May 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Atari released the [[Atari Lynx]], a handheld console with color graphics, to much fanfare.  A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season, and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's [[Game Boy]] which, despite only having a black and white display, was cheaper, had better battery life and had much higher availability.  Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles but Atari's proprietary computer architecture and operating system fell victim to the success of the [[Wintel]] platform while the game market revived.  In 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly.&lt;ref name="nintendosuit"&gt;{{Cite news

===As a division of Hasbro (1998–2000)===
{{Main|Atari Interactive}}
In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million—less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier.&lt;ref name="JTS-Mar-1998-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/524/104746998009085/filing-main.htm |title=JTS, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 9, 1998 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516113642/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/524/104746998009085/filing-main.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This transaction primarily involved the brand and intellectual property, which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000 when French software publisher [[Infogrames]] took over [[Hasbro Interactive]].&lt;ref name="Hasbro-Dec-2000-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2187/4608000000017/filing-main.htm |title=Hasbro, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Dec 7, 2000 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516114500/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2187/4608000000017/filing-main.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infogrames/Atari SA (2001–present)===
{{Main|Atari SA}}
In October 2001, Infogrames (now [[Atari SA]]) announced that it was "reinventing" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games featuring a prominent Atari branding on their boxarts: ''[[Splashdown (video game)|Splashdown]]'', ''[[MX Rider]]'' and ''[[TransWorld Surf]]''.&lt;ref name="returnofataribrand"&gt;{{cite web

On May 7, 2003, Infogrames had its majority-owned, but discrete US subsidiary Infogrames NA officially renamed '''Atari, Inc.''',&lt;ref name="Atari-May-2003-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/597/95012303005486/filing-main.htm |title=Atari, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date May 8, 2003 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516120453/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/597/95012303005486/filing-main.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; renamed its European operations to Atari Europe but kept the original name of the main company [[Infogrames Entertainment]]. The original Atari holdings division purchased from Hasbro, [[Hasbro Interactive]], was also made a separate corporate entity renamed as [[Atari Interactive]].

On March 6, 2008, Infogrames made an offer to Atari Inc. to buy out all remaining public shares for a value of $1.68 per share, or $11 million total.&lt;ref name="Atari-Mar-2008-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1415/0000950123-08-002638.pdf |title=Atari, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 7, 2008 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516113604/http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1415/0000950123-08-002638.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer would make Infogrames sole owner of Atari Inc., thus making it a privately held company.&lt;ref name="offer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080306/nyth121.html?.v=101|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529210707/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080306/nyth121.html?.v=101|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 29, 2008|title=Atari, Inc.

On December 9, 2008, Atari announced that it had acquired [[Cryptic Studios]], a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] developer.&lt;ref name="cryptic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/atari-acquires-cryptic-studios |title=Atari acquires Cryptic Studios |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830214715/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/atari-acquires-cryptic-studios |archivedate=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bandai Namco Entertainment|Namco Bandai]] purchased a 34% stake in Atari Europe on May 14, 2009, paving the way for its acquisition from Infogrames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/namco-bandai-swallow-atari-europe |title=Namco Bandai To Swallow Atari Europe |accessdate=May 30, 2009 |date=May 14, 2009 |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723143840/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/namco-bandai-swallow-atari-europe/ |archivedate=July 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atari had significant financial issues for several years prior, with losses in the tens of millions since 2005.&lt;ref name="Atari-Jul-2008-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/279/0000950123-08-007500.pdf |title=Atari, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Jul 1, 2008 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516113700/http://pdf.secdatabase.com/279/0000950123-08-007500.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Infogrames Entertainment SA, the parent company of Atari, and Atari Interactive, announced it would change its name to Atari SA.

In April 2010, Atari SA board member and former CEO David Gardner resigned.  Original Atari co-founder [[Nolan Bushnell]] joined the board as a representative for Blubay holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/04/nolan-bushnell-rejoins-atari-phil-harrison-leaves.ars |title=Nolan Bushnell rejoins Atari, Phil Harrison leaves |author=Andrew Webster |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413082621/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/04/nolan-bushnell-rejoins-atari-phil-harrison-leaves.ars |archivedate=April 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 31, 2011, the board of directors consisted of Frank Dangeard, Jim Wilson, Tom Virden, Gene Davis and Alexandra Fichelson.&lt;ref name="2011report"/&gt;

On January 21, 2013, the four related companies Atari, Atari Interactive, [[Humongous Entertainment|Humongous]], and California US Holdings filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atari-files-for-chapter-11-to-separate-from-french-parent-187698581.html |title=Atari Files For Chapter 11 To Separate From French Parent |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926195436/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atari-files-for-chapter-11-to-separate-from-french-parent-187698581.html |archivedate=September 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three Ataris emerged from bankruptcy one year later and the entering of the social casino gaming industry with Atari Casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2014/03/26/atari-social-casino/6915065/ |title=Atari resets with jump into social casino gaming |author=Brett Molina |publisher=USA Today |date=March 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326225045/http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2014/03/26/atari-social-casino/6915065/ |archivedate=March 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frederic Chesnais, who now heads all three companies, stated that their entire operations consist of a staff of 10 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/03/26/atari-and-flowplay-team-up-to-offer-social-casino-games/ |title=Atari and FlowPlay team up to offer social casino games |author=Dean Takahashi |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |date=March 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126062413/http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/26/atari-and-flowplay-team-up-to-offer-social-casino-games/ |archivedate=November 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2014, Atari announced a new corporate strategy that would include a focus on "new audiences", specifically "[[LGBT]], social casinos, real-money gambling, and [[YouTube]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makuch |first1=Eddie |title=Iconic Pong, Asteroids Publisher Atari Reveals "Comeback Strategy" |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/iconic-pong-asteroids-publisher-atari-reveals-comeback-strategy/1100-6420597/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=7 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811181405/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/iconic-pong-asteroids-publisher-atari-reveals-comeback-strategy/1100-6420597/ |archivedate=August 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The box design was derived from early Atari designs (e.g. 2600) with a ribbed top surface, and a rise at the back of the console; two versions were announced: one with a traditional wood veneer front, and the other with a glass front.  Connectivity options were revealed, including [[hdmi|HDMI]], [[USB]] (x4), and [[SD card]] – the console was said to support both classic and current games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/07/the-first-look-at-the-ataribox-ataris-new-console/| title = The First Look At The Ataribox, Atari's New Console| first = Alex|last = Walker| date = 17 July 2017| work = www.kotaku.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, according to an official company statement of June 22, 2017, the product was to be initially launched via a [[crowdfunding]] campaign in order to minimize any financial risk to the parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/atari-precise-la-nature-de-l-ataribox-3050798755.html |title=Atari précise la nature de l'Ataribox |author=Jarod |date=September 27, 2017 |website=[[Gamekult]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26, 2017, Atari sent out a press release about the new "[[Atari VCS (2019 console)|Atari VCS]]", which confirmed more details about the console. It will run a Linux operating system, with full access to the underlying OS, but it will have a custom interface designed for the TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/atari-are-launching-a-new-gaming-system-the-ataribox-and-it-runs-linux.10418|title=Atari are launching a new gaming system, the 'Ataribox' and it runs Linux|work=GamingOnLinux|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bunny''''' is a daily [[webcomic]] by '''Lem''' (b. 1984-03-20), the [[pseudonym]] of a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[artist]] named Huw Davies. Launched in August 2004, ''Bunny'' follows the [[gag-a-day]] formula, with no true [[Plot (narrative)|plotline]]. The subject matter of ''Bunny'' varies widely (with topics ranging from popular [[Internet culture]], to [[current events]] to [[rabbit]] [[ninja]]s), but usually portrays the pink bunny [[protagonist]]'s uncomplicated take on a given situation. Starting with Strip #862 on 2007-03-31 the comic changed from its long rectangular format to a taller and narrower horizontal rectangular format. The shape of the panels currently vary.

In February 2007 ''Bunny'' was placed under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 [[license]].

Starting on 2007-12-24 with strip #1067, [[tooltip]] (better known as title text) became a part of most comics.

==Characters==
[[File:Bunny plain.jpg|right|The Bunny]]
;The [[Pink]] [[Bunny]]: The Pink Bunny is the main character and the strip's only constant. In early strips, the Pink Bunny seemed taken by flying old [[airplanes]], and sometimes has seemed to be gifted with insight and stupidity. The Pink Bunny is also seen [[skateboarding]] on some occasions. The Pink Bunny's language relates everything to itself; everything, no matter how seemingly unrelated, is described as integral to the Bunny's being.

;The [[Blue]] Bunny: The [[Blue]] Bunny (sometimes called purple) may or may not be the Pink Bunny's cousin, commonly used as a random extra character. The Blue Bunny's language does not describe objects per se, but instead describes where they might go or be seen, or what they might do.

;The [[Orange (colour)|Orange]] Bunny: The Orange Bunny also may or may not be the Pink Bunny's cousin. The Orange bunny has always seemed quite malicious, known to love explosions, and is apparently using its life for scenes of destruction and being annoying. The Orange Bunny does not have a language per se; as the only one of his kind, he communicates via telepathy.

; Others:

:The randomly appearing ninja, pirate, and stealth ninja pirate bunnies share a love for [[watermelon]]s and [[Canada]], coming in mostly to present the idea of battle or war. They are known to communicate via sign language.

:The comic "Extended Family" shows different colored bunnies, including green, red, yellow, and navy. Humans are very rarely drawn, and a squirrel character has appeared twice as a friend of the Pink Bunny. Bats, bunny zombies, and alien parasites have also appeared. A ninja character has made recurring, traffic courtesy-themed appearances, starting in "Now You See Him, Now You Don't." Bunnies also occasionally keep small, fuzzy, orange creatures called Peevs around as pets.

:The comic "next year's edinburgh military tattoo entry"[http://www.bunny-comic.com/index.php?id=976] shows an extra green bunny.

The '''cinema of Oman''' is very small. There is only one Omani film, ''[[Al-Boom]]'' (2006), as of 2007. Partly inspired by [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'', ''Al-Boom'' deals with the challenges facing a small fishing community.

A joint US-Indian-Omani production, ''Pirate's Blood'', starring Sunny Leone was co-produced by Stegath Dorr in 2008.  Stegath Dorr's film ''Blood Desert'' was released in 2014, many years after it premiered at the 2006 Oman Film Festival. A few [[Hollywood]] movies have been partly filmed in the country.

An annual film festival is held in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]].

{{British film list}}
The '''[[United Kingdom]]''' has had a significant film industry for over a century. While film production reached an all-time high in 1936,&lt;ref name="FF12-03"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/facts/fact2.html |title = BFI Screenonline: UK Feature Films Produced 1912–2003 |accessdate =30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "golden age" of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, during which the directors [[David Lean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors-directors.html |title=The Directors' Top Ten Directors |accessdate=2 November 2010 |publisher=British Film Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514093259/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors-directors.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Powell]], (with [[Emeric Pressburger]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/447167/index.html|title=Powell, Michael (1905–1990)|accessdate=25 January 2011|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carol Reed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/459891/index.html|title=Reed, Carol (1906–1976)|accessdate=25 January 2011|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced their most highly acclaimed work. Many British actors have achieved worldwide fame and critical success, such as [[Maggie Smith]], [[Michael Caine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/463342/index.html|title=Caine, Michael (1933-)|accessdate=11 December 2010|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Connery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/455509/index.html|title=Connery, Sean (1930-)|accessdate=11 December 2010|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Kate Winslet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/489012/index.html|title=Winslet, Kate (1975-)|accessdate=11 December 2010|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the films with the largest ever box office returns have been made in the United Kingdom, including the third and fourth [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing film series|highest-grossing film series]] (''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' and [[James Bond (film series)|''James Bond'']]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/11/jkjoannekathleenrowling|title=Harry Potter becomes highest-grossing film franchise|accessdate=2 November 2010|work=The Guardian|date=11 September 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the former being [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]].

The identity of the British industry, particularly as it relates to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], has often been the subject of debate. Its history has often been affected by attempts to compete with the American industry. The career of the producer [[Alexander Korda]] was marked by this objective, the [[Rank Organisation]] attempted to do so in the 1940s, and [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]] in the 1980s. Numerous British-born directors, including [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Ridley Scott]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462413/index.html|title=Scott, Sir Ridley (1937-)|accessdate=25 January 2011|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performers, such as [[Charlie Chaplin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462570/index.html|title=Chaplin, Charles (1889–1977)|accessdate=25 January 2011|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cary Grant]], have achieved success primarily through their work in the United States.

In 2009, British films grossed around $2&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/vitalstats|title=UK film - the vital statistics|accessdate=22 October 2010|publisher=UK Film Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK box-office takings totalled £1.1&amp;nbsp;billion in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK cinema box office|url=http://www.cinemauk.org.uk/facts-and-figures/admissions/annual-uk-box-office-and-average-annual-spending-2000-2012/|publisher=Cinema Exhibitor's Association|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 172.5&amp;nbsp;million admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK cinema annual admissions|url=http://www.cinemauk.org.uk/facts-and-figures/admissions/monthly-uk-cinema-admissions-2004-2012/|publisher=Cinema Exhibitor's Association|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and silent films===
The first moving picture was shot in [[Leeds]] by [[Louis Le Prince]] in 1888&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/local_heroes/biogs/biogleprince.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128020048/http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/local_heroes/biogs/biogleprince.shtml |archivedate=28 November 1999|publisher=BBC Education|work=Local Heroes|title=Louis Le Prince|date=28 November 1999|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howells|first=Richard|title=Louis Le Prince: the body of evidence|journal=[[Screen (journal)|Screen]]|volume=47|issue=2|pages=179–200|publisher=Oxford Journals|date=Summer 2006|url=http://screen.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/47/2/179|issn=0036-9543|doi=10.1093/screen/hjl015|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first moving pictures developed on [[Nitrate film|celluloid film]] were made in [[Hyde Park, London]] in 1889 by British inventor [[William Friese Greene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/friesegreene|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; who patented the process in 1890.

[[File:Charlie Chaplin with doll.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|[[Charlie Chaplin]], c. 1918]]
The first people to build and run a working [[35 mm]] [[camera]] in Britain were [[Robert W. Paul]] and [[Birt Acres]]. They made the first British film ''[[Incident at Clovelly Cottage]]'' in February 1895, shortly before falling out over the camera's patent. Soon several British film companies had opened to meet the demand for new films, such as [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] in [[Blackburn]].

Although the earliest British films were of everyday events, the early 20th century saw the appearance of narrative shorts, mainly comedies and melodramas.  The early films were often melodramatic in tone, and there was a distinct preference for story lines already known to the audience, in particular, adaptations of [[Shakespeare]] plays and [[Dickens]] novels.

[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|The Lumière brothers]] first brought their show to London in 1896.  In 1898 American producer [[Charles Urban]] expanded the London-based [[Warwick Trading Company]] to produce British films, mostly documentary and news.

In 1898 [[Gaumont-British|Gaumont-British Picture Corp.]] was founded as a subsidiary of the French [[Gaumont Film Company]], constructing [[Lime Grove Studios]] in [[West London (sub region)|West London]] in 1915 in the first building built in Britain solely for film production. Also in 1898 [[Hepworth Studios]] was founded in [[Lambeth]], South London by [[Cecil Hepworth]], the [[Bamforths]] began producing films in [[Yorkshire]], and [[William Haggar]] began producing films in [[Wales]].

In 1902 [[Ealing Studios]] was founded by [[Will Barker]], becoming the oldest continuously-operating film studio in the world.

In 1902 the earliest colour film in the world was made; like other films made at the time, it is of everyday events.  In 2012 it was found by the National Science and Media Museum in [[Bradford]] after lying forgotten in an old tin for 110 years. The previous title for earliest colour film, using Urban's inferior [[Kinemacolor]] process, was thought to date from 1909. The re-discovered films were made by pioneer [[Edward Raymond Turner]] from London who patented his process on 22 March 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19423951 "World's first colour moving pictures discovered"]. [[BBC News]], 12 September 2012. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 Urban formed the [[Charles Urban Trading Company]], which produced early colour films using his patented Kinemacolor process. This was later challenged in court by Greene, causing the company to go out of business in 1915.

In 1903 [[Frank Mottershaw]] of [[Sheffield]] produced the film ''[[A Daring Daylight Robbery]]'', which launched the chase genre.

In 1911 the [[Ideal Film Company]] was founded in [[Soho, London]], distributing almost 400 films by 1934, and producing 80.

In 1913 stage director [[Maurice Elvey]] began directing British films, becoming Britain's most prolific film director, with almost 200 by 1957.

In 1914 [[Elstree Studios]] was founded, and acquired in 1928 by German-born [[Ludwig Blattner]], who invented a magnetic steel tape recording system that was adopted by the [[BBC]] in 1930.

In 1920 Gaumont opened [[Islington Studios]], where [[Alfred Hitchcock]] got his start, selling-out to [[Gainsborough Pictures]] in 1927. Also in 1920 [[Cricklewood Studios]] was founded by Sir [[Oswald Stoll]], becoming Britain's largest film studio, known for [[Fu Manchu]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]] film series.

[[File:Leslie Howard GWTW.jpg|thumb|right|upright|150px|Leslie Howard]]

In 1920 the short-lived company [[Minerva Films]] was founded in London by the actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] (also producer and director) and his friend and story editor [[Adrian Brunel]].  Some of their early films include four written by [[A. A. Milne]] including ''[[The Bump (film)|The Bump]]'', starring [[C. Aubrey Smith]]; ''[[Twice Two]]''; ''[[Five Pound Reward]]''; and ''[[Bookworms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Estel Eforgan| title = Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor| date = 30 June 2010| publisher = [[Vallentine Mitchell]]| isbn = 978-0-85303-971-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1920s the British film industry was losing out to heavy competition from the United States, which was helped by its much larger home market — in 1914 25% of films shown in the UK were British, but by 1926 this had fallen to 5%. The [[Slump of 1924]] caused many British film studios to close, resulting in the passage of the [[Cinematograph Films Act 1927]] to boost local production, requiring that cinemas show a certain percentage of British films. The act was technically a success, with audiences for British films becoming larger than the quota required, but it had the effect of creating a market for poor quality, low cost films, made to satisfy the quota. The "quota quickies", as they became known, are often blamed by historians for holding back the development of the industry. However, some British film makers, such as [[Michael Powell]], learnt their craft making such films.

Ironically, the biggest star of the silent era, English comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]], was [[Hollywood]]-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462570/index.html|title=Chaplin, Charles (1889–1977)|accessdate=11 December 2010|publisher=British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The early sound period===
Scottish solicitor [[John Maxwell (producer)|John Maxwell]] founded [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] (BIP) in 1927. Based at the former [[Elstree Studios#Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood|British National  Studios]] in Elstree, the facilities original owners, including producer-director [[Herbert Wilcox]], had run into financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Patricia|title=British Film Studios: An Illustrated History|publisher=B.

Batsford|location=London|year=2001|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the company's early films, [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929), is often regarded as the first British sound feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Paul Matthew |last=St. Pierre | title = Music Hall Mimesis in British Film, 1895–1960: On the Hall on the Screen| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AvxgFdRJ66kC&amp;pg=PA79| date =31 May 2009| publisher = Associated University Press| isbn = 978-0-8386-4191-0| page = 79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard Allen|author2=S.

Earlier in 1929, the first all-talking British feature, ''[[The Clue of the New Pin (1929 film)|The Clue of the New Pin]]'' was released. It was based on a novel by [[Edgar Wallace]], starring Donald Calthrop, Benita Home and Fred Raines, which was made by [[British Lion Film Corporation|British Lion]] at their [[Beaconsfield]] Studios. John Maxwell's BIP became the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|last2=Chibnall|first2=Steve|title=Historical Dictionary of British Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8SRjwJqwukC&amp;pg=PA43|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD and Plymouth, England|year=2013|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABPC's studios in Elstree came to be known as the "porridge factory", according to Lou Alexander, "for reasons more likely to do with the quantity of films that the company turned out, than their quality".&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Lou|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/460815/|title=Associated British Picture Corporation (1933-70)|work=BFI screenonline|date=2003–14|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elstree]] (strictly speaking almost all the studios were in neighboring [[Borehamwood]]) became the center of the British film industry, with six film complexes over the years all in close proximity to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (2001), pp. 57, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of sound films, many foreign actors were in less demand, with English [[received pronunciation]] commonly used; for example, the voice of Czech actress [[Anny Ondra]] in ''Blackmail'' was substituted by an off-camera [[Joan Barry (British actress)|Joan Barry]] during Ondra's scenes.

Starting with [[John Grierson]]'s ''[[Drifters (1929 film)|Drifters]]'' (also 1929), the period saw the emergence of the school of realist [[Documentary Film Movement]], from 1933 associated with the [[GPO Film Unit]]. It was Grierson who coined the term "[[Documentary film|documentary]]" to describe a non-fiction film, and he produced the movement's most celebrated early films, ''[[Night Mail]]'' (1936), written and directed by [[Basil Wright]] and [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Watt]], and incorporating the poem by [[W. H. Auden]] towards the end of the short.

[[Music hall]]s also proved influential in [[comedy films]] of this period, and a number of popular personalities emerged, including [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Jessie Matthews]] and [[Will Hay]]. These stars often made several films a year, and their productions remained important for morale purposes during [[World War II]].

[[File:Alexander-Korda-1936.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Alexander Korda]]
Many of the British films with larger budgets during the 1930s were produced by [[London Films]], founded by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] ''emigre'' [[Alexander Korda]]. The success of ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933), made at [[Elstree Studios#British and Dominion Studios, Borehamwood|British and Dominion]] in Elstree, persuaded [[United Artists]] and [[Prudential plc|The Prudential]] to invest in Korda's [[Denham Film Studios]], which opened in May 1936, but both investors suffered losses as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (2001), pp. 26, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Korda's films before the war included ''[[Things to Come]]'', ''[[Rembrandt (1936 film)|Rembrandt]]'' (both 1936) and ''[[Knight Without Armour]]'' (1937), as well as the early [[Technicolor|Technicolour]] films ''[[The Drum (film)|The Drum]]'' (1938) and ''[[The Four Feathers (1939 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1939). These had followed closely on from ''[[Wings of the Morning (1937 film)|Wings of the Morning]]'' (1937), the UK's first three-strip Technicolour feature film, made by the local offshoot of [[20th Century Fox]]. Although some of Korda's films indulged in  "unrelenting pro-Empire flag waving", those featuring [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]] turned him into "a huge international star";&lt;ref&gt;Mark Duguid, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/445836/index.html "Korda and Empuire"], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; "for many years" he had the highest profile of any actor of Indian origin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooke, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/459165/index.html "Sabu (1924–1963)"], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Robeson]] was also cast in leading roles when "there were hardly any opportunities" for African Americans "to play challenging roles" in their own country's productions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Bourne (writer)|Stephen Bourne]], [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/446731/index.html "Robeson, Paul (1898–1976)"], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising expenditure and over-optimistic expectations of expansion into the American market caused a financial crisis in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Street ''British National Cinema'', London: Routledge, 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; after an all-time high of 192 films were released in 1936. Of the 640 British production companies registered between 1925 and 1936, only 20 were still active in 1937. Moreover, the 1927 Films Act was up for renewal. The replacement Cinematograph Films Act 1938 provided incentives, via a "[[Cinematograph Films Council|quality test]]", for UK companies to make fewer films, but of higher quality, and to eliminate the "quota quickies". Influenced by world politics, it encouraged American investment and imports. One result was the creation of [[MGM-British Studios|MGM-British]], an English subsidiary of the largest American studio, which produced four films before the war, including ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1939).

The new venture was initially based at Denham Studios. Korda himself lost control of the facility in 1939 to the [[Rank Organisation]], whose own [[Pinewood Studios]] had opened at the end of September 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (2001), pp. 29, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Circumstances forced Korda's ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), a spectacular fantasy film, to be completed in California, where Korda continued his film career during the war.

By now contracted to [[Gaumont British]], Alfred Hitchcock had settled on the thriller genre by the mid-1930s with ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938). Lauded in Britain where he was dubbed "Alfred the Great" by ''[[Picturegoer]]'' magazine, Hitchcock's reputation was beginning to develop  overseas, with a ''[[The New York Times]]'' feature writer asserting; "Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not. [[Magna Carta]], the [[Tower Bridge]] and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Leff, Leonard J., ''The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in Hollywood''. University of California Press, 1999, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock was then signed up to a seven-year contract by Selznick and moved to [[Hollywood]].

===Second World War===
[[Humphrey Jennings]] began his career as a documentary film maker just before the war, in some cases working in collaboration with co-directors. ''[[London Can Take It]]'' (with [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Wat]], 1940) detailed the blitz while ''[[Listen to Britain]]''&lt;ref name="indep3909"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/britains-world-war-ii-films-were-more-than-just-propaganda-1780730.html|title=Britain's World War II films were more than just propaganda|author=Gerard Gilbert|accessdate=3 May 2012|work=The Independent|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with [[Stewart McAllister]], 1942) looked at the home front. The [[Crown Film Unit]],&lt;ref name=indep3909/&gt; part of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] took over the responsibilities of the GPO Film Unit in 1940. [[Paul Rotha]] and [[Alberto Cavalcanti]] were colleagues of Jennings. British films began to make use of documentary techniques; Cavalcanti joined [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]] for ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942),

Many other films helped to shape the popular image of the nation at war. Among the best known of these films are ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (1942), ''[[We Dive at Dawn]]'' (1943), ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944). The war years also saw the emergence of [[Powell and Pressburger|The Archers]] partnership between director Michael Powell and the Hungarian-born writer-producer [[Emeric Pressburger]] with films such as ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943) and ''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944).

[[Two Cities Films]], an independent production company releasing their films through a Rank subsidiary, also made some important films, including the [[Noël Coward]] and David Lean collaborations ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' (1944) and ''[[Blithe Spirit (film)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1945) as well as [[Laurence Olivier]]'s ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' (1944). By this time, [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough]] Studios were releasing their series of critically derided but immensely popular period melodramas, including ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'' (1945). New stars, such as [[Margaret Lockwood]] and [[James Mason]], emerged in the Gainsborough films.

===Post-war cinema===
[[File:Deborah Kerr 3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Deborah Kerr]] as Sister Clodagh in ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947).]]
Towards the end of the 1940s, the [[Rank Organisation]], founded in 1937 by [[J. Arthur Rank]], became the dominant force behind British film-making, having acquired a number of British studios and the Gaumont chain (in 1941) to add to its [[Odeon Cinemas#History|Odeon Cinemas]]. Rank's serious financial crisis in 1949, a substantial loss and debt, resulted in the contraction of its film production.&lt;ref&gt;Warren (2001), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Rank maintained an industry duopoly with ABPC (later absorbed by EMI) for many years.

For the moment, the industry hit new heights of creativity in the immediate post-war years. Among the most significant films produced during this period were [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' (1945) and his Dickens adaptations ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946) and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948), [[Carol Reed]]'s thrillers ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949), and Powell and Pressburger's ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948), the most commercially successful film of its year in the United States. Laurence Olivier's ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (also 1948), was the first non-American film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Ealing Studios (financially backed by Rank) began to produce their most celebrated comedies, with three of the best remembered films, ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore]]'' (1948), ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' and ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'' (both 1949), being on release almost simultaneously. Their [[Portmanteau film|portmanteau]] horror film ''[[Dead of Night]]'' (1945) is also particularly highly regarded.

During the 1950s, the British industry began to concentrate on popular comedies and World War II dramas aimed more squarely at the domestic audience. The war films were often based on true stories and made in a similar low-key style to their wartime predecessors. They helped to make stars of actors like [[John Mills]], [[Jack Hawkins]] and [[Kenneth More]]. Some of the most successful included ''[[The Cruel Sea (1953 film)|The Cruel Sea]]'' (1953), ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1954), ''[[The Colditz Story]]'' (1955) and ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'' (1956).

The Rank Organisation produced some comedy successes, such as ''[[Genevieve (film)|Genevieve]]'' (1953). The writer/director/producer team of twin brothers [[John and Roy Boulting]] also produced a series of successful satires on British life and institutions, beginning with ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956), and continuing with (among others) ''[[Brothers in Law (film)|Brothers in Law]]'' (1957), ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'' (1958), and ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959).

Popular comedy series included the "Doctor" series, beginning with ''[[Doctor in the House]]'' (1954). The series originally starred [[Dirk Bogarde]], probably the British industry's most popular star of the 1950s, though later films had [[Michael Craig (actor)|Michael Craig]] and [[Leslie Phillips]] in leading roles. The [[Carry On (film series)|Carry On series]] began in 1958 with regular instalments appearing for the next twenty years. The Italian director-producer [[Mario Zampi]] also made a number of successful [[black comedy|black comedies]], including ''[[Laughter in Paradise]]'' (1951), ''[[The Naked Truth (1957 film)|The Naked Truth]]'' (1957) and ''[[Too Many Crooks]]'' (1958). [[Ealing Studios]] had continued its run of successful comedies, including ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), but the company ceased production in 1958, after the studios had already been bought by the [[BBC]].

[[File:Dracula 1958 a.jpg|thumb|Dracula 1958 a|[[Christopher Lee]] in ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958).]]
Less restrictive censorship towards the end of the 1950s encouraged B-film producer [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] to embark on their series of commercially successful horror films. Beginning with adaptations of [[Nigel Kneale]]'s [[BBC]] [[science fiction television|science fiction serials]] ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' (1955) and ''[[Quatermass II]]'' (1957), Hammer quickly graduated to ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957) and  ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958), both deceptively lavish and the first gothic horror films in colour. The studio turned out numerous sequels and variants, with English actors [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Christopher Lee]] being the most regular leads. ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (1960), a now highly regarded thriller, with horror elements, set in the contemporary period, was badly received by the critics at the time, and effectively finished the career of Michael Powell, its director.

===Social realism===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0710-0009-013, Karlsbad, Filmfestival, Beyer, Reiss, Brousil.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Karel Reisz]] (centre)  who was active in the [[Free Cinema]] and the 'British New Wave']]
The [[British New Wave]] film makers attempted to produce [[social realism|social realist]] films (see also '[[kitchen sink realism]]') attempted in commercial feature films released between around 1959 and 1963 to convey narratives about a wider spectrum of people in Britain than the country's earlier films had done. These individuals, principally [[Karel Reisz]], [[Lindsay Anderson]] and [[Tony Richardson]], were also involved in the short lived Oxford film journal ''[[Sequence (journal)|Sequence]]'' and the "[[Free Cinema]]" documentary film movement. The 1956 statement of Free Cinema, the name was coined by Anderson, asserted: "No film can be too personal. The image speaks. Sounds amplifies and comments. Size is irrelevant. Perfection is not an aim. An attitude means a style. A style means an attitude." Anderson, in particular, was dismissive of the commercial film industry. Their documentary films included Anderson's ''[[Every Day Except Christmas]]'', among several sponsored by [[Ford of Britain]], and Richardson's ''[[Momma Don't Allow]]''. Another member of this group, [[John Schlesinger]], made documentaries for the BBC's ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'' arts series.

Together with future James Bond co-producer [[Harry Saltzman]], dramatist [[John Osborne]] and Tony Richardson established the company Woodfall Films to produce their early feature films. These included adaptations of Richardson's stage productions of Osborne's ''[[Look Back in Anger (1959 film)|Look Back in Anger]]'' (1959), with [[Richard Burton]], and ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960) with [[Laurence Olivier]], both from Osborne's own screenplays. Such films as Reisz's ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'' (also 1960), Richardson's ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961), Schlesinger's ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962) and ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' (1963), and Anderson's ''[[This Sporting Life]]'' (1963) are often associated with a new openness about working-class life or previously taboo issues.

The team of [[Basil Dearden]] and [[Michael Relph]], from an earlier generation, "probe[d] into the social issues that now confronted social stability and the establishment of the promised peacetime consensus".&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan"&gt;Tim O'Sullivan, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/456049/index.html "Dearden, Basil (1911-1971)"], BFI screenonline, citing the ''Reference Guide to British and Irish Film Directors''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pool of London (film)|Pool of London]]'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;Carl Daniels, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/475521/index.html "Pool of London (1950)"], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sapphire (film)|Sapphire]]'' (1959) were early attempts to create narratives about racial tensions and an emerging multi-cultural Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ogidi, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/440288/ "Sapphire (1959)"], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; Dearden and Relph's ''[[Victim (1961 film)|Victim]]'' (1961), was about the blackmail of homosexuals. Influenced by the [[Wolfenden report]] of four years earlier, which advocated the decriminalising of homosexual sexual activity, this was "the first British film to deal explicitly with homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Duguid, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444107/index.html "Victim (1961)"], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the New Wave film makers though, critical responses to Dearden's and Relph's work have not generally been positive.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] ''[[A New Biographical Dictionary of Film]]'', London: Little, Brown, 2002, p. 213, and (for a defence) Brian McFarlane (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of British Film'', 2003, London: Methuen/BFI, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1960s===
[[File:Peter OToole in Lawrence of Arabia.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Peter O'Toole]] in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962)]]
As the 1960s progressed, American studios returned to financially supporting British films, especially those that capitalised on the "[[swinging London]]" image propagated by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1966. Films like ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]'', ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It]]'' (both 1965), ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' and ''[[Georgy Girl]]'' (both 1966), all explored this phenomenon. ''[[Blowup]]'' (also 1966), and later ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1969), showed female and then male full-frontal nudity on screen in mainstream British films for the first time.

At the same time, film producers Harry Saltzman and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] combined sex with exotic locations, casual violence and self-referential humour in the phenomenally successful [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] series with [[Sean Connery]] in the leading role. The first film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) was a [[sleeper hit]] in the UK and the second, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), a hit worldwide. By the time of the third film, ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), the series had become a global phenomenon, reaching its commercial peak with ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' the following year. The series' success led to a [[spy film]] boom with many Bond imitations. Bond co-producer Saltzman also instigated a rival series of more realistic spy films based on the novels of [[Len Deighton]]. [[Michael Caine]] starred as bespectacled spy [[Harry Palmer]] in ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'' (1965), and two sequels in the next few years. Other more downbeat espionage films were adapted from [[John le Carré]] novels, such as ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Deadly Affair]]'' (1966).
[[File:Dr. Strangelove - The War Room.png|right|thumb|The war room in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1963) was designed by [[Ken Adam]]]]
American directors were regularly working in London throughout the decade, but several became permanent residents in the UK. Blacklisted in America, [[Joseph Losey]] had a significant influence on British cinema in the 1960s, particularly with his collaborations with playwright [[Harold Pinter]] and leading man [[Dirk Bogarde]], including ''[[The Servant (1963 film)|The Servant]]'' (1963) and ''[[Accident (1967 film)|Accident]]'' (1967). Voluntary exiles [[Richard Lester]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]] were also active in the UK. Lester had major hits with [[The Beatles]] film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It]]'' (1965) while Kubrick's ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1963) and  ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). While Kubrick settled in [[Hertfordshire]] in the early 1960s and would remain in England for the rest of his career, these two films retained a strong American influence. Other films of this era involved prominent filmmakers from elsewhere in Europe, ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''Blowup'' (1966) were the first English language films of the  Polish director [[Roman Polanski]] and the Italian [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] respectively.

Historical films as diverse as ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]'' (1963), and ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966) benefited from the investment of American studios. Major films like ''[[Becket (1964 film)|Becket]]'' (1964), ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1968) were regularly mounted, while smaller-scale films, including ''[[Accident (1967 film)|Accident]]'' (1967), were big critical successes. Four of the decade's [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners for best picture were British productions, including six [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for the film musical ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' (1968), based on the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.

After directing several contributions to the BBC's ''[[The Wednesday Play|Wednesday Play]]'' anthology series, [[Ken Loach]] began his feature film career with the social realist ''[[Poor Cow]]'' (1967) and ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' (1969). Meanwhile, the controversy around [[Peter Watkins]] ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), which won the Best Documentary Film Oscar in 1967, but had been suppressed by the BBC who had commissioned it, would ultimately lead Watkins to work exclusively outside Britain.

===1970 to 1980===
[[File:Glenda Jackson.JPG|right|150px|thumb|[[Glenda Jackson]] in 1971.]]
American studios cut back on British productions, and in many cases withdrew from financing them altogether. Films financed by American interests were still being made, including [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970), but for a time funds became hard to come by.

More relaxed censorship also brought several controversial films, including [[Nicolas Roeg]] and [[Donald Cammell]]'s ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'', [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]'' (1971), [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) starring [[Malcolm McDowell]] as the leader of a gang of thugs in a [[dystopia]]n future Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/100britishfilms/film.asp?film=11 "The 100 Best British Films Ever"]. Empire. Retrieved 5 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Other films during the early 1970s included the Edwardian drama ''[[The Go-Between (1971 film)|The Go-Between]]'' (1971), which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], Nicolas Roeg's Venice-set supernatural thriller ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973) and [[Mike Hodges]]' gangster drama ''[[Get Carter]]'' (1971) starring [[Michael Caine]]. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] returned to Britain to shoot ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972), Other productions such as [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Young Winston]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977) met with mixed commercial success. The British [[horror film]] cycle associated with Hammer Film Productions, [[Amicus Productions|Amicus]] and [[Tigon British Film Productions|Tigon]] drew to a close, despite attempts by Hammer to spice up the formula with added nudity and gore. Although some attempts were made to broaden the range of British horror films, such as with ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' (1973), these films made little impact at the box office, In 1976, British Lion, who produced ''The Wicker Man'', were finally absorbed into the film division of [[EMI Films|EMI]], who had taken over ABPC in 1969. The duopoly in British cinema exhibition, via Rank and now EMI, continued.

[[File:Sir Peter Ustinov Allan Warren.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Peter Ustinov]] (pictured in 1986) starred as [[Hercule Poirot]] in ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978)]]
Some British producers, including Hammer, turned to television for inspiration, and big screen versions of popular sitcoms like ''[[On the Buses (film)|On the Buses]]'' (1971) and ''[[Steptoe and Son (film)|Steptoe and Son]]'' (1972) proved successful with domestic audiences, the former had greater domestic box office returns in its year than the Bond film, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. Low-budget British [[sex comedy|sex comedies]] included the ''Confessions of&amp;nbsp;...'' series starring [[Robin Askwith]], beginning with ''[[Confessions of a Window Cleaner]]'' (1974). More elevated comedy films came from the [[Monty Python]] team, also from television. Their two most successful films were ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), the latter a major commercial success, probably at least in part due to the controversy at the time surrounding its subject.

Some American productions did return to the major British studios in 1977–79, including the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) at [[Elstree Studios]], ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) at [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]], and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) at [[Shepperton Studios|Shepperton]]. Successful adaptations were made in the decade of the [[Agatha Christie]] novels ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974) and ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978). The entry of [[Lew Grade]]'s company [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] into film production in the latter half of the decade brought only a few box office successes and an unsustainable number of failures

===1980 to 1990===
[[File:Richard Attenborough.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Richard Attenborough]] in 1983.]]
In 1980, only 31 British films were made,&lt;ref name="FF12-03"/&gt; a 50% decline from the previous year and the lowest number since 1914, and production fell again in 1981 to 24 films.&lt;ref name="FF12-03"/&gt; The industry suffered further blows from falling cinema attendances, which reached a record low in 1984, and the elimination of the 1957 [[Eady Levy]], a tax concession, in the same year. The concession had made it possible for an overseas based film company to write off a large amount of its production costs by filming in the UK — this was what attracted a succession of big-budget American productions to British studios in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These factors led to significant changes in the industry, with the profitability of British films now "increasingly reliant on secondary markets such as video and television, and [[Channel 4]]&amp;nbsp;... [became] a crucial part of the funding equation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1304135/index.html |title = BFI Screenonline: Channel 4 and Film |accessdate =15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s soon saw a renewed optimism, led by smaller independent production companies such as [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]], [[HandMade Films]] and [[Merchant Ivory Productions]].
[[File:Terry Gilliam 01.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Terry Gilliam]] in 1985]]
Handmade Films, which was partly owned by [[George Harrison]], was originally formed to take over the production of ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', after EMI's [[Bernard Delfont]] (Lew Grade's brother) had pulled out. Handmade also bought and released the gangster drama ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' (1980), produced by a Lew Grade subsidiary, after its original backers became cautious. Members of the Python team were involved in other comedies during the decade, including [[Terry Gilliam]]'s fantasy films ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981) and ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), and [[John Cleese]]'s hit ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' (1988), while [[Michael Palin]] starred in ''[[A Private Function]]'' (1984), from [[Alan Bennett]]'s first screenplay for the cinema screen.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooks, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/499846/ "HandMade Films"], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldcrest producer [[David Puttnam]] has been described as "the nearest thing to a mogul that British cinema has had in the last quarter of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/470271/ |title = BFI Screenonline: Puttnam, Lord David |accessdate =15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Puttnam, a generation of British directors emerged making popular films with international distribution. Some of the talent backed by Puttnam &amp;mdash; [[Hugh Hudson]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Alan Parker]], and [[Adrian Lyne]] &amp;mdash; had shot commercials; Puttnam himself had begun his career in the advertising industry. When Hudson's ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981) won 4 Academy Awards in 1982, including Best Picture, its writer [[Colin Welland]] declared "the British are coming!".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/05/this-weeks-new-theatre-and-dance "This week's new theatre and dance"]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), another Goldcrest film, picked up a Best Picture Oscar, it looked as if he was right.

It prompted a cycle of period films – some with a large budget for a British film, such as [[David Lean]]'s final film ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984), alongside the lower-budget [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory]] adaptations of the works of [[E. M. Forster]], such as ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room with a View]]'' (1986). But further attempts to make 'big' productions for the US market ended in failure, with Goldcrest losing its independence after ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' (1985) and ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986) were commercial and critical flops. Another Goldcrest film, [[Roland Joffé]]'s ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'' (also 1986), won the 1986 [[Palme d'Or]], but did not go into profit either. Joffé's earlier ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' (1984) had been both a critical and financial success. These were Joffé's first two feature films and were amongst those produced by Puttnam.

Mainly outside the commercial sector, film makers from the new commonwealth countries had begun to emerge during the 1970s. [[Horace Ové]]'s ''[[Pressure (film)|Pressure]]'' (1975) had been funded by the [[British Film Institute]] as was ''[[A Private Enterprise]]'' (1974), these being the first [[Black British]] and [[Asian British]] films, respectively. The 1980s however saw a wave of new talent, with films such as [[Franco Rosso]]'s ''[[Babylon (film)|Babylon]]'' (1980), [[Menelik Shabazz]]'s ''[[Burning an Illusion (1981)|Burning an Illusion]]'' (1981) and [[Po-Chih Leong]]'s ''[[Ping Pong (1986 film)|Ping Pong]]'' (1986; one of the first films about Britain's Chinese community). Many of these films were assisted by the newly formed [[Channel 4]], which had an official remit to provide for "minority audiences." Commercial success was first achieved with ''[[My Beautiful Laundrette]]'' (1985). Dealing with racial and gay issues, it was developed from [[Hanif Kureishi]]'s first film script. ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' features [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] in a leading role. Day-Lewis and other young British actors who were becoming stars, such as [[Gary Oldman]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Tim Roth]] and [[Rupert Everett]], were dubbed the [[Brit Pack (actors)|Brit Pack]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Marlow.

''[[The Daily Beast]]''. 8 December 2011. Retrieved 10 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the involvement of Channel 4 in film production, talents from television moved into feature films with [[Stephen Frears]] (''My Beautiful Laundrette'') and [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] with ''[[Dance with a Stranger]]'' (1985). [[John Boorman]], who had been working in the US, was encouraged back to the UK to make ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987). Channel Four also became a major sponsor of the British Film Institute's Production Board, which backed three of Britain's most critically acclaimed filmmakers: [[Derek Jarman]] (''[[The Last of England (film)|The Last of England]]'', 1987), [[Terence Davies]] (''[[Distant Voices, Still Lives]]'', 1988), and [[Peter Greenaway]]; the latter of whom gained surprising commercial success with ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover]]'' (1989). [[Stephen Woolley]]'s company [[Palace Pictures]] also produced some successful films, including [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' (1984) and ''[[Mona Lisa (1986 film)|Mona Lisa]]'' (1986), before collapsing amid a series of unsuccessful films. Amongst the other British films of the decade were [[Bill Forsyth]]'s ''[[Gregory's Girl]]'' (1981) and ''[[Local Hero]]'' (1983), [[Lewis Gilbert]]'s ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983), [[Peter Yates]]' ''[[The Dresser (1983 film)|The Dresser]]'' (1983) and [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'' (1989).

===1990 to 2000===
[[File:Hugh Grant Cannes.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Hugh Grant]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

Compared to the 1980s, investment in film production rose dramatically. In 1989, annual investment was a meagre £104 million. By 1996, this figure had soared to £741 million.&lt;ref&gt;Dyja, Eddie (ed.); 'BFI Film and Television Handbook 1999', London: BFI, 1998; p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the dependence on finance from television broadcasters such as the BBC and Channel 4 meant that budgets were often low and indigenous production was very fragmented: the film industry mostly relied on Hollywood inward investment. According to critic Neil Watson, it was hoped that the £90 million apportioned by the new [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] into three franchises (The Film Consortium, Pathe Pictures, and DNA) would fill the gap, but "corporate and equity finance for the UK film production industry continues to be thin on the ground and most production companies operating in the sector remain hopelessly under-capitalised."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Neil, "Hollywood UK", in ''British Cinema of the 90s'', London: BFI Publishing, 2000, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems were mostly compensated by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], a film studio whose British subsidiary [[Working Title Films]] released a [[Richard Curtis]]-scripted comedy ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994). It grossed $244 million worldwide and introduced [[Hugh Grant]] to global fame, led to renewed interest and investment in British films, and set a pattern for British-set romantic comedies, including ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' (1998) and ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' (1999). Other Working Titles films included ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' (1997), ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]'' (1998) and ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin (film)|Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'' (2001). PFE was eventually sold and merged with [[Universal Pictures]] in 1999, the hopes and expectations of "building a British-based company which could compete with Hollywood in its home market [had] eventually collapsed."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, "Hollywood UK", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax incentives allowed American producers to increasingly invest in UK-based film production throughout the 1990s, including films such as ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996), ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998), ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999). Miramax also distributed [[Neil Jordan]]'s acclaimed thriller ''[[The Crying Game]]'' (1992), which was generally ignored on its initial release in the UK, but was a considerable success in the United States. The same company also enjoyed some success releasing the [[BBC]] period drama ''[[Enchanted April (1992 film)|Enchanted April]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Wings of the Dove (1997 film)|The Wings of the Dove]]'' (1997).

Among the more successful British films were the [[Merchant Ivory]] productions ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'' (1993), [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993), and [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s Shakespeare adaptations. ''[[The Madness of King George]]'' (1994) proved there was still a market for British [[costume drama]]s, and other period films followed, including ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), ''[[Restoration (1995 film)|Restoration]]'' (1995), ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'' (1996), ''[[Mrs. Brown]]'' (1997), ''[[Basil (film)|Basil]]'' (1998), ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998) and ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'' (1999).

After a six-year hiatus for legal reasons the [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] films returned to production with the 17th Bond film, ''[[GoldenEye]]''. With their traditional home [[Pinewood Studios]] fully booked, a new studio was created for the film in a former [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] aero-engine factory at [[Leavesden Film Studios|Leavesden]] in [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pounds-200m-film-studio-boost-for-uk-1580727.html|title=£200m film studio boost for UK |date=7 November 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Leigh]] emerged as a significant figure in British cinema in the 1990s, with a series of films financed by Channel 4 about working and middle class life in modern England, including ''[[Life Is Sweet (film)|Life Is Sweet]]'' (1991), ''[[Naked (1993 film)|Naked]]'' (1993) and his biggest hit ''[[Secrets &amp; Lies (film)|Secrets &amp; Lies]]'' (1996), which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes.

Other new talents to emerge during the decade included the writer-director-producer team of [[John Hodge (screenwriter)|John Hodge]], [[Danny Boyle]] and [[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Andrew Macdonald]] responsible for ''[[Shallow Grave]]'' (1994) and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' (1996). The latter film generated interested in other "regional" productions, including the Scottish films ''[[Small Faces (film)|Small Faces]]'' (1996), ''[[Ratcatcher (film)|Ratcatcher]]'' (1999) and ''[[My Name Is Joe]]'' (1998).

===2000 to 2010===
[[File:David Heyman1.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[David Heyman]], who produced all eight installments of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]]]

The first decade of the 21st century was a relatively successful one for the British film industry. Many British films found a wide international audience due to funding from BBC Films, Film 4 and the UK Film Council, and some independent production companies, such as Working Title, secured financing and distribution deals with major American studios. Working Title scored three major international successes, all starring Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, with the romantic comedies ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (2001), which grossed $254 million worldwide; the sequel ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'', which earned $228 million; and Richard Curtis's directorial debut ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003), which grossed $239 million. Most successful of all, [[Phyllida Lloyd]]'s ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' (2008), which grossed $601 million.

The new decade saw a major new film series in the Harry Potter films, beginning with ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' in 2001. [[David Heyman]]'s company Heyday Films has produced seven sequels, with the final title released in two parts – ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'' in 2010 and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'' in 2011. All were filmed at Leavesden Studios in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/travel/studio-tour-casts-spells-like-harry-potter.html|title=Studio Tour Casts Spells Just Like Harry|date=29 March 2012 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aardman Animations' [[Nick Park]], the creator of Wallace and Gromit and the Creature Comforts series, produced his first feature-length film, ''[[Chicken Run]]'' in 2000. Co-directed with Peter Lord, the film was a major success worldwide and one of the most successful British films of its year. Park's follow up, ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' was another worldwide hit: it grossed $56 million at the US box office and £32 million in the UK. It also won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

However it was usually through domestically funded features throughout the decade that British directors and films won awards at the top international film festivals. In 2003, [[Michael Winterbottom]] won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for ''[[In This World]]''. In 2004, Mike Leigh directed ''[[Vera Drake]]'', an account of a housewife who leads a double life as an abortionist in 1950s London. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In 2006 Stephen Frears directed ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' based on the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana, which won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival and Academy Awards and the BAFTA for Best Film. In 2006, Ken Loach won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival with his account of the struggle for Irish Independence in ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]''. [[Joe Wright]]'s adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'' was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Film and won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Film. ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' was filmed entirely in Mumbai with a mostly Indian cast, though with a British director ([[Danny Boyle]]), producer ([[Christian Colson]]), screenwriter ([[Simon Beaufoy]]) and star (Dev Patel)—the film was all-British financed via Film4 and Celador.  It has received worldwide critical acclaim. It has won four Golden Globes, seven BAFTA Awards and eight Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film.  ''[[The King's Speech]]'', which tells the story of King [[George VI]]'s attempts to overcome his speech impediment, was directed by [[Tom Hooper (director)|Tom Hooper]] and filmed almost entirely in London.  It received four Academy Awards (including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay) in 2011.

The start of the 21st century saw Asian British cinema assert itself at the box office, starting with ''[[East Is East (1999 film)|East Is East]]'' (1999) and continuing with ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' (2002). Other notable British Asian films from this period include ''[[My Son the Fanatic]]'' (1997), ''[[Ae Fond Kiss...]] (2004)'', ''[[Mischief Night (2006 film)|Mischief Night]] (2006)'', ''[[Yasmin (2004 film)|Yasmin]]'' (2004) and ''[[Four Lions]]'' (2010). Some argue it has brought more flexible attitudes towards casting Black and Asian British actors, with [[Robbie Gee]] and [[Naomie Harris]] take leading roles in ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]'' respectively. The year 2005 saw the emergence of The [[British Urban Film Festival]], a timely addition to the film festival calendar, which recognised the influence of ''[[Kidulthood]]'' on UK audiences and consequently began to showcase a growing profile of films in a genre previously not otherwise regularly seen in the capital's cinemas. Then in 2005 ''[[Kidulthood]]'', a film centring on inner-city London youth had a limited release. This was successfully followed up with a sequel ''[[Adulthood (film)|Adulthood]]'' (2008) that was written and directed by actor [[Noel Clarke]]. Several other films dealing with inner city issues and Black Britons were released in the 2000s such as ''[[Bullet Boy]]'' (2004), ''[[Life and Lyrics]]'' (2006) and ''[[Rollin' with the Nines]]'' (2009).

Like the 1960s, this decade saw plenty of British films directed by imported talent. The American [[Woody Allen]] shot ''[[Match Point]]'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jan/06/1|title=Match Point|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Peter Bradshaw|work=The Guardian| date=6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/12/28/movies/28matc.html|title=London Calling, With Luck, Lust and Ambition |accessdate=29 June 2012|work=The New York Times| date=28 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three later films in London. The Mexican director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] helmed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004) and ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006); New Zealand filmmaker [[Jane Campion]] made ''[[Bright Star (film)|Bright Star]]'' (2009), a film set in 19th century London; Danish director [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] made ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]'' (2008), a biopic about the English criminal [[Michael Gordon Peterson]]; the Spanish filmmaker [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] directed ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' (2007), a sequel to a British horror film; and two [[John le Carré]] adaptations were also directed by foreigners—''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' by the Brazilian [[Fernando Meirelles]] and ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'' by the Swedish [[Tomas Alfredson]]. The decade also saw English actor [[Daniel Craig]] became the new James Bond with ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', the 21st entry in the official Eon Productions series.

Despite increasing competition from film studios in Australia and Eastern Europe, British studios such as [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]], [[Shepperton Studios|Shepperton]] and [[Leavesden Film Studios|Leavesden]] remained successful in hosting major productions, including ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'', ''[[Closer (2004 film)|Closer]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'',  ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]''  and ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]''.

In November 2010, [[Warner Bros.]] completed the acquisition of [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]], becoming the first Hollywood studio since the 1940s to have a permanent base in the UK, and announced plans to invest £100 million in the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/09/warner-bros-leavesden-studios|title=Warner Bros buys Harry Potter studios in £100m boost for UK films|date=9 November 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/11/08/uk-warner-britain-idUKTRE6A73MW20101108|title=Warner to purchase and invest £100 million in film studio|date=8 November 2010|agency=Reuters|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the [[British Film Institute]] published in December 2013 found that of the 613 tracked British films released between 2003 and 2010 only 7% made a profit. Films with low budgets, those that cost below £500,000 to produce, were even less likely to gain a return on outlay. Of these films, only 3.1% went into the black. At the top end of budgets for the British industry, under a fifth of films that cost £10million went into profit.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Beaumont-Thomas, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/03/7-percent-british-film-profit-bfi-study "Only a small fraction of British films turn a profit, BFI study finds"], ''The Guardian'', 3 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2010 it was announced that the UK Film Council, which was the main body responsible for the development of promotion of British cinema during the 2000s, would be abolished, with many of the abolished body's functions being taken over by the [[British Film Institute]]. Actors and professionals, including [[James McAvoy]], [[Emily Blunt]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], [[Damian Lewis]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Daniel Barber (director)|Daniel Barber]] and [[Ian Holm]], campaigned against the Council's abolition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/7926836/British-film-industry-will-suffer-if-the-Government-closes-the-UK-Film-Council.html "British film industry will suffer if the Government closes the UK Film Council"], 5 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestforfilm.com/film-news/mr-hunt-give-me-a-future-harry-brown-director-supports-our-campaign "Daniel Barber condemns UK Film Council abolition"], 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The move also led American actor and director [[Clint Eastwood]] (who had filmed ''[[Hereafter (film)|Hereafter]]'' in London) to write to &lt;!-- The British term uses "the" in the official title --&gt;the British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] in August 2010 to protest the decision to close the Council.

At the closure of the UK Film Council on 31 March 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that "The UKFC's entire annual budget was a reported £3m, while the cost of closing it down and restructuring is estimated to have been almost four times that amount."&lt;ref name="guardian010411"&gt;Ben Child, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/01/uk-film-council-british-institute-bfi "Fade out from the UK Film Council&amp;nbsp;... to the British Film Institute"], ''The Guardian'', 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the UKFC's last films, ''[[The King's Speech]]'', is estimated to have cost $15m to make and grossed $235m, besides winning several [[Academy Awards]]. UKFC invested $1.6m for a 34% share of net profits, a valuable stake that will pass to the British Film Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Macnab, [http://www.screendaily.com/territories/uk-ireland/kings-speech-bfi-gets-kings-ransom/5024247.article "King's Speech: BFI gets king's ransom?"] ''Screen Daily'', 24 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, at Pinewood Studios to visit film-related businesses, UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said that his government had bold ambitions for the film industry: "Our role, and that of the BFI, should be to support the sector in becoming even more dynamic and entrepreneurial, helping UK producers to make commercially successful pictures that rival the quality and impact of the best international productions. Just as the British Film Commission has played a crucial role in attracting the biggest and best international studios to produce their films here, so we must incentivise UK producers to chase new markets both here and overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm-uk-film-industry/|title=PM backs 'dynamic and entrepreneurial' UK film industry|date=11 January 2012|publisher=Number 10|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film industry remains an important earner for the British economy. According to a UK Film Council press release of 20 January 2011, £1.115 billion was spent on UK film production during 2010. A 2014 survey suggested that British-made films were generally more highly rated than Hollywood productions, especially when considering low-budget UK productions.

==Art cinema==
Although it had been funding British experimental films as early as 1952, the [[British Film Institute]]'s foundation of a production board in 1964—and a substantial increase in public funding from 1971 onwards—enabled it to become a dominant force in developing British art cinema in the 1970s and 80s: from the first of [[Bill Douglas]]'s Trilogy ''My Childhood'' (1972), and of [[Terence Davies]]' Trilogy ''Childhood'' (1978), via [[Peter Greenaway]]'s earliest films (including the surprising commercial success of ''The Draughtsman's Contract'' (1982)) and [[Derek Jarman]]'s championing of the New Queer Cinema. The first full-length feature produced under the BFI's new scheme was [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[Andrew Mollo]]'s ''Winstanley'' (1975), while others included ''Moon Over the Alley'' (1975), ''Requiem for a Village'' (1975), the openly avant-garde ''Central Bazaar'' (1973), ''[[Pressure (film)|Pressure]]'' (1975) and ''A Private Enterprise'' (1974) -- the last two being, respectively, the first British Black and Asian features.

The release of Derek Jarman's ''[[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]]'' (1978) marked the beginning of a successful period of UK [[art film|art cinema]], continuing into the 1980s with filmmakers like [[Sally Potter]]. Unlike the previous generation of British film makers who had broken into directing and production after careers in the theatre or on television, the Art Cinema Directors were mostly the products of Art Schools. Many of these filmmakers were championed in their early career by the [[London Film Makers Cooperative]] and their work was the subject of detailed theoretical analysis in the journal ''Screen Education''. Peter Greenaway was an early pioneer of the use of computer generated imagery blended with filmed footage and was also one of the first directors to film entirely on high definition video for a cinema release.

With the launch of [[Channel 4]] and its [[Film on Four]] commissioning strand, Art Cinema was promoted to a wider audience. However the Channel had a sharp change in its commissioning policy in the early 1990s and Greenaway and others were forced to seek European co-production financing.

==Film technology==

In the 1970s and 1980s, British studios established a reputation for great special effects in films such as ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), and ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989). Some of this reputation was founded on the core of talent brought together for the filming of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) who subsequently worked together on series and feature films for [[Gerry Anderson]]. Thanks to the Bristol-based [[Aardman Animations]], the UK is still recognised as a world leader in the use of stop-motion animation.

British special effects technicians and production designers are known for creating visual effects at a far lower cost than their counterparts in the US, as seen in ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981) and ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985). This reputation has continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century with films such as the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] series, ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000) and the [[Harry Potter]] franchise.

From the 1990s to the present day, there has been a progressive movement from traditional film opticals to an integrated [[digital film]] environment, with special effects, cutting, colour grading, and other post-production tasks all sharing the same all-digital infrastructure. The London-based [[visual effects]] company [[Framestore]], with [[Tim Webber]] the [[visual effects supervisor]], have worked on some of the most technically and artistically challenging projects, including, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008) and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013), with new techniques involved in ''Gravity'' realized by Webber and the Framestore team taking three years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Roddick, [https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/film/tim-webber-the-man-who-put-sandra-bullock-in-space-8804917.html "Tim Webber: the man who put Sandra Bullock in space"], ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 17 September 2013. Retrieved 17 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of high-speed [[Internet Protocol]] networks has made the British film industry capable of working closely with U.S. studios as part of globally distributed productions. As of 2005, this trend is expected to continue with moves towards (currently experimental) digital distribution and projection as mainstream technologies. The British film ''[[This is Not a Love Song]]'' (2003) was the first to be [[stream]]ed live on the [[Internet]] at the same time as its cinema [[premiere]].

A '''crocodile farm''' or '''alligator farm ''' is an establishment for breeding and raising of [[crocodilian]]s in order to produce crocodile and [[alligator meat]], [[leather]], and other goods. Many species of both [[alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s are farmed internationally.  In Louisiana alone, alligator farming is a $60 to $70 million industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Krause |first1=Adam |title=Inside the Dangerous (and Lucrative) Business of Alligator Farming |url=http://www.inc.com/adam-krause/business-of-the-alligator.html |accessdate=28 August 2014 |work=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]] |publisher=[[Mansueto Ventures]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though not truly [[domestication|domesticated]], alligators and crocodiles have been bred in farms since at least the early 20th century. Most of these early businesses, such as [[St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park]], established in 1893, were farms in name only, primarily keeping alligators and crocodiles as a [[tourist attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.american-alligator.com/Crocodiles-and-Alligator-Farms.html |work=Americana-alligator.com |title=Crocodiles and Alligator Farms }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 1960s did commercial operations that either harvested eggs from the wild or bred alligators on-site begin to appear.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/18/archives/one-way-to-halt-poachinggator-farming.html?sq=%2522alligator%2520farm%2522&amp;scp=2&amp;st=cse |title=One Way to Halt Poaching-Gator Farming |last=Medley |first=Cynthia|date=January 18, 1970 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely driven by diminishing stocks of wild alligators, which had been hunted nearly to extinction by that time.

As the [[American alligator]] was placed under official protection in 1967 (under a law preceding the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]]), farming alligators for skins became the most viable option for producing leather.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Mostly concentrated in the Southern U.S. states of [[Louisiana]], [[Florida]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the practice quickly spread to other nations. Both the American and [[Chinese alligator]] are farmed intensively today, mostly within each species' respective native region. The [[Nile crocodile]] is found in ranches all over Africa, and the [[saltwater crocodile]] is farmed in Australia and other areas. The smaller [[caiman]]s are generally not of enough market value to farm, though captive breeding of the [[spectacled caiman]] does take place in South America.

Farming alligators and crocodiles first grew out of the demand for skins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/30/us/anahuac-journal-alligator-farmer-feeds-demand-for-all-the-parts.html?sq=alligator+meat&amp;scp=3&amp;st=cse+20th |title=Anahuac Journal; Alligator Farmer Feeds Demand for All the Parts |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 30, 1998 |last=Lyman |first=Rick }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can fetch hundreds of dollars each. But alligator and crocodile meat, long a part of [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern cooking]] (especially [[Cajun cuisine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/travel/fare-of-the-country-louisiana-alligator-from-pies-to-picante.html?sq=alligator+meat&amp;sec=travel&amp;scp=2&amp;st=cse |title=Louisiana Alligator, From Pies to Picante |date=April 4, 1993 |last=Marcus |first=Frances Frank |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Asian and [[African cuisine]]s, began to be sold and shipped to markets unfamiliar with crocodilian meat. Chinese cuisine based on [[traditional Chinese medicine]] considers the meat to be a curative food for colds and [[cancer]] prevention, although there is no [[scientific evidence]] to support this.&lt;ref name=ngm&gt;Chang, L. T., and Olson, R.. Gilded Age, Gilded Cage. ''National Geographic Magazine'', May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vietnamese cuisine#Exotic dishes|Crocodiles were eaten by Vietnamese]] while they were taboo and off limits for Chinese.

==Effects==
A common misconception is that crocodilians are an easy source of revenue and not difficult to care for in captivity; however, few crocodilian businesses are successful in the developing world. To offset overhead costs and have a regular source of income, crocodilian facilities can add tourism; in this way alligator farming can assist native species and provide people with work.&lt;ref name= "Brien" /&gt;

Alligator farming has minimal adverse effects on the environment,&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Thomas J. and Ruppert, Kathleen C., 1987.{{cite web|url=http://myfwc.com/media/310209/Alligator_IFASrfac002.pdf |title=Alternative Opportunities for Small Farms: Alligator Production Review |publisher=Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has at least two positive direct effects on alligator conservation. Because the luxury goods industry has a reliable stream of product, illegal [[poaching]] is reduced. Juvenile crocodilians can also be released into the wild to support a steady population. Wild alligator conservation has also benefited indirectly from farming. Ranching businesses protect alligator habitats to take care of nesting sites. The fiscal incentive to keep a healthy environment for breeding alligators means that the environment and its wildlife are seen as an economic resource. This can augment the government’s willingness to take care of crocodilian populations.

Animals other than crocodilians may benefit from a similar application of sustainable and ethical farming.&lt;ref&gt;Moyle, Brendan (July 2013). {{cite journal|title=Conservation that's more than skin-deep: alligator farming|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1663–1677 |doi=10.1007/s10531-013-0501-9 | last1 = Moyle | first1 = Brendan|year = 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

Ranching, wild harvesting, and captive breeding are the three ways to obtain crocodilians recognized by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES) and the Crocodile Specialist Group (CSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control of operations that breed Appendix-I animal species for commercial purposes|url=http://www.cites.org/|website=CITES|publisher=CITES|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alligators can be raised in captivity on farms or on ranches. Alligator farms breed alligators, whereas ranches incubate and rear hatchlings collected from the wild. Farms do collect eggs from the wild but they also keep breeding adults in their facilities to produce their own eggs whereas ranches do not.&lt;ref name= "Heykoop2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heykoop|first1=Jerry|last2=Frechette|first2=Darren|title=Gatornomics: Profitable and sustainable use of alligators in the southeastern United States|journal=Marine Resource Economics|date=2001|volume=16|issue=2|pages=127–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blake|first1=D.K.|last2=Loveridge|first2=J.P.|title=The role of commercial crocodile farming in crocodile conservation|journal=Biological Conservation|date=1975|volume=8|issue=4|pages=261–272|doi=10.1016/0006-3207(75)90004-x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Farming and ranching operations typically return a certain percentage of juveniles to the wild at a size associated with a high survival rate, an approach that increases overall alligator survival rates from the low numbers of successful eggs and juveniles usually observed in the wild.&lt;ref name = "Elsey2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsey|first1=Ruth|last2=McNease|first2=Larry|last3=Joanen|first3=Ted|title=Louisiana's alligator ranching programme: a review and analysis of releases of captive-raised juveniles|journal=In Crocodilian Biology and Evolution|date=2001|issue=Surrey Beaty &amp; Sons, Chipping Norton|pages=426–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crocodiles can be housed in a number of ways depending on the goals of the rearing facility. Large areas of a lake or marsh can be enclosed for many individuals or a smaller area can be created for fewer individuals.

Alligators and crocodiles can be raised in captivity with "open cycle" or "closed cycle" methods. Open cycle refers to programs that are concerned with the health of the wild population and are using captive rearing as a means to supplement the wild populations.&lt;ref name = "Brien" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=J.H.|last2=Rahman|first2=M.M.|title=An assessment of crocodile resource potential in Bangladesh|journal=Proceedings of the 12th Working Meeting of the Crocodile Specialist Group|date=1994|volume=1|issue=IUCN – The World Conservation Union Gland, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorbjarnarson|first1=John|title=Crocodiles: An action plan for their conservation|date=1992|publisher=UUCN|location=Gland, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-cycle operations are primarily concerned with harvest. In closed cycle operations, adult females are kept in captivity, and the eggs they lay are collected, incubated artificially, hatched, and the juveniles are grown to a certain size and harvested.&lt;ref name = "Thor" /&gt; Closed cycle operations provide no incentive for conservation and are often unsuccessful because the cost of starting and managing the operation often outweighs the profits gained from products. Although the cost of operating an open cycle operation is comparable to closed cycle, the goal of an open cycle operation is the overall health of the species, rather than economic profit. Captive breeding and ranching operations provide more incentive to protect natural populations and are important contributors to the success of crocodilian populations.&lt;ref name= "Brien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Economics" /&gt;

==Concerns==

===Animal welfare===
Welfare concerns include the threat of crocodilian diseases such as caiman pox, [[Adenovirus|adenoviral Hepatitis]], [[mycoplasmosis]], and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydiosis]].  Crocodiles suffer from stress in confined spaces such as farms, leading to disease outbreaks.  Most crocodilians keep a body temperature within 28 and 33 degrees Celsius. On farms, body temperatures can reach 36 degrees Celsius, which affects the animals' immune system, and puts them at risk of various illnesses. Another concern is for the cleanliness of the water in enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Dzoma, B. M., Sejoe, S., Segwagwe, B. V., E. June 2008. {{Cite journal |url=http://search.proquest.com/naturalscicollection/docview/274650120/14142F30403C345766/11?accountid=13626 |title=Commercial crocodile farming in Botswana |journal=Tropical Animal Health and Production |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=377–381 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pests===
Many alligator farms in the United States have experienced property damage from ''Sus scrofa'' (feral swine).&lt;ref&gt;Elsey, Ruth M.,  Mouton, Edward C. Jr, and Kinler, Noel., 2012. {{Cite journal |title=Effects of Feral Swine (Sus scrofa) on Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) Nests in Louisiana |journal=Southeastern Naturalist |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=205–218 |doi=10.1656/058.011.0204 |year = 2012|last1 = Elsey|first1 = Ruth M.|last2=Mouton |first2=Edmond C. |last3=Kinler |first3=Noel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease===
Between 2001 and 2003, West Nile virus (WNV) infected and caused deaths resulting in economic loss in [[American alligator]]s in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller et al. 2003, Jacobson et al. 2005, Nevarez et al. 2005 {{title needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;Unlu, Isik, Kramer, Wayne L., Roy, Alma F., Foil, Lane D., July 2010. {{Cite journal |title=Detection of West Nile Virus RNA in Mosquitoes and Identification of Mosquito Blood Meals Collected at Alligator Farms in Louisiana |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=625–633 |doi=10.1603/ME09087 |year = 2010|last1 = Unlu|first1 = Isik|last2=Kramer |first2=Wayne L. |last3=Roy |first3=Alma F. |last4=Foil |first4=Lane D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; WNV has been found in Mexico at a crocodile farm in [[Ciudad del Carmen]].&lt;ref&gt;Farfan, Jose A. et al 2006.{{ Cite journal |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/74/5/908.full.pdf+html |title=Antibodies to West Nile Virus in Asymptomatic Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico |journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=908–914 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skin, most notably the underside, of alligators and crocodiles is of commercial value, so diseases of the skin needs to be treated properly and effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Dzoma, B. M., Sejoe, S., Segwagwe, B. V., E. June 2008. {{Cite journal |url=http://search.proquest.com/naturalscicollection/docview/274650120/14142F30403C345766/11?accountid=13626 |title=Commercial crocodile farming in Botswana |journal=Tropical Animal Health and Production |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=377–381 |accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crocodilian diseases vary between species. [[Salmonellosis]] is common on some farms, and is acquired from infected food; it may also be spread by poor hygiene practices. [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]], (specifically ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'') can persist for years if not treated, for example with [[tetracycline]]. Crocodilians may acquire [[mycobacteria]] from infected meat.&lt;ref&gt;Huchzermeyer, F.W. 1997{{Cite journal |url=http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D9168.PDF |title=Public health risks of ostrich and crocodile meat | journal=Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epiz. |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=599–604 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illnesses affecting crocodilians include crocodile pox, which is caused by Parapoxvirus, affecting hatchlings and juveniles. It causes a brown residue to form around the eyes, oral cavity, and tail. Caiman pox similarly causes white lesions around the eyes, oral cavity, and tail. Adenoviral [[Hepatitis]] causes organ failure and death. Mycoplasmosis causes polyarthritis and pneumonia in crocodilians under the age of three. Infected animals have swollen jaws and are unable to move. Chlamydiosis has two forms that affects juveniles under one year of age. The first causes acute hepatitis, usually resulting in death.  The other causes chronic bilateral conjunctivitis, usually resulting in blindness.&lt;ref&gt;Huchzermeyer, F.W. 2002{{Cite journal|url=http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D513.PDF|title=Diseases of farmed crocodiles and ostriches |journal=Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epiz. |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=265–276 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parasitic infections include tapeworm cysts, ''Trichinella spiralis nelsoni'' in the meat of Nile crocodiles in Zimbabwe, and Coccidia.

===Escape===
There have been reports of crocodiles escaping from farms during flooding. In 2013, approximately 15,000 crocodiles were released into the Limpopo River from flood gates at the nearby Rakwena Crocodile Farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Africa police join hunt for 10,000 escaped crocodiles|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/us-safrica-crocodiles-idUSBRE90N0OT20130125|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2013-01-25|access-date = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A crocodilian farm in Louisiana (in reality, Jamaica) is featured in the 1973 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''. [[List of James Bond henchmen in Live and Let Die#Tee Hee Johnson|Tee Hee Johnson]], one of the villain's henchman, attempts to feed James Bond to the alligators and crocodiles.

In the second season of ''[[The Amazing Race Australia]]'', teams had to visit a Cuban alligator farm and feed a wheelbarrow full of chum to a pen of alligators along with capturing an alligator with a stick and rope in order to receive their next clue.

'''David Belasco''' (July 25, 1853 – May 14, 1931) was an American [[theatrical producer]], [[impresario]], [[theatre director|director]] and [[playwright]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was the first writer to adapt the short story ''[[Madame Butterfly (short story)|Madame Butterfly]]'' for the stage, and he launched the theatrical career of many actors, including [[Mary Pickford]], [[Lenore Ulric]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Belasco pioneered many innovative new forms of stage lighting and special effects in order to create realism and naturalism.&lt;ref name=Osnes&gt;Osnes, Beth, and Gill, Sam. ''Acting: An International Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO (2001) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marker&gt;Marker, Lise-Lone, ''David Belasco: Naturalism in the American Theater'', Princeton Univ. Press (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
David Belasco was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], the son of Abraham H. Belasco (1830–1911) and Reyna Belasco (née Nunes, 1830–1899), [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jews who had moved from [[London]]’s Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community during the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt;{{rp|13}} He began working in a San Francisco [[theatre]] doing a variety of routine jobs, such as [[call boy (theatre)|call boy]], script copier or as an extra in small parts.&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt;{{rp|14}} He received his first experience as a stage manager while on the road. He said, "We used to play in any place we could hire or get into{{mdash}}a hall, a big dining room, an empty barn; any place that would take us."&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt;{{rp|14}}

From late 1873 to early 1874, he worked as an actor, director, and secretary at [[Piper's Opera House]] in [[Virginia City, Nevada]], where he found "more reckless women and desperadoes to the square foot…than anywhere else in the world". He said that while there, seeing "people die under such peculiar circumstances" made him "all the more particular in regard to the psychology of dying on the stage. I think I was one of the first to bring naturalness to bear in death scenes, and my varied Virginia City experiences did much to help me toward this. Later I was to go deeper into such studies." By March 1874, he was back at work in San Francisco. His recollections of that time were published in ''Hearst's Magazine'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Belasco, David. ''Gala Days of Piper's Opera House and the California Theater''. 1914. Sparks, NV:, Falcon Hill Press, 1991: v–vi, 18, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually was given the opportunity to act and serve as a stage manager, learning the business inside out. A gifted playwright, Belasco went to [[New York City]] in 1882 where he worked as stage manager for the [[Madison Square Theatre]] (starting with ''[[Young Mrs. Winthrop (play)|Young Mrs. Winthrop]]''), and then the [[Lyceum Theatre (New York, 1885-1902)|old Lyceum Theatre]] while writing plays. By 1895, he was so successful that he set himself up as an independent producer.

==Career==
[[File:David Belasco 1873.jpg|thumb|Belasco in 1873]]
During his long creative career, stretching between 1884 and 1930, Belasco either wrote, directed, or produced more than 100 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays including ''[[Hearts of Oak (play)|Hearts of Oak]]'', ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'', and ''Du Barry'', making him the most powerful personality on the New York city theater scene. He also helped establish careers for dozens of notable stage performers, many of whom went on to work in films.

Among them were [[Mrs. Leslie Carter|Leslie Carter]], dubbed "The American Sarah Bernhardt,"&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; whose association with Belasco skyrocketed her to theatrical fame after her roles in ''[[Zaza (play)|Zaza]]'' (1898) and ''Madame Du Barry'' (1901).&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; [[Ina Claire]]'s lead in ''Polly with a Past'' (1917) and [[The Gold Diggers (1919 play)|''The Gold Diggers'']] (1919), similarly propelled her career.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Belasco wrote a lead part for 18-year-old [[Maude Adams]], in his new play, ''[[Men and Women (play)|Men and Women]]'' (1890), which ran for 200 performances.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

Other stars whose careers he helped launch included [[Jeanne Eagels]], who would later achieve immortality as [[Sadie Thompson]] in ''Rain'' (1923), which played for 340 performances.&lt;ref name=Botto&gt;Botto, Louis; Viagas, Robert. ''At this Theatre: 100 Years of Broadway Shows, Stories and Stars'', Hal Leonard Corp. (2002) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Belasco discovered and managed the careers of [[Lenore Ulric]]&lt;ref name=NYT-obit&gt;"Lenore Ulric, Broadway Star of Belasco Era, Is Dead at 78", ''The New York Times'', December 31, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Warfield]], both of whom became major stars on Broadway. He launched the career of [[Barbara Stanwyck]], which included changing her name.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

Belasco is perhaps most famous for having adapted the short story ''[[Madame Butterfly (short story)|Madame Butterfly]]'' into [[Madame Butterfly (play)|a play with the same name]] and for penning ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (play)|The Girl of the Golden West]]'' for the stage, both of which were adapted as operas by [[Giacomo Puccini]] (''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' 1904—twice,  after revision) and ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' (1910). More than forty [[motion pictures]] have been made from the many plays he authored.

''A Life of Barbara Stanwyck: Steel-True 1907-1940'', Simon and Schuster (2013) ebook&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many prominent performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries sought the opportunity to work with Belasco; among them were [[D. W. Griffith]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mary Pickford]]&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; and [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; DeMille's father had been close friends with Belasco, and after DeMille graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he began his stage career under Belasco's guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, David. ''Lost Hollywood'', Macmillan (2001)  p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; DeMille's later methods of handling actors, using dramatic lighting and directing films, was modeled after Belasco's staging techniques.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

Pickford appeared in his plays ''The Warrens of Virginia'' at the first Belasco Theatre in 1907 and ''A Good Little Devil'' in 1913. The two remained in touch after Pickford began working in Hollywood; Belasco appeared with her in the 1914 film adaptation of ''A Good Little Devil''. He is also credited as giving Pickford her stage name. He also worked with [[Lionel Barrymore]] who starred in his play ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'' opposite [[Lucille Kahn]], whose Broadway career Belasco launched. Belasco was a member of [[The Lambs]] from 1893 to 1931.

==Marriage==
David Belasco was married to Cecilia Loverich for over fifty years; they had two daughters, Reina and Augusta.

==Death==
Belasco died in 1931 at the age of 77 in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=David Belasco Dies. Dean Of Theatre, 76, Had Long Been Ill.

==Influence on American theatre==
[[Image:Belasco's The Heart of Maryland.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'' with [[Maurice Barrymore]] and [[Mrs. Leslie Carter]]]]

Belasco demanded a natural acting style, and to complement that, he developed stage settings with authentic lighting effects to enhance his plays. His productions inspired several generations of theatre lighting designers.&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Belasco's contributions to modern stage and lighting techniques were originally not appreciated as much as those of his European counterparts, such as [[André Antoine]] and [[Constantin Stanislavski]], however today he is regarded as "one of the first significant directorial figures in the history of the American theatre," writes theatre historian Lise-Lone Marker.&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt;{{rp|xi}}

He brought a new standard of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] to the American stage as the first to develop modern stage lighting along with the use of colored lights, via motorized color changing wheels, to evoke mood and setting.&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt;{{rp|xi}}&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt; America's earliest stage lighting manufacturer, [[Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company|Kliegl Brothers]], began by serving the specialized needs of producers and directors such as Belasco and [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt;{{rp|157}} With regard to these modern lighting effects, Belasco is best remembered for his production of ''Girl of the Golden West'' (1905), with the play opening to a spectacular sunset which lasted five minutes before any dialogue started.&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Belasco became one of the first directors to eschew the use of traditional footlights in favor of lights concealed below floor level, thereby hidden from the audience. His lighting assistant, Louis Hartmann, fabricated Belasco's design ideas.&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt;{{rp|29}} He also used follow spots to further create realism and often tailored his lighting configurations to complement the complexions and hair of the actors.&lt;ref name=Cox&gt;Cox, Jim. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RwVkMMLqMdkC Sold on Radio: Advertisers in the Golden Age of Broadcasting]''. Jefferson, North  Carolina: McFarland, 2008; reprint 2013. {{ISBN|9780786433919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}} He ordered a specially made 1000-watt lamp developed just for his own productions, and was the only director to have one for the first two years after its introduction (1914-1915).&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt;{{rp|135}}

In his own theatres, the dressing rooms were equipped with lamps of several colors, allowing the performers to see how their makeup looked under different lighting conditions.

Supposedly he put appropriate scents to set scenes in the ventilation of the theaters, while his sets paid great attention to detail, and sometimes spilled out into the audience area. In one play, for instance, an operational laundromat was built onstage. In ''[[The Governor's Lady]]'', there was a reproduction of a [[Childs Restaurant]] kitchen where actors actually cooked and prepared food during the play. He is even said to have purchased a room in a [[flophouse]], cut it out of the building, brought it to his theater, cut out one wall and presented it as the set for a production. Belasco's original scripts were often filled with long, specific descriptions of props and set dressings. He has not been noted for producing unusually naturalistic scenarios.

Belasco also embraced existing theatre technology and sought to expand on it. Both of Belasco's New York theatres were built on the cutting edge of their era's technology. When Belasco took over the Republic Theatre he drilled a new basement level to accommodate his machinery; the Stuyvesant Theatre was specially constructed with enormous amounts of flyspace, hydraulics systems and lighting rigs. The basement of the Stuyvesant contained a working machine shop, where Belasco and his team experimented with lighting and other special effects. Many of the innovations developed in the Belasco shop were sold to other producers.

[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] references Belasco's reputation for realism in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' when he has a drunken visitor in the library of Gatsby's mansion exclaim in amazement that the books are genuine: "See!" he cried triumphantly. "It's a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn't cut the pages."&lt;ref&gt;F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uRVGCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33 The Great Gatsby]'', chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatres==
{{See also|Belasco Theatre}}

The first Belasco Theatre in New York was located at 229 West 42nd Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues, in the [[Times Square]] district of Manhattan. Belasco took over management of the theater and completely remodeled it in 1902, only two years after it was constructed as the Theatre Republic by [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] (the grandfather of the famous lyricist). He gave up the theater in 1910 and it was renamed the Republic. Under various owners, it went through a tumultuous period as a [[burlesque]] venue, hosted second-run and, eventually, pornographic films and fell into a period of neglect before being rehabilitated and reopened as the [[New Victory Theater]] in 1995.

The second [[Belasco Theatre]] is located at 111 West 44th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues, only a few blocks away from the New Victory. It was constructed in 1907 as the Stuyvesant Theatre and renamed after Belasco in 1910. The theater was built to Belasco's wishes, with [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] lighting and ceiling panels, rich woodwork and murals. His business office and private apartment were also housed there. The Belasco is still in operation as a Broadway venue with much of the original decor intact. In 2010 it underwent a massive US $14.5 million restoration, which strove to renovate and restore the theater to the condition it was in when David Belasco was alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/theater/29isherwood.html?pagewanted=all|title=Belasco Theater Is Burnished, and Back|first=Charles|last=Isherwood|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belasco Theatres also existed in several other cities. In Los Angeles, the first Belasco Theatre was located at 337 S. Main St. The theater, which hosted the Belasco Stock Company, opened in 1904 and was operated by David Belasco's brother, Frederick. This theater was renamed twice: as the Republic in about 1913 and as the Follies, circa 1919. The theater eventually became a burlesque venue in the 1940s, fell into sharp decline, and was demolished in May 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/follies|title=Follies Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2202|title=Follies Theatre|work=cinematreasures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and perhaps more well known, Los Angeles Belasco Theatre is located at 1050 S. Hill St in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The theatre, which was built by Morgan, Walls &amp; Clements, opened in 1926, and was managed by Edward Belasco, another of David's brothers. Many Hollywood stars with theatrical roots, as well as Broadway stars who were visiting the West Coast, appeared at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/belasco|title=Belasco Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater declined after the death of Edward Belasco in 1937.

'''''Devil Daggers''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Indie video game development|indie development]] team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving for as long as possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early [[Video game graphics#3D|3D]] games released in the 1990s.

''Devil Daggers'' was released for [[Windows]] in February 2016, after being [[Steam Greenlight|greenlit]] for release on [[digital distribution]] platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted that during the latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style made it difficult to understand what was happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of ''Devil Daggers'' to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Devil daggers screenshot.png|The player character is looking at a set of approaching enemies. Daggers are fired from the fingers of their outstretched hand.|thumb]]
''Devil Daggers'' is a [[shooter game|shooter]] [[video game]] with gameplay experienced from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The goal of the game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. ''Devil Daggers'' opens with the [[player character]] standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt; Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt; In the arena, demonic enemies begin [[Spawning (video gaming)|spawning]].&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt; Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt; As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear.&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt; Each enemy makes a unique and continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt;

The player kills enemies by firing daggers from their fingers.&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt; There are two firing options: clicking the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers with a wide spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt; Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies.&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt; Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt; The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage.&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt; At the top of the screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted.&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt; The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard.&lt;ref name="rps_2_oct" /&gt; Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a [[top-down perspective]].&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;

As enemies accumulate in the arena, the amount of safe space decreases.&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt; This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness.&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt; The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt; The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can [[bunny hopping|gain a speed boost]] by [[Strafing (gaming)|strafing]] while jumping.&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt; The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be [[Rocket jumping|propelled further]] and perform a [[Double jump (video gaming)|double jump]] by firing downwards while still in the air.&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt;

==Development and release==
''Devil Daggers'' was developed by Sorath, a [[Melbourne]]-based [[independent video game developer]]. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of ''[[Dustforce]]'' creators Hitbox Team.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra_press" /&gt; The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged [[Video game graphics#3D|3D]] models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games.&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rps_14_dec" /&gt; Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] games; however, the recreation of these effects in ''Devil Daggers'' is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement.&lt;ref name="pcgamer_style" /&gt; Enemy designs are [[hell]]ish, with some entities taking the form of [[insectoid]]s with skeletal features.&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt; Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rps_14_dec" /&gt;

Sorath submitted ''Devil Daggers'' to [[Steam Greenlight]], a community selection system, so that the game could be released on [[digital distribution]] platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="pcgamer_greenlight" /&gt; The game was successfully greenlit and released for [[Windows]] on 18 February 2016.&lt;ref name="rps_launch" /&gt; On 6 July 2016, Sorath released an [[OS X]] version of ''Devil Daggers''. Alongside this release, two new enemy types were added to the game and the ''Devil Daggers'' soundtrack was added to the game's [[Directory (computing)|directory]].&lt;ref name="rps_mac" /&gt; Support for [[vertical sync]], increased [[Field of view in video games|field of view]], and virtual surround sound via [[Head-related transfer function|HRTF-processing]] were also added.&lt;ref name="rps_mac" /&gt; On 19 September 2016, a [[Linux]] version of ''Devil Daggers'' was released along with the ability to view replays from a top-down perspective. The update also added more statistics such as tracking a player's total survival time across all runs.&lt;ref name="rps_linux" /&gt;

''Devil Daggers'' received "generally favourable" reviews from critics according to [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt; Critics compared the gameplay and graphics favourably to first-person shooters of the 1990s such as ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hardcore_review" /&gt; Reviewers were pleased with how ''Devil Daggers'' offered a stripped-down experience of these games, and provided a fast and pure gameplay experience.&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hardcore_review" /&gt;

The game's fluid movement system was compared to arena shooters ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' and ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' by [[Edge (magazine)|''Edge'' magazine]]. They welcomed the inclusion of advanced movement techniques, saying they felt "fresh" when implemented in a survival context. They also thought that ''Devil Daggers'' refined on so much of the borrowed elements, that it would be inaccurate to simply call the game a "nostalgic throwback".&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;  ''Devil Daggers'' was considered to be a perfect distillation of old school arena shooters by Zack Furniss, writing for ''[[Destructoid]]''.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt; ''[[Kill Screen]]'' writer Davis Cox praised the "frenetic, [[bullet hell]]" nature of ''Devil Daggers'', but felt that there was opportunity to incorporate more interesting levels and spaces into the game.&lt;ref name="killscreen_review" /&gt;

Tom Senior of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' enjoyed the "oppressive" and "hellish" atmosphere created by the deliberate use of old rendering techniques and effects.&lt;ref name="pcgamer_style" /&gt; Both [[GameSpot]] and [[IGN]] critics agreed that although the retro visual style was fitting, it could also become a hindrance when the excessive clutter of pixelated enemies made it difficult to interpret what was happening on screen.&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt; Furniss of ''Destructoid'' stated that the visuals might not appeal to everyone, but he loved the horror aspect and sense of nostalgia that it evoked.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;

The game's sound design was lauded by critics. Reviewers especially liked the practical use of unique and continuous enemy noises. Being able to pinpoint an enemy's location when they were obscured from view was seen as an interesting aspect of the game's audio.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eurog_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rps_review" /&gt; The cacophony created by enemies was described as "chilling" by IGN reviewer Chloi Rad. She also felt that the audio combined well with the fluid movement to provide the player with the information and means for dealing with enemies.&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt;

Many reviewers discussed the high level of difficulty presented by ''Devil Daggers'', calling the experience "intense" and "brutal", but also "gleeful" and "exhilarating".&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eurog_review" /&gt; ''Edge'' called the game an "expertly designed test of skill".&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt; GameSpot reviewer Mike Mahardy believed that surpassing the 60 second mark in a run was a feat.&lt;ref name="gamespot_review" /&gt; [[Eurogamer]] writer Johnny Chiodini thought the game excelled at being a short experience and highlighted that becoming proficient in ''Devil Daggers'' was a process of repetition and refinement.&lt;ref name="eurog_review" /&gt; Writing for ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'', Mark Steighner called the game addictive and thought that it was ideal for people obsessed with chasing high scores in games.&lt;ref name="hardcore_review" /&gt; Critics also liked the replay feature and pointed out that it was a great way to learn from other players and heighten the competitive aspect among the community.&lt;ref name="ign_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rps_review" /&gt;

''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' named ''Devil Daggers'' as the best game of 2016. Writers of the website complimented its gameplay, aesthetic, and sound design.&lt;ref name="rps_goty" /&gt; In January 2017, they placed ''Devil Daggers'' fifth on their list of the fifty best first-person shooters on PC.&lt;ref name="rps_best_fps" /&gt; Chris Thursten of ''PC Gamer'' named ''Devil Daggers'' as his personal game of the year, calling it "flawlessly designed".&lt;ref name="pcgamer_goty" /&gt;

The '''French drop''', also known as ''"Le Tourniquet"'', is a [[sleight of hand]] method used by [[Magician (illusion)|magicians]] to vanish a small object such as a coin. It is one of the oldest methods of vanishing, however it is still effective when properly executed.&lt;ref name="Bobo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Coin Magic|author=J.B.Bobo|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1982}} P.37&lt;/ref&gt; Although the method is known as a vanish, it can also be used as a switch or transformation, giving rise to numerous possibilities.&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt;

==Method==
The object is held between the thumb and first two finger tips. When using a coin, it is held by its edges and tilted up slightly so it can be seen by the spectators. The other hand appears to take the coin, placing the thumb behind the coin and the fingers in front, however the coin is left behind and [[Palming| palmed]].&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Simple Sleight-of-Hand: Card and Coin Tricks for the Beginning Magician|author=Paul Zenon|authorlink=Paul Zenon|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2007}} p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Furby''' is an American [[Electronics|electronic]] [[robot]]ic toy released in 1998 by [[Tiger Electronics]]. It resembles a [[hamster]] or [[owl]]-like creature and went through a period of being a "[[Fad|must-have]]" toy following its [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]] launch, with continual sales until 2000. Over 40 million Furbies were sold during the three years of its original production, with 1.8 million sold in 1998, and 14 million in 1999. Its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages.

Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a [[domestic robot|domestically-aimed robot]]. A newly purchased Furby starts out speaking entirely "Furbish", the unique language that all Furbies use, but is programmed to start using English words and phrases in place of Furbish over time. This process is intended to resemble the process of learning English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/encounterswithkismet.pdf |date=2004-09-30 |publisher=[[MIT]] |title=Encounters with Kismet and Cog: Children Respond to Relational Artifacts |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated Emoto-Tronic Furby, with voice-recognition and more complex facial movements, was sold by [[Hasbro]] between 2005–2007. They released another updated Furby with [[LCD]] eyes and a [[mobile app]] for the holiday season in 2012.

==History==

===Initial creation===
Dave Hampton and Caleb Chung spent nine months creating the Furby (in addition to nine months spent designing the toy). After two attempts at licensing the concept, they invited fellow toy and game inventor Richard C. Levy to join their efforts to sell Furby. Levy brought Furby to Tiger Electronics and Tiger's Roger Shiffman bought the rights to it. Furby's first public appearance was at the American International Toy Fair in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Banks |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/june/toys/index.html |title=Furby Co-Inventor Richard Levy |publisher=NPR |date=2002-06-18 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/rlevy.html |title=Inventor of the Week: Archive |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sloane |first=Julie |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/07/01/325614/index.htm |title=Game Theories The man who made the Furby fly explains how he comes up with his ideas. – July 1, 2002 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2002-07-01 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://andelman.com/2010/10/complete-idiots-guide-author-and-furby-inventor-richard-c-levy-creates-ways-to-avoid-mr-media/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306044136/http://andelman.com/2010/10/complete-idiots-guide-author-and-furby-inventor-richard-c-levy-creates-ways-to-avoid-mr-media/ |date=March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Furby, a McDonaldsToy circa 2001, with bright blue coat.jpg|thumb|Furby toy from McDonald's]]
Furbies originally retailed for about US$35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/05/furby/index.html |date=1998-10-05 |publisher=CNN |title=New toy an interactive fur ball |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon release, they sold very well. Catapulting demand during the 1998 Christmas period drove the resale price over $100, and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies sold for over $300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to the different aesthetic varieties, and sellers assigned rarity values to them.

The significant aftermarket demand (and price) for the toy resulted in cases of fraud in which customers paid for Furbies that were never delivered. Parental battles, arguments, and fights increased rapidly as supplies dwindled, and when retail supplies ran out, parents turned to the [[Internet]], where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. During one 12-month period, a total of 27 million Furby toys were sold.&lt;ref name="Furby 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Collecting|first=Furbys|title=Furbys &amp; Furby Collecting|url=http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/features/furbys/|work=Yes|publisher=Word CollectorsNet|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 revival===
2005 saw the reintroduction of Furby with the release of the new Emoto-Tronic Furby.

===2012 revival===
On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Hasbro would be making a new line of Furbies. The new line was released in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/308423/furby-s-coming-back-five-things-to-know-about-this-iconic-toy |title=Furby's Coming Back! Five Things to Know About This Iconic Toy |publisher=E! Online |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2012 there were sixteen colors: Teal, white, black, purple, tangerine-tango, yellow, aqua, navy blue, plum, pink, pink/teal, orange/blue, black/pink, blue/yellow, teal/purple, gray/teal.&lt;ref name=Furby&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasbro|first=Electronics|title=Furby|url=http://m.furby.com/furby_en_US/catalog?cid=2750936&amp;p=2&amp;ps=10&amp;s=7&amp;k=|work=Yes|publisher=Hasbro|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furbies were one of the eleven toys named top toys for Christmas 2013 by the Toy Retailers Association at the DreamToys Convention where they unveil their predictions for most popular holiday toys annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Toys for Christmas 2013|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/12/07/top-toys-for-christmas-2013/20783883/#!slide=1915852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Classic Furbies===
The main reason for their popularity{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} was because of apparent "intelligence", reflected in their ability to develop language skills.

Furbies can communicate with one another via an [[infrared]] port located between their eyes. Furbies start out speaking entirely "Furbish", a language with short words, simple syllables, and various other sounds. They are programmed, however, to speak less and less Furbish and more and more [[English language|English]] as they "grow".

There was a common misconception that they repeated words that were said around them. This belief most likely stemmed from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] banned them from their offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 |publisher=CNN |date=1999-01-13 |title=Furby a threat to national security? |accessdate=2006-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060828044552/http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple electric motor and a system of cams and gears close the Furby's eyes and mouth, raise its ears, and lift it off the ground in a ''faux'' display of mobility.

The originals are popular with many [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] as they can be dissected and made to do interesting things. In particular, their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces make them popular with the [[circuit bending]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LPvW8R1zbD0|Circuit-bent Furby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circuit-bent.net/furby-bending-tutorial.html |title=Furby Bending Tutorial |first=Kevin |last=Rees |publisher=Circuit-Bent.Net |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Furbies===

====Furby Babies====
In 1999, the Furby Babies line was introduced. Furby Babies are smaller than the original, have higher voices, and cannot dance, but they switch to speaking English more quickly. They also have an extended vocabulary and different "Easter eggs" and "games" built into them. Furby babies come in 24 different colors. All have white eyelashes and one of six different eyecolors.

====Furby Friends====
Novel Furbies were also released, including an interactive Furby-like "Gizmo", from the film ''[[Gremlins]]'', a Furby-like "Interactive [[Yoda]]" based on the Star Wars character, and a Furby-like "Interactive [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]" from the movie of the same name. Another "friend of Furby", called "Shelby", is similar to Furby, but looks like a clam, has vast improvements in memory, and has a different personality; it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies. They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds, can sense being upside down (they say things like "Shiver me timbers" and "Walk the plank" when left them upside-down for an extended period of time), and they laugh when "tickled" (their antennae&amp;nbsp;– or "tennies", as they like to call them). They also purr when "petted". They can be fed by sticking a finger in their mouth. Similarly, Shelbies do not have their own names, unlike the classic Furbies. Shelbies are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby, saying phrases such as "Where's Furby?"—though they cannot differentiate between a Furby and a Furby Baby—they just assume it is a Furby. In addition to English, Shelbies also know some Furbish words and also have their own unique language called "Shelbish".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Emoto-Tronic Furbies====

This Furby was released in August 2005. Larger than the previous version, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, enabling them to communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them 'sleep', and they have an on/off switch. They can communicate with other Emoto-tronic Furbies, though to a lesser extent than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies nor Funky Furbies. They also lack light sensors and basic motion sensors and do not respond to loud sounds as the originals do. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island.

====Emoto-Tronic Furby Babies====
In 2006, a new version of Furby baby was released, with most notable features being the new look and a more "baby-ish" appearance in contrast to the Emoto-Tronic Furby adult. They also have considerably fewer features than the "adult" Furby, with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity. Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto-Tronic Baby Furby is the movable "legs" which unfurl when Furby baby is awake. Although they were a European exclusive, they were sold in the US via the Hasbro Toy Shop website.

====Emoto-Tronic Funky Furbies====
The Funky Furbies were released in August 2006 outside the United States. They are limited to two color combinations (pink and yellow; purple and green), and they can sing three new songs and dance. They can be taught dance routines and remember them.

====2012 Furbies====
A new Furby was released in the fall of 2012. It has more expressive LCD eyes, a wider range of motions, its own [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app, and the ability to adapt its personality in reaction to user behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8/24/12 12:00pm 8/24/12 12:00pm |url=https://gizmodo.com/5937402/the-new-furby-review-absolute-horror |title=The New Furby Review: Absolute Horror |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The on-off switch is replaced with a reset button; the Furby turns itself off after one minute of inactivity.

====Furby Party Rockers====
Furby's smaller friends launched March 2013 and unlike their full-sized Furby companions, which grow and learn through human interaction, each Party Rocker is born with its own unique personality, making ready to interact with its owner straight from the box. There are four Furby Party Rockers, called Twitby, Fussby, Scoffby and Loveby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furbypartyrockers.co.uk/ |title=Furby Party Rockers |publisher=Furby Party Rockers |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furby Boom====
In summer of 2013, about a year after the Furby 2012 came out, a new Furby was released with new different colors and new Personalities. It has a brand new [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)]] app, called Furby BOOM, with many new features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2427353,00.asp|title=Furby Boom|author=|date=|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/11196342/Furby-that-interacts-with-iPads-is-among-must-have-Christmas-toys.html|title=Furby that interacts with iPads is among 'must-have' Christmas toys|author=|date=30 October 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furblings (toy version)====
In June 2014, a toy version of the Furblings from the Furby Boom app was released along with a Golden limited time one.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It can communicate with Furby Booms, and can be used with the app too.

====Furby Boom Crystal====
The release for Christmas 2014 is called the Furby Boom Crystal series, with a redesign of the ears, face and feet and a new bright neon fur. The [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps have also been redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Furby Boom Crystal Series Review|url=http://boomcrystaltoys.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furby Boom Crystal Furblings====
In early 2015, it announced toy version of the Furby Boom Crystal Furblings from the app were released. Like the other Furblings, it can communicate with Furby Boom Crystals, and be used with the app.

====Furbacca====
In June 2015, a Furby that resembles Chewbacca from Star Wars was released. It is similar to the Furby Boom because it can hatch Furblings with the same app and more. It is known as the Wookie Furby and the new Furby Friend.

====Furby Connect====
In 2016 another new Furby with more expressive eyes and movements was released, along with an app containing a whole world of Furblings for it to interact with. The Furby Connect has a translucent plastic joystick on its head which lights up different colors when toggled and is used to control games played with Furblings in the app. Unlike the 2012 Furby and Furby Boom, the Furby Connect does not change personalities. However it can sing songs that it "learns" from the app.

==Security concerns==
On January 13, 1999, it was reported the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States banned Furbies from entering NSA's property due to concerns that they may be used to record and repeat classified information, advising those that see any on NSA property to "contact their Staff Security Officer for guidance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/254094.stm|title=BBC News – Americas – Furby toy or Furby spy?|author=|date=|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/furbies-banned-at-us-spy-base-1046935.html|title=Furbies banned at US spy base|author=|date=|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 |title=CNN – Furby a threat to national security? – January 13, 1999 |author= |date= |work=archive.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826021319/http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01/ |archivedate=August 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Shiffman, the owner of Tiger Electronics, stated that "Furby has absolutely no ability to do any recording whatsoever," and that he would have gladly told the NSA this if he was asked by anyone from the spy agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/14/julianborger1 |title=Secret agent Furby sneaks into spies' inner sanctum |date=14 January 1999 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}} Additionally, Dave Hampton demonstrated that Furby's microphone can't record any sound at all, and can only hear a single monotonous beep if a loud sound is produced around Furby, and no words or waveforms can be made out at all.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} He too was never questioned by the NSA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The ban was eventually withdrawn.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Security researchers discovered that the microphone on a Furby Connect can be remotely activated and used to record voice through a [[Bluetooth]] connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/technology/connected-toys-hacking.html?hpw&amp;rref=technology&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well|title=A Cute Toy Just Brought a Hacker Into Your Home|last=Frenkel|first=Sheera|date=21 December 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furbish-English phrases==
"Furbish" is the Furbies' language, with simple syllables, short words, and various sounds. A newly purchased Furby starts out speaking entirely in Furbish. Over time, the Furby gradually replaces Furbish words and phrases with English.
* '''wee-tah-kah-loo-loo''': Tell me a joke.
* '''wee-tah-kah-wee-loo''': Tell me a story.
* '''wee-tee-kah-wah-tee''': Sing me a song.
* '''u-nye-loo-lay-doo?''': Do you want to play?
* '''u-nye-ay-tay-doo?''': Are you hungry?
* '''u-nye-boh-doo?''': How are you?
* '''u-nye-way-loh-nee-way''': Go to sleep now.
* '''u-nye-noh-lah''': Show me a dance.

Furbies may say these Furbish words:
* '''doo?''': What? (Furbies say this when called)
* '''doo-dah''': Yes. (Furbies say this in response to a command before doing it)
* '''boo''': No. (Furbies say this when they do not want to carry out a command)
* '''yoo?''': Why will you not play with me today? (This usually means the Furby is upset)

==Film adaptation==
[[Bob Weinstein]] announced in November 2016 that a Furby film adaptation is to be produced by [[The Weinstein Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |date=2 November 2016 |title=AFM: Bob Weinstein Unveils Furby Movie for TWC-Dimension |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/afm-bob-weinstein-furby-movie-twc-dimension-1201907667/ |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |access-date=10 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was written by Daniel Persitz and Devon Kliger, and will contain both [[live action]] and [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] characters.&lt;ref name=slash&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderton |first=Ethan |date=4 November 2016 |title=There’s a Furby Movie in the Works, Because That Toy Was a Thing Once |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/furby-movie/ |publisher=[[/Film]] |access-date=10 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the film's narrative, Hasbro executive Stephen Davis stated that "we think that this can resonate as a [[four-quadrant movie|four-quadrant film]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7624">'''Gambling in Japan''' is generally banned by the [[Criminal Code of Japan|Criminal Code]] chapter 23;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/PC.pdf Criminal Code of Japan] PDF&lt;/ref&gt; however, there are several exceptions, including betting on [[horse racing]] and certain [[motor sports]].&lt;ref name="sumo supremo" /&gt;

Public sports, [[lottery]], and toto (football pools) are held under special laws in order to increase the income of national and local governments, as well as to offer a form of entertainment for many people.

==Public sports==
''Kōei kyōgi'' (公営競技, public sports) are public races that people in Japan can gamble on legally. There are four different types of ''kōei kyōgi'': [[horse racing]], ''[[Keirin#Keirin in Japan|bicycle racing]], [[Kyōtei|powerboat racing]], and [[Auto Race (Japanese sport)|asphalt speedway]] [[motorcycle speedway|motorcycle racing]]. ''They are allowed by special laws and are regulated by local governments or governmental corporations.

The prize pool for the gamblers of these races are about 75-80% of total sales. Betting tickets are available at countless circuits and ticket booths within many cities, namely [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Yokohama]], and [[Nagoya]].

==Lottery==
[[File:Takarakuji Ikebukuro 2011.jpg|thumb|Small street shop, in [[Ikebukuro]], selling takarakuji tickets.]]
Takarakuji (宝くじ), i.e., lotteries, are held by [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] or [[City designated by government ordinance|large cities]] on a regular basis all throughout the calendar year.

There are three main types of lotteries: unique number lotteries, selected number lotteries, and scratch cards. Each lottery ticket is sold at 100 to 500 yen, and the top cash prizes are usually 100 million yen or more.

The takarakuji law stipulates that the entire prize pool for any given lottery is to be less than 50% of total sales, with the rest going to local government organizations and charities. Takarakuji tickets are available at takarakuji booth and stores in many cities. Tickets for selected number lotteries can be also bought at some [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s.

==Pachinko==
{{main article|Pachinko}}
[[Pachinko]] is a [[pinball]]-like [[slot machine]] game. It is officially not considered gambling because Japanese laws regard pachinko as an exception to the criminal code on gambling for historical, monetary, and cultural reasons. Pachinko parlours can be found all over Japan, and they are operated by private companies. As of 2011, there are about 12,480 pachinko parlors in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majiroxnews.com/2011/04/21/gov-sparks-pachinko-bashing/: Gov. sparks pachinko bashing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In pachinko, when a player's ball makes it into a special hole to activate the slot machine and a jackpot is made, they are rewarded with more balls. Players can then exchange the balls for prizes of different value at a booth in the parlour. Money cannot be awarded at pachinko parlors as this would be in violation of the criminal code. However, players almost always exchange pachinko balls for special tokens, usually slits of gold encased in plastic, and then "sell" them at a neighboring shop for cash. Usually such shops are also owned by the parlor operators, but as long as the winners do not receive cash in the parlour, the law is not broken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120202214818/http://blog.thejapanesetutor.com/playing-pachinko-how-illegal-gambling-is-legal-in-japan-2010-09 Playing Pachinko: How Illegal Gambling Is Legal in Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal gambling==
[[Yakuza]] are known to operate illegal casinos in Japan. In addition to traditional casino games, [[Mahjong]] can be played for money and many mahjong parlors have ties with the Yakuza to assist collecting debt from players who default.

Another illegal gambling opportunity is offered by mobile gambling sites. At these sites, Japanese gamblers can play [[rock-paper-scissors]] and win cash prizes. In 2010, the owner of one of these sites was arrested and confessed to earning over $1 million. The players purchased betting tickets for ¥315. They could win ¥1,000 if they won three times in a row while ¥10,000 was the prize for those who won five times in a row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=793&amp;catid=21&amp;subcatid=144#10 Gambling in Japan: Gambling in Japan: Bicycles, Boats and Horse Racing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casinos==
There were movements within the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) government to open [[casino]]s to boost [[tourism in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] [http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/seisaku/2006/seisaku-006.html discussion about casinos in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  Operating casinos remains illegal in Japan, and recent [[sports betting]] on [[baseball]] by [[sumo]] wrestlers has caused a scandal.&lt;ref name="sumo supremo"&gt;{{cite news

On April 4, 2011, [[Shintaro Ishihara]], the previous Tokyo Governor, spoke against the pachinko parlours, arguing that the popular game together with vending machines eat up about 1000&amp;nbsp;kWh.{{clarify|reason=1000 kWh per what unit of time?|date=August 2016}} He said that following the consequences the earthquake of March 11, 2011, the government asked people to reduce energy consumption, but asking wasn't enough and the government order was not enacted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2011/04/11/tokyo-governor-takes-aim-at-vending-machines-pachinko/ Tokyo Governor Takes Aim at Vending Machines, Pachinko]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Ishihara has been pushing the legalization of casinos for quite a while. In 2000, he proposed building casinos in Odaiba, but despite the high public interest, the idea wasn't totally approved. One of the arguments was that the Japanese being not used to gambling would be too prone to addiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20000116a3.html Viva Odaiba! Ishihara dreams of casinos in the bay]&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility for the development of the casino industry in Japan is the creation of floating casinos. The idea of boat gambling is also actively supported by Ishihara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantraveler.com/issues/0005/racism.html Racism in Japan: Racism as a Business Defence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Casino legislation in Japan has picked up fresh momentum with lawmakers preparing to submit the Integrated Resort (IR) Enabling Act to the Diet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/japan-casino-idUSL2N0WW0C520150330]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Japanese lawmakers approved a bill that officially allows casinos in the country. Three casinos in the form of integrated resorts will be established in different locations. The IRs will come with restrictions and Japanese locals will only be able to visit the casinos three times per week, or ten times a month. Japanese visitors will also be charged a 6,000 yen entrance fee to help discourage addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180720/p2g/00m/0fp/133000c|title=Japan's Diet approves opening of casino resorts despite opposition|last=|first=|date=July 20, 2018|website=The Mainichi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dame Gracie Fields''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DBE}} (born '''Grace Stansfield'''; 9 January 1898{{spaced ndash}}27 September 1979) was an English actress, singer and comedienne and star of both cinema and [[music hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba14f3df1|title=Gracie Fields|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/gracie-fields-p23366|title=Gracie Fields - Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos - AllMovie|website=AllMovie}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent the later part of her life on the isle of [[Capri]], Italy. Fields was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for "services to entertainment" in 1938, and in 1979, seven months before her death, she was invested a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Dame]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/451952/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Fields, Gracie (1898-1979) Biography|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Fields was born Grace Stansfield, over a [[Fish and chips|fish and chip shop]] owned by her grandmother, Sarah Bamford, in Molesworth Street, [[Rochdale]], Lancashire. She made her first stage appearance as a child in 1905, joining children's repertory theatre groups such as 'Haley's Garden of Girls' and the 'Nine Dainty Dots'. Her two sisters, Edith and Betty, and brother, Tommy, all went on to appear on stage, but Gracie was the most successful. Her professional debut in variety took place at the Rochdale Hippodrome theatre in 1910 and she soon gave up her job in the local [[cotton mill]], where she was a half-timer, spending half a week in the mill and the other half at school.

Fields met the comedian and impresario [[Archie Pitt]] and they began working together. Pitt gave Fields champagne on her 18th birthday, and wrote in an autograph book to her that he would make her a star. Pitt began to manage her career and they began a relationship; they married in 1923 at [[Clapham]] Register Office. Their first revue was called ''Yes I Think So'' in 1915 and the two continued to tour Britain together until 1924. That year they appeared in the revue ''Mr Tower of London'', with other shows ''By Request'', ''It's A Bargain'' and ''The Show's The Thing'', during the following years.

Pitt was the brother of Bert Aza, founder of the Aza agency, which was responsible for many entertainers of the day including the actor and comedian [[Stanley Holloway]], who was introduced to Aza by Fields. Fields and Holloway first worked together on her film ''[[Sing As We Go]]'' in 1934 and the two remained close friends for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Anthony Baker |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/feature.php/27936/jack-beckitt |work=The Stage|title=Obituaries / Jack Beckitt |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fame===
Fields came to major public notice in ''Mr Tower of London'', which appeared in London's West End.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/fields-gracie-1898-1979|title=FIELDS, Gracie (1898-1979) - English Heritage|website=www.english-heritage.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career accelerated from this point with legitimate [[Drama (art form)|dramatic]] performances and the beginning of a recording career.

At one point, Fields was playing three shows a night in London's West End. She appeared in the Pitt production ''SOS'' with [[Gerald Du Maurier]], a legitimate production staged at the [[St James's Theatre]].

Fields' most famous song, which became her theme, "Sally", was worked into the title of her first film, ''[[Sally in Our Alley (1931 film)|Sally in Our Alley]]'' (1931), which was a major box office hit. She went on to make several films initially in Britain and later in the United States (for which she was paid a record fee of £200,000 for four films). Regardless, she never enjoyed performing without a live audience, and found the process of film-making boring. She tried to opt out of filming, before director [[Monty Banks]] persuaded her otherwise, landing her the lucrative Hollywood deal. Fields demanded that the four films be filmed in Britain and not Hollywood, and this was the case.

The final few lines of the song "Sally", which Fields sang at every performance from 1931 onwards, were written by her husband's mistress, Annie Lipman. Fields claimed in later life that she wanted to "Drown blasted Sally with Walter with the aspidistra on top!", a reference to two other of her well-known songs, "Walter, Walter", and "It's the Biggest Aspidistra in the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Helen Smith Bevington]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di0KqkvZPYgC&amp;pg=PA158 |title=The Journey is Everything: A Journal of the Seventies |page=158 |date=1983 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, NC |isbn=0-8223-0553-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous opera star [[Luisa Tetrazzini]] heard her singing an aria and asked her to sing in grand opera.  Gracie decided to stay "where I knew I belonged."&lt;ref&gt;''Rochdale Observer'', Saturday 29 September 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity work===
In the 1930s her popularity peaked and she was given many honours: the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Officer of the Venerable Order of St. John]] (for charity work), the [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) (for services to entertainment) in 1938 and the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Borough of Rochdale]] in 1937.

She donated her house in [[The Bishops Avenue]], north London (which she had not much cared for and which she had shared with her husband Archie Pitt and his mistress) to an orphanage after the marriage broke down. In 1939, she became seriously ill with [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/123122/Truth-about-Gracie-s-life-in-exile|title=Truth about Gracie's life in exile|author=David Bret|website=Daily Express|date=27 August 2009|access-date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public sent over 250,000 goodwill messages and she retired to her villa on [[Capri]]. After she recovered, she recorded a very special 78rpm record simply called ''Gracie's Thanks'', in which she thanks the public for the many cards and letters she received while in hospital. During World War II, she paid for all servicemen/women to travel free on public transport within the boundaries of Rochdale.

Fields also helped [[Rochdale F.C.]] in the 1930s when they were struggling to pay fees and buy sports equipment.

In 1933 she set up the Gracie Fields Children's Home and Orphanage at [[Peacehaven]], Sussex, for children of those in the theatre profession who could not look after their children. She kept this until 1967, when the home was no longer needed. This was near her own home in Peacehaven, and Fields often visited, with the children all calling her 'Aunty Grace'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091117190143/http://www.peacehavencouncil.co.uk/index.php/historic-peacehaven/famous-residents "Famous Residents"], Peacehaven Council&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

In 1939, Fields suffered a breakdown and went to Capri to recuperate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Afro American'', newspaper, 2 December 1939, page 6 – (article) ''Twelve Sing Way Back to America'' by William N. Jones – "''[[Bricktop]] has been back in America several weeks while [[Adelaide Hall]] has been singing for the soldiers. Miss Hall, whose popularity with the British Tommy’s ranks with that of Gracie Fields, may remain in England as Miss Fields has recently suffered a breakdown.''"(retrieved 14 October 2015): https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2211&amp;dat=19391118&amp;id=5k9AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RgMGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1335,3800200&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
World War II was declared while she was recovering in Capri, and Fields – still very ill after her cancer surgery – threw herself into her work and signed up for the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA) headed by her old film producer, [[Basil Dean]]. Fields travelled to France to entertain the troops in the midst of air-raids, performing on the backs of open lorries and in war-torn areas. She was the first artist to play behind enemy lines in Berlin.

Following her divorce from Archie Pitt, she married Italian-born film director [[Monty Banks]] in March 1940. However, because Banks remained an Italian citizen and would have been interned in the United Kingdom after Italy declared war in 1940, she went with him to North America, possibly at the suggestion of [[Winston Churchill]] who told her to "Make American Dollars, not British Pounds",&lt;ref name="express"/&gt; which she did, in aid of the Navy League and the Spitfire Fund. She and Banks moved to their home in [[Santa Monica]], California. Fields occasionally returned to Britain, performing in factories and army camps around the country. After their initial argument, Parliament offered her an official apology.

Although she continued to spend much of her time entertaining troops and otherwise supporting the war effort outside Britain, this led to a fall-off in her popularity at home. She performed many times for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops, travelling as far as [[New Guinea]], where she received an enthusiastic response from Australian personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/23/chapters/10.pdf |title=Home - Australian War Memorial|work=awm.gov.au |format=PDF |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1945 she toured the South Pacific Islands.

===Past World War II===
After the war, Fields continued her career less actively. She began performing in Britain again in 1948 headlining the [[London Palladium]] over [[Eartha Kitt]] who was also on the bill. The BBC gave her her own radio show in 1947 dubbed ''Our Gracie's Working Party'' in which 12 towns were visited by Fields, and a live show of music and entertainment was broadcast weekly with Fields compering and performing, and local talents also on the bill. This tour commenced in Rochdale. Like so many BBC shows at the time, this show transferred to [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] in 1950, sponsored by Wisk soap powder. Billy Ternent and his Orchestra accompanied her.

In 1951, Fields opened the [[Festival of Britain]] celebrations{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}. She proved popular once more{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, though never regaining the status she enjoyed in the 1930s. She continued recording, but made no more films, moving more towards light classical music as popular tastes changed, often adopting a religious theme. She continued into the new medium of LP records, and recorded new takes of her old favourite songs, as well as new and recent tracks to 'liven things up a bit'.

Monty Banks died on 8 January 1950&lt;ref name=tmb-banksdead&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56929680 |title=Death Of Gracie Fields Husband |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Queensland |date=10 January 1950 |accessdate=9 March 2015 |volume= |number=№ 27622 |page=1 |via=[[Trove]]-National Library of Australia |format=scan}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a heart attack while travelling on the [[Orient Express]]. On 18 February 1952 in Capri, Fields married Boris Alperovici, a Romanian radio repairman.&lt;ref name=yahoo-boris &gt;{{cite web |last1=Gavaghan |first1=Julian|title=On This Day: British star Gracie Fields marries Romanian repairman in Italy |url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/on-this-day--british-star-gracie-fields-marries-romanian-repairman-in-italy-170744644.html#yKABwCH |publisher=uk.news.yahoo.com |accessdate=9 March 2015 |date=17 February 2014 |quote=Gracie Fields married a Romanian radio repairman [Boris Alperovici] in a quiet ceremony in Italy on this day [February 18] in 1952.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that he was the love of her life, and that she couldn't wait to propose to him. She proposed on Christmas Day in front of friends and family. They married at the Church of St. Stefano on Capri in a quiet ceremony before honeymooning in Rome.

She lived on her beloved [[Capri|Isle of Capri]] for the remainder of her life, at her home ''La Canzone Del Mare'', a swimming and restaurant complex which Fields' home overlooked. It was favoured by many Hollywood stars during the 1950s, with regular guests including [[Richard Burton]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Noël Coward]].

===Later years===
She began to work less, but still toured the UK under the management of [[Harold Fielding]], manager of top artists of the day such as [[Tommy Steele]] and [[Max Bygraves]]. Her UK tours proved popular, and in the mid-1960s she performed farewell tours in Australia, Canada and America – the last performance was recorded and released years later.

In 1956, Fields was the first actress to portray the title character in [[Miss Marple]]&lt;ref name=gwldrec&gt;{{cite web |title=First actress to portray Miss Marple on TV |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-actress-to-portray-miss-marple-on-tv |website=www.guinnessworldrecords.com |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] Limited |accessdate=16 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216090033/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-actress-to-portray-miss-marple-on-tv |archive-date=16 February 2015 |quote=The earliest actress to portray Miss Marple was the UK's Gracie Fields in the NBC (USA) Goodyear TV Playhouse: ''A Murder is Announced'' in 1956.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a US TV production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[A Murder is Announced]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0591121/fullcredits#cast |work=Goodyear Playhouse |title=A Murder Is Announced (Full Cast &amp; Crew) |year=1956 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb)  |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production featured [[Jessica Tandy]] and [[Roger Moore]], and predates the [[Margaret Rutherford]] films by some five years. She also starred in television productions of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', ''[[The Old Lady Shows Her Medals]]''&amp;nbsp;– for which she won a TV Award&amp;nbsp;– and ''Mrs 'Arris Goes to Paris'', which was remade years later with [[Angela Lansbury]] as Mrs Harris, a charwoman in search of a fur coat (or a Christian Dior gown in Lansbury's case.)

In 1957, her single "Around the World" peaked at No.8 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], with her recording of "[[Little Donkey]]" reaching No.20 in November 1959.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

She was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1960 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/gracie_fields.html|title=Gracie Fields|website=www.bigredbook.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields regularly performed in TV appearances, being the first entertainer to perform on [[Val Parnell]]'s ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/london_palladium.htm|title=SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE LONDON PALLADIUM - A TELEVISION HEAVEN REVIEW|first=laurence|last=marcus|website=www.televisionheaven.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields had two Christmas TV specials in 1960 and 1961, singing her old favourites and new songs in front of a studio audience. 1971 saw ''A Gift For Gracie'', another TV special presented by Fields and [[Bruce Forsyth]]. This followed on from her popularity on ''[[Stars on Sunday (TV series)|Stars on Sunday]]'', a religious programme on Britain's [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], in which well-known performers sang hymns or read extracts from the Bible. Fields was the most requested artist on the show.

In 1968, Fields headlined a two-week Christmas stint at the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]'s prestigious [[Batley Variety Club]]. "I was born over a fish and chip shop&amp;nbsp;– I never thought I'd be singing in one!" claimed Fields during the performance recorded by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/analysis/the-variety-club-that-made-batley-the-las-vegas-of-the-north-1-8459782|title=The variety club that made Batley the ‘Las Vegas of the North’|website=www.yorkshirepost.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, her album ''The Golden Years'' reached No. 48 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"/&gt;

In 1978, she opened the Gracie Fields Theatre, next to [[Oulder Hill Community School]] in her native Rochdale, performing a concert there recorded by the BBC to open the show. Fields appeared in ten [[Royal Variety Performance]]s from 1928 onwards, her last being in 1978 at the age of 80 when she appeared as a surprise guest in the finale, in which she appeared and sang her theme song, "Sally".&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

Her final TV appearance came in January 1979 when she appeared in a special octogenarian edition of ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' in America, in which she sang the song she popularised in America, "The Biggest Aspidistra in the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-merv-griffin-show/episode-714649/203074/|title=The Merv Griffin Show|website=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields was notified by her confidante John Taylor while she was in America that she had the Queen's invitation to become a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], to which she replied: "Yes I'll accept, yes I can kneel&amp;nbsp;–  but I might need help getting back up, and yes I'll attend&amp;nbsp;–  as long as they don't call Boris 'Buttons'."

=== Death ===
Fields' health declined in July 1979, when she contracted [[pneumonia]] after performing an open-air concert on the [[HMY Britannia|Royal Yacht]] which was docked in Capri's harbour.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} After a spell in hospital, she seemed to be recovering, but died on 27 September 1979.&lt;ref name=grv-gracie /&gt; The press reported she died holding her husband's hand, but in reality he was at their Anacapri home at the time, while Gracie was home with the housekeeper, Irena. She is buried in Capri's Protestant Cemetery&lt;ref name=grv-gracie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5203 |title=Gracie Fields (1899–1979)  |work=findagrave.com |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a white marble tomb. Her coffin was carried by staff from her restaurant. Her husband Boris died on 3 July 1983.&lt;ref name=grv-boris&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/123729638 |title=Boris Alperovici (? – 1983)  |work=findagrave.com |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and popular culture==
Fields was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1938. In February 1979, she was invested as a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]&lt;ref name="London Gazette"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/47723/supplements/7|title=Supplement to the London Gazette|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven months before her death at her home on Capri, aged 81.

Gracie Fields was mentioned in the 1987 film ''[[Wish You Were Here (1987 film)|Wish You Were Here]]'', the 1996 film ''[[Intimate Relations (1996 film)|Intimate Relations]]'', and the 2006 film ''[[The History Boys (film)|The History Boys]]''.

On 3 October 2009 the final train to run on the [[Oldham Loop Line|Oldham Loop]] before it closed to be converted to a tramway, a [[British Rail Class 156|Class 156]], was named in her honour.&lt;ref name="Rochdale Online"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/2/news-headlines/30712/train-named-after-rochdale-star |title=Train named after Rochdale star |publisher=Rochdale Online |accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields was granted the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of Rochdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIc52NJieeU |title=Alderman Crowder grants the Freedom of Rochdale to Gracie Fields |publisher=YouTube |date=8 September 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local theatre in Rochdale, the Gracie Fields Theatre, was opened by her in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graciefieldstheatre.com/ourgracie.html |title=Gracie Fields Theatre, Rochdale |publisher=Graciefieldstheatre.com |date=27 September 1979 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, a statue of Fields was unveiled outside [[Rochdale Town Hall]] which is the first statue of a woman to be erected for over a century in [[Greater Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/our-gracie-comes-home-rochdale-salutes-gracie-fields-with-statue|title='Our Gracie' comes home: Rochdale salutes Gracie Fields with statue|last=Halliday|first=Josh|date=2016-09-19|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hobo with a Shotgun''''' is a 2011 Canadian [[black comedy]] [[Action film|action]] [[exploitation film]] directed by [[Jason Eisener]], written by John Davies, from a story by Eisener, and starring [[Rutger Hauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenrush.co.uk/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18497327.html|title=Two New Clips From Hobo With A Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the [[Grindhouse (film)#Hobo with a Shotgun|trailer of the same title]] in [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s [[South by Southwest]] ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' contest.

== Plot ==
A [[hobo]] arrives by [[boxcar]] in the city of Hope Town, its welcome sign reading "Scum Town". The city is brutally ruled over by "The Drake" and his sadistic sons Ivan and Slick. The Hobo sees an [[amateur film|amateur]] [[Filmmaking|filmmaker]] shooting a "[[Bumfights|Bumfight]]" movie. A bloodied man, Logan, The Drake's younger brother, screams for help. The Drake and his sons arrive and, labelling him a traitor to the townspeople, publicly [[decapitation|decapitate]] him with a barbed-wire noose.

Wishing to buy a [[lawnmower]] in a [[pawn shop]], The Hobo begs for change on a sidewalk. However, after seeing a group of [[Punk subculture|punks]] drag in a homeless man, he sneaks into The Drake's [[nightclub]]. Inside, the brothers and their henchmen torture and kill homeless people in arcade-style games. Slick begins harassing a boy named Otis, who owes him money, and Ivan snaps Otis' arm. Abby, a prostitute, defends Otis. Slick prepares to kill her, but The Hobo knocks him unconscious and carries him to the police station. There, he learns of the police chief's [[corruption]] and complicity in criminal activities. The brothers and the chief carve "scum" into his chest and throw him into a garbage bin. He meets Abby, who helps him recover.

The next day, The Hobo goes to the filmmaker and completes a series of degrading acts, including chewing glass, to purchase the lawnmower. A trio of robbers enter and hold a woman and her baby hostage. The Hobo grabs a [[pump-action shotgun|shotgun]] from the shelf and kills the robbers. Realizing that Hope Town needs justice, he buys the shotgun, costing the same as the lawnmower, and kills dozens of [[criminal]]s, including the filmmaker, a [[pimp]], a [[Cocaine|coke]] [[Drug lord|lord]], and a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] dressed as [[Santa Claus]].

The Drake, infuriated, lets his sons loose. They burn a school bus filled with children — who are friendly to hobos — and burst into a television station, killing the anchorman during a live broadcast — who had expressed his appreciation of the hobo; they demand that all homeless people be killed. The Drake then joins them and orders The Hobo be brought to him. A mass murder of the city's [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] begins.

As Abby is walking home, a cop attempts to rape her. The Hobo kills him and Abby smuggles The Hobo past a group in a shopping cart covered with the cop's remains. The pair are spotted by Otis, who informs Slick and Ivan. Back at her apartment, The Hobo tells Abby of his plan to start a lawnmowing business, which she enthusiastically supports. Ivan and Slick enter and attack the two, wounding Abby. The Hobo overpowers Slick, holds him at gunpoint, and forces Ivan to leave. The Hobo then shoots Slick in the groin and takes Abby to the hospital. Slick manages to call The Drake before he is taken to [[hell]] in a burning school bus. The Drake, mourning the death of his favorite son, summons "The Plague", a duo of armor-clad demons named Rip and Grinder. While Abby is recovering, The Hobo visits the maternity ward and delivers a monologue to the babies. When he returns to Abby's room, The Plague capture and deliver him to The Drake, who plans to publicly execute him.

Recovered, Abby returns to the pawn shop for weapons. Attaching an axe to The Hobo's shotgun and retrofitting the lawnmower into a shield, she arms a crowd to free The Hobo and bring down The Drake. She confronts The Drake, holding Ivan hostage; The Drake shoots and denounces him a disappointment. In the ensuing fight, Abby kills Grinder. Although The Drake severs Abby's hand with the lawnmower shield, she stabs him repeatedly with her exposed arm bone and incapacitates him. Rip tries to persuade Abby to be his partner, but The Hobo drives him off.

The townspeople, motivated by Abby's bravery, have shown up with their own weapons and proceed to aim them at the shocked police, who demand that they leave the area. Seeing that the police will kill the people they failed to protect against the criminals, the Hobo tells Drake that on their upcoming ride to Hell "I've got shotgun", and blows his head off. The police open fire on the Hobo and the people then turn their guns on the police. Both groups shoot each other, while the Hobo dies and Abby's screams are heard.

=== Alternative ending ===
In an extended ending that was taken out from the final cut of the film, Abby's hand is replaced by several shotguns, as she becomes the new member of The Plague.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10799">'''Hypertext fiction''' is a genre of [[electronic literature]], characterized by the use of [[hypertext]] links that provide a new context for non-linearity in literature and reader interaction. The reader typically chooses links to move from one node of text to the next, and in this fashion arranges a story from a deeper pool of potential stories.  Its spirit can also be seen in [[interactive fiction]].

The term can also be used to describe traditionally-published books in which a [[nonlinear narrative]] and interactive narrative is achieved through internal references. [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), [[Enrique Jardiel Poncela]]'s ''[[La Tournée de Dios]]'' (1932), [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]'' (1941), [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'' (1962), [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Rayuela]]'' (1963; translated as ''Hopscotch''), and [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[The Castle of Crossed Destinies]]'' (1973) are early examples predating the word "[[Hypertext#History|hypertext]]", while a common pop-culture example is the ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' series in [[young adult fiction]] and other similar [[gamebook]]s. ''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]'' (1941) is both a hypertext story and is sometimes used as a description of having different possible paths.

== Definitions ==
There is little consensus on the definition of hypertext literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yellowlees |first=Jane Douglas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReMjJYdo2n0C&amp;pg=PA3 |page=3 |title=The End of Books—or Books Without End?: Reading Interactive Narratives |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2001 |isbn=0472088467}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similar term cybertext is often used interchangeably with hypertext.&lt;ref&gt;Aarseth, Espen.1997. ''ergodic Literature''. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. http://www.hf.uib.no/cybertext/Ergodic.html&lt;/ref&gt; In hypertext fiction, the reader assumes a significant role in the creation of the narrative. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a [[linear]] piece of literature, such as a [[novel]], and a [[game]]. In a novel the reader has no choice, the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and the characters are all chosen by the author, there is no 'user,' just a 'reader,' this is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what actions to take, what punches to punch, or when to jump.

To [[Espen Aarseth]], cybertext is not a [[genre]] in itself; in order to classify traditions, [[literary genres]] and [[aesthetic value]], [[Plain text|texts]] should be examined at a more local level.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David, Degrees of Freedom, retrieved from http://www.uv.es/~fores/programa/bolter_freedom.html&lt;/ref&gt;  To Aarseth, hypertext fiction is a kind of '''[[ergodic literature]]''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no [[wikt/extranoematic|extranoematic]] responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Aarseth, the process of reading immersive narrative, in contrast, involves "trivial" effort, that is, merely moving one's eyes along lines of text and turning pages; the text does not resist the reader.

== History ==

The first hypertext fictions were published prior to the development of the [[World Wide Web]], using software such as [[Storyspace]] and [[HyperCard]]. Noted pioneers in the field are [[Judy Malloy]] and [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]. 

[[Douglas Anthony Cooper|Douglas Cooper]]'s ''[[Delirium (Cooper novel)|Delirium]]'' (1994) was the first novel serialized on the World Wide Web; it permitted navigation between four parallel story strands. On June 21, 1996, Bobby Rabyd (aka [[Robert Arellano]]) published the World Wide Web's first interactive novel,&lt;ref&gt;Ciccarello, Lisa. [http://www.pifmagazine.com/2000/01/swiveling-my-hipsthrough-the-interbunk "Swiveling My Hips through the Interbunk (And Having a Great Time, Too)"]. Pif Magazine: January, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunshine 69'', with navigable maps of settings, a nonlinear calendar of scenes, and a character "suitcase" enabling readers to try on nine different points of view. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, [[Mark Amerika]] released ''GRAMMATRON'', a multi-linear work that was eventually exhibited in art galleries.  In 2000, it was included in the [[Whitney Museum|Whitney Biennial of American Art]].&lt;ref name="nytwhitneylist"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/120899whitney-list.html Artists Selected for the 2000 Whitney Biennial]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, women and feminist artists took advantage of hypertext and produced dozens of works. [[Linda Dement]]’s ''Cyberflesh Girlmonster'' a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women’s body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes. Dr. Caitlin Fisher’s  hypertext novella “‘These Waves of Girls“ is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. It won the [[Electronic Literature Organization]] award.

Some other web examples of hypertext fiction include Adrienne Eisen's ''Six Sex Scenes'' (1995),
Stuart Moulthrop's ''Hegirascope'' (1995, 1997), ''The Unknown'' (which won the trAce(Alt X award in 1998), ''The Company Therapist'' (1996-1999) (which won Net Magazine's "Entertainment Site of the Year"), and Caitlin Fisher's ''These Waves of Girls'' (2001) (which won the ELO award for fiction in 2001). More recent works include Stephen Marche's "Lucy Hardin's Missing Period" (2010)&lt;ref&gt;http://walrusmagazine.com/lucyhardin/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul LaFarge|Paul La Farge’s]] * ''Luminous Airplanes''  (2011).

The internationally oriented, but US based, [[Electronic Literature Organization]] (ELO) was founded in 1999 to promote the creation and enjoyment of electronic literature. Other organisations for the promotion of electronic literature include trAce Online Writing Community, a British organisation, started in 1995, that has fostered electronic literature in the UK, Dichtung Digital, a journal of criticism of electronic literature in English and German, and ELINOR, a network for electronic literature in the Nordic countries, which provides a directory of Nordic electronic literature. The Electronic Literature Directory lists many works of electronic literature in English and other languages.

== Characteristics ==
Hypertext fiction is characterized by networked nodes of text making up a fictional story. There are often several options in each node that directs where the reader can go next. Unlike traditional fiction, the reader is not constrained by reading the fiction from start to end, depending on the choices they make. In this sense, it is similar to an encyclopaedia, with the reader reading a node and then choosing a link to follow. While this can be done more easily on paper, it is quite a different experience on a screen. The reader can be thrown into unpredictable loops because not all of the links are explained by their title. The fiction can contain text, quotes, and images.

There are different forms that hypertext fiction can take. These forms are axial, arborescent, and networked. Axial hypertext fictions have a central story line with links that branch off and return to the central storyline. Arborescent fictions branch into mutually exclusive story lines, and networked fictions have multiple starting points and do not always have a set ending. A single work of hypertext fiction can have a mixture of these three forms.

== Criticism ==
In 2013, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] published an article to describe why hypertext fiction did not become popular; it was because the non-linear stories are difficult to write, since each section of the work would need to introduce characters or concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2013/04/hypertext/ Why No One Clicked on the Great Hypertext Story] March 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, hypertext is widely used to tell linear stories on the Internet by using hypertext links to other articles or arguments that are written by different people.

[[Image:Joel Sweeney.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joel Sweeney]]

'''Joel Walker Sweeney''' (1810 – October 29, 1860), also known as '''Joe Sweeney''', was a musician and early [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrel]] performer.  He is known for popularizing the playing of the [[banjo]].

==Biography==
Born to a farming family in the county of Appomattox, Virginia he claimed to have learned to play the [[banjo]] from local African-Americans. He is the earliest known person to have played the banjo on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his important role in popularizing the instrument, he has often been credited with advancing the physical development of the modern five-string banjo. Whereas the instrument's resonating chamber had formerly been constructed from a gourd (like the banjo's African ancestors and cousins), Sweeney popularized the use of a drum-like resonating chamber (legend has it that he adapted a cheese box for this purpose).&lt;ref&gt;Rice 22..&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been credited with adding the banjo's fifth string, which according to legend was for an instrument he created for his niece between 1831 and 1840. He supposedly added the fifth string because he was "allegedly unhappy with the limited rhythm and melodic variation of the four-string banjos popularly in use." &lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J: "Historical  Origin and Stylistic Developments of the Five-String Banjo", p. 59, ''The Journal of American Folklore'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there is no proof that Sweeney introduced either innovation. "Outlandish claims have been made about Sweeney, from his being the "inventor" of the banjo to his being the first white man to play the banjo. These claims are part of an effort, beginning in the nineteenth century, to divorce the banjo from its African American origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banjo Roots and Branches|last=Winans|first=Robert|last2=Gibson|first2=George|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=Urbana|pages=246|chapter=Black Banjo, Fiddle and Dance in Kentucky and the Amalgamation of African American and Anglo-American Folk Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people assume Sweeney's "fifth string" is the drone string—the ''[[chanterelle]]''—but if Sweeney did really add a fifth string, it would have been another, lower string.  That would provide more melodic and harmonic expression, as the quote suggests. The high-pitched, thumb or drone string (the chanterelle, the fifth on a modern banjo) is seen on surviving 18th-century four-string banjos, and in banjo illustrations that long pre-date Sweeney's heyday.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin.&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth string gives the banjo a [[reentrant tuning]], a feature that existed in instruments of the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweeney began performing with the banjo in the early 1830s. He first performed throughout central Virginia for county court sessions. A few years later he joined a circus and traveled throughout Virginia and North Carolina. By 1839, Sweeney was performing in various blackface venues in New York. His earliest documented use of the banjo on stage was in April 1839. That same month, he performed alongside James Sanford at the [[Broadway Circus]] in New York with a blackface burlesque of  ''The Dying Moor's Defence of His Flag'' called "Novel Duetts, Songs, &amp;c". This was accompanied by a "Comic [[Border Morris|Morris Dance]] by the whole company".&lt;ref&gt;23–26 December 1839. ''New York Herald''. Quoted in Cockrell 52.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Billy Whitlock]] of the [[Virginia Minstrels]], Sweeney gave Whitlock a few banjo lessons around this time.

[[Image:Blacksmith's Shop on a Virginia Plantation (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sweeney's Virginia Melodies, 1847]]

In colonial America the banjo was known as an instrument of "the lower classes,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: Black Folk Music to the Civil War|last=Epstein|first=Dena|publisher=Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|year=1977|isbn=0-252-00520-1|location=Urbana|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1841, Sweeney was remaking the banjo into an instrument for the middle class. His advertisements boasted that he played with "scientific touches of perfection".&lt;ref&gt;18 March 1841. Playbill, [[Bowery Theatre]]. Quoted in Cockrell 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Another raved, "Only those who have heard Sweeny {{sic}} know what music there is in a banjo."&lt;ref&gt;9 December 1841. ''Boston Post''. Quoted in Cockrell 148.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next few years, he was the benchmark against whom other banjo players were compared. After a performance by [[Dan Emmett]] at the [[Bowery Amphitheatre Circus]], the ''[[New York Herald]]'' wrote, "Emmit's {{sic}} banjo playing is fully equal to Jo {{sic}} Sweeney's, and far ahead of any other now in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;31 January 1842. ''New York Herald''. Quoted in Cockrell 149.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Jenny Get Your Hoe Cake Done]]" and "[[Knock a Nigger Down]]" became two of Sweeney's signature tunes.

Sweeney saw success, and by early 1843, he embarked on a European tour that included stops in London and [[Edinburgh]]. In July 1843, Sweeney played during [[entr'acte]]s at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in Edinburgh, [[Scotland]]. [[Frank Brower]] of the [[Virginia Minstrels]] met him there and joined Sweeney's act as a [[bones (instrument)|bones]] player. The two toured, performing in early October at the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] in [[Birmingham]] and later that month in a circus at [[Leicester]]. At some point, Brower parted company to tour with [[Dan Emmett]], though he rejoined Sweeney by spring of 1844.

At this time, [[Dick Pelham]] met up with Sweeney and Brower, and the trio decided to reform the Virginia Minstrels with Sweeney as banjoist. They found Emmett in [[Bolton]] and talked him into joining, although Sweeney would be the troupe leader. The new Virginia Minstrels performed in [[Dublin]] at the Theatre Royal from 24 April to 7 May during entr'actes, then continued for a series of entr'actes and complete minstrel shows in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Belfast]], then [[Glasgow]] by the end of May. They did several shows at the Theatre Royal, Adelphi, and later in the [[Waterloo Rooms]] in Edinburgh, followed by a return engagement in Glasgow, this time at [[Glasgow City Halls|City Hall]].

Joel Sweeney's younger brothers, Sampson ("Sam") and Richard ("Dick"), and his sister Missouri were also talented banjo and fiddle players. In 1845, Joel, Sam, and Dick formed the minstrel troupe "Old Joe's Minstrels". Joel died in Appomattox on 29 October 1860 of [[dropsy]]. Dick also died in 1860.

In 1862 during the [[American Civil War]], Sam Sweeney enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]], serving in Company H of the [[2nd Virginia Cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, Bob. ''The Birth of the Banjo: Joel Walker Sweeney and Early Minstrelsy'', (2007): 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Sweeney and his banjo playing came to the attention of the famed [[cavalry]] general [[J.E.B. Stuart]]. Stuart had Sweeney attached to his staff, which became one of Stuart's best-known personal quirks. Sam Sweeney's signature song, possibly penned by Stuart himself, was "[[Jine the Cavalry]]."  Sam Sweeney died, possibly of [[smallpox]], on January 13, 1864, and was buried in Graham Cemetery, [[Orange, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minstrelbanjo.ning.com/forum/topics/sam-sweeney-memorial Sam Sweeney Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kogarashi Monjirō'''''|木枯し紋次郎|}} is the main character and title of a Japanese novel by {{illm|Saho Sasazawa|ja|笹沢左保}}, probably best known in the televised that broadcast on prime-time in 1972–1973, directed by [[Kon Ichikawa]].

Monjirō is a drifter, iconic for his ragged straw hat and cape outfit and long toothpick in his mouth. His stock phrase was "It's got nothing to do with me".

A film version directed by [[Sadao Nakajima]] appeared in 1972. A [[manga]] version was created by [[Goseki Kojima]] (artist for ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]'').

== Plot ==
Kogarashi Monjirō (See [[#Characters|§Characters]] below) is a ''toseinin'' ([[yakuza]]) in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name=jidaigeki-channel/&gt; He travels alone.{{sfnp|Nomura|1999|pp=183-184}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.konichikawa.com/films_a10.html|title=Kaettekita Kogarashi Monjirō |script-title= 帰ってきた木枯し紋次郎 |website=www.konichikawa.com &lt;!--director Kon Ichikawa's Official Website--&gt;|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is exiled to the island of [[Hachijō-jima]] taking blame for a crime committed by a friend, but when the friend breaches the vow of silence in order to protest Mojirō's innocence, it shatters his faith in people.&lt;ref name=araki/&gt;

==Characters==
;Kogarashi Monjirō

The character is known for always having a long toothpick protruding from his mouth,{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|One source says he chews on a "long reed of grass".&lt;ref name=amano&amp;wiedemann/&gt;}} which sometimes served as a weapon.&lt;ref name=clements&amp;tamamuro/&gt; He wears a weatherbeaten {{illm|sandogasa{{!}}''sandogasa''|ja|三度笠}} hat (type of ''[[Kasa (hat)|kasa]]'' hat), and a dingy {{illm|kappa (cape){{!}}''kappa''|ja|合羽}} cloak.&lt;ref name=clements&amp;tamamuro/&gt;{{sfnp|Sasazawa|1986|p=73}}{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|A ''kasa'' is woven from strands of [[Rush (plant family)|rush]], sedge, or straw, or strips of [[bamboo]].&lt;!--Or [[bamboo]] [[husk]] (''takegawa'') according to some sources--&gt;.{{r|kodansha-headgear}}.}}

He also has a famous [[punch line]], which was "''Asshi ni wa kakawari no nei koto de gozansu'' (It does not concern me)".&lt;!--amano&amp;wiedeman misquotes as "kankei no nei"---&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Or "It's nothing to do with me".&lt;ref name=clements&amp;tamamuro/&gt;
}}

He is a wanderer (''watari-mono''),&lt;ref name=yoshida/&gt; and a skilled swordsman, who winds up aiding people he meets in his wayfaring journey,&lt;ref name=yoshida/&gt; but he maintains he does not act out of altruism or sense of justice, but only acts against those who provoke his anger.&lt;ref name=clements&amp;tamamuro/&gt;

==Television production==
Film director [[Kon Ichikawa]] agreed to take the helm for the TV production partly for financial reasons, hoping to accrue enough capital to fund his cinematic works.&lt;ref name=quandt/&gt; The role of Monjirō was played by then-budding actor [[Atsuo Nakamura]].&lt;ref name=jidaigeki-channel/&gt;&lt;!--新人--&gt;&lt;ref name=quandt/&gt;

Monjirō, especially the TV version, has achieved folk-hero status.&lt;ref name=araki/&gt;

The production was plagued with problems. The lead actor Nakamura injured his [[Achilles tendon]] which disrupted filming, and the series had to go into recess and the hole filled by another program.&lt;ref name=clements&amp;tamamuro/&gt;&lt;!-- c&amp;t says it was "Sure Death" but Japanese Wiki claims Tōge series based on same novelist, Sasazawa, so need verification--&gt; The troubled production company, {{illm|Daiei Kyoto|ja|大映京都撮影所}} also fell into bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=clements&amp;tamamuro/&gt;

==Other adaptations==
[[Sadao Nakajima]] directed the 1972 film version in which the lead role was played by [[Bunta Sugawara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0322981 |Kogarashi Monjirô (1972)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been adapted into ''manga'' by [[Goseki Kojima]], famous for his samurai comic series ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]'' read not only in the United States but internationally.&lt;ref name=amano&amp;wiedemann/&gt;

==Analysis==
The wanderer who can be classed with other television and on-screen heroes like [[Zatōichi]] or and an academic study compares them with the Japanse folk belief in ''[[marebito]]'', wandering spirits who help humankind.&lt;ref name=yoshida/&gt;

The '''Koker trilogy''' is a series of three films directed by acclaimed Iranian filmmaker [[Abbas Kiarostami]]:&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Taste of cherry.png|right|thumb|150px|''[[Taste of Cherry]]'' (1997)]] --&gt; ''[[Where Is the Friend's Home?]]'' (1987), ''[[And Life Goes On]]'' (a.k.a. ''Life and Nothing More'', 1992) and ''[[Through the Olive Trees]]'' (1994). The designation was made by film theorists and critics, rather than by Kiarostami himself, who resists the designation and notes that the films are connected only by the accident of place (referring to the fact that [[Koker, Iran|Koker]] is the name of a northern Iranian village). He has suggested that it might be more appropriate to consider the latter two titles plus ''[[Taste of Cherry]]'' (1997) as a trilogy, since these are connected by the theme of life's preciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=45&amp;eid=63&amp;section=essay The Criterion Collection: Taste of Cherry by Abbas Kiarostami&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Where Is the Friend's Home?'' depicts the simple story of a young boy who travels from Koker to a neighbouring village to return the notebook of a schoolmate. ''Life and Nothing More'' follows a father and his young son as they drive from Tehran to Koker in search of the two young boys from ''Where Is the Friend's Home?'', fearing that the two might have perished in the [[1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake|1990 Iran earthquake]] that killed 50,000 people in northern Iran. ''Through the Olive Trees'' examines the making of a small scene from ''Life and Nothing More'', forcing us to view a peripheral [[drama]] from ''Life and Nothing More'' as the central drama in ''Through the Olive Trees''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/29/kiarostami_rural_space_and_place/ Days in the Country: Representations of Rural Space and Place in Abbas Kiarostami's Life and Nothing More, Through the Olive Trees and The Wind Will Carry Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiarostami's three films are poised between fiction and real life, opening the medium to new formal experiences. They are among his most acclaimed work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/issue/200505 BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | May 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202040216/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/issue/200505/ |date=2006-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Martin emphasises Kiarostami's direct perception of the world and identifies his cinema as being "diagrammatical." Literal "diagrams" inscribed in the landscape, such as the famous zigzagging pathway in the Koker Trilogy, indicate a "geometry of forces of life and of the world". For Martin, these forces are neither complete order, nor complete chaos but rather what lies between these poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmireland.net/reviews/kiarostami.htm Kiarostami: The Art of Living - Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210151223/http://www.filmireland.net/reviews/kiarostami.htm |date=2009-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== 1940s–1950s ===
The term "Latin music" originated from the US due to the growing influence of [[Hispanic and Latino American]]s in the American music market, with notable pioneers including [[Xavier Cugat]] (1940s) and [[Tito Puente]] (1950s) and then accelerating in later decades.&lt;ref name="stavans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vivalatino" /&gt; As one author explained the rising popularity from the 1940s: "Latin America, the one part of the world not engulfed in [[World War II]], became a favorite topic for songs and films for Americans who wanted momentarily to forget about the conflagration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ynt6yc5nGQC&amp;pg=PT263 |title=Skylark: The Life and Times of Johnny Mercer |first=Philip |last=Furia |publisher=Macmillan |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4668-1923-8 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime propaganda for America's "[[Good Neighbor Policy]]" further enhanced the cultural impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian |last=O'Neil |chapter=Carmen Miranda: The High Price of Fame and Bananas |title=Latina Legacies |editor1-first=Vicki L. |editor1-last=Ruiz |editor2-first=Virginia |editor2-last=Sánchez Korrol |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |page=195 |isbn=978-0-19-515398-9 |quote=the power that Hollywood films could exert in the two-pronged campaign to win the hearts and minds of Latin Americans and to convince Americans of the benefits of Pan-American friendship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960s ===
The Brazilian [[bossa nova]] became widespread in Latin America and later became an international trend, led especially by [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taffet |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Watcher |first2=Dustin |title=Latin America and the United States: A Documentary History |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-538568-7 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OhC9DgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT419#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rock en español]] became popular with the younger generation of Latinos in Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Cordelia Candelaria |last1=Candelaria |first1=Cordelia|editor1-last=Candelaria|editor1-first=Cordelia|editor2-last=García|editor2-first=Peter J.|editor3-last=Aldama|editor3-first=Arturo J. |title=Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture in the United States |volume=2 |date=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |isbn=978-0-313-32215-0 |page=690 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uD6PKXl3q4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA690#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably including Argentine bands such as [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olsen |first1=Dale |last2=Sheehy |first2=Daniel E. |title=The Garland handbook of Latin American music |date=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-96101-1 |page=458 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RK6TAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA458#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican-American [[Latin rock]] guitarist [[Carlos Santana]] began his decades of popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/carlos-santana-mn0000175196/biography |title=Carlos Santana: Biography |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |year=2003 |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salsa music]] became the dominant genre of tropical music in the 1970s.

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s, the [[Latin ballad]] continued to be the main form of Latin pop music, with [[Juan Gabriel]], [[José José]], Julio Iglesias, [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], and [[José Luis Rodríguez (singer)|José Luis Rodríguez]] dominating the charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rg8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=jose+jose+el+principe+de+la+cancion#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Prince's 40-Year Reign: A Billboard Q&amp;A |last=Cobo |first=Leila |volume=115 |issue=48 |page=28 |date=November 29, 2003 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salsa music]] lost some traction, and its musical style changed to a slower rhythm with more emphasis on romantic lyrics.

=== 1990s ===
[[Bolero]] music saw a resurgence of popularity with the younger audience. Mexican singer [[Luis Miguel]] was credited for the renewed interest due to the success of his album, ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]'' (1991), a collection of classics covered by the artist.&lt;ref name="ageless"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ageless+romance+with+bolero.-a017482173 |title=Ageless Romance with Bolero |last=Holston |first=Mark |journal=Américas |date=September 1, 1995 |accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s, [[Latin pop]] music was dominated by younger artists such as [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]] alumnus [[Ricky Martin]], Colombian teen [[Shakira]], and Julio's son [[Enrique Iglesias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=John |title=Encyclopedia of North American immigration |date=2005 |publisher=Facts On File |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4381-1012-7 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, artists from Italy such as [[Eros Ramazzotti]], [[Laura Pausini]], and [[Nek]] successfully [[crossover (music)|crossed over]] to the Latin music field by recording Spanish-language versions of their songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Obejas |first1=Achy |authorlink1=Achy Obejas |title=Italian Artists Conquer Latin Music Charts |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-04-04/news/9904040139_1_latin-music-eros-ramazzotti-italian |accessdate=January 4, 2015 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=April 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Regional Mexican]] field, [[Tejano music|Tejano]] became the most prominent genre. [[Selena]] helped push Tejano music into the mainstream market with her albums ''[[Entre a Mi Mundo]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994), although the genre's popularity declined following [[Murder of Selena|her death]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saldana |first1=Hector |title=Tejano music enjoyed a decade-long golden age |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Tejano-music-enjoyed-a-decade-long-golden-age-6447952.php |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[tropical music]] field, [[merengue music|merengue]], which gained attention in the 1980s, rivaled [[salsa music|salsa]] in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Nelson |title=A look at contemporary Merengue.

=== 2000s ===
In the mid-2000s, [[reggaeton]] became popular in the mainstream market, with [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Don Omar]], and [[Wisin &amp; Yandel]] considered to be the frontiers of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Resto-Montero |first1=Gabriela |title=The Unstoppable Rise of Reggaeton |url=http://fusion.kinja.com/the-unstoppable-rise-of-reggaeton-1793854249 |website=Fusion |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |date=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tropical music scene, [[bachata (music)|bachata]] music became popular in the field, with artists such as [[Monchy &amp; Alexandra]] and [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]] finding success in the urban areas of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cobo |first1=Leila |title=Tropical Paradise |journal=Billboard |date=August 15, 2009 |volume=121 |issue=32 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHcbf1oaC8UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banda (music)|Banda]] was the dominant genre in the Regional Mexican music field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Henderson |first1=Alex |title=Me Cambiaste la Vida – Rogelio Martinez |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/me-cambiaste-la-vida-mw0000474613 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
By the turn of the decade, the Latin music field became dominated by up-tempo rhythms, including electropop, reggaeton, urban, banda and contemporary bachata music, as Latin ballads and crooners fell out of favor among U.S. Latin radio programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cobo |first1=Leila |authorlink1=Leila Cobo |title=Latin Noise: We Want Our Ballads |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin-notas/6244251/latin-music-we-want-our-ballads |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |date=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Streaming media|Streaming]] has become the dominant form of revenue in the Latin music industry in the United States, Latin America and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Melendez |first1=Angel |title=Why Are Spanish Songs More Popular on YouTube?

'''Latino theatre in the United States'''

== History and the assimilation of the Latino / Hispanic culture into America ==
Latinos and Hispanics immigrating to North America faced many struggles with the immigration process as well as with learning how to adapt and, in many ways, assimilate into the modern, mainstream culture developing in North America. Puerto Rico, one of the largest Latino groups of the time, was annexed in 1898 following the Spanish–American War. Puerto Rico shortly thereafter became known as Porto Rico and English became the official language that was taught and learned by the people of Porto Rico (Puerto Rico). The previously all Catholic Puerto Rico began to become pervaded by the Protestant religion. Puerto Ricans officially became U.S. citizens in 1917, however, Puerto Ricans as well as the other Latino groups had a difficult time assimilating within the U.S. cultures and ideals. Often Latinos would question who they really were as they had the challenge of adopting certain U.S. ideals yet had to keep their culture, heritage, and traditions still alive within their lives. Through their assimilation into America, many Latinos began to speak a new language in a sense called Spanglish. It was a mixture of Spanish and English. This immigration and assimilation and the use of their own version of their language in America began to translate into the written work of Latino theatre. One of the first mainstream plays that was written about the Latino culture and immigration experience in America was ''The Oxcart'' by René Marqués. This play discussed the Puerto Ricans sense of belonging in America, and their adaptation and immigration/assimilation into America.
"In reviewing all that has happened in Latina/o theater in the last thirty-plus years, it is clear that we have come a long way. However, we have all heard the old adage, "You can't know where you're going if you don't know where you've been." As a theater historian I am interested in our history as Latina/o theater artists; as a theater director, I am concerned with the aesthetic evolution of our cultural work and workers. But you cannot analyze or write about Latina/o theater without also sounding like a sociologist, a political scientist, an ethnographer, etc., because these are all vital discourses in the understanding of our cultures as Latinas and Latinos. I propose here an overview of the theaters of the three major Latina/o groups, the Chicanas/os, Cuban-Americans and Puerto Ricans, focusing on their theatrical evolutions."&lt;ref&gt;Huerta, Jorge. "From the margins to the mainstream: Latino/a theater in the U.S." Studies in Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Literature 32.2 (2008): 463+. Literature Resource Center. Web. 13 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Each of these groups experienced historic moments when their relationships to Spain or Mexico and to the United States were altered forever. For the ancestors of the Chicanos, 1848 marks the year they actually became citizens of the territories which would eventually become a part of the United States, creating what some political scientists have called a sense of "internal colonization."1 Ironically, 1898 is the year both the Cubans and Puerto Ricans were freed from Spanish domination only to find themselves in a quasi-colonial condition with the United States. As inhabitants of a commonwealth, the island Puerto Ricans suffer a colonial destiny which, some say, extends to Puerto Ricans on the mainland, creating what Fredric Jameson has termed an "internal Third World Voice." Jameson writes: "... in the United States itself we have come to think and to speak of the emergence of internal Third World voices, as in black women's literature and Chicano literature...." thus aligning the Chicanos with the Puerto Ricans (49). The Cubans' connections to the United States ended in 1959, while the Puerto Ricans continue to live under a commonwealth status. Separation by water pervades the consciousness of both the Cuban and Puerto Rican writers, while a more metaphoric water, a river, sometimes separates the Chicanos from Mexico. History has shown that both the water that separates the three groups from home, and the fences, that are constructed along the U.S.-Mexico border are permeable, encouraging negotiations, tensions and crossings rife with drama."

== Representation ==
Oftentimes in the representation of Latinos and/or Hispanics in theatre, stereotypes have played a large role in the representation of the characters and of the culture as a whole. Oftentimes Latinos have been portrayed as being violent, rivalrous, exotic, and not wanting to adapt. Many believe this representation to be true in the musical, "[[West Side Story]]."  Many consider this to be a great example of Puerto Rican stereotypes and much future discussion on representation of Puerto Ricans and other Latinos would stem from this musical. Some believe that the underlying message portrayed was that of a dangerous Latino culture that was exotic and needed to be controlled or reined in. Many would also argue that "West Side Story" furthered the ability for Latinos to be involved and be the subject writing in theatre. Even though the musical was not told in the perspective from a true Puerto Rican immigrant, it opened many doors for future shows to involve Latino playwrights, actors, etc.

== Playwrights and plays ==
* Paul Simon (The Capeman musical)
* Jose Rivera (Marisol)
* Reinaldo Arenas René Ariza, María Julia Casanova,  Susana Cook, José Corrales, Nilo Cruz, María Irene Fornés, Anne García-Romero, Carlos Lacámara, Manuel Martín, Jr., Jesús Papoleto Meléndez, Cherríe Moraga, Manuel Pereiras García, Dolores Prida, María Ruiz de Burton, Luis Santeiro, Héctor Santiago, Caridad Svich, Luis Valdez.

=== Milestone plays involving Latino playwrights and/or Latino actors ===
* ''The Oxcart''
* ''West Side Story''
* ''The Capeman''
* ''Marisol''
* ''In the Heights''
* ''Hamilton''

=== Modern examples of Latino theatre ===
Writer/director/actor [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] is known most recently for his work on ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]''. However, before ''Hamilton'' he wrote a successful musical called ''[[In the Heights]]'', which brought up themes and ideas of being Latino and living in America, more specifically New York. Miranda has been known to further the "traditional" approaches to casting and has often selected a diverse cast to help tell his stories in new and exciting perspectives from a multitude of different cultures and backgrounds.

== Casting issues ==
Latinos have often found it difficult to get cast in roles that have not been specifically written to be played by a Latino. Many casting directors have begun to use the term "color blind" casting, however this has caused much controversy in itself as if a show is cast improperly with certain races in certain roles, it can come across to the audiences as well as the theatre community as wrong and/or racist. What is much preferred now by actors is a statement that suggests that there will be no discrimination in the casting process. Even still, there have even been times when films, TV shows, and plays have been written for Latino actors, and yet they have ended up being played by non-Latino actors. An example of this is TheaterWorks' production of "The Motherf**ker With the Hat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/theaterworks-the-motherfker-with-the-hat-raises-casting-questions/|title=TheaterWorks' 'The Motherf**ker With the Hat' Raises Casting Questions|author=|date=18 January 2012|website=backstage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are '''lists of the highest-grossing domestic and international films in Indonesia''' with gross revenue in [[Indonesian Rupiah]] and the number of tickets sold nationwide.

==Domestic films by admissions==
This is listed by the tickets sold nationwide, '''as of November 30, 2018''' according to the Filmindonesia.or.id.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmindonesia.or.id/movie/viewer/2007-2018|title=Filmindonesia.or.id|publisher=Filmindonesia.or.id|accessdate=2018-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121213958/http://filmindonesia.or.id/movie/viewer/2007-2018#|archive-date=January 21, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, information on Filmindonesia.or.id was accrued since 2007, making some films that release before 2007 was not included or not accurated in number of admissions. Number of admissions for films that release before 2007 was collected from trusted articles or news.
&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE. '''''FOR ALL MOVIE &gt;= 1.000.000 ADMISSIONS ONLY'''''. --&gt;

== Approaches to literary space ==

=== The past approach ===
Space in the 20th century was regarded as a part of various literary spheres, such as the narrative situation. It changed only in the last decade of the period. Since then literary space has been treated as an independent and unique entity, semantic centre of the work, while such notions as the time of action or characters became its particularizations.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 195-97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The modern approaches ===
==== Yuri Lotman ====

The first person to approach the issue of literary space from the semiotic point of view was [[Yuri Lotman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture|last=Lotman|first=Yuri|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Bloomington:|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lotman, artistic space is only a model of real space, not its copy. He argued that the information provided by the text about space is incomplete and, consequently, space also is not complete. Being discontinued (what is not mentioned in the text does not exist), space cannot be reconstructed by the implied reader (Lotman 1977, &lt;nowiki&gt;''Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, p.213).

What is more, Lotman broached in his literary studies the question of the relationship between space in the text and space of the real world. He claimed both space organisations are governed by cultural stereotypes and conventions, which serve as kind of a &lt;nowiki&gt;'mediator' between them. However, while additional senses are imposed on textual space by cultural codes, extratextual space uses the reworked ones. Through textual hints (described customs, clothing, etc.) literary space can refer to more general knowledge of the implied reader of the empirical reality. The aim of this measure is to make possible the association of the fictional world with the experiential one not calling it as if ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;by name”.&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola.” ''Semiotyka kultury''. Eds. E .Janus and M. R. Mayenowa. Warszawa: PIW. pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilizing extratextual patterns, the author of a literary work creates their own vision of the world and they do it through the use of description. Limited just like description&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola.” ''Semiotyka kultury''. Eds. E .Janus and M. R. Mayenowa. Warszawa: PIW. pp. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;, such an authorial model does not exist beyond the textual frames and is composed of relations resulting from senses imposed on space. Those, in turn, may suggest non-spatial meanings (e.g. ''up'' is better, ''down'' is worse as in the case of a social hierarchy of [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'' and the Morlocks and the Eloi):&lt;blockquote&gt;''Literary space represents an author's model of the world, expressed in the language of spatial representation. In a literary work, space models different relations of the world-picture: temporary, social, ethical and others. […] in the literary models of the world―space sometimes metaphorically adopts meanings of relations in the modelled world-structure, that are themselves not spatial at all.''&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). ''The Structure of the Artistic Text.'' pp.&amp;nbsp;218''.'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Janusz Sławiński ====

[[:pl:Janusz_Sławiński_(filolog)|Janusz Sławiński]] considered the presented reality to be the most fundamental code modelling space, understood as the principles organising the thematic-compositional plane of a single literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This reality is the construction of words, the result of all the linguistic as well as stylistic choices which are made by the implied author, and as such, does not exist beyond the text. It is vital not only to imagine space but also to follow the narration, the description, and the course of action, since all those may shape the fictitious reality by imposing the additional meanings on it.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary/cultural conventions constitute the second space-modelling code. This system is more abstract one than the previous one. It does not refer to how an individual work shapes space but how it is conventionally done by a given epoch, genre, etc. So, for instance, one of the main features of Gothic novels are elements of the supernatural and the sublime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/gothic-literature/supernatural-sublime-characteristic.html|title=The Supernatural and the Sublime|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, therefore, texts are full of ghosts, vampires and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language is the last of codes shaping space. Every language models space in a different manner. The language of geography, for example, differentiates [[Cardinal direction|cardinal and intercardinal directions]], among others, west or north-east, while geometry uses [[Relative direction|relative directions]], for instance, left/right/backward(s)/forward(s). In short, it can be said that language organises space in a way, defines it, and provides terms for various types of spatial arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 200-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Sławiński put an emphasis on description, scenery and superimposed senses, three interrelated planes influencing space (Sławiński 2000, p. 205)

The descriptive plane is the aspect of narration and consists of words. It is especially crucial to space when it is introduced to the implied reader. The spatial relationship would be impossible to define without description. It describes space directly or implies it, developing together with characters' movements.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; This 'development' makes the description a dynamic notion in a sense that it creates meanings. Certain elements of the description relate to each other not only on the grammatical but also semantic level. For example, there are relations between words and phrases. Added-on meanings imposed on particular fragments of a text are, for instance, the consequence of such relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 207-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to description, scenery is considered to be a static entity as it results from description. Description producing scenery may consist of a single block of text or scenery can be the effect of numerous descriptive references in such a text put together.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superimposed senses are the last plane. They are a structure caring added-on meanings. They are not conditioned in any way and are type of a subcode which shapes non-spatial relationships and values (Sławiński 2000, p. 212).

==== Mieczysław Porębski ====

According to [[:pl:Mieczysław_Porębski|Mieczysław Porębski]] space can be divided into three types, namely, extratextual, intertextual and intratextual.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The first is where works of art are stored. It is physical, 3-dimensional and, therefore, can be ''experienced'' by readers (e.g. libraries). The second type is space only in a metaphorical sense, a set of conventions, of common fields of references for a certain piece of writing. It may refer either to other texts or literary traditions (just like [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Hobbit'' by the appearance of dwarves alludes to, for instance, fairy tales), or both, and as such, intertextual space is an abstract notion. The last space differentiated by Porębski is, intratextual space, is what can be called 'an intentional space' since it is implied&lt;ref&gt;Ingarden, Roman''. The Literary Work of Art.''&lt;/ref&gt; and, provoked by the text itself, exists only in the implied reader's imagination.

Porębski derived three subspaces from the intratextual space: physical, symbolical and mathematical ones.&lt;ref&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;The physical space is considered to be an intricate structure, not ordered. What is more, it is 3-dimensional to characters and infinite (lines of length, etc. can be prolonged as much as one wishes them to). The symbolical type of space&lt;ref&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; is the way in which culture arranges it. It is the most primary type of spatial organisation, and it is so crucial due to its metaphysical and eschatological dimension but only when some additional meanings are endows otherwise semantically neutral space. The mathematical type of space can be divided further into topological and geometrical spaces. The former shows how space is perceived in both cultural and mythological way, having much in common with a symbolical space, the latter uses map features, e.g. distances, symmetries, proportions, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11959">'''Media management''' is seen as a business administration discipline that identifies and describes strategic and operational phenomena and problems in the leadership of [[Mass media|media]] enterprises. Media management contains the functions strategic management, procurement management, production management, organizational management and marketing of media enterprises. 

A uniform definition of the term media [[management]] does not yet exist, and "the field of media management in its present form is neither clearly defined nor cohesive."&lt;ref name="Ng"&gt;Küng (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Notwithstanding this fact, among existing definitions there is a shared base concerning the business administrative character of media management and the functional understanding of management. In the following a number of definitions are provided.

"Media Management consists of (1) the ability to supervise and motivate employees and (2) the ability to operate facilities and resources in a cost-effective (profitable) manner."&lt;ref&gt;Sherman (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

"The core task of media management is to build a bridge between the general theoretical disciplines of management and the specifities of the media industry."&lt;ref name="Ng" /&gt;

"Media and internet management covers all the goal-oriented activities of planning, organization and control within the framework of the creation and distribution processes for information or entertainment content in media enterprises."&lt;ref&gt;Wirtz (2011a)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media enterprises and media markets ==
Media enterprises are strategically organized economic entities whose central work is generating and [[marketing]] of media. The generation of media is the bundling of internally and externally generated content and its transformation into a medium. The marketing is the direct or indirect distribution of media. The term media in this connection is restricted to one-to-many-communication with one sender and a large number of consumers. More precisely, the focus is on [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[books]], [[music]], [[television]], [[films]], [[internet]] and [[games]]. More details can be drawn from the graphic illustrating the definition of media enterprises. [[File:Definition of media enterprises.jpg|thumb|Image shows the definition of media companies.]]

In order to understand management in media enterprises it is crucial to build a larger picture of the media marketplace. The characteristics of media markets differ from markets of other economic sectors in several ways.

One characteristic of media markets is the multidimensional competition. Media enterprises operate in three different markets. They sell their services in form of content like information and entertainment, as well as in form of [[advertising]] space. These services are offered for different business markets. The content is offered to the consumer markets which differ depending of the type of media and the way it is used by consumers. The advertising spaces are traded on advertisement markets.

The third markets are [[procurement]] markets. They are needed as media enterprises generally do not produce all their offered content themselves but buy service packages of both, information and entertainment, from procurement markets.  For example, authors and artists contracts or license and copyright deals can be acquired. But procurement markets can turn to business markets if, for example, complete rights to an event are purchased and then resold by a media enterprise in the form of secondary utilization rights. The described market structure is shown in the second image.
[[File:Media markets.jpg|thumb|Image gives an overview of different media markets.]]

In fact, the three described media markets each media enterprise can be active in are strongly interdependent. But the intensity of their relationships differs. For example, there is a strong relationship between advertisement and consumer markets as the success among consumers drives advertising revenues. All possible inter-dependencies are pictured in the third graphic.
[[File:Interdependence in media markets.jpg|thumb|Image describes the inter-dependencies in media markets]]

Furthermore, there are geographic [[media market]]s. Media enterprises operate in specific geographic markets. Some firms operate in a national market while other companies, for example, local radio stations operate in a regional area. So the marketplace of a media enterprise consists of the product media markets (consumer market, advertisement market and procurement market) and the geographic media market.

== Value chain and core competencies ==
The [[value chain]] analysis by [[Michael Porter]]&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2004), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
can be adapted for the analysis of value creation in media enterprises. Although the media sector is very heterogeneous and has different branch-specific features, the presented [[value chain]] of the media industry form the basic principles.
[[File:Value chain of the media industry.jpg|thumb|Image describing the value chain of the media industry.]]

As for business companies in general, for media enterprises their core assets and [[core competencies]] are decisive for the long-term success. Core competencies considerably contribute to the perceived customer benefit of a product and ensure the competitive advantage of an enterprise. Competencies which are crucial to successful media management can be classified as technical skills, human skills, conceptual skills, financial skills and marketing skills.&lt;ref&gt;Albarran (2010), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Core competencies of media enterprises are, for example, an exceptional editorial ability or cross-media marketing competence.  There are six subgroups of core competencies of media enterprises: content-sourcing competence, content-creation competence, product development competence, promotion competence, cross-media utilization competence and technology competence.

The content-sourcing competence means acquisition of high-quality information and/or entertainment content for content production. Especially the production of exclusive content leads to unique [[competitive advantage]]. Content-creation competence is one of the most important core competences in most media enterprises. Media enterprises with content-creation competences are, for example, especially good at realizing social trends and implementing them into their media products, making them highly attractive for the customers. The product development competence is the qualification for a product portfolio with a steady flow of revenues.In order to achieve this, media enterprises have to be able to develop promising media products and to assess their marketability. The [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] competence is specifically relevant for media products belonging to the film, book or music categories as these are individual products. Here a different promotion strategy than promotion of brand identity is needed. Achieving public attention and thus a better market position for media products constitutes the promotion competence.  Media enterprises with cross-media utilization competences can provide content to the recipients in a timely manner, in the desired amount and via the right channel. Finally the technology competence refers to the employment of modern information and communication technology for the creation and marketing of content.
Core competences form the foundation for the strategy formation process in media enterprises. For their future success, the media enterprises have to analyze the current competence basis and compare them with the required, strategically important, core competences derived from an external market analysis. There is a range of different influences on the media management decisions and actions that have to be included in the external market analysis. The influences are "the licensee, competing media, the government, the labor force, the labor unions, the public, and advertisers, economic activity, the industry, social factor and technology."&lt;ref&gt;Pringle and Starr (2006), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; In case some strategically important [[core competencies]] are not yet acquired by the media enterprise, they have to be developed.

== Business models ==
The concept of the [[business model]] is not used uniformly in the literature. Compared to the concept of the [[value chain]], it is not limited to a physical production process. It also includes service processes. According to Timmers, "a business model is defined as the organization (or architecture) of product, service and information flows, and the sources of revenues and benefits for suppliers and customers."&lt;ref&gt;Timmers (2001), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wirtz, "a business model is a simplified and aggregated representation of the relevant activities of a company. It describes how marketable information, products and/or services are generated by means of a company's value-added component. In addition to the architecture of value creation, strategic as well as customer and market components are considered in order to realize the overriding objective of generating and preserving a competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;Wirtz (2011b), p.65&lt;/ref&gt; The business model as an integrated management tool consists of further partial models: the revenue model, the consumer model, the procurement model, the production of goods and services model, the service offer model and the distribution model. Because a [[business model]] can strongly vary depending on the type of business, it can best be described using a sample. In the following the business model of a book [[publishing house]] is presented.
Book publishers are companies that have two components to consider: profit-orientation and a cultural dimension. They usually publish titles which are produced by external authors. The sales of books in the receiver markets are the main part of the revenue model of a book publisher. Other revenues can be generated in the rights and licensing markets. Further sources for revenues are utilization rights generating revenue outside of the printing sector. For example, successful manuscripts are used for film, television, magazines and merchandising.
[[File:Business model of a book publishing house.jpg|thumb|Image describing an example business model of a book publishing house.]]
For book publishers, production and distribution are the main focuses of the economic activity. Here the cost structure of manufacturing is of high importance. The amount of first copy costs in relation to total revenue is around 41%. [[Marketing]] costs are about 12% and administrative costs average 14%, with a profit margin of approximately 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Wirtz (2011b), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;
The final product is delivered through existing distribution channels. With the rise of the internet, new distribution channels with direct delivery to book consumers have been developed. The business model of a book publishing house is shown in the graphic.

{{For|the song|Method Acting (song)}}
[[File:Marlon Brando in 'Streetcar named Desire' trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marlon Brando]]'s performance in [[Elia Kazan]]'s film of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' exemplified the power of Stanislavski-based acting in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Blum (1984, 63) and Hayward (1996, 216).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Method acting''' is a range of training and rehearsal techniques that seek to encourage sincere and emotionally expressive performances, as formulated by a number of different [[theatre practitioner]]s, principally in the United States, where it is among the most popular—and controversial—approaches to acting.&lt;ref name=krasner129&gt;Krasner (2000b, 129).&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are built on [[Stanislavski's system]], developed by the Russian actor and director [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and captured in his books ''[[An Actor Prepares]]'', ''[[Building a Character]]'', and ''[[Creating a Role]]''.&lt;ref name=krasner130 /&gt; 

Among those who have contributed to the development of the Method, three teachers are associated with "having set the standard of its success", each emphasizing different aspects of the approach: [[Lee Strasberg]] (the psychological aspects), [[Stella Adler]] (the sociological aspects), and [[Sanford Meisner]] (the behavioral aspects).&lt;ref name=krasner129 /&gt; The approach was first developed when they worked together at the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in New York.&lt;ref name=krasner130&gt;Krasner (2000b, 130).&lt;/ref&gt; All three subsequently claimed to be the rightful heirs of Stanislavski's approach.

== From the "system" to the Method ==
{{Main|Stanislavski's system}}
"The Method" is an elaboration of the "system" of acting developed by the Russian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. In the first three decades of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]], Stanislavski organized his training, preparation, and rehearsal techniques into a coherent, [[system]]atic methodology. The "system" brought together and built on: (1) the director-centred, [[Gesamtkunstwerk|unified aesthetic]] and disciplined, [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] approach of the [[Meiningen Ensemble|Meiningen company]]; (2) the actor-centred [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of the [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly]]; (3) and the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] staging of [[André Antoine (actor)|Antoine]] and the independent theatre movement.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1989, 5–11, 15, 18) and (1999b, 254), Braun (1982, 59), Carnicke (2000, 13, 16, 29), Counsell (1996, 24), Gordon (2006, 38, 40–41), and Innes (2000, 53–54).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diagram of Stanislavski's 'system'.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram of [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski's "system"]], based on his "Plan of Experiencing" (1935).]]
The "system" cultivates what Stanislavski calls the "art of experiencing" (to which he contrasts the "[[art of representation]]").&lt;ref name=rep&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 201), Carnicke (2000, 17), and Stanislavski (1938, 16–36). Stanislavski's "[[art of representation]]" corresponds to [[Mikhail Shchepkin]]'s "actor of reason" and his "art of experiencing" corresponds to Shchepkin's "actor of feeling"; see Benedetti (1999a, 202).&lt;/ref&gt; It mobilises the actor's [[Consciousness|conscious]] thought and [[Will (philosophy)|will]] in order to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes—such as emotional experience and [[subconscious]] behaviour—sympathetically and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; In rehearsal, the actor searches for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the character seeks to achieve at any given moment (a "task").&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 182–183).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Stanislavski further elaborated the "system" with a more physically grounded rehearsal process known as the "[[Method of Physical Action]]".&lt;ref name=MOPA&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 325, 360) and (2005, 121) and Roach (1985, 197–198, 205, 211–215). The term "[[Method of Physical Action]]" was applied to this rehearsal process after Stanislavski's death. Benedetti indicates that though Stanislavski had developed it since 1916, he first explored it practically in the early 1930s; see (1998, 104) and (1999a, 356, 358). Gordon argues the shift in working-method happened during the 1920s (2006, 49–55). Vasili Toporkov, an actor who trained under Stanislavski in this approach, provides in his ''Stanislavski in Rehearsal'' (2004) a detailed account of the Method of Physical Action at work in Stanislavski's rehearsals.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimising at-the-table discussions, he now encouraged an "active analysis", in which the sequence of dramatic situations are [[Improvisation|improvised]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 355–256), Carnicke (2000, 32–33), Leach (2004, 29), Magarshack (1950, 373–375), and Whyman (2008, 242).&lt;/ref&gt; "The best analysis of a play", Stanislavski argued, "is to take action in the given circumstances."&lt;ref name=ANALYSIS&gt;Quoted by Carnicke (1998, 156). Stanislavski continues: "For in the process of action the actor gradually obtains the mastery over the inner incentives of the actions of the character he is representing, evoking in himself the emotions and thoughts which resulted in those actions. In such a case, an actor not only understands his part, but also feels it, and that is the most important thing in creative work on the stage"; quoted by Magarshack (1950, 375).&lt;/ref&gt;

The transmission of the earliest phase of Stanislavski's work via the students of the First Studio of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] (MAT) revolutionized acting in the [[Western culture|West]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnicke (1998, 1, 167) and (2000, 14), Counsell (1996, 24–25), Golub (1998, 1032), Gordon (2006, 71–72), Leach (2004, 29), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; When the MAT toured the US in the early 1920s, the young [[Lee Strasberg]] saw all of their productions and was deeply impressed by their [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 286) and Blum (1984, 22). Strasberg was 22 at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[Richard Boleslavsky]], one of Stanislavski's students from the First Studio, presented a series of lectures on the "system" that were eventually published as ''Acting: The First Six Lessons'' (1933).&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Boleslavsky|Boleslavsky]] had been able to extend his visa thanks to an invitation from Stanislavski to act as an assistant director to the company.&lt;/ref&gt; The interest generated led to a decision by Boleslavsky and [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] (another student at the First Studio) to emigrate to the US and to establish the [[American Laboratory Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 283, 286) and Gordon (2006, 71–72).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The version of Stanislavski's practice that travelled to the US with them was that developed in the 1910s, rather than the more fully elaborated version of the "system" detailed in Stanislavski's acting manuals from the 1930s, ''An Actor's Work'' and ''An Actor's Work on a Role''. The first half of ''An Actor's Work'', which treated the psychological elements of training, was published in a heavily abridged and misleadingly translated version in the US as ''[[An Actor Prepares]]'' in 1936. English-language readers often confused the first volume on psychological processes with the "system" as a whole.&lt;ref name=b332&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 332).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the American practitioners who came to be identified with the Method were taught by Boleslavsky and Ouspenskaya at the American Laboratory Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Krasner (2000b, 129–130).&lt;/ref&gt; The approaches to acting subsequently developed by their students—including Lee Strasberg, [[Stella Adler]], and [[Sanford Meisner]]—are often confused with Stanislavski's "system". Strasberg's adaptation relied exclusively on psychological techniques and contrasted sharply with Stanislavski's multivariate, holistic and [[Psychophysiology|psychophysical]] approach, which explores character and action both from the "inside out" and the "outside in".&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005, 147–148) and Carnicke (1998, 1, 8). Not only actors are subject to this confusion; [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[obituary]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' credited Stanislavski with the invention of the Method: "Mr. Strasberg adapted it to the American theatre, imposing his refinements, but always crediting Stanislavsky as his source" (Quoted by Carnicke 1998, 9); see Gussow (1982). Carnicke argues that this "robs Strasberg of the originality in his thinking, while simultaneously obscuring Stanislavsky's ideas" (1997, 9). In a note from 1913 Stanislavski wrote that a character "is sometimes formed psychologically, i.e. from the inner image of the role, but at other times it is discovered through purely external exploration"; quoted by Benedetti (1999a, 216). Neither the tradition that formed in the USSR nor the American Method, Carnicke argues, "integrated the mind and body of the actor, the corporal and the spiritual, the text and the performance as thoroughly or as insistently as did Stanislavsky himself" (1998, 2). For evidence of Strasberg's misunderstanding of this aspect of Stanislavski's work, see Strasberg (2010, 150—151).&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as Stanislavski's early work, the ideas and techniques of his student [[Yevgeny Vakhtangov]] (who had died in 1922 at the age of 39) were also an important influence on the development of the Method. Vakhtangov's "object exercises" were developed further by [[Uta Hagen]] as a means for actor training and the maintenance of skills. Strasberg attributed to Vakhtangov the distinction between Stanislavski's process of "justifying" behaviour with the inner motive forces that prompt that behaviour in the character and "motivating" behaviour with imagined or recalled experiences relating to the actor and substituted for those relating to the character. Following this distinction, actors ask themselves "What would motivate me, the actor, to behave in the way the character does?" rather than the more Stanislavskian question "Given the particular circumstances of the play, how would I behave, what would I do, how would I feel, how would I react?"&lt;ref&gt;Carnicke (2009, 221).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotion and imagination ==
Among the concepts and techniques of method acting are [[substitution (theatre)|substitution]], "as if", sense memory, [[affective memory]], and animal work (all of which were first developed by Stanislavski). Contemporary method actors sometimes seek help from psychologists in the development of their roles.&lt;ref&gt;Kase (2011, 125) and Hull (1985, 10).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Strasberg's approach, actors make use of experiences from their own lives to bring them closer to the experience of their characters. This technique, which Stanislavski came to call emotion memory (Strasberg tends to use the alternative formulation, "affective memory"), involves the recall of sensations involved in experiences that made a significant emotional impact on the actor. Without faking or forcing, actors allow those sensations to stimulate a response and try not to inhibit themselves.

Every afternoon for five weeks during the summer of 1934 in [[Paris]], Stanislavski worked with the American actress [[Stella Adler]], who had sought his assistance with the blocks she had confronted in her performances.&lt;ref name="Benedetti 2006"&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 351) and Gordon (2006, 74).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the emphasis that emotion memory had received in [[New York City|New York]], Adler was surprised to find that Stanislavski rejected the technique except as a last resort.&lt;ref name="Benedetti 2006" /&gt; Under the influence of [[Richard Boleslavsky]], emotion memory had become a central feature of Strasberg's training at the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre in New York]]. In contrast, Stanislavski recommended to Stella Adler an indirect pathway to emotional expression via physical action.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 351–352).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biography of Stanislavski, Jean Benedetti writes: "It has been suggested that Stanislavski deliberately played down the emotional aspects of acting because the woman in front of him was already over-emotional. The evidence is against this. What Stanislavski told Stella Adler was exactly what he had been telling his actors at home, what indeed he had advocated in his notes for [[Leonid Leonidov|Leonidov]] in the production plan for ''[[Othello]]''." Stanislavski confirmed this emphasis in his discussions with [[Harold Clurman]] in late 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 351–352).&lt;/ref&gt; The news that this was Stanislavski's approach would have significant repercussions in the US; Strasberg angrily rejected it and refused to modify his approach.&lt;ref name="Benedetti 2006" /&gt;

In training, as distinct from rehearsal process, the recall of sensations to provoke emotional experience and the development of a vividly imagined fictional experience remained a central part both of Stanislavski's and the various Method-based approaches that developed out of it.

A widespread misconception about method acting—particularly in the popular media—equates method actors with actors who choose to remain in character even offstage or off-camera for the duration of a project.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In his book ''A Dream of Passion'', Strasberg wrote that Stanislavski, early in his directing career, "require[d] his actors to live 'in character' off stage", but that "the results were never fully satisfactory".&lt;ref&gt;Strasberg (1988, 44).&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislavski did experiment with this approach in his own acting before he became a professional actor and founded the [[Moscow Art Theatre]],  though he soon abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 18–19) and Magarshack (1950, 25, 33–34). He would disguise himself as a [[tramp]] or drunk and visit the railway station, or as a fortune-telling [[Romani people|gypsy]]. As Benedetti explains, however, Stanislavski soon abandoned the technique of maintaining a characterisation in real life; it does not form a part of his "system".&lt;/ref&gt; Some method actors employ this technique, such as [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], but Strasberg did not include it as part of his teachings and it "is not part of the Method approach".&lt;ref&gt;Skog (2010, 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strasberg's students included many prominent American actors of the latter half of the 20th century, including [[Paul Newman]], [[Al Pacino]], [[George Peppard]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[James Dean]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Mickey Rourke]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Strasberg's approach ==
Some American acting teachers inspired by Stanislavski broke off with Strasberg, believing his method was not an authentic adaptation of Stanislavski's system.

[[Sanford Meisner]], another Group Theatre pioneer, believed the method was far too focused on the internal workings of the actor, and that acting should be "outside in" rather than "inside out". His ideas came to be called the [[Meisner technique]]. He advocated actors fully immersing themselves "in the moment" and concentrating on their partner (what Stanislavski called "communication" and "adaptation"). Meisner taught actors to achieve spontaneity by understanding the [[given circumstances]] of the scene. He designed interpersonal exercises to help actors invest emotionally in the scene, freeing them to react "honestly" as the character. Meisner described acting as "living truthfully under imaginary circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;Meisner (1987, 15, 136).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]] also broke with Strasberg. In his books ''Method—or Madness?'' and the more autobiographical ''Slings and Arrows'', Lewis argued that method acting was too focused on pure emotional training and neglected vocal and physical training, which forms a fundamental part both of classical actor-training and of [[Stanislavski's system]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2003, 193).&lt;/ref&gt; The method's reliance on emotion, he felt, could too easily encourage overacting.

[[Stella Adler]], an actress and acting teacher whose students included [[Marlon Brando]], [[Warren Beatty]], and [[Robert De Niro]], also broke with Strasberg after she studied with Stanislavski, by which time he had modified many of his earliest ideas. Her version of the method is based on the idea that actors should stimulate emotional experience by imagining the scene's "given circumstances", rather than recalling experiences from their own lives. Adler's approach also seeks to stimulate the actor's imagination through the use of "as ifs", which substitute more personally affecting imagined situations for the circumstances experienced by the character. Adler argued that "drawing on personal experience alone was too limited.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Brando himself claimed he never studied with Strasberg and never liked him for being so selfish and ambitious. Brando was a student of Stella Adler's, and in his book, he claimed to have abhorred Lee Strasberg's teachings and praised Adler for her work.

The charge that Strasberg's method distorted Stanislavski's system has been responsible for a considerable revivalist interest in Stanislavski's "pure" teachings. As the use of the Method has declined considerably from its peak in the mid-20th century, acting teachers claiming to teach Stanislavski's unadulterated system are becoming more numerous.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] described his work with [[Montgomery Clift]] in ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' as difficult "because you know, he was a method actor". He recalled similar problems with Paul Newman in ''[[Torn Curtain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson (2015, 135).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lillian Gish]] quipped: "It's ridiculous. How would you portray death if you had to experience it first?"&lt;ref&gt;Flom (2009, 241).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Laughton]], who worked closely for a time with [[Bertolt Brecht]], argued that "Method actors give you a photograph",  while "real actors give you an oil painting."&lt;ref&gt;French (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jason Robards]] was another critic of Method techniques, in general. "I don't want actors reasoning with me about 'motivation,'” he is reported to have said, suggesting instead that actors should simply “learn [their] lines and [not] bump into each other.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/jason-robards-dead-oscar-winning-actor-star-stage-screen-article-1.887636|title=JASON ROBARDS DEAD Oscar-winning actor star of stage, screen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming of ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (1976), [[Laurence Olivier]], who had lost patience with method acting two decades earlier while filming ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]'' (1957) with Marilyn Monroe and [[Paula Strasberg]] (Lee Strasberg's wife), was said to have quipped to Dustin Hoffman, after Hoffman stayed up all night to match his character's situation, that Hoffman should "try acting... It's so much easier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=The American actor Dustin Hoffman, playing a victim of imprisonment and torture in the film The Marathon Man, prepared himself for his role by keeping himself awake for two days and nights. He arrived at the studio disheveled and drawn to be met by his co-star, Laurence Olivier. "Dear boy, you look absolutely awful," exclaimed the First Lord of the Theatre. "Why don't you try acting? It's so much easier." Never was a grosser untruth spoken in jest. Laurence Kerr Olivier . . . would be the last man on earth to regard his chosen profession as easy.|date=17 May 1982|page=8|newspaper=[[The Times]]|title=The Times Profile: Laurence Olivier at Seventy-Five|first=Alan|last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian cinema ==
In [[Indian cinema]], a form of method acting was developed independently from American cinema. [[Dilip Kumar]], a [[Hindi cinema]] actor who debuted in the 1940s and eventually became one of the biggest Indian [[movie star]]s of the 1950s and 1960s, was a pioneer of method acting, predating Hollywood method actors such as [[Marlon Brando]]. Kumar inspired many future Indian actors, from [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]]  to [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thequint.com/entertainment/2015/12/11/before-brando-there-was-dilip-kumar Before Brando, There Was Dilip Kumar], The Quint, December 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Even actors of today have influences of Dilip Kumar'|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/javed-akhtar-even-actors-of-today-have-influences--of-dilip-kumar/20121111.htm|work=[[Rediff]]|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumar, who pioneered his own form of method acting without any acting school experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kumar|first1=Dilip|title=Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow|date=2014|publisher=[[Hay House]]|isbn=9789381398968|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was described as "the ultimate method actor" (natural actor) by the famous filmmaker [[Satyajit Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unmatched innings|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/magazine/article597902.ece|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=24 January 2012|accessdate=9 January 2015|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208164035/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/magazine/article597902.ece|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological effects ==
{{Main|Psychological effects of method acting}}

When the felt emotions of a played character are not compartmentalized, they can encroach on other facets of life, often seeming to disrupt the actor’s psyche. This occurs as the actor delves into previous emotional experiences, be they joyful or traumatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological effects, like emotional fatigue, comes when suppressed or unresolved raw emotions are unburied to add to the character,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; not just from the employing personal emotions in performance.

Fatigue, or emotional fatigue, comes mainly when actors “create dissonance between their actions and their actual feelings.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A mode of acting referred to as “surface acting” involves only changing one’s actions without altering the deeper thought processes. Method acting, when employed correctly, is mainly deep acting, or changing thoughts as well as actions, proven to generally avoid excessive fatigue. Surface acting is statistically “positively associated with a negative mood and this explains some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idJudge|Judge, Timothy A. “Is Emotional Labor More Difficult for Some than for Others? A Multi-level, Experience-sampling Study.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; This negative mood that is created leads to fear, anxiety, feelings of shame and sleep deprivation.

Raw emotion or unresolved emotions conjured up for acting, may result in a sleep deprivation and the cyclical nature of the ensuing side effects. [[Sleep deprivation]] alone can lead to impaired function, causing some individuals to “acute episodes of psychosis.” Sleep deprivation initiates chemical changes in the brain that can lead to behavior similar to psychotic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes can lead to more lasting psychological damage. In cases where raw emotion that has not been resolved, or traumas have been evoked before closure has been reached by the individual, the emotion can result in greater emotional instability and increased sense of anxiety, fear or shame.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mini Racer RC-12''' is 1/12 scale [[RC car]] manufactured by [[Yokomo]] from 1977 to the early 1980s. It was produced when [[Yokomo#History|Yokobori Mokei]] changed their name to Yokomo. The RC-12 box had both a Yokomo and Yokobori Mokei label on it. There were two different models in the RC-12 series. "Mini Racer RC-12" came with a narrow [[chassis]] and "Mini Racer RC-12 Junior" came with a wide chassis.

Stylistically, the music on the show ranges from mainstream [[pop music|pop]] ([[Britney Spears]], [[The Bangles]]) to oldies and classic rock artists ([[The Beach Boys]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pink Floyd]]), from classic [[jazz]] and [[soul music|soul]] ([[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Ben E. King]]) to [[hip-hop]] ([[Xzibit]], [[Time Zone (band)|Time Zone]]), often within a single episode.&lt;ref name="hbo"&gt;{{cite web | title=HBO: The Sopranos: Episode Guide | publisher=HBO | url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/episode/index.shtm | accessdate = 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening credits==
In the [[opening credits]] for each episode, [[Tony Soprano]] ([[James Gandolfini]]) drives from [[New York City]] to his home in [[North Caldwell, New Jersey]]. The musical accompaniment for this segment is the "Chosen One Remix" of the song "[[Woke Up This Morning]]" by the British group [[Alabama 3]] (known in the United States as A3 for legal reasons). "Woke Up This Morning (Chosen One Mix)" is four minutes and five seconds long,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Sopranos-Music-From-The-HBO-Original-Series/release/1702566&lt;/ref&gt; so a shortened version of it is used in the opening credits, which is approximately one minute and thirty seconds long.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinemetrics.lv/movie.php?movie_ID=10101&lt;/ref&gt;

==End credits==
Each episode's [[closing credits]] sequence features a unique piece of previously recorded music, with few exceptions. The episode "[[A Hit Is a Hit]]" uses a song by the fictional band Defiler, which appeared earlier in the episode. Three episodes feature multiple songs in the credits sequence ("[[Commendatori]]," "[[Whitecaps (The Sopranos episode)|Whitecaps]]" and "[[Cold Stones]]"), while two episodes ("[[Full Leather Jacket]]" and "[[Made in America (The Sopranos)|Made in America]]") have no music at all.

The following is a list of songs used at the end of each episode:

==Alternate music in Europe==
For the version of the series aired in Europe, the producers partially replaced the music for licensing reasons. European DVD editions (in case of Season One: only the 16:9 re-issue) contain these altered versions as foreign language dubs as well as the original unaltered English soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1.

==Other music used and trailers==
Not all artists featured on the show made it on to one of the compilation albums. The producers are known fans of the underground music scene and featured many locally relevant artists on the show. Also some classical pieces on the show failed to make any of the soundtrack albums—pieces by [[Beethoven]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and [[Emma Shapplin]]. A piece by [[Al Di Meola]] didn't make it.

Music used for the trailers was also different. The Season 5 trailer included the song "Say Yes!" of [[Siouxsie Sioux]]'s second band [[The Creatures]],  from their 2003 album ''[[Hái!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4tqo1ajeUk The Sopranos Season 5 Trailer].

'''Opera a la Carte''' is a Los Angeles-based [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] professional touring [[repertory]] company. It was founded in 1970 by British Gilbert and Sullivan artist Richard Sheldon (1935–2016), who directed its productions as closely as possible to the style and practice of the original productions of the [[Savoy operas]] by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].&lt;ref name=SheldonObit&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=177283021 "Obituaries: Richard Sheldon"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon retired from Opera a la Carte in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operaalacarte.org/about-opera-a-la-carte/richard-sheldon/ "Richard Sheldon"], Opera a la Carte, accessed January 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The company often presents ''[[H.M.S.

'''Paul Eliot Green''' (March 17, 1894 – May 4, 1981) was an American [[playwright]] best known for his historical dramas of life in North Carolina during the first decades of the twentieth century. He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for his 1927 play, ''[[In Abraham's Bosom]]'', which was included in [[Burns Mantle]]'s ''The Best Plays of 1926-1927''. 

His play ''[[The Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony ]]'' has been regularly produced since 1937 near [[Manteo, North Carolina]], and the historic colony of Roanoke. Its success has resulted in numerous other [[Symphonic outdoor drama|historical outdoor dramas]] being produced; his work is still the longest-running. 

==Biography==
Born in [[Buies Creek, North Carolina|Buies Creek]], in [[Harnett County, North Carolina|Harnett County]], near [[Lillington, North Carolina]], Green was educated at Buies Creek Academy. (It developed as what is now known as [[Campbell University]]). He went on to study at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he joined [[The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies]] and the [[PlayMakers Repertory Company#History of the Carolina Playmakers|Carolina Playmakers]]. Green also studied at [[Cornell University]].

Green first attracted attention with his 1925 one-act play ''The No 'Count Boy'', which was produced by the [[New York Theatre Club]]. The next year his full-length play ''[[In Abraham's Bosom]]'' (1926) was produced by the [[Provincetown Players]] and received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. The play was considered remarkable for its depiction of [[African Americans]] in the South. Its hero, a man of [[mixed-race]] ancestry, finds his idealistic attempts to better the lives of the African Americans around him doomed to failure. With this success, Green was recognized as one of the leading regional voices in the American theatre. His plays were often compared with the folk plays of Irish playwright [[John Millington Synge]]. This included his 1926 play, ''The Last of the Lowries'', a fictional account of [[Henry Berry Lowry]], a mixed-race leader of the [[Lumbee people]] during and after the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Paul. ''The Lord’s Will, and Other Carolina Plays,'' New York: Henry Holt and Co., 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roper, John Herbert (1948- ) ''Paul Green, Playwright of the Real South,'' Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2003. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green's ''The [[House of Connelly]]'' was a tragedy of the decline of an old Southern family. It was chosen by the newly formed [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] for its inaugural production. Often compared to [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' in its contrast of aristocratic decay and parvenu energy, ''The House of Connelly'' was praised by critic [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] as Green's finest play to date.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Expressionism===
But Green had begun to shift from the realistic style of his early work. In 1928–29 he traveled to Europe on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and was impressed by the non-realistic productions that he saw there. He began to experiment with [[expressionism]] and the [[Epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Erwin Piscator]]. In the 1930s Green largely abandoned the New York theatre, whose commercialism he found distasteful. His experiments in non-realistic drama, ''Tread the Green Grass'' (1932) and ''Shroud My Body Down'' (1934), both premiered in Chapel Hill. They were never professionally produced in New York.

During the summer of 1936, Green, [[Cheryl Crawford]], [[Kurt Weill]] and Weill's wife [[Lotte Lenya]] rented an old house in [[Nichols, Connecticut]], near the summer rehearsal headquarters of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] at [[Pine Brook Country Club]]. Green returned to the Group Theatre to write his pacifist musical play, ''[[Johnny Johnson (musical)|Johnny Johnson]]'', with a score by Kurt Weill. In it, Green experimented with [[genre]], writing the first act as a comedy, the second as a tragedy, and the third as a satire. During this time he had an affair with [[Lotte Lenya]], which would be her first American [[affair|love affair]].&lt;ref&gt;''Speak Low (when you speak of love): The Letters of Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Southern Life: Letters of Paul Green, 1916–1981,'' p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

The production encountered problems of style early on: set designer [[Donald Oenslager]] designed the first act in poetic realism, the second in expressionism, and the final act in an extremely distorted style, director [[Lee Strasberg]] wanted to stage it realistically, and others in the company wanted it to be staged expressionistically throughout. Reviews ranged from the enthusiastic to the dismissive. The play closed after 68 performances.

===Outdoor drama===
Green created a new dramatic form that he called [[symphonic outdoor drama|symphonic drama]]. Inspired by historical events, it incorporated music and pageantry, usually for outdoor performance. His first experiment in this form was ''Roll Sweet Chariot'' (1934), which ran for four performances on Broadway. Much more warmly received was the first of his outdoor symphonic dramas, ''[[Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony]]'' (1937), with music by [[Lamar Stringfield]]. Based on the Lost Colony of Roanoke and produced during the [[Great Depression]], it is still produced during the summers in an outdoor theater at [[Fort Raleigh National Historic Site]] near [[Manteo, North Carolina]]. ''The Lost Colony'' is the oldest outdoor historical drama in the United States and is one of three still being performed. It has become a community institution.

Among Green's other outdoor symphonic dramas are ''Faith of Our Fathers'', ''Wilderness Road'', ''Texas'', ''The Common Glory''; ''The Founders''; and ''Trumpet in the Land'', which tells the story of the European-American massacre of Native American Christian [[Moravians]] in [[Gnadenhutten]], Ohio, during the American Revolution; ''[[Cross and Sword]]'', the state play of Florida; and ''[[The Stephen Foster Story]]'', which continues to be played each summer in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]].

The little one-room house where Green conducted much of his writing has been moved to the [[North Carolina Botanical Garden]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].

==Other artistic endeavors==
Green also wrote screenplays: ''[[The Cabin in the Cotton]]'' (1932) and ''[[State Fair (1933 film)|State Fair]]'' (1933). He also wrote extensively on the subject of his beloved [[North Carolina]]. He helped [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] adapt his novel ''[[Native Son]]'' for the stage in 1940. 

Green founded the [[North Carolina Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Institute for Outdoor Drama]]. He served [[UNESCO]] traveling around the world to lecture on [[human rights]] and [[drama]]. Green served as a [[professor]] of drama at UNC until his death in 1981.

'''Phantom Entertainment, Inc.''' (known as '''Infinium Labs, Inc.''' until 2006) is a company founded in 2002 by Tim Roberts which makes [[computer keyboard]]s. However, Phantom is best known for the Phantom, a [[video game console]] advertised for Internet [[gaming on demand]] in [[2004 in games|2004]]; it was never marketed, leading to suggestions that it was [[vaporware]]. The company's website was last updated in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phantom.net/|title=Phantom Entertainment 2011: Home to the Phantom Lapboard|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Company history}}History==
Infinium Labs was founded by Tim Roberts in 2002 as a private company. In January 2003 it issued a press release saying that it would soon release a "revolutionary new gaming platform" with an on-demand video-game service, delivering games through an [[online]] subscription. The press release had no specific information, but included a computer-generated [[prototype]] design. Due to the use of [[buzzwords]] and the lack of details, the product was derided nearly from the beginning&lt;ref name="HomeLAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelanfed.com/index.php?id=11482 |title=Phantom Interview |author=John Callaham |date=20 January 2003 |work=HomeLAN |accessdate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402120109/http://www.homelanfed.com/index.php?id=11482 |archivedate=April 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by news sites such as [[IGN]]&lt;ref name="IGn2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/383/383280p1.html |title=Destroy Your Game Systems |author=Ivan Sulic |date=21 January 2003 |work=IGN |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slashdot]] and in the ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' [[webcomic]].&lt;ref name="PennyArcade1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/2003/01/22 |title=Penny Arcade "Dude, Whoa" |author=Jerry Holkins |date=22 January 2003 |work=Penny Arcade |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware and gaming site [[HardOCP]] researched and wrote an extensive article on the company and its operation, and was sued in turn. The Phantom placed first in ''[[Wired News]]''{{'}}s "Vaporware 2004".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Leander|last=Kahney|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66195-4,00.html?tw=wn_story_page_next3 |title=Vaporware Phantom Haunts Us All|publisher=[[Wired News]]|date=2005-01-07|accessdate=2006-05-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060131063719/http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66195-4,00.html?tw=wn_story_page_next3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Infinium Labs went [[Initial public offering|public]].&lt;ref name="PR2007"/&gt;

Roberts left the company in summer 2005 (with millions of shares of stock) before any products had been delivered. He later rejoined as chairman of the board, but in a July 2007 press release he again resigned from the company.&lt;ref name="PR2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/timothy-m-roberts-resigns-as-chairman-and-director-of-phantom-entertainment-inc-52714642.html |title=Timothy M.

The Phantom is a cancelled video-game console whose development was supposedly begun by Phantom Entertainment–then known as Infinium Labs–in 2003. The device was said to be capable of playing current and future PC games, giving the system a large initial game library and making it easier for developers to produce games for the system. The system was said to feature a direct-download [[content delivery]] service, instead of the [[disk storage|discs]] and [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]] used by most game consoles at the time.

Press releases said in 2003 that the console would be released that year, and the [[digital rights management]] software would be provided by DiStream.&lt;ref name="PR2003Unveil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beststuff.com/fromthewire/phantom-game-console-unveiling-to-be-online-august-17th.html |title=Phantom Game Console Unveiling to Be Online August 17th |author=Infinium Labs |date=23 July 2003 |work=Infinium Labs Press Release |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PR2003DiStream"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infinium-labs-selects-distream-for-digital-rights-management-of-phantom-game-system-and-phantomnet-game-service-72841717.html |title=DiStream Will Provide Server System and Management Platform for PhantomNet |author=Infinium Labs |date=3 November 2003 |work=Infinium Labs Press Release |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prototype]] Phantom was first seen at the May 2004 [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), although it was rumored to be fake.&lt;ref name="TomsHard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Online-Games-Store-Phantom,6703.html |title=Phantom Returns With Online Store |author=Kevin Parrish |date=16 December 2008 |work=TomsHardware |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robrady Design was hired to develop the first Phantom prototype, and Synopse ID was later retained to develop second- and third-generation prototypes.

==={{anchor|Development|Release date}}Release===
The Phantom had an online release on August 17, 2003 with basic hardware specifications and a price of "below $399".&lt;ref name="2003Unveiling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladydragon.com/phantom.html |title=Phantom Unveiling |author=Infinium Labs |date=17 August 2003 |work=Infinium Labs |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Options included customized hardware and the PhantomNet (a gaming-content service), priced at $9.95 a month. A sale date for the first quarter of 2004 was set. It was missed; the company later claimed it would go on sale in November for the holiday season, although it had not developed online-delivery software, licensed games or found any retailers. The second deadline was missed, with Infinium sending thousands of faxes claiming that the system would be released in January 2005.

When that deadline passed, Infinium predicted the system's release for around March 2005. That date also passed, and Infinium Labs was absent from the 2005 E3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Morris|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/19/technology/personaltech/e3_phantom/|title=Whither the Phantom?

By August 2006, the Phantom Console was removed from the products page of the Phantom Entertainment website.

Although the console was never manufactured, [[Alienware]] ordered a shipment of Lapboards for inclusion in a line of media-center PCs. Scheduled for release in February 2007, the company stated in December that Phantom could not meet their delivery needs and they would not be carrying the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2007/12/27/alienware-no-longer-carrying-phantom-lapboard/ | title = Alienware no longer carrying Phantom Lapboard | first = John | last = Biggs | work = CrunchGear | date = 2007-12-27 | accessdate = 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial problems===
The company was unable to raise its projected $30&amp;nbsp;million to complete the Phantom and announced it would downsize and focus on the Phantom Lapboard, a [[wireless keyboard]] for home use. On May 16, 2006, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] accused Phantom Entertainment founder and former CEO Timothy Roberts of running a "[[pump and dump]]" scheme in promoting the Phantom console in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Morris|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/16/technology/infinium/index.htm |title='Phantom' video game CEO charged with pump and dump scheme|publisher=[[CNN|CNN/Money]]|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phantom lost credibility in the gaming and business worlds because its release date was continually pushed back, and because of financial scandals involving Phantom Entertainment (which lost more than $62.7 million since its creation).&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite news | title=Infinium opens the books | publisher=GameSpot | date=2006-02-21 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6144631.html | first=Brendan|last=Sinclair | accessdate=2006-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phantom Lapboard is a [[wireless]] [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] made by the company. It was released on June 23, 2008, two years after its originally planned release date. Designed as a component of the Phantom game console, it is sold for use with [[Internet TV]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] [[video games]] since the console has been cancelled.&lt;ref name="gamespot1"&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6155882.html Phantom transmogrifies - News at GameSpot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a new model of the Lapboard was released to work with Internet TV, gaming and media centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/reviews/phantom_lapboard_review|title=Phantom Lapboard Review|last1=Castle|first1=Alex|date=September 7, 2010|website=MaximumPC|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Announcement===
On January 3, 2006, Infinium Labs announced that the lapboard component of the console (a keyboard and mouse designed to be held on the lap, for example, seated on a couch in front of a television) was due to be released to online retailers by the second quarter of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brendan|last=Sinclair|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6141718.html |title=Phantom Lapboard coming to PCs|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2006-01-03|accessdate=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19 it announced that the keyboard would not be released in time for Q2 2006, but the device (manufactured by Itron Technology) would be released in North America and Europe "no later than October" 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Orry|url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/phantom_lapboard_delayed.html|title=Phantom Lapboard delayed|publisher=Pro-G|date=2006-05-18|accessdate=2006-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15 it was announced that the price for the Lapboard would be [[USD|$]]129.99, with customers who preordered receiving a $30 discount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080321071314/http://phantom.net/content/customerCare/index.html Phantom Entertainment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard was then delayed until November.&lt;ref name="gamespot1" /&gt; On August 22, 2007, Phantom Entertainment signed an agreement with ProGames Network to provide Lapboards and Game Service content in hotels worldwide.&lt;ref name="businesswire" /&gt; The keyboard was finally released on June 23, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/phantom-lapboard/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218204012/http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/phantom-lapboard/| archivedate=December 18, 2007| title = Phantom Lapboard - Gizmodo | date = 2008-04-25 | accessdate = 2008-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two years after its originally planned release date.

===Reception===
[[Image:Lapboard Samples - White 002.JPG|thumb|right|250px|alt=White wireless keyboard, with thumb drive and wireless mouse|White Lapboard]]
In April 2008 ''[[Maximum PC]]'' published a preview of the lapboard, describing it as "extremely promising" although the supplied mouse "experienced signal dropouts at a distance of about 24 inches from the sensor". The author was able to use other wireless mice successfully. The preview states that the peripheral will be available in "June for $130 in limited quantities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/first_look_the_phantom_lapboard|website=Maximum PC|last1=Smith|first1=Will|title=First Look: The Phantom Lapboard|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the actual review, however, Maximum PC gave the Lapboard a verdict of 4 out of 10 saying: "The bottom line is that this thing is bad. The mouse isn’t good for gaming, the angled keyboard is awful for typing, and for media playback you’d do much better with a slimmer wireless media keyboard with a built-in trackpad or ball, which are available for significantly less than the Lapboard’s $140 asking price." 
On July 20, 2009, a sample lapboard received a favorable review from the ''Hardware Heaven'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardwareheaven.com/reviews/812/pg1/phantom-lapboard-keyboard-mouse-intro-keyboard.html|title=Phantom Lapboard (Keyboard &amp; Mouse)|author=Zardon|date=20 July 2009|website=HardwareHeaven.com|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its lukewarm review, in May 2010 [[About.com]] included the Phantom Lapboard in its [[Father's Day]] gift guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peripherals.about.com/od/pckeyboardsmice/fr/PhantomLapboard.htm|title=Phantom Lapboard Review|last=Johnston|first=Lisa|website=About.com|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peripherals.about.com/od/laptopbagsaccessories/tp/FathersDay.htm|title=Father's Day Gift Ideas|last=Johnston|first=Lisa|website=About.com|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, 2010, Michael Welter posted a generally positive review of the Phantom Lapboard on ''Missing Remote''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingremote.com/review/phantom-lapboard|title=The Phantom Lapboard|last=Welter|first=Michael|website=Missing Remote|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal controversies==

===HardOCP lawsuit===
In September 2003 HardOCP, a computer-hardware news website, published an investigative report by writer Steve Lynch critical of Infinium Labs and its founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Behind the Infinium Phantom Console | url = http://www.hardocp.com/article/2003/09/17/behind_infinium_phantom_console | first = Steve | last = Lynch | work = HardOCP | date = 2003-09-17 | accessdate = 2015-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 19, 2004 Infinium Labs' lawyers sent a [[cease and desist letter]] to HardOCP's editor demanding that the news site take down the article, claiming that it "painted a portrait of a company intent on swindling the public" and threatening to file a [[defamation]] suit. Rather than concede to Infinium's demands, HardOCP owner Kyle Bennett filed a lawsuit for a [[Declaratory ruling|declaratory judgment]] that his company had done nothing wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/hardocp-takes-legal-action-against-infinium | title = HardOCP takes legal action against Infinium | first = Rob | last = Fahey | date = 2004-03-04 | accessdate = 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinium Labs then filed suit in Florida, denying that Texas was the proper jurisdiction (although it had previously maintained a staffed office in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.spong.com/article/6936/Infiniums_Kevin_Bachus_Accused_of_Lying_to_US_Courts?cb=446 | title = Infinium's Kevin Bachus Accused of Lying to US Courts | date = 2004-06-15 | accessdate = 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, the judge required Infinium Labs to produce a number of financial records, including Roberts's personal income-tax returns, by the end of that month. Because the company failed to produce the required documents, HardOCP won a court order compelling them to do so. The judge ruled that sanctions would be awarded to KB Networks and Kyle Bennett in an amount to be determined by the court (later reported as $50,000).&lt;ref name="INFINIUM-LABS-INC-May-2005-10QSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/403/114420405016780/filing-main.htm |title=INFINIUM LABS INC, Form 10QSB, Filing Date May 23, 2005 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinium Labs settled the suit, agreeing to drop the pending Florida suit, and admitting all allegations of KB Networks' Texas complaint; they paid $50,000 to end the suit.

===Other controversies===
In October 2005, it was reported that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) had notified Tim Roberts that charges were pending against him for violating federal securities laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136934.html | title = Phantom maker in hot water with SEC | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | date = 2005-10-31|accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement about the notice, Infinium said it was not notified of specific charges, but suspected they were related to an SEC investigation of the unlawful promotion of [[penny stock]]s (including Infinium's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.z1Z9x.htm | title = Infinium Labs Inc • 8-K • For 10/20/05 | work = Form 8-K | publisher = Infinium Labs | date = 2005-10-20 | accessdate = 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts hired a stock promoter to send faxes claiming that the Phantom console's release was imminent, and the company's stock price might increase as much as 3,000 percent. The SEC alleged that the company never intended to release the console at the promised time due to significant unresolved "technological and manufacturing hurdles", and the faxes were part of a [[pump and dump]] scheme on the part of Roberts. Roberts reached a settlement with the SEC in which he was barred from serving as an officer or public director of a public company or participating in penny-stock offerings for five years and paid a $30,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.404.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20730.htm|title=SEC settles charges with video game executive|publisher=SEC|date=2008-09-19|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Roberts was CEO of Infinium, the company failed to report a substantial amount of interest and penalties on unpaid payroll taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6136934.html | title = Phantom maker in hot water with SEC | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair | publisher = Gamespot | date = 2005-11-01 | accessdate = 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, the company had consistently reported a small amount of cash on hand amid extensive (and increasing) debt.

In January 2006, Infinium Labs reached an agreement to borrow up to $5,000,000 from Golden Gate Investors to finance the manufacturing of the Phantom Lapboard, scheduled for release later that year. This would have been the largest amount of money Infinium Labs had ever borrowed at one time. The loan would have been repaid over three years, with an option of repayment with shares of common stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147455 | title = Infinium Bags $5 Million  | first = Patrick | last = Klepek|date = 2006-01-25 | accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, [[GameSpot]] reported that Phantom Entertainment was suspending the Phantom Game Service to develop the Lapboard. An SEC filing showed three-year losses in excess of $62.7&amp;nbsp;million, over half of which was marketing for the company and unreleased products. Over $24&amp;nbsp;million was spent on salaries and consultants, and $2.5&amp;nbsp;million on development. Infinium claimed it still intended to release the Lapboard if its financial situation improved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/6144631.html | title = Infinium opens the books | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair | publisher = GameSpot|date = 2006-02-21 | accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but it missed release dates for the second quarter of 2006, October 2006 and November 2006. On August 15, 2006 Phantom Entertainment removed all references to the Phantom Game Receiver from its website, claiming that the content-delivery system targeted for the Phantom would be available for PCs running the [[Microsoft Windows XP]] Media Center edition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Phantom console disappears | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33737 | publisher = The Inquirer | date = 2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; it later indicated this service would be available in March 2007, after the November 2006 release of the Lapboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2015342,00.asp | title = Surprise!

'''Rainway''' is a [[video game]] [[Streaming media|streaming]] service. Rainway allows users to run games on their [[personal computer|PC]] and play them on other devices over an internet connection. The beta launched on PC on January 20, 2018.&lt;ref name="rainway-delay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="digitaltrends" /&gt;

== Compatibility ==
Rainway is compatible with games purchased from [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Origin (digital distribution software)|Origin]], [[Battle.net]], Itchio and [[Uplay]]. The service can run in [[web browser]]s and will also be compatible with [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone|mobile phones]], as well as [[Xbox One]] consoles. The developers of Rainway also plan to support the service on the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] (with approval). Rainway's web service can be used through the Nintendo Switch's [[Nintendo_Switch_system_software#System|internal web browser]], which has been used by the Rainway developers for testing the service on the Nintendo Switch, although it is not yet known whether or not [[Nintendo]] will allow the Rainway application to be distributed on the [[Nintendo eShop]].&lt;ref name="digitaltrends"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/rainway-pc-game-streaming-nintendo-switch-support/ |title=Rainway’s PC game streaming service will also support the Nintendo Switch |last=Parrish |first=Kevin |date=2017-06-14 |website=Digital Trends |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bgr.com/2017/08/07/nintendo-switch-pc-game-streaming-half-life-2-rainway/ |title=Watch ‘Half-Life 2’ running on a Nintendo Switch with the Rainway app |last=Siegal |first=Jacob |date=2017-08-08 |website=BGR |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/10/rainway_streaming_app_continues_to_push_the_switch_version_teasing_cuphead_footage |title=Rainway Streaming App Continues to Push the Switch Version, Teasing Cuphead Footage |last=Whitehead |first=Thomas |date=2017-10-16 |website=Nintendo Life |language=en-GB |access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Rainway was first announced in March of 2017, by Andrew Sampson, with a beta planned for May 5th. The announcement was made on the official website for Ulterius, another streaming service worked on by Sampson which used similar technologies, but focused on [[Remote desktop software|desktop remote access]] rather than game streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://techraptor.net/content/andrew-sampson-announces-rainway |title=Borderless Gaming Developer Andrew Sampson Announces Rainway |last=Adams |first=Robert |date=2017-03-11 |website=TechRaptor |access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ulterius {{!}} Remote desktop inside any web browser when you need it|url=http://ulterius.io/|website=Ulterius|accessdate=9 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rainway did not gain significant attention until April, when it announced its plan to support the then-newly released Nintendo Switch console.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wccftech.com/rainway-pc-game-streaming-switch/ |title=Rainway App Allows 60FPS PC Game Streaming To Nintendo Switch, Xbox One &amp; More |last=Aernout |date=2017-04-24 |website=Wccftech |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[E3 2017]], Rainway reiterated that its streaming service would be made available for the Nintendo Switch console, and announced that the Rainway beta would launch on November 25.&lt;ref name="digitaltrends" /&gt; The release of the beta was later delayed again, to January 20.&lt;ref name="rainway-delay" /&gt;

[[File:Colorful Clown 3.jpg|thumb|This ridiculously small hat is incongruous with the man's head size.|200px]]

To be '''ridiculous''' is to be something which is highly incongruous or inferior, sometimes deliberately so to make people laugh or get their attention, and sometimes unintendedly so as to be considered laughable and earn or provoke ridicule and derision. It comes from the 1540s Latin "ridiculosus" meaning  "laughable", from "ridiculus" meaning  "that which excites laughter", and from "ridere" meaning "to laugh".&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ridiculous Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "Ridiculous" is an adjective describing "the ridiculous".

In common usage, "ridiculousness" is used as a synonym for [[absurdity]] or [[nonsense]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonsensical Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/illogicality Thesaurus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; From a historical and technical viewpoint, "absurdity" is associated with argumentation and reasoning, "nonsense" with [[semantics]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], while "ridiculous" is most associated with laughter, superiority, deformity, and incongruity. ''[[Reductio ad absurdum]]'' is a valid method of [[argument]], while ''[[appeal to ridicule|reductio ad ridiculum]]'' is invalid. Argument by [[invective]] declaration of ridiculous is invalid, while arguments involving declarations of nonsense may summarize a [[logical reasoning|cogent]] semantic problem with lack or meaning or [[ambiguity]].

Historically, the ridiculous was central to initial theories of humor and laughter as first put forth by philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]. It is currently used in the [[theories of humor|theory of humor]] to create laughter, shock, parody, or satire. Reactions to the ridiculous have been studied in [[psychology]] for its effects on memory, attention, and attitude in social hierarchies. These studies have been applied to the theory of advertisement regarding attention, memory, and alleviation of preexisting negative attitudes toward products. The ridiculous is often contrasted with the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], one of extreme inferiority, the other of extreme superiority, and often one can suddenly move from one extreme state to the other.

== Humor ==
{{Further information|Theory of humor}}

=== History: Incongruity, the superiority theory of humor, and deformity ===
The ridiculous often has extreme incongruity (things that are not thought to belong next to each other) or inferiority, e.g., "when something that was dignified is reduced to a
ridiculous position (here noting the element of the incongruous), so that laughter
is most intense when we escape from a 'coerced solemnity'."&lt;ref&gt;''Humour, Jokes and the Statement'', Journal of Human Values, 2006, S Acharya, [http://jhv.sagepub.com/content/12/2/179.short]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284 British Journal of Aesthetics, (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p.284]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Aristotle]], we laugh at inferior or [[unattractiveness|ugly]] individuals, because we feel a joy at being superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', 1449a, p. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] was reported by [[Plato]] as saying that the ridiculous was characterized by a display of self-ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Philebus'' 49b ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deformity]] was considered by some to be essential to the ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Laughter as a Test of Truth in Enlightenment Satire'', Werner von Koppenfels&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HEL&gt;A history of English Laughter: Laughter from Beowulf to Beckett and Beyond, Manfred Pfister&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories of humor  include the "incongruity theory" and the "superiority theory", the latter of which the philosopher Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent.&lt;ref&gt;The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke? Sexist Humor and What's Wrong With It, Memo Bergmann, Hypatia, Vol.1, Issue 1, March 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humor as a Double‐Edged Sword: Four Functions of Humor in Communication, JC Meyer, Communication Theory, Volume 10, Issue 3, pages 310–331, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes claimed that laughter was either caused spontaneously, or by seeing a deformed thing to which one compares themselves and laugh as a form of self applause; "a sudden glory arising from sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison of the infirmities of others." &lt;ref name=HEL/&gt; The Right Reverend [[William Warburton]], [[Lord Bishop]] of [[Gloucester]] said in the early 18th century that, "Nothing is ridiculous but what is deformed".&lt;ref&gt;The divine legation of Moses demonstrated, William Warburton&lt;/ref&gt; Using the ridiculous is a method in the theory of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Investigating the humor of gelotophobes: Does feeling ridiculous equal being humorless?, Humor - International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 22, Issue 1-2, Pages 111–143, ISSN (Online) 1613-3722, ISSN (Print) 0933-1719, {{doi|10.1515/HUMR.2009.006}}, /February/2009, Willibald Ruch, Ursula Beermann, [http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/HUMR.2009.006?journalCode=humr]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although common usage now considers "absurdity" to be synonymous with "ridiculousness", Hobbes discussed the two concepts as different, in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning, as in [[Hobbes' Table of Absurdity]], while ridiculousness has to do with laughter, superiority, ridicule, and deformity.

=== Native American Ritual Clown ===
{{Further information|Ritual clown}}
The [[Ritual clown]] ([[Heyókȟa]]) in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture uses the painfully ridiculous, and is believed to become closer to the gods by its [[:wikt:primordial|primordial]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;''Native American Postcolonial Psychology'', E Duran, B Duran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambigere: The Euro-American Picaro and the Native American Trickster, Melus, The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States Vol. 17, No. 1, Spring 1991, F Ballinger&lt;/ref&gt; Native American clowns are ridiculous in their contrary and rule breaking antics.&lt;ref&gt;The Mythology of Evil Among North American Indian Yuroks and Its Implications for Western Spirituality, Anthropology of Consciousness, Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 15–29, September 1996, Royal Alsup, Stanley Krippne, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/467321]&lt;/ref&gt; In the film ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'', the sacred clown rides sitting backwards on his horse, "washes" himself with dirt and "dries" himself with water.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer L. McMahon, B. Steve Csaki, ''The Philosophy of the Western'' (2010), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Heyókȟa are thought of as being incongruously backwards-forwards, upside-down, or contrary in nature. This spirit is often manifest by doing things backwards or unconventionally—riding a horse backwards, wearing clothes inside-out, or speaking backwards. For example, if food were scarce, a Heyókȟa would sit around and complain about how full he was; during a baking hot heat wave a Heyókȟa would shiver with cold and put on gloves and cover himself with a thick blanket. Similarly, when it is 40 degrees below freezing he will wander around naked for hours complaining that it is too hot.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Parody and satire in social commentary ====
{{Further information|Parody|Satire}}
The ridiculous can use uses both physical and conceptual inferiority and incongruity of juxtaposition to create [[parody]] and [[satire]].

In ''[[Candide]]'',  [[Voltaire]] parodies [[Leibniz]]'s argument for the [[existence of evil]] under a benign God using ''"ridiculous rationalizations of evil"''.&lt;ref name="TCD"&gt;''"ridiculous rationalizations of evil"''. Teaching Candide-A Debate, The French Review, Vol 61, No. 5, 1988, Theodore E. D. Braun, Felicia Sturzer, Martine Darmon Meyer, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/393842]&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz claimed that God is constrained by logic, and created the best of all ''[[possible worlds]]''. After being reduced from a "[[dignity|dignified]]" state to its opposite, the [[optimistic]] Dr. [[Panglossian|Pangloss]] (representing Leibniz) finds cause to consider his undignified position to be the best of all possible worlds, noting his own particular current happiness, which he argues could not have been attained without experiencing the atrocities in the previous narrative; his optimistic attitude is extremely incongruous with his experiences and extremely inferior undignified ultimate condition.&lt;ref name= TCD/&gt;

In [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', apelike humans and their behavior are juxtaposed next to streamlined advanced technology with a highly avant garde score by composer [[György Ligeti]]; Ligeti also used ridiculous juxtaposition in his scores to create parody,&lt;ref&gt;Blending the Sublime and the Ridiculous: A Study of Parody in György Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre, Sewell, Amanda J, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021116/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?bgsu1150987452]&lt;/ref&gt; and this tool was frequently used by composer [[Peter Maxwell Davies]].

=== Deformity and incongruity in performance as social commentary, and lifestyle ===

==== Japanese Butoh dance ====
{{Further information|Butoh}}
Japanese [[Butoh]] uses both incongruity and deformity to create ridiculous dance performance and lifestyle; extreme movement methods that are highly incongruous with natural body movement in its dance and everyday lifestyle, as well as in its clothing, actions, costume and set design that is highly incongruous with societal norms, which often shock the audience or visitor, and are sometimes considered not only ridiculous, but incongruently "bizarre and [[beauty|beautiful]]" or "[[elegant]] and [[grotesque]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizarre World of Butoh'', San Fransciso Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizzare and the Beautiful'', Los Angeles Times, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Theatre of the Ridiculous ====
{{Further information|Theatre of the Ridiculous}}
The Theatre of the Ridiculous uses highly incongruous stage settings and incongruous costumes such as [[cross dressing]] to disturb or create shock in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest of the Ridiculous:Ronald Tavel, John Vaccaro and Charles Ludlam, WarholStars, [http://www.warholstars.org/ridiculous.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology: attention, memory, and attitudes ==
Psychologists have studied human response to the ridiculous and its effects on attention and memory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Psychology of Advertising, Walter Dill Scott, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Art of Memory: Usefulness in Treatment, Bernard M. Patten, Archives of Neurology, 1972;26(1):25-31, [http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/25]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising===
The ridiculous is used in advertising to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] attention and attitudes toward products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Music for advertising effects, Psychology and Marketing, Volume 1, Issue 3-4, 1984, S Hecker&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juxtaposition with the sublime {{anchor| Ridiculous and the sublime}} ==
The ridiculous is sometimes contrasted to the sublime where something with one quality is thought of as approaching, or likely to change to, the other.

[[Thomas Paine]], writing in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' in 1795, said ''The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the sublime, makes the ridiculous; and one step above the ridiculous, makes the sublime again.''&lt;ref name=odp&gt;{{cite book|chapter=sublime | title=The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs | editor=Jennifer Speake | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t90.e2157| accessdate=2011-02-13}}  ''Available online to subscribers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]], reflecting on the state of his existence following his retreat from Moscow in 1812, famously remarked to Polish ambassador [[Dominique-Georges-Frédéric Dufour de Pradt|D. G. De Pradt]]: ''Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas'' (''There is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous'').&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;&lt;ref name=odp /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations, Robert Andrews&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Journal of Aesthetics, Aesthetics (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p. 284-5, [http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduction to the ridiculous,  or "reductio ad ridiculum" ===
{{Further information|Appeal to ridicule|Red herring|straw man}}
Reduction to the ridiculous (Latin: "reductio ad ridiculum", also called "Appeal to ridicule", "appeal to mockery", or "the Horse Laugh") is a logical fallacy which presents the opponent's argument in a way that grossly misrepresents it and appears ridiculous next to it, often so misrepresentative as to create a [[straw man]] argument, rather than addressing the argument itself.&lt;ref name=WT&gt;''Wishful Thinking and Other Philosophical Reflections'', Nicholas Rescher, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in arguing against [[idealism]], with its sophisticated arguments that the world was not real but only existed in the [[mind]], philosopher [[Dr. Johnson]] famously kicked a stone.&lt;ref Name=WT/&gt;

Contrasting ridiculousness with absurdity in [[reasoning]], ''Reductio ad ridiculum'' is an invalid method of argument, while ''reductio ad absurdum'' is a valid method.

=== Invective ===
Arguments are often simply dismissed by calling them "ridiculous" as invective, without further argumentation.&lt;ref name=WT/&gt; Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often dismissed philosophical positions by calling them "ridiculous" without further argument given.&lt;ref name=WT/&gt;

'''''Sanxion''''' is a 1986 [[scrolling shooter]] by [[Thalamus Ltd]], developed by Stavros Fasoulas. It was the first game released by Thalamus. Fasoulas also wrote ''[[Delta (computer game)|Delta]]'' and ''[[Quedex]]''.

==Gameplay==
{{no references|section|date=March 2018}}

''Sanxion'' is a horizontally-scrolling shooter. The goal to traverse each level from left to right avoiding or destroying any enemies and obstacles. The side-scroller speed is controllable, increasing the closer the player is to the center of the screen. The screen is divided in two sections, the upper one with an overhead view, and the lower one, taking up two-thirds of the screen, shows a typical side view. Enemies can come from both sides of the screen in close formations that the player must avoid colliding with.

While the scrolling is automatic for the most part, the player can control the speed of the engines (there is even a bonus timer that counts down, as an incentive for those who want to "blast through"), and the pitch of the noise alters accordingly, while sounding vaguely like a [[didgeridoo]]. This "adjustable rate autoscroll" is uncommon in the genre ([[Armed Police Unit Gallop]] is another example of this) There are a few exceptions, though. Several levels end with sections where the ship is forced to fly at maximum speed (a two-note siren will sound at the beginning of such sections), where the player must be quick to avoid oncoming barriers.

There are two main types of levels in Sanxion, based on the enemies. In some, such as the first, the enemies are constant throughout the level. In some others, such as the second, reaching a certain point (usually change of terrain) will cause all enemies on screen to self-destruct, and a different type of enemy will appear. There are exceptions to these patterns.

At the end of each level, there are non-lethal bonus stages which award points to the player for shooting, crashing or avoiding floating letters (the action required depends on the actual letter) at great speed. The background in these stages is rainbow, and the "radar" does not show your ship.

==Music==
The [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] music by [[Rob Hubbard]] called "Thalamusik" was played in the [[Commodore 64]] tape loading screen, during several minutes of slow tape load. The piece was inspired by ''[[Zoolook]]'' by [[Jean Michel Jarre]], a piece that Hubbard also reproduced in SID form for some public domain demos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c64.com/interviews/hubbard_part_2.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was very popular and later spawned several fan-made remixes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remix64.com/tune_47500.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The menu plays a [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] version of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''Dance of the Knights'' piece from the ballet [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]].

==Ports==
===Sinclair ZX Spectrum===
''Sanxion'' was ported externally to the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] by Sofstorm Developments in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] with the subtitle ''the Spectrum Remix'' in both 48k and 128k versions. This port has noticeable gameplay differences, e.g. the scrolling speed is fixed. The music score features renditions of the two main themes composed by Wally Beben.

===Game Boy Advance===
A port was planned by Thalamus Interactive in {{vgy|2001}} for the [[Game Boy Advance]], with updated graphics and new features, like two-player mode and end-of-level bosses. A prototype without split screen was developed, but the game was perceived too financially risky and ultimately canceled &lt;ref&gt;"Games that weren't", Retrogamer, Issue 18, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Sanxion'' was the first Thalamus game to use the ''Cyberload'' loader by John Twiddy, famous for containing the string "hackers fuck off and die".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c64.com/articles/thalamus_history.html C64.COM - For the best in C64 nostalgia - Thalamus History :Stavros Fasoulas]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' noted the presence of the fastloader (although not the string present) and was very thankful for its inclusion.&lt;ref name = "CGW"&gt;{{Cite news | date = April 1988 | last = Wilson | first = David | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = The Best Starfighter: A Comparison of Space Arcade Games  | pages = 24–25 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1988 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #130 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="Dragon130"&gt;{{cite journal

|journal=Dragon
|issue=130
|date=February 1988
|pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Commodore User]]''''s Mike Pattenden considered the game to be a clone of ''[[Uridium]]'' which was well executed but not really worth purchasing as an alternative to the cheaper rival ''Warhawk''.&lt;ref&gt;http://amr.abime.net/issue_2365_reviews&lt;/ref&gt;

It was voted Best Soundtrack of the Year at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue066/Pages/CVG06600101.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retrospective review Kristan Reed of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' gave the game a 7/10 rating and said "Although ''Sanxion'' doesn't stand up nearly as well as ''[[Uridium]]'' does these days, it was still a real highlight of the C64's growing love-affair with shooters. If you're a twitch shooter junkie, this is a game you have to play at some stage."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sanxion-review&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Secrets of Rætikon''''' is an [[action-adventure video game|action-adventure]] [[open world]] video game developed and published by Broken Rules. The player controls a bird and must explore the environment of Rætikon to find its secrets. Game elements include animals with specific behaviors and ancient puzzles. Development began in 2011 and the game was formally announced in July 2013 and followed by alpha and Steam Early Access releases. ''Secrets of Rætikon'' was released on April 17, 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] platforms. It received mixed reviews from reviewers, who praised its artwork and movement physics, but criticized its inconsistency, lack of cohesion, and technical issues.

== Gameplay ==

''Secrets of Rætikon'' is a [[single-player]], story-driven, [[open world]] sandbox&lt;ref name="Polygon: release date"/&gt; [[action-adventure video game]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: announce"/&gt; The [[player-character]] takes form of a bird. The player controls the bird with three buttons: one that flaps its wings, another that takes items into the bird's beak, and another that makes bird sounds.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt; While the game can be played through [[keyboard and mouse]], the developers instead recommend a [[video game controller|controller]].&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt;

The objective is to fly through the Rætikon environment to find its titular secrets, namely by collecting relics to power an ancient device. The environment is split into themed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] such as swamp, lagoon, mountaintops, and forests. Glowing shards are dispersed throughout each level, which can be collected and redeemed at an altar within each themed level for a glowing relic. These relics can be returned to where the player started the game to power a mysterious, ancient device. The player-character carries the relics past aggressive enemies and treacherous environment, and completes [[puzzle video game|puzzles]] of reconstructing animal statues from its pieces to access new levels.&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt; Each level features different animals and contain environmental objects that player can interact with.&lt;ref name="Polygon: release date"/&gt;

== Development ==
''Rætikon'' was first announced in July 2013,&lt;ref name="Polygon: announce"/&gt; though its development began in 2011.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Indiegogo"/&gt; The game's [[Vienna|Viennese]] developer and publisher, Broken Rules Games, had previously worked on the 2012 [[Wii U]] game ''Chasing Aurora'',&lt;ref name="Polygon: announce"/&gt; which itself was based on a multiplayer prototype for ''Rætikon''.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra: Chasing Aurora"/&gt; The game is partly based on an [[Alps]] region culture conquered by the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: release date"/&gt; Its visuals were inspired by dream-like flying sensations.&lt;ref name="Polygon: announce"/&gt; In an effort to increase the game's [[replay value]], the developers emphasized its [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]], physics, and interactive qualities, including animal-specific behaviors and strippable plant foliage.

Broken Rules released an [[alpha version]] of the game in October 2013. Around the same time, they announced an [[Indiegogo]] [[crowdfunding]] campaign in lieu of searching for a [[video game publisher|publisher]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: Indiegogo"/&gt; The game later entered [[Steam Early Access]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: release date"/&gt; ''Rætikon'' was released on April 17, 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] platforms via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the [[Mac App Store]], and the [[Humble Store]]. The Steam edition of the game supports [[Steam Workshop]] with a level editor for users to build and share original content.&lt;ref name="Polygon: release date"/&gt;

The game received "mixed or average reviews", according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=Metacritic/&gt; Reviewers praised the game's artwork and movement physics, but criticized its lack of cohesion.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HG review"/&gt; Some appreciated the moments where the game's elements coalesced.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt; They estimated the game to run between two&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt; and three hours in length.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt;

''Joystiq''{{'s}} Sam Prell said that the adventure felt restrictive and linear, "like a guided tour".&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt; He wrote that ''Rætikon''{{'s}} map design encourages players to think methodically about their path rather than to explore the game as a non-linear open world. In this way, he felt that its gameplay philosophies contradicted.&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt; ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Geoff Thew wrote that the game "commits a number of fundamental design sins" as one of "few games so ceaselessly tiring to play".&lt;ref name="HG review"/&gt; He felt that the animals who steal the game objectives created "busywork", and complained of copious backtracking and the "straight up discourteous" exclusion of an in-game map.&lt;ref name="HG review"/&gt; ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} Jon Denton added that numerous "extremely irritating conflicts" with off-screen animals hurt the game's pacing.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt; He noted its gameplay influence from ''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]'' and compared its blue shards game mechanics to that of ''[[Dark Souls]]''.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt; Denton did not feel that the game deserved the amount of effort it required of its players to understand its story.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt; Reviewers noted technical issues and glitches within the game. Prell noted issues in the game's physics and [[game save]] features. As ''Rætikon'' does not support manual saves, he frequently found his progress automatically saved while his player-character was stuck in the environment.&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt; Thew of ''Hardcore Gamer'' found similar physics glitches that trapped him in the environment, which led him to use his keyboard alongside the Xbox 360 controller to circumvent controller compatibility issues.&lt;ref name="HG review"/&gt;

When mentioning the game's art style, most reviewers gave positive response. Denton described the style as a "beautifully drawn, angular 2D world".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt; Prell wrote that ''Rætikon''{{'s}} triangle-based art style made its characters feel like [[papercraft]] and gave the game "a sense of reverence and spirituality" when complemented by the story, and gave comparison to ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]''.&lt;ref name="Joystiq review"/&gt;  Thew gave similar response noting that it is reminiscent of Origami. However, Thew continued to state that while the visuals were "distinctive", the game's "alpine" area was "clichéd and predictable" and its "good looks and smooth movement mechanics" did not compensate for the rest of the game's design.&lt;ref name="HG review"/&gt; He found the game "shallow", uninteresting, and "a disappointment ... on almost every level".&lt;ref name="HG review"/&gt; Denton of ''Eurogamer'' praised the moments where he figured out how to find a shard or alphabet piece, but ultimately found ''Rætikon'' "awkward", with "substance did not live up to its style", and causing unjustified and unreasonable frustration.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt;

He briefly served on the Rishon LeZion City Council.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 2008, he ran in the [[primaries]] to determine the Likud list for the [[Eighteenth Knesset]], but was placed in an unrealistic place on the list.

==Awards and recognition==
Rivlin won the Israeli Television Academy award.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 2002, he won the Golden Mask prize for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A Jerusalem Post columnist who interviewed him said: "Watching him is very simply an audience with a comic artist - hour after hour, he creates comedy. In person, he is much funnier than he is on TV. Face to face, his bug eyes and mugging and comic airs, and, above all, his nonstop improvisatory ability, are explosively funny."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-17011419.html No Funny Business, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the news of his death Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] called Rivlin a “friend and companion” and a "beloved artist who made generations of Israelis laugh with his witty humor.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-comedian-sefi-rivlin-dies-at-age-66/ Israeli comedian Sefi Rivlin dies at age 66]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smackgirl''' was a Japanese mixed martial arts promotion focused solely on [[Women's mixed martial arts|female fighters]]. The promotion also held grappling and amateur events along with its main line of professional MMA cards. After financial difficulties throughout 2008 the promotion was sold to Marverous Japan Co.,Ltd. and [[Rebranding|rebranded]] [[Jewels (mixed martial arts)|JEWELS]].&lt;ref name="Jewels Gets Debut; Hioki-Sato Set for Shooto"&gt;{{cite web

Unlike conventional MMA in Japan, Smackgirl did not allow striking to the head while in a grounded position. There was also a 30-second limit for ground fighting but it was abolished by 2008.&lt;ref name="Ward, Tavares, Marquez arrive in Tokyo for Smackgirl show"&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Adventures of Barry McKenzie''''' is a 1972 Australian film starring [[Barry Crocker]], telling the story of an Australian '[[Yob (slang)|yobbo]]' on his travels to the United Kingdom. [[Barry McKenzie]] was originally a character created by [[Barry Humphries]] for a [[cartoon strip]] in ''[[Private Eye]]''. It was the first Australian film to surpass one million dollars in Australian box office receipts.&lt;ref name="SBS"&gt;Don Groves, [http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2010/03/23/beresford-reflects-his-colossal-mistake "Beresford reflects on his 'colossal mistake': A TV screening of an iconic Australian comedy brings back mixed memories for the filmmaker."] [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  A sequel, ''[[Barry McKenzie Holds His Own]]'', was produced in 1974.&lt;ref name="ASO"&gt;{{cite web|title = Australianscreen.com.au – The Adventures of Barry McKenzie |url =http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/adventures-barry-mckenzie/ |accessdate=22 December 2008|work= |publisher=National Film and Sound Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Humphries appears in several roles, including: a hippie, Barry McKenzie's psychiatrist Doctor de Lamphrey, and as Aunt Edna Everage (later [[Dame Edna Everage]]). Humphries would later achieve fame with the character of Dame Edna in the UK and USA.

The film was produced by [[Phillip Adams]], who became a prominent [[op-ed]] journalist and broadcaster, and directed by [[Bruce Beresford]].

==Plot summary==
Barry 'Bazza' McKenzie (Barry Crocker) travels to England with his aunt Edna Everage (Barry Humphries) to advance his cultural education. Bazza is a young Aussie fond of beer, [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]] and beautiful '[[sheila]]s'. He settles in [[Earls Court]], where his old friend Curly ([[Paul Bertram]]) has a flat. He gets drunk, is ripped off, insulted by pretentious Englishmen and exploited by record producers, religious charlatans and a BBC television producer ([[Peter Cook]]). He reluctantly leaves England under the orders of his aunt, after exposing himself on television. His final words on the plane home are, "I was just starting to like the Poms!"

==Production==
Bruce Beresford was living in London and knew Barry Humphries socially when he heard about government funding being given to Australian films.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I said to Barry Humphries that we should do a script from the comic strip because they had money available to make films but it hadn't occurred to them that they had no one to make them. I said, "I don't think they've thought about that but if we whip back to Australia with a script, with you starring in it and we're all set to go, we have a good chance of getting the money. There wouldn't be all that many going for it." And that's more or less what happened.&lt;ref name="signet"&gt;[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Bruce+Beresford&amp;bl "Interview with Bruce Beresford", ''Signet'', 15 May 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121220180451/http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Bruce+Beresford&amp;bl |date=20 December 2012 }} accessed 17 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The film was entirely funded by the [[Screen Australia|Australian Film Development Corporation]].  Shooting started in London in January 1972, with the unit moving to Australia in February. Local unions complained about the presence of British technicians in the crew, but a compromise was reached where Australian technicians joined the crew. Filming ended in March.&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt;

Phillip Adams wanted to cast [[Paul Hogan]] as Curly but he turned down the role. "I suspect he was concerned over his ability to work with professional actors," says Adams.&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;Gordon Glenn &amp; Scott Murray, "Phil Adams: Producer", ''Cinema Papers'', March–April 1976 p340&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Phillip Adams insisted on distributing the film himself initially.&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1980 p44&lt;/ref&gt; The film was very popular at the box office in Australia and London, and the production company repaid the government most of its money within three months of release.&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt; Bruce Beresford said in a 1999 interview: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Personally, it was a massive mistake for me to do it, a massive mistake, because the film was so badly received critically. Instead of getting me work, even though it was successful commercially, it put me out of work.&lt;ref name="signet"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beresford went on to direct "Barry McKenzie Holds His Own" {{endash}} again to great commercial success {{endash}} in 1974, and then "Breaker Morant" starring Edward Woodward in 1980. However, in the 1999 interview Beresford said that both Barry McKenzie films had been "mistakes":
&lt;blockquote&gt;That [''Barry McKenzie Holds His Own''] was an even bigger mistake. I couldn't find anything else to make because the films were so reviled critically that I thought that, with these two films, I'll never work again. Luckily Phillip Adams saved my life by offering me Don's Party. But that was a couple of years later. I thought the Barry McKenzie films were very funny but the reaction was so hostile that I realised very quickly that I had made a massive mistake.&lt;ref name="signet"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Box office==
This was the first Australian film to surpass $1 million at the national box office,&lt;ref name="SBS"/&gt; and it led the Australian box office in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Davies, [http://www.spectator.co.uk/australia/6051553/our-lost-golden-age/ "Our lost Golden Age"], ''[[The Spectator]]'', 2 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The film recovered its $250,000 budget within a few months of release.&lt;ref name="ASO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A [[Film Victoria]] report on box office results states that ''The Adventures of Barry McKenzie'' took $47,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $399,500 in 2009 dollars. [http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office''], archive copy [https://web.archive.org/web/20110218045303/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf here]. However, this figure may be an error, since it is inconsistent with the many other sources that describe the film as a major box office success that recouped its $250,000 budget in a few months.  See also the notes at the entry for [http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/adventures-of-barry-mckenzie ''The Adventures of Barry McKenzie''] at Oz Movies, raising similar doubts about the Film Victoria box office figures.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The film explores the cultural distance between Australian [[popular culture]] and the manners and mores of England, both nations presented in hyperbolically satirical manner. Barry is the extreme embodiment of  "Ockerism" of the late fifties and mid-sixties Australia. Swearing, excessive drinking, vomiting, rowdiness and other crassness is glorified. The film also plays with the ideas of the era where the sixties cultural revolution had swept aside the "certainties" of [[Classical education movement|classical education]].{{cn|date=August 2015}}

A '''tombeau''' (plural '''tombeaux''') is a musical composition (earlier, in the early 16th century, a poem) commemorating the death of a notable individual. The term derives from the French word for "tomb" or "tombstone". The vast majority of tombeaux date from the 17th century and were composed for [[lute]] or other plucked string instruments. The genre gradually fell out of use during the 18th century, but reappeared in the early 20th.

==History==
"In instrumental music, ''tombeau'' signifies a musical 'tombstone' (French ''le tombeau'' = tomb). The musical genre of tombeau is generally connected with music for the [[lute]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Of some 60+ surviving pieces, most are intended for the [[lute]] or [[theorbo]], 5 for the baroque [[guitar]], 7 for the [[viola da gamba]] and 3 for [[harpsichord]]. The earliest example of this genre seems to be the ''Tombeau de [[René Mezangeau|Mezangeau]]'' (1638) by French lutenist [[Ennemond Gaultier]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

"Musical predecessors are memorial pavans like those by [[Anthony Holborne]] (''Countess of Pembrokes Funeralle'', 1599). In France, where this musical genre emerged first, strong influence of literary models, particularly of memorial poems that were popular from the 16th to the end of the 17th centuries, may have been another important factor."&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

"The tombeau preeminently comes in two forms, as a slow elegiac [[allemande]] grave in 4/4 or as a [[pavane|pavan]], a tri-partite [[renaissance dance]] already long out of date for the era of tombeaux, but with all the trappings of the allemande (cf. [[Denis Gaultier]], ''Tombeau pour M. [[Racquette]]''). There are also a few unique tombeaux that appear as [[gigue]]s; that is because the gigue grave resembles the allemande in a number of respects."&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

"As opposed to the Italian [[lamento]], the tombeau should not have used expressive elements of mourning, which were skeptically viewed in France. Nevertheless, certain typical [[onomatopoetic]] features were used: repeated note motifs depicting the knocking of Death at the door, ascending or descending [[diatonic]] or [[chromatic]] [[musical scale|scale]]s which depict the soul's tribulation and transcendence. Froberger's [[Lamentation]] on the Death of Ferdinand III or the Meditation sur ma Mort Future would be a prime example of such a form. Some tombeaux include a motif of four descending notes, a metaphor for grief given influential expression by John Dowland in his [[Lachrimae]] (1604). These genres offered many suitable expressive characteristics: the suspirans figure (a three-note upbeat), dotted rhythms, particularly in repeated notes, and slow-moving harmonies in the minor mode whose gravity is heightened by a tendency to settle on pedal points. Later examples also tend to use chromatic progressions related to the lamento bass. The few courante tombeaux exploit the same rhythmic features in triple metre."&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

"Developed by Parisian [[lutenist]]s ([[Denis Gaultier]], [[Charles Mouton]], [[Jacques Gallot]], [[François Dufault]]), the genre was soon taken over by [[clavecin]]ists ([[Johann Jakob Froberger]], [[Louis Couperin]], both on the death of their friend [[Charles Fleury|Blancrocher]] in 1652) and was then spread into Central Europe ([[Jan Antonín Losy]], [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]])."&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

The tombeau genre went into decline at the end of the 18th century.  It reappeared in the 20th century with [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Le tombeau de Couperin]]'' (1919).  Other 20th century tombeaux include [[Manuel de Falla]]'s ''Le tombeau de [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'' for solo guitar, [[Arthur Benjamin]]'s ''Le tombeau de Ravel'' for clarinet and piano, and the last movement of ''[[Pli selon pli]]'' by [[Pierre Boulez]]. In the 21st century a series of tombeaux was written by [[Roman Turovsky-Savchuk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sineris.es/tombeaux2.html&lt;/ref&gt;
