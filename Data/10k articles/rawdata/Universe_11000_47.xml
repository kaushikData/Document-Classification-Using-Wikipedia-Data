'''Alphabet Energy''' is a [[startup company]] founded in 2009 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[thermoelectrics]] expert [[Matthew L. Scullin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/matt-scullin-power-recycler-09292011.html Matt Scullin, Power Recycler - Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peidong Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/08/100823-energy-electric-power-from-heat/ Tapping into the Electric Power of Heat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The company uses [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] applications to create [[thermoelectric generator]]s that are more cost effective than previous [[bismuth telluride]]-based devices. The company is based in [[Hayward, California]]. It started with a license to use [[Nanowire battery|silicon nanowire]] developed at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/13941 "Low Cost Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Efficient Power Generation", Department of Defense award information, United States Government Small Business Innovation Research website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2014/07/22/alphabet-energy-wants-to-be-the-intel-of-waste-heat-recovery/ |title=Alphabet Energy Wants to Be the "Intel of Waste Heat Recovery" |publisher=Xconomy |date=2014-07-22 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs |first=Suzanne |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528841/thermoelectric-material-to-hit-market-later-this-year/ |title=Cheaper Thermoelectric Materials &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2014-07-15 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cases.haas.berkeley.edu/promo/2012_2_alphabet_5717.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They moved from UC Berkeley to offices in San Francisco in 2011, and later to Hayward.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/alphabet-energy-pilots/ Alphabet Energy's Waste-Heat Recovery Tech Is Out Of The Lab, Pilot Projects Underway | TechCrunch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alphabet has a number of [[patents]] related to the capture of [[waste heat]] for purposes of electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/patents/assignee/alphabet-energy-inc/ |title=Alphabet Energy, Inc. - Patent applications |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is working with [[tetrahedrite]], a common mineral with thermoelectric properties.

2011's ''[[The Lean Startup|The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]]'' describes Alphabet Energy's approach to product development as an example of the successful practice of the book's principles. Author [[Eric Ries]] is on Alphabet's advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alphabetenergy.com/company/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Alphabet Energy |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727214848/http://www.alphabetenergy.com/company/about-us/ |archive-date=2014-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alphabet has raised over $35 million in venture capital funding from Claremont Creek, [[TPG Capital]], [[Encana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/03/11/canadian-natural-gas-giant-encana-backs-alphabet-energy/ |title=Canadian natural gas giant Encana backs Alphabet Energy — Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2013-03-11 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the California Clean Energy Fund. They were chosen as a 2014 [[World Economic Forum]] Technology Pioneer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/community/technology-pioneers |title=Technology Pioneers &amp;#124; World Economic Forum - Technology Pioneers |publisher=Weforum.org |date=2013-06-29 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a 2015 IHS [[CERAWeek]] Energy Innovation Pioneer.

The company’s name, based on the word [[alpha]], comes from its use as a term for a [[thermoelectric effect|Seebeck coefficient]], and has no relation to the Google holding company, Alphabet Inc.

==Products==

In 2014, Alphabet Energy introduced the world’s first industrial-scale thermoelectric generator, the E1.  The E1 takes exhaust heat from large industrial engines and turns it into electricity. The result is an engine that needs less fuel to deliver the same power.  The E1 is optimized for engines up to 1,400&amp;nbsp;kW, and works on any engine or exhaust source, currently generating up to 25 kWe on a standard 1,000&amp;nbsp;kW engine.  The E1's modules are interchangeable but currently come with a low-cost proprietary thermoelectric material and the device is rated for a 10-year life span.  As advances in thermoelectric materials are made, new modules can be swapped in for old ones, to continually improve fuel efficiency to as much as 10%.

==High temperature heat-to-electricity conversion==
In 2017 Alphabet Energy, with a $2-million grant from the [[California Energy Commission]] (CEC), has been partnering with Berkley Lab "to create a cost-effective thermoelectric [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] system to reduce both energy use in the industrial sector and electricity-related carbon emissions." &lt;ref name="juchao"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chao|first1=Julie|title=New Berkeley Lab Project Turns Waste Heat to Electricity|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2017/04/13/new-berkeley-lab-project-turns-waste-heat-to-electricity/|accessdate=May 31, 2017|agency=News Center|publisher=Berkeley Lab|date=April 13, 2017|quote=ab to work with Alphabet Energy to develop a low-cost thermoelectric system}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is a prototype with 10+ percent efficiency, operating temperatures beyond the 400 degree Celsius limit up to 800 degrees, possible remote electricity generation for areas off the grid, and "modularization for a broad scale of..applications" unique at various locations. &lt;ref name="juchao"/&gt;

'''Antifreeze proteins''' ('''AFPs''') or '''ice structuring proteins''' ('''ISPs''') refer to a class of [[polypeptides]] produced by certain [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] that permit their survival in subzero environments.  AFPs bind to small [[ice crystals]] to inhibit growth and [[crystallization|recrystallization]] of ice that would otherwise be fatal.&lt;ref name="Madura2001"&gt;http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=120&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also increasing evidence that AFPs interact with mammalian cell membranes to protect them from cold damage.  This work suggests the involvement of AFPs in cold [[acclimatization]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fletcher GL, Hew CL, Davies PL | title = Antifreeze proteins of teleost fishes | journal = Annu. Rev. Physiol. | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 359–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11181960 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.physiol.63.1.359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-colligative properties==
Unlike the widely used automotive antifreeze, [[ethylene glycol]], AFPs do not lower freezing point in proportion to concentration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Rather, they work in a non[[colligative]] manner.  This phenomenon allows them to act as an antifreeze at concentrations 1/300th to 1/500th of those of other dissolved solutes.  Their low concentration minimizes their effect on [[osmotic pressure]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher2001" /&gt;  The unusual properties of AFPs are attributed to their selective affinity for specific crystalline ice forms and the resulting blockade of the ice-nucleation process.&lt;ref name="Jorov2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jorov A, Zhorov BS, Yang DS | title = Study of interaction of winter flounder antifreeze protein with ice | journal = Protein Sci. | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 1524–37 |date=June 2004 | pmid = 15152087 | pmc = 2279984 | doi = 10.1110/ps.04641104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal hysteresis==
AFPs create a difference between the melting point and freezing point (busting temperature of AFP bound ice crystal) known as thermal hysteresis.  The addition of AFPs at the interface between solid ice and liquid water inhibits the thermodynamically favored growth of the ice crystal.  Ice growth is kinetically inhibited by the AFPs covering the water-accessible surfaces of ice.&lt;ref name="Jorov2004" /&gt;

Thermal hysteresis is easily measured in the lab with a [[nanolitre osmometer]].  Organisms differ in their values of thermal hysteresis.  The maximum level of thermal hysteresis shown by fish AFP is approximately -3.5&amp;nbsp;°C (Sheikh Mahatabuddin et al, SciRep)(29.3&amp;nbsp;°F).  However, insect antifreeze proteins are 10–30 times more active than fish proteins. This difference probably reflects the lower temperatures encountered by insects on land.  In contrast, aquatic organisms are exposed only to -1 to -2&amp;nbsp;°C below freezing.  During the extreme winter months, the [[spruce budworm]] resists freezing at temperatures approaching -30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Fletcher2001" /&gt; The Alaskan beetle ''[[Upis ceramboides]]'' can survive in a temperature of -60&amp;nbsp;°C by using antifreeze agents that are not proteins.&lt;ref name="Walters KR Jr, Serianni AS, Sformo T, Barnes BM, Duman JG 2009 20210–5"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walters KR Jr |author2=Serianni AS |author3=Sformo T |author4=Barnes BM |author5=Duman JG | title=A nonprotein thermal hysteresis-producing xylomannan antifreeze in the freeze-tolerant Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]  | volume= 106 | issue= 48| year=2009 | pages=  20210–5| pmid=19934038 | pmc=2787118 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0909872106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of cooling can influence the thermal hysteresis value of AFPs.  Rapid cooling can substantially decrease the nonequilibrium freezing point, and hence the thermal hysteresis value.  Consequently, organisms cannot necessarily adapt to their subzero environment if the temperature drops abruptly.&lt;ref name="Fletcher2001" /&gt;

==Freeze tolerance versus freeze avoidance==
Species containing AFPs may be classified as

'''Freeze avoidant''': These species are able to prevent their body fluids from freezing altogether.  Generally, the AFP function may be overcome at extremely cold temperatures, leading to rapid ice growth and death.

'''Freeze tolerant''': These species are able to survive body fluid freezing.  Some freeze tolerant species are thought to use AFPs as cryoprotectants to prevent the damage of freezing, but not freezing altogether.  The exact mechanism is still unknown.  However, it is thought AFPs may inhibit recrystallization and stabilize cell membranes to prevent damage by ice.&lt;ref name="Duman2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Duman JG | title = Antifreeze and ice nucleator proteins in terrestrial arthropods | journal = Annu. Rev. Physiol. | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 327–57 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11181959 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.physiol.63.1.327 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may work in conjunction with [[protein ice nucleator]]s (PINs) to control the rate of ice propagation following freezing.&lt;ref name="Duman2001" /&gt;

== Diversity ==
There are many known [[Convergent evolution|nonhomologous]] types of AFPs.

===Fish AFPs===
[[Image:AFPnew.svg|frame|'''Figure 1'''. The three faces of Type I AFP]]Antifreeze [[glycoproteins]] or AFGPs are found in [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[notothenioid]]s and [[Gadidae|northern cod]]. They are 2.6-3.3 kD.&lt;ref name="Crevel2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crevel RW, Fedyk JK, Spurgeon MJ | title = Antifreeze proteins: characteristics, occurrence and human exposure | journal = Food Chem. Toxicol. | volume = 40 | issue = 7 | pages = 899–903 |date=July 2002 | pmid = 12065210 | doi =10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00042-X  }}&lt;/ref&gt; AFGPs evolved separately in notothenioids and northern cod. In notothenioids, the AFGP gene arose from an ancestral trypsinogen-like serine protease gene.&lt;ref name="Chen et. al.1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen | title = Evolution of antifreeze glycoprotein gene from a trypsinogen gene in Antarctic notothenioid fish | journal = PNAS | volume = 94 | issue = 8 | pages = 3811–3816 | year = 1997 | doi=10.1073/pnas.94.8.3811 | pmid=9108060 | pmc=20523|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type I AFP is found in [[winter flounder]], [[longhorn sculpin]] and [[shorthorn sculpin]]. It is the best documented AFP because it was the first to have its three-dimensional structure determined.&lt;ref name="Duman and DeVries1976"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duman JG, de Vries AL | title = Isolation, characterization, and physical properties of protein antifreezes from the winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus | journal = Comp. Biochem. Physiol., B | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–80 | year = 1976 | pmid = 1277804 | doi = 10.1016/0305-0491(76)90260-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Type I AFP consists of a single, long, amphipathic alpha helix, about 3.3-4.5 kD in size. There are three faces to the 3D structure: the hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and Thr-Asx face.&lt;ref name="Duman and DeVries1976" /&gt;

Type I-hyp AFP (where hyp stands for hyperactive) are found in several righteye flounders. It is approximately 32 kD (two 17 kD dimeric molecules). The protein was isolated from the blood plasma of winter flounder. It is considerably better at depressing freezing temperature than most fish AFPs.&lt;ref name="Scotter2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scotter AJ, Marshall CB, Graham LA, Gilbert JA, Garnham CP, Davies PL | title = The basis for hyperactivity of antifreeze proteins | journal = Cryobiology | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–39 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16887111 | doi = 10.1016/j.cryobiol.2006.06.006 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type II AFPs are found in [[sea raven]], [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] and [[herring]]. They are cysteine-rich globular proteins containing five [[disulfide bond]]s.&lt;ref name="Ng and Hew1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng NF, Hew CL | title = Structure of an antifreeze polypeptide from the sea raven. Disulfide bonds and similarity to [[lectin]]-binding proteins | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 267 | issue = 23 | pages = 16069–75 |date=August 1992 | pmid = 1644794 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type II AFPs likely evolved from calcium dependent (c-type) lectins.&lt;ref name="Ewart et. al.1992"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ewart | title = Structural and functional similarity between fish antifreeze proteins and calcium-dependent lectins | journal = Biochem Biophys Res Commun | volume = 185 | pages = 335–340 | year = 1992 | doi=10.1016/s0006-291x(05)90005-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea ravens, smelt, and herring are quite divergent lineages of [[teleost]]. If the AFP gene were present in the most recent common ancestor of these lineages, it's peculiar that the gene is scattered throughout those lineages, present in some orders and absent in others. It has been suggested that lateral gene transfer could be attributed to this discrepancy, such that the smelt acquired the type II AFP gene from the herring.&lt;ref name="Graham et. al.2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graham | title = Lateral transfer of a lectin-like antifreeze protein gene in fishes | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3 | pages = e2616 | year = 2008 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002616|display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type III AFPs are found in Antarctic [[eelpout]]. They exhibit similar overall hydrophobicity at ice binding surfaces to type I AFPs. They are approximately 6kD in size.&lt;ref name="Crevel2002" /&gt; Type III AFPs likely evolved from a sialic acid synthase gene present in Antarctic eelpout. Through a gene duplication event, this gene—which has been shown to exhibit some ice-binding activity of its own—evolved into an effective AFP gene.&lt;ref name="Kelley et. al.2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kelley | title = Functional diversification and evolution of antifreeze proteins in the Antarctic fish Lycodichthys dearborni | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 71 | pages = 111–118 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1007/s00239-010-9367-6|display-authors=etal | pmid=20686757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type IV AFPs are found in longhorn sculpins. They are alpha helical proteins rich in glutamate and glutamine.&lt;ref name="Deng1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deng G, Andrews DW, Laursen RA | title = Amino acid sequence of a new type of antifreeze protein, from the longhorn sculpin Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosis | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 402 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–20 |date=January 1997 | pmid = 9013849 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(96)01466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This protein is approximately 12KDa in size and consists of a 4-helix bundle.&lt;ref name="Deng1997" /&gt;  Its only posttranslational modification is a [[pyroglutamate]] residue, a cyclized [[glutamine]] residue at its [[N-terminus]].&lt;ref name="Deng1997" /&gt;

===Plant AFPs===
The classification of AFPs became more complicated when antifreeze proteins from plants were discovered.&lt;ref name="Griffith1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffith M, Ala P, Yang DS, Hon WC, Moffatt BA | title = Antifreeze protein produced endogenously in winter rye leaves | journal = Plant Physiol. | volume = 100 | issue = 2 | pages = 593–6 |date=October 1992 | pmid = 16653033 | pmc = 1075599 | doi = 10.1104/pp.100.2.593| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plant AFPs are rather different from the other AFPs in the following aspects:

#They have much weaker thermal hysteresis activity when compared to other AFPs.&lt;ref name="Griffith and Yaish2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffith M, Yaish MW | title = Antifreeze proteins in overwintering plants: a tale of two activities | journal = Trends Plant Sci. | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 399–405 |date=August 2004 | pmid = 15358271 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2004.06.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Their physiological function is likely in inhibiting the recrystallization of ice rather than in the preventing ice formation.&lt;ref name="Griffith and Yaish2004"/&gt;
#Most of them are evolved [[pathogenesis]]-related proteins, sometimes retaining [[Fungicide|antifungal]] properties.&lt;ref name="Griffith and Yaish2004" /&gt;

''See also [[dehydrin]]''

===Insect AFPs===
There are two types of insect antifreeze proteins, ''Tenebrio'' and ''Dendroides'' AFPs which are both in different insect families. They are similar to one another, both being hyperactive (i.e. greater thermal hysteresis value) and consist of varying numbers of 12- or 13-mer repeats of approximately 8.3 to 12.5 kD. Throughout the length of the protein, at least every sixth residue is a [[cysteine]].&lt;ref name="Duman2001" /&gt; It has recently been discovered that even highly truncated insect AFP (e.g. peptide consisting of just two or three coils) may exhibit ice structuring and thermal hysteresis activities.&lt;ref name="Kong2017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kong CH, Leung IK, Sarojini V | title = Synthetic Insect Antifreeze Peptides Modify Ice Crystal Growth Habit | journal = CrystEngComm | issue =  | pages =  |date=24 Feb 2017 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1039/C7CE00232G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tenebrio'' or Type V AFPs are found in beetles,&lt;ref name="Graham1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graham LA, Liou YC, Walker VK, Davies PL | title = Hyperactive antifreeze protein from beetles | journal = Nature | volume = 388 | issue = 6644 | pages = 727–8 |date=August 1997 | pmid = 9285581 | doi = 10.1038/41908 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''Dendroides'' or ''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'' AFPs are found in some [[Lepidoptera]].

===Sea ice organisms AFPs===
AFPs were also found in microorganisms living in [[sea ice]]. The [[diatom]]s ''Fragilariopsis cylindrus'' and ''F. curta'' play a key role in polar sea ice communities, dominating the assemblages of both platelet layer and within pack ice. AFPs are widespread in these species, and the presence of AFP [[genes]] as a multigene family indicates the importance of this group for the genus ''Fragilariopsis''.&lt;ref name="pmid20105220"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bayer-Giraldi M, Uhlig C, John U, Mock T, Valentin K | title = Antifreeze proteins in polar sea ice diatoms: diversity and gene expression in the genus Fragilariopsis | journal = Environ.

== Evolution ==
The remarkable diversity and distribution of AFPs suggest the different types evolved recently in response to sea level [[glaciation]] occurring 1-2 million years ago in the Northern hemisphere and 10-30 million years ago in Antarctica.  This independent development of similar adaptations is referred to as [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher2001" /&gt;  There are two reasons why many types of AFPs are able to carry out the same function despite their diversity:
# Although ice is uniformly composed of [https://web.archive.org/web/20061121021621/http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1999/january/12/ice1h.jpg oxygen and hydrogen], it has many different surfaces exposed for binding.  Different types of AFPs may interact with different surfaces.
# Although the five types of AFPs differ in their [[primary structure]] of amino acids, when each folds into a functioning protein, they may share similarities in their three-dimensional or [[tertiary structure]] that facilitates the same interactions with ice.&lt;ref name="Fletcher2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9108061"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen L, DeVries AL, Cheng CH | title = Convergent evolution of antifreeze glycoproteins in Antarctic notothenioid fish and Arctic cod | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 94 | issue = 8 | pages = 3817–22 |date=April 1997 | pmid = 9108061 | pmc = 20524 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.8.3817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of action ==
AFPs are thought to inhibit growth by an [[adsorption]]–inhibition mechanism.&lt;ref name="Raymond and DeVries1977"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raymond JA, DeVries AL | title = Adsorption inhibition as a mechanism of freezing resistance in polar fishes | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 2589–93 |date=June 1977 | pmid = 267952 | pmc = 432219 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.6.2589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They adsorb to non[[basal plane]]s of ice, inhibiting thermodynamically favored ice growth.&lt;ref name="Raymond1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raymond JA, Wilson P, DeVries AL | title = Inhibition of growth of non basal planes in ice by fish antifreezes | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

J. | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 2142–51 |date=May 1998 | pmid = 9591641 | pmc = 1299557 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77923-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Binding to ice ==
Normally, ice crystals grown in solution only exhibit the basal (0001) and prism faces (1010), and appear as round and flat discs.&lt;ref name="Jorov2004" /&gt;  However, it appears the presence of AFPs exposes other faces.  It now appears the ice surface 2021 is the preferred binding surface, at least for AFP type I.&lt;ref name="Knight1991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knight CA, Cheng CC, DeVries AL | title = Adsorption of alpha-helical antifreeze peptides on specific ice crystal surface planes | journal = Biophys. J. | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 409–18 |date=February 1991 | pmid = 2009357 | pmc = 1281157 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(91)82234-2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through studies on type I AFP, ice and AFP were initially thought to interact through hydrogen bonding (Raymond and DeVries, 1977).  However, when parts of the protein thought to facilitate this hydrogen bonding were mutated, the hypothesized decrease in antifreeze activity was not observed.  Recent data suggest hydrophobic interactions could be the main contributor.&lt;ref name="pmid9688560"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haymet AD, Ward LG, Harding MM, Knight CA | title = Valine substituted winter flounder 'antifreeze': preservation of ice growth hysteresis | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 430 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–6 |date=July 1998 | pmid = 9688560 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(98)00652-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to discern the exact mechanism of binding because of the complex water-ice interface.  Currently, attempts to uncover the precise mechanism are being made through use of [[molecular modelling]] programs ([[molecular dynamics]] or the [[Monte Carlo method]]).&lt;ref name="Madura2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorov2004" /&gt;

== Binding mechanism and antifreeze function ==

According to the structure and function study on the antifreeze protein from ''[[Winter flounder|Pseudopleuronectes americanus]]'',&lt;ref name=chou&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chou KC | title = Energy-optimized structure of antifreeze protein and its binding mechanism | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 223 | issue = 2 | pages = 509–17 |date=January 1992 | pmid = 1738160 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(92)90666-8| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the antifreeze mechanism of the type-I AFP molecule was shown to be due to the binding to an ice nucleation structure in a zipper-like fashion through hydrogen bonding of the [[hydroxyl group]]s of its four [[Threonine|Thr]] residues to the oxygens along the &lt;math&gt;[01\overline{1}2]&lt;/math&gt; direction in ice lattice, subsequently stopping or retarding the growth of ice pyramidal planes so as to depress the freeze point.&lt;ref name=chou/&gt;

The above mechanism can be used to elucidate the structure-function relationship of other antifreeze proteins with the following two common features:
# recurrence of a [[Threonine|Thr]] residue (or any other polar amino acid residue whose side-chain can form a hydrogen bond with water) in an 11-amino-acid period along the sequence concerned, and
# a high percentage of an [[Alanine|Ala]] residue component therein.&lt;ref name=chou/&gt;

== History ==
In the 1950s, Norwegian scientist Scholander set out to explain how Arctic fish can survive in water colder than the freezing point of their blood. His experiments led him to believe there was “antifreeze” in the blood of Arctic fish.&lt;ref name="Madura2001" /&gt;  Then in the late 1960s, animal biologist Arthur DeVries was able to isolate the antifreeze protein through his investigation of Antarctic fish.&lt;ref name="De Vries and Wohlschlag1969"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeVries AL, Wohlschlag DE | title = Freezing resistance in some Antarctic fishes | journal = Science | volume = 163 | issue = 3871 | pages = 1073–5 |date=March 1969 | pmid = 5764871 | doi = 10.1126/science.163.3871.1073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins were later called antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) or antifreeze glycopeptides to distinguish them from newly discovered nonglycoprotein biological antifreeze agents (AFPs). DeVries worked with Robert Feeney (1970) to characterize the chemical and physical properties of antifreeze proteins.&lt;ref name="DeVries1970"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeVries AL, Komatsu SK, Feeney RE | title = Chemical and physical properties of freezing point-depressing glycoproteins from Antarctic fishes | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 245 | issue = 11 | pages = 2901–8 |date=June 1970 | pmid = 5488456 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, Griffith ''et al.'' documented their discovery of AFP in winter rye leaves. Around the same time, Urrutia, Duman and Knight (1992) documented thermal hysteresis protein in angiosperms. The next year, Duman and Olsen noted AFPs had also been discovered in over 23 species of [[angiosperms]], including ones eaten by humans.&lt;ref name="Duman and Olsen1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duman JG, Olsen TM | year = 1993 | title = Thermal hysteresis protein activity in bacteria, fungi and phylogenetically diverse plants | journal = Cryobiology | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 322–328 | doi = 10.1006/cryo.1993.1031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They reported their presence in fungi and bacteria as well.

== Name change ==
Recent attempts have been made to relabel antifreeze proteins as ice structuring proteins to more accurately represent their function and to dispose of any assumed negative relation between AFPs and automotive antifreeze, [[ethylene glycol]]. These two things are completely separate entities, and show loose similarity only in their function.&lt;ref name="pmid12050776"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke CJ, Buckley SL, Lindner N | title = Ice structuring proteins - a new name for antifreeze proteins | journal = Cryo Letters | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–92 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12050776 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial and medical applications ==
Numerous fields would be able to benefit from the protection of tissue damage by freezing.  Businesses are currently investigating the use of these proteins in:{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

* Therapy for hypothermia

[[Unilever]] has obtained UK approval to use a [[genetically modified]] yeast to produce antifreeze proteins from fish, for use in ice cream production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dairyreporter.com/Regulation-Safety/Unilever-protein-gets-UK-go-ahead|title=Unilever protein gets UK go ahead|date=31 Jul 2007|author=Neil Merrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent news ==
One recent, successful business endeavor has been the introduction of AFPs into ice cream and yogurt products. This ingredient, labelled ice-structuring protein, has been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The proteins are isolated from fish and replicated, on a larger scale, in genetically modified yeast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.impactnottingham.com/2014/09/can-ice-cream-be-tasty-and-healthy/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is concern from organizations opposed to [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs), who belive that antifreeze proteins may cause inflammation.&lt;ref name="Dortch2006"&gt;[http://www.non-gm-farmers.com/news_details.asp?ID=2808 Dortch, Eloise. (2006). Fishy GM yeast used to make ice-cream. Network of Concerned Farmers.

As well, the [[transgenic]] process of ISP production is widely used in society already. [[Insulin]] and [[Rennet#Fermentation-produced chymosin .28FPC.29|rennet]] are produced using this technology. The process does not impact the product; it merely makes production more efficient and prevents the death of fish which would otherwise be killed to extract the protein.

Currently, [[Unilever]] incorporates AFPs into some of its American products, including some [[Popsicle (brand)|Popsicle]] [[ice pop]]s and a new line of [[Breyers]] Light Double Churned ice cream bars. In ice cream, AFPs allow the production of very creamy, dense, reduced fat ice cream with fewer additives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/dining/26cream.html Creamy, Healthier Ice Cream?

An association can be viewed as a real, integrated entity shaped either by species interactions or by similar habitat requirements, or it can be viewed as merely a common point along a continuum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">'''Bloch oscillation''' is a phenomenon from [[solid state physics]]. It describes the oscillation of a particle (e.g. an [[electron]]) confined in a periodic potential when a constant force is acting on it.
It was first pointed out by [[Felix_Bloch|Bloch]] and [[Clarence_Zener|Zener]] while studying the electrical properties of crystals. In particular, they predicted that the motion of electrons in a perfect crystal under the action of a constant [[electric field]] would be oscillatory instead of uniform. While in natural crystals this phenomenon is extremely hard to observe due to the scattering of electrons by lattice defects, it has been observed in semiconductor [[superlattices]] and in different physical systems such as [[ultracold atom|cold atoms]] in an optical potential and ultrasmall [[Josephson junction]]s.

== Derivation ==

The one-dimensional equation of motion for an electron in a constant electric field E is:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar \frac{dk}{dt}=-eE&lt;/math&gt; , 

as was pointed out by '''[[Wave–particle duality|wave-particle duality]]''' and &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; in [[solid state physics]] (rather than &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; in general).

&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}={\operatorname{d}\!\vec{p}\over\operatorname{d}\!t}=\hbar{\operatorname{d}\!\vec{k}\over\operatorname{d}\!t}
&lt;/math&gt;

which has the solution

&lt;math&gt;k(t)=k(0) - \frac{eE}{\hbar} t&lt;/math&gt; .

The velocity v of the electron is given by

&lt;math&gt;v(k)=\frac{1}{\hbar}\frac{d\mathcal{E}}{dk}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(k)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[dispersion relation]] for the given [[energy band]].
Suppose that the latter has the (tight-binding) form

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(k)= A \cos{ak} &lt;/math&gt;,

where a is the lattice parameter and A is a constant. Then v(k) is given by

&lt;math&gt;v(k)=\frac{1}{\hbar}\frac{d\mathcal{E}}{dk}=-\frac{Aa}{\hbar}\sin{ak}&lt;/math&gt; ,

and the electron position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by

&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\int_0^t{v(k(t'))}{dt'}=x(0) -\frac{A}{eE}\cos\left({\frac{aeE}{\hbar}t}\right)&lt;/math&gt; .

This shows that the electron oscillates in real space. The angular frequency of the oscillations is given by &lt;math&gt;\omega_B = ae|E|/\hbar&lt;/math&gt;.

==Discovery and experimental realizations==

Bloch oscillations were predicted by Nobel laureate [[Esaki|Leo Esaki]] in 1970. However, they were not experimentally observed for a long time, because in natural solid-state bodies, &lt;math&gt;\omega_B&lt;/math&gt; is (even with very high electric field strengths) not large enough to allow for full oscillations of the charge carriers within the diffraction and tunneling times, due to relatively small lattice periods. The development in semiconductor technology has recently led to the fabrication of structures with super lattice periods that are now sufficiently large, based on artificial semiconductors. The oscillation period in those structures is smaller than the diffraction time of the electrons, hence more oscillations can be observed in a time window below the diffraction time. For the first time the experimental observation of Bloch oscillations in such super lattices at very low temperatures was shown by [[Jochen Feldmann]] and [[Karl Leo]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leo|first=Karl|last2=Bolivar|first2=Peter Haring|last3=Brüggemann|first3=Frank|last4=Schwedler|first4=Ralf|last5=Köhler|first5=Klaus|title=Observation of Bloch oscillations in a semiconductor superlattice|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=84|issue=10|pages=943–946|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(92)90798-e|bibcode=1992SSCom..84..943L|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other realizations were

A '''bob''' is the weight on the end of a [[pendulum]] found most commonly, but not exclusively, in [[pendulum clock]]s.

== Reason for use ==
Although a pendulum can theoretically be any shape, any rigid object swinging on a [[wikt:pivot|pivot]], clock pendulums are usually made of a weight or ''bob'' attached to the bottom end of a rod, with the top attached to a pivot so it can swing.  The advantage of this construction is that it positions the [[centre of mass]] close to the physical end of the pendulum, farthest from the pivot.  This maximizes the [[moment of inertia]], and minimises the length of pendulum required for a given [[period (physics)|period]].  Shorter pendulums allow the clock case to be made smaller, and also minimize the pendulum's [[air resistance]].  Since most of the energy loss in clocks is due to air friction of the pendulum, this allows clocks to run longer on a given power source.

== Use in clocks ==
[[Image:Old Pendulum clock.jpg|thumb|Pendulum clock with visible bob]]
Traditionally, a pendulum bob is a round flat disk, lens-shaped in [[Cross section (geometry)|section]], but bobs in older clocks often have decorative carving and shapes characteristic of the type of clock. They are usually made of a dense metal such as iron or [[brass]].  [[Lead]] is denser, but is usually avoided because of its softness, which would result in the bob being dented during its inevitable collisions with the inside of the clock case when the clock is moved.

In most pendulum clocks the rate is adjusted by moving the bob up or down on the pendulum rod. Moving it up shortens the pendulum, making it beat more quickly, and causing the clock to gain time.  In the most common arrangement, the bob is attached to the pendulum with an adjustment nut at the bottom, on the threaded end of the pendulum rod.  Turning the nut adjusts the height of the bob.  But some bobs have levers or dials to adjust the height.  In some precision clocks there is a smaller auxiliary weight on a threaded shaft to allow more fine adjustment.  [[Tower clock]]s sometimes have a tray mounted on the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed, to adjust the rate without stopping the clock.

The weight of the bob itself has little effect on the [[Period (physics)|period]] of the pendulum. However, a heavier bob helps to keep the pendulum moving smoothly until it receives its next push from the clock's [[escapement]] mechanism.  That increases the pendulum's [[Q factor]], making the motion of the pendulum more independent of the escapement and the errors it introduces, leading to increased accuracy.  On the other hand, the heavier the bob is the more energy must be supplied by the clock's power source and more friction and wear occurs in the clock's movement.  Pendulum bobs in quality clocks are usually made as heavy as the clock's movement can drive.  A common weight for the bob of a [[seconds pendulum|one second pendulum]], widely used in [[grandfather clock]]s and many others, is around 2 kilograms.

A '''Burgers material''' is a [[viscoelastic]] material which consists of a [[Maxwell material]] and a [[Kelvin material]] in series.  It is named after the Dutch physicist [[Johannes Martinus Burgers]].

Given that the Kelvin material has an elasticity &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and viscosity &lt;math&gt;\eta_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the Maxwell material has an elasticity &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; and viscosity &lt;math&gt;\eta_2&lt;/math&gt;, the Burgers model has the [[constitutive equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma + \left( \frac {\eta_1} {E_1} + \frac {\eta_2} {E_1} + \frac {\eta_2} {E_2} \right) \dot\sigma + 
\frac {\eta_1 \eta_2} {E_1 E_2} \ddot\sigma = \eta_2\dot\varepsilon +
\frac {\eta_1 \eta_2} {E_1} \ddot\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the stress and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malkin|first1=Alexander Ya.|last2=Isayev|first2=Avraam I.|title=Rheology: Concepts, Methods, and Applications|year=2006|publisher=ChemTec Publishing|isbn=9781895198331|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model incorporates viscous flow into the [[standard linear solid model]], giving a linearly increasing asymptote for strain under fixed loading conditions.

'''Coalite''' is a brand of low-temperature [[coke (fuel)|coke]] used as a [[smokeless fuel]].  The title refers to the residue left behind when coal is carbonised at 640 degrees Celsius. It was invented by [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]] in 1904. In 1936 the Smoke Abatement Society awarded its inventor a posthumous gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/genealogy/Parker/Coalite.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602222423/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/genealogy/Parker/Coalite.htm |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalite is darker and more friable than high temperature coke. It is easier to ignite, burns with an attractive flame, and is lighter than coal, making it an ideal fuel for open domestic firegrates. Drawbacks are its tendencies to produce an excessive residual ash, to burn quickly and give off sulphurous fumes.
  
==Carbonisation process==
Coal delivered by rail, first from the nearby Bolsover colliery, and later from other sources, was heated in 8 large air sealed ovens called "batteries".&lt;ref name="Inst"&gt;{{cite book | last = Institution of Mechanical Engineers: Energy, Environment and Sustainability Group | first = | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCu1mC2CN3EC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=Coalite&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3SmW_NaPXL&amp;sig=cBu8Gf0D-prT_m56F_WOGPFlWxY&amp;hl=en#PPA93,M1| title = Engineering for Profit from Waste| publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2002 | pages = 92–93 | isbn = 1-86058-331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Volatile constituents were driven off and condensed into coal oil and a watery fraction called ammoniacal liquor. Coal gas was used to heat the ovens and also burned in the works boilers and furnaces. Any excess was flared off. The coal oil and liquor were piped over the road to the chemical works section where they were processed into various fractions and industrial chemicals.  The residual Coalite solid fuel was cooled, then sorted into various grades based on size and stockpiled for distribution by road transport.

==The Coalite Company==
Two years after [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]] died in 1915, the forerunner of the Coalite company was formed with the building of a production unit at Barugh near Barnsley. In the 20s, two more plants at [[Askern]] near Doncaster and at East Greenwich in London were opened, the latter being operated under license by the South Metropolitan Gas Company.

In April 1937, the main manufacturing plant at Buttermilk Lane, [[Bolsover]] was opened by [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]. At the time it was the largest one of its type in the world.

In 1939, another works was opened at Wern Tarw in South Wales. In the 1950s older plants were closed and production was concentrated at the expanded Bolsover and Askern plants.
Plants were also opened later in [[Rossington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-villager.co.uk/Archives.asp?FILE=19921201003 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306031422/http://www.the-villager.co.uk/Archives.asp?FILE=19921201003 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; near Doncaster, and at [[Grimethorpe]] in South Yorkshire. The coal oil and liquor from all these plants was processed at the central refinery at the Bolsover plant. The ovens continued producing Coalite until the Bolsover works closed down in 2004.

By 1939, the company was producing a low octane petrol called "Coalene" as well as diesel and other fuel oils. It continued to do so through the [[World War II|Second World War]] and into the early 1960s. It supplied fuel to the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]] during the war, reputedly keeping 12 squadrons flying and 2 battleships sailing.

In 1948, the company changed its name to the Coalite Chemical Company to reflect the diversified nature of the business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:2kU6fnBoMJAJ:www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/resources/conversions/DER_BOL_Coalite.pdf]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the registered Head office address was moved from London to Bolsover. In 1956, after the introduction of the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] Coalite was licensed as an "authorised fuel". Demand increased and the company expanded accordingly.

The Group consisted of several companies in the 1950–1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/whoswho/w041.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum - Francis L.

* The Derbyshire Coalite Co.Ltd,            (ran the solid fuel production at Bolsover) 
* The British Diesel Oil &amp; Petrol Co.       (ran the refinery at Bolsover)

* London Coalite Ltd.

In 1978, the company merged with the Charringtons Coke distribution company and with this they acquired the [[Falkland Islands Company]]. From 1984 to 1989 [[Eric Varley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2471396/Lord-Varley-of-Chesterfield.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Lord Varley of Chesterfield | date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ex-[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] cabinet minister was company chairman.

In 1986, the group acquired Hargreaves Fuel distribution services. This marked the zenith of the company's fortunes. The group was now at its most diverse and widespread, owning subsidiaries that were totally unrelated to its core business. These included sheep farming, [[Dormobile]] camper vans, Builders merchants, [[Pyrometer]] Instrument manufacturers, vehicle sales and many others as well as industrial land across the country. From 1987 to 1991, the company sponsored [[Chesterfield F.C.]]

In 1989, the company was taken over by [[Anglo United]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19890525&amp;id=I001AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pKULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6486,1287843 ]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 1992, the company sponsored world class snooker tournaments
 
In 1997, [[FIH group|Falkland Islands Holdings]] subsidiary was floated off and became an independent company again.&lt;ref name="ukbusinesspark.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukbusinesspark.co.uk/cos66659.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331122047/http://www.ukbusinesspark.co.uk/cos66659.htm |archivedate=2007-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The solid fuel side of the business began to shrink in the 1980s. There was falling demand for the product as cheaper natural gas gradually took over the domestic heating market. The Askern works closed in 1986 and Grimethorpe in 1994. After 1982, there were several waves of redundancies.

As well as the reduced demand for solid fuel the slow demise of the company was accelerated after the Anglo takeover. During the 1990s, there were financial difficulties because the relatively small Anglo United had borrowed heavily from [[HSBC]] to buy the much larger Coalite group and had intended to service this debt by [[asset stripping]] Coalite's many subsidiaries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717081053/http://www.alacrastore.com/mergers-acquisitions/Anglo_United_plc-2015346 ]&lt;/ref&gt; selling them off whilst retaining the core business of solid fuel production. The sell-off did not realise as much cash as was required and even a raid on the company pension fund did little to reduce the debt. Weighed down by this debt and with little money for investment the company declined as it faced outside competition in a downturned [[agrochemical]] market. It was making losses of £2 million per annum in the late 90s. At the same time, it was embroiled in legal actions concerning land and river pollution and the resulting adverse publicity affected the sales of its products.

In 2002, Anglo was bought by a consortium of local businessmen. Any viable assets were covertly (but legally) moved into separate subsidiaries under the Anglo holding company. The remaining debts were left with the much diminished Coalite Chemicals Ltd which went into administration and then receivership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2004/05/07/578922/coalite-receiver-in-talks-with-possible-buyer-for-chems.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130126030445/http://www.icis.com/Articles/2004/05/07/578922/coalite-receiver-in-talks-with-possible-buyer-for-chems.html|deadurl=yes|title=Coalite receiver in talks with possible buyer for chems unit-07/05/20…|date=26 January 2013|archivedate=26 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finding no buyers, closed down finally in 2004, leaving a considerable number of redundant employees with much reduced pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookham.com/community/equitable/finalsalarya.htm |title=Wound Up Final Salary Schemes |website=Cookham.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dioxin contamination==
The company gained attention as a manufacturer of the chemical, 245 [[trichlorophenol]], a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[Agent Orange]] which was a [[defoliant]] used in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. An explosion in a pilot plant in 1968 had killed a chemist and spread [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] over the debris. 79 employees contracted [[chloracne]] whilst cleaning up and even some of their families were affected by traces brought home on clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lists.essential.org/1998/dioxin-l/msg00190.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 April 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820034754/http://lists.essential.org/1998/dioxin-l/msg00190.html |archivedate=20 August 2011|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was more controversy when the company appeared reluctant to reveal the location of sites where the contaminated plant debris was buried and when the case notes of an independent investigator were mysteriously stolen from her home.

A specialised 245 unit was built soon after, with stringent controls and safety measures to prevent any future accidents but when the [[Seveso disaster]] in 1976 reawakened public concern over this issue, Ted Needham, the company chairman, deemed it expedient to close down this now uneconomical plant. The reluctance of his employees to work in it may also have influenced his decision.

Problems continued with dioxin emission from the works incinerator which burned residues from the chlorination plant. This caused further public protest and instigated official investigations that culminated in prosecution and a fine of £150,000 for contamination of the [[river Doe Lea]] and surrounding farmland in 1996.&lt;ref name="ukbusinesspark.co.uk"/&gt; In 1994, the river gained the dubious distinction of being the most polluted in the world with regard to dioxins, 27 times higher than the second worst waterway, a Norwegian [[Fjord]] near a Magnesium processing plant. The pollution was believed to extend 13 miles downstream into the [[River Rother, South Yorkshire|River Rother]] and the [[River Don, Yorkshire|River Don]], near Rotherham in South Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schoon|first=Nicholas|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/pollution-watchdog-plans-legal-action-record-level-of-dioxins-in-river-near-coalite-plant-1372618.html|title=Pollution watchdog plans legal action: Record level of dioxins in river near Coalite plant|work=The Independent|date=1994|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure and redevelopment==
The site has been derelict since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broomhead|first=Michael|url=https://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/1-500-new-jobs-derelict-coalite-site-set-for-exciting-transformation-1-7689209|title=1,500 New Jobs: Derelict Coalite site set for exciting transformation|work=Derbyshire Times|date=22 January 2016|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005, the Bolsover works were gradually demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/chesterfield/Bolsover-jobs-hope-site-plans.4215596.jp |title=Bolsover jobs hope site plans go public |work=[[Derbyshire Times]] |date=24 June 2008|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, decontamination of the area began and the [[Environment Agency]] was made aware of an increase in odours from the site after complaints from local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broomhead|first=Michael|url=Environment Agency investigating nasty smells from Coalite site|work=Derbyshire Times|date=17 January 2017|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This final process might have saved the company. Successful trials with existing modified plant showed that large scale reclamation of useful products from used tyres was possible.&lt;ref name="Inst"/&gt; However it came too late to prevent financial collapse. This was attributed by the company to the delayed response of the regulating authorities in granting licenses for the sale of the tyre oil as fuel.

'''Cyclone Herwart''' was a [[European windstorm]] that affected Southern [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Czech Republic]] on 28–29 October 2017. Named by the [[Free University of Berlin]] Meteorology Department,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=de|url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20171028.gif|title=Analysis|publisher=[[Free University of Berlin]]|date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the storm was an [[extratropical cyclone]] formed as a secondary low to a more northerly centre of low pressure named ''Grischa'' coming southward from the [[Svalbard Islands]] region, the latter splitting in two low-pressure areas late on 28 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wz.de/lokales/nrw/wetterdienst-warnt-vor-sturm-grischa-bahn-befuechtet-probleme-1.2544949|title=Wetterdienst warnt vor Sturm "Grischa" - Bahn befüchtet Probleme|date=2017-10-28|work=www.wz.de|access-date=2017-10-30|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center of Herwart started rotating counterclockwise around the main low pressure area, passing over [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Latvia]] and then losing power while moving over western [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=de|url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20171031.gif|title=Analysis|publisher=[[Free University of Berlin]]|date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, which was hit on 28 October, the storm was named ''Ingolf''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vejr.tv2.dk/2017-10-28-stormen-ingolf-rammer-danmark-i-nat|title=Stormen Ingolf rammer Danmark i nat|date=2017-10-28|work=vejr.tv2.dk|access-date=2017-10-30|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, the storm was named ''Nárcisz'' (''Narcissus''), a Hungarian female name whose [[name day]] is on 29 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://24.hu/tudomany/2017/10/30/miert-kapott-kedves-viragnevet-a-hazankban-pusztito-ciklon/|title=Miért kapott kedves virágnevet a hazánkban pusztító ciklon?|date=2017-10-30|work=24.hu|access-date=2017-11-06|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The storm and rainfall caused death and destruction.

Herwart caused disruption to the German energy market as the strong winds caused an over-supply of energy onto the German power grid. Prices for energy slipped into negative values as low as minus €83.06 euros per megawatt hour, with an average low of minus €52.11 (normal energy prices are €37 per megawatt hour). These values were the lowest since Christmas 2012. This can lead to a situation where Austria and Switzerland find it attractive to use the energy in their pumped storage reservoirs, where it can later be sold back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zschäpitz|first1=Holger|title=Strompreise: "Herwart" offenbart Wahnsinn der Energiewende|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/energie/article170189224/Strompreis-Kollaps-durch-Herwart-offenbart-Wahnsinn-der-Energiewende.html|accessdate=9 November 2017|work=DIE WELT|date=31 October 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herwart was not as strong as [[Cyclone Xavier (2017)|Xavier]] which struck Germany earlier in October 2017.&lt;ref name="Schappert"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schappert|first1=Sebastian|title="HERWART" - ein weiterer Herbststurm steht vor der Tür|url=https://www.dwd.de/DE/wetter/thema_des_tages/2017/10/28.html|accessdate=11 December 2017|publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst|date=28 October 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herwart is considered one of the strongest storms of the past 10 years in Germany, ranked in 8th place in strongest storms there in the last decade, but not considered memorable when compared to the strongest storms such as [[Cyclone Kyrill|Kyrill]] (2007) and [[Cyclones Lothar and Martin|Lothar]] (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herold|first1=Christian|title=Thema des Tages - Archiv - Die großen Herbst- und Winterstürme der vergangenen 10 Jahre.|url=https://www.dwd.de/DE/wetter/thema_des_tages/2017/10/30.html|accessdate=11 December 2017|work=www.dwd.de|publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst|date=30 October 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herwart was responsible for the worst insurance losses in the Czech Republic since the storms Kyrill and [[Cyclone Emma (2008)|Emma]] (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Storm Herwart insured loss estimate rising, now EUR 300m: Aon|url=http://www.artemis.bm/blog/2017/11/03/storm-herwart-insured-loss-estimate-rising-now-eur-300m-aon/|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=Artemis.bm - The Catastrophe Bond, Insurance Linked Securities &amp; Investment, Reinsurance Capital, Alternative Risk Transfer and Weather Risk Management Blog|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''December 2003 New England snowstorm''' was a severe [[nor'easter]] that impacted the [[Eastern United States]] during the first week of the month. It produced heavy snowfall throughout the [[New England]] and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] regions, exceeding {{convert|40|in|cm}} in northern [[New England]].&lt;ref name="NWS report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms.met.psu.edu/sref/severe/2003/5-6Dec2003.pdf |title=The Megalopolitan Snow Storm of 5-7 December 2003 |last=Grumm |first=Richard H. |agency=[[National Weather Service]] |location=[[State College, Pennsylvania]] |pages=13 |format=PDF |access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snowfall"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Rank: 2 &amp;#124; 7 December 2003 &amp;#124; Score: 210.21|date=|publisher=Lyndon State College|accessdate=2009-12-11|url=http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/projects/snowstorm/Event02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclone had complex origins, involving several individual weather disturbances. An area of [[low pressure area|low pressure]] primarily associated with the southern branch of the [[jet stream]] spread light precipitation across portions of the [[Midwest U.S.|Midwest]] and [[Southeast U.S.|Southeast]]. The low reached the coast on December 5 and continued to produce snow throughout the Mid-Atlantic. Another system involving the northern branch of the jet stream merged with the initial storm, causing another coastal storm to develop. This storm soon became the primary feature as it intensified and moved northeastward. It reached [[Cape Cod]] on December 6, but became nearly stationary through the morning of December 7.&lt;ref name="met stuff"&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Major Nor'easter: Saturday-Sunday December 6-7, 2003 |date= |publisher=''WRBG CBS 6 Albany'' |accessdate=2009-12-11 |url=http://www.cbs6albany.com/sections/weather/historical/paststorms/2003/Dec6-7-2003_Noreaster.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223113724/http://www.cbs6albany.com/sections/weather/historical/paststorms/2003/Dec6-7-2003_Noreaster.htm |archivedate=2010-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had finally dissipated by December 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Daily Weather Maps for December 8, 2003|publisher=Hydrometeorological Preciction Center|accessdate=2009-12-11|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/dailywxmap/index_20031208.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions surrounding the storm allowed for several bands of heavy snowfall to set up over [[New York State]] and New England, including a small area of {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} per hour snowfall rates in the [[Hudson Valley]]. As a result of extremely cold temperatures over the region, snowfall accumulations were generally significant and broke several daily records. At [[Albany, New York]], {{convert|12.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} of snow fell in just one day. Locations affected by the storm commonly picked up {{convert|17|to|24|in|mm|abbr=on}}, with totals occasionally exceeding {{convert|30|in|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="met stuff"/&gt;

The event led to widespread travel delays from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[Boston]], and around 13 people lost their lives because of the storm. 35.6 of snow inches fell just 14 miles north of Boston in the city of [[Peabody, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="USAtoday"&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press|title=Buried Northeast starts digging|date=December 8, 2003|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=2009-12-11|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2003-12-08-northeast-snowstorm_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nor'easter was among the largest early-season winter storms on record to affect the major East Coast cities.

'''District cooling''' is the cooling equivalent of [[district heating]]. Working on broadly similar principles to district heating, district cooling delivers chilled water to buildings like offices and factories needing cooling. In winter, the source for the cooling can often be sea water, so it is a cheaper resource than using electricity to run compressors for cooling.
Alternatively, District Cooling can be provided by a Heat Sharing Network which enables each building on the circuit to use a heat pump to reject heat to an ambient ground temperature circuit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benuk.net/District-Cooling.html |title=District Cooling Networks: using groundwater to heat or cool buildings with heat pumps. |accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Finland===
The Helsinki district cooling system uses otherwise wasted heat from summer time CHP power generation units to run [[absorption refrigerator]]s for cooling during summer time, greatly reducing electricity usage. In winter time, cooling is achieved more directly using sea water. The adoption of district cooling is estimated to reduce the consumption of electricity for cooling purposes by as much as 90 per cent and an exponential growth in usage is forecast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinginenergia.fi/en/cool/os3_3a.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202064306/http://www.helsinginenergia.fi/en/cool/os3_3a.html |date=February 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is now being adopted in other Finnish cities.

===Sweden===
The use of district cooling grows also rapidly in Sweden in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedishenergyagency.se/web/biblshop.nsf/FilAtkomst/ET2007_49.pdf/$FILE/ET2007_49.pdf?OpenElement |title=Energiläget 2007 |publisher=Swedishenergyagency.se |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Cornell University]]'s Lake Source Cooling System uses [[Cayuga Lake]] as a heat sink to operate the central chilled water system for its campus and to also provide cooling to the Ithaca City School District. The system has operated since the summer of 2000 and was built at a cost of $55–60 million. It cools a 14,500 [[Ton#Refrigeration|tons]] (50 [[megawatt|MW]]) load.

===Switzerland===
Working since 1985, the system of the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] combines, depending on the needs, cooling and heat extraction. This allows for a higher overall energy efficiency of the 19 [[megawatt|MW]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dii.epfl.ch/page-18562-fr.html |title=Real Estate and Infrastructures Department, EPFL |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a district cooling system was installed in the United Nations area of [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]], drawing water from [[Lake Geneva]]. The system is in the process of being expanded to other areas of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sig-ge.ch/en/about-sig/energy/thermal-energy/renewable-cooling |title=SIG. Using lake water to heat or cool. |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In August 2004, Enwave Energy Corporation, a district energy company based in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], started operating a system that uses water from [[Lake Ontario]] to cool downtown buildings, including office towers, the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, a small brewery and a telecommunications centre. The process has become known as [[Deep lake water cooling|Deep Lake Water Cooling]] (DLWC). It will provide for over 40,000 [[Ton#Refrigeration|tons]] (140 [[megawatt|MW]]) of cooling&amp;mdash;a significantly larger system than has been installed elsewhere. Another feature of the Enwave system is that it is integrated with Toronto’s drinking water supply. The Toronto drinking water supply required a new intake location that would be further from shore and deeper in the lake. This posed two problems for the utility that managed the city's drinking water supply: 1. the capital cost of moving the water intake location and additionally, the new location would supply water that was so cold it would require heating before it could be distributed. The cooperation of the district cooling agency, Enwave, solved both problems: Enwave paid for the cost of moving the water intake and also supplied the heat to warm the drinking water supply to acceptable levels by effectively extracting the heat from the buildings it served. Contact between drinking water and the Enwave cooling system is restricted to thermal contact in a heat exchanger. Drinking water does not circulate through the Enwave cooling systems. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===United Arab Emirates===

In January 2006, PAL technology is one of the emerging project management companies in UAE involved in the diversified business of desalination, sewage treatment and district cooling system. More than 400,000 Tons (1400 [[megawatt|MW]]) of district cooling projects are planned. The Palm Jumeirah utilises district cooling supplied by [http://www.palmutilities.ae Palm Utilities LLC] to provide air conditioning for buildings on the trunk and crescent of the Palm. The Dubai Metro system, inaugurated in 2009, is the first mass transit network in the world to use district cooling to lower temperatures in stations and trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-6342-district-cooling-world-first-for-dubai-metro/|title=District cooling world first for Dubai Metro - ConstructionWeekOnline.com|first=Gerhard|last=Hope|website=www.constructionweekonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In 2006, a district cooling system came online in Amsterdam's Zuidas, drawing water from the Nieuwe Meer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycclimatesummit.com/casestudies/water/water_amsterdam.html Lake water air conditioning cuts CO2 emissions by 70% compared to conventional cooling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118161916/http://www.nycclimatesummit.com/casestudies/water/water_amsterdam.html |date=November 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.web-logix.nl/CreativeEnergy/content/visits/folder_Zuidas.pdf |title=District cooling in Amsterdam's Zuidas |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005092738/http://www.web-logix.nl/CreativeEnergy/content/visits/folder_Zuidas.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qatar ===
{{Advert|section|date=October 2014}}
On November 9, 2010, The world's largest district cooling plant opened at [[The Pearl-Qatar]]. This plant is owned and operated by Qatar District Cooling Company (known as [http://www.qatarcool.com Qatar Cool]). It is capable of cooling a load of 130,000 tons (450 [[megawatt|MW]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=397773&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |title=World’s largest district cooling plant opens at The Pearl Qatar |publisher=Gulf-times.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924141529/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=397773&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |archivedate=2012-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plant was Built by C.A.T. group, a Lebanese-International general contractor with vast experience in District Cooling.

The Lusail City district cooling system will supply chilled water to end users through an integrated network with a connected cooling of 500,000 Tons of Refrigeration by utilizing multiple chiller plants which are Marina, Wadi, West and North. This will be one of the largest district cooling systems in the world.

=== Kuwait ===
{{Advert|section|date=May 2014}}
A project started in 2012 in Kuwait for the Sabah Al-Salem University City with district cooling. It is capable of cooling a load of 72000 TR and it has two central utility plants having 36 chillers, 36 cooling towers and 2 TES (Thermal Energy Storage) tank.

Fire rated Remote control Steel Doors. The total project duration is 1810 days.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== Germany ===

In Germany, amongst [[:de:Fernkälte#Anwendungsbeispiele|other projects]],  [[Munich]] established a rapidly growing system in 2011 with its core below the [[Karlsplatz (Stachus)]], drawing water from the underground Stadtgrabenbach. There's a 24km network, currently supplying 16 larger organizations. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/fernkaelte-muenchens-kaltes-herz-1.3506876&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.swm.de/english/m-fernwaerme/m-fernkaelte.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold storage==
If the other renewable alternatives are too warm during the summer or too expensive, cold storage can be investigated. In large scale applications underground and snow storage are the most likely alternatives. In an underground storage the winter cold is heat exchanged from the air and loaded into the bedrock or an aquifer by one or more bore holes. In a snow storage frozen water (snow and/or ice) is saved in some kind of storage (pile, pit, cavern etc.). The cold is utilized by pumping melt water to the cooling object, directly in a district cooling system or indirect by a heat exchanger. The lukewarm melt water is then pumped back to the snow where it gets cooled and mixed with new melt water. Snow cooling works as a single cold source but can also be used for peak cooling since there is no relevant cooling limit.&lt;ref&gt;http://epubl.ltu.se/1402-1544/2005/30/LTU-DT-0530-SE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cooling water treatment|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/water/cooling-water-treatment-services/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden there is one snow cooling plant in Sundsvall, built and owned by the county. The cooling load in Sundsvall is about 2000&amp;nbsp;kW (570 tons of refrigeration) and 1500 MWh/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpower.se/sundsvalls-kylanlaggning_en.asp |title=The Sundsvall snowcooling plant - large scale snowcooling &amp;#124; Snowpower |publisher=Snowpower.se |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dehumidifying==
Especially in subtropical regions not only cooling, but dehumidifying of the air becomes important. Liquid desiccant cooling allows to generate remotely and efficiently a moisture absorbing liquid. This liquid can be pumped or transported long distances without energy loss.

{{Orphan|date=September 2014}}

'''EGTS''' (Electric Green Taxiing System) is an electric taxiing system which allows aircraft to taxi and pushback without requiring the use of aircraft engines, and is designed to reduce fuel volumes used by aircraft and reduce greenhouse gas emissions during ground operations.
EGTS technology enables aircraft to avoid using their main engines during [[taxiing]] and instead taxi autonomously under their own electrical power, using the [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] (APU) generator. The system is designed for single-aisle aircraft, such as the [[Airbus A320]] and the [[Boeing 737]].

== Design ==

EGTS is an electric taxiing system that is used prior to [[takeoff]] and can help airlines reduce cost by eliminating the need to use [[jet engine]]s which are not efficient on the ground. It can also reduce [[foreign object damage]] and is environmentally friendly as it reduce carbon and other emissions created during the taxiing phase. The main landing gear is equipped with an electric motor powered by the [[auxiliary power unit]] which allows the aircraft to push back from the gate and taxi without a tug or its jet engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EGTS brochure|url=http://aerospace.honeywell.com/~/media/EGTS%20Brochure%20FINAL%20-%20June%202014(1).ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system weighs 300&amp;nbsp;kg and is permanently installed on the aircraft.&lt;ref name=AIN18june2013/&gt;
The system can accelerate the aircraft to 20 knots.&lt;ref name=AIN11Feb2014&gt;{{cite news |title= WheelTug, Safran-Honeywell and IAI Offer Three Rival Solutions for Airline Engine-off Taxiing |url= http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2014-02-11/wheeltug-safran-honeywell-and-iai-offer-three-rival-solutions-airline-engine-taxiing |date= 11 February 2014 |work= AIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With electric motors located on each of the main landing gear driving inboard wheels and powered by the APU generator, the EGTS system allows aircraft to push back from the gate without a tug tractor, and taxi without the use of the main engines.

The Pilot Interface Unit enables the pilot to switch on the EGTS and select the desired taxi speed (forward) or push back speed (backwards). The EGTS Controller receives and converts actions into orders to power the electronics.

The wheel actuator applies the required torque and speed proportional to the wheel as per the instructions received from the Wheel Actuator Controller Unit (WACU). The WACU converts current into instructions to the electrical motor proportional to the pilot’s command as delivered by the EGTS Controller.

== Development ==

Electric taxiing was invented by Delos Aerospace in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://delosaerospace.com/about-us |title= What We Do |publisher= Delos Aerospace}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-source-inline|date=September 2018}} and patented in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |number= US7226018 |title= Landing gear method and apparatus for braking and maneuvering  |date= 2006-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honeywell and SAFRAN announced their joint venture EGTS International at the Paris Air Show in 2011.&lt;ref name=AIN18june2013&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/paris-air-show/2013-06-18/honeywell-safran-demo-electric-taxiing-system-airlines |title= Honeywell, Safran Demo Electric Taxiing System For Airlines |author= Bill Carey |date= June 18, 2013 |work= AIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[easyJet]], in collaboration with Honeywell and Safran, announced that it would be the first airline to support the development and trial of the electric green taxiing system (EGTS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EasyJet to Test Electric Plane-Taxiing Gear to Reduce Fuel Burn|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-09/easyjet-to-test-electric-plane-taxiing-gear-to-reduce-fuel-burn.html |agency= Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial phase of ground testing and first move in April 2013, the system was first demonstrated at the Paris Air Show 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Paris Air Show: Aircraft tech that works best on the ground |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22992654 |publisher= BBC |date= 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, [[Air France]] announced its support of the development of the EGTS taxiing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Air France helps to develop the Electric Green Taxiing System|url=http://corporate.airfrance.com/en/press/news/article/item/air-france-helps-to-develop-the-electric-green-taxiing-system/ |publisher= Air France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, [[Airbus]] signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with EGTS International to further develop and evaluate EGTS for the [[A320]] Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Airbus signs MoU with Honeywell and Safran to develop electric taxiing solution for A320 Family|url=https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/about/media-resources/newsroom/airbus-signs-mou-with-honeywell-and-safran-to-develop-electric-taxiing-solution-for-a320-family|publisher= Honeywell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Honeywell and Safran signed a Memorandum of Understanding with [[GoAir]] to support the advancement of the EGTS taxiing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GoAir signs pact with Honeywell, Safran for tech to save fuel|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/goair-signs-pact-with-honeywell-safran-for-tech-to-save-fuel/article5781530.ece |work= [[The Hindu Business Line]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
GoAir will test the system and supply operational data to have an accurate projection of fuel saving to potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/126594/honeywell-amp-safran-sign-mou-for-egts|title=Honeywell &amp; Safran Sign MOU for EGTS|first=Zacks Investment|last=Research|date=|work=Zacks.com|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Mexican airline [[Interjet]] became the first North American airline to announce its support for the advancement of the EGTS taxiing system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Interjet becomes the first american airline to support electric taxiing system|url=http://www.safran-group.com/site-safran-en/press-media/press-releases/2014/article/interjet-becomes-the-first?13819 |publisher= Safran }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Farnborough Air Show]] in July 2016, while the development was successful and customers were interested, Honeywell terminated its joint venture with Safran with low oil prices sapping its market but Safran will continue to work on taxiing systems as system design was completed while its A320 demonstrator had been decommissioned since 2013.&lt;ref name=Flight13July2016&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-honeywell-and-safran-halt-electric-tax-427400/ |title= Honeywell and Safran halt electric taxi project |date= 13 July 2016 |author= Michael Gubisch |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FFKM'''s (by ASTM 1418 standard) (equivalent to '''FFPMs''' by ISO/DIN 1629 standard) are perfluoroelastomeric compounds containing an even higher amount of fluorine than [[FKM]] fluoroelastomers.

==Overview==
FFKMs (by ASTM 1418 standard) (equivalent to '''FFPMs''' by ISO/DIN 1629 standard) are perfluoroelastomeric compounds containing an even higher amount of fluorine than FKM. They have further improved resistance to high temperatures&lt;ref&gt;E. I. DuPont, Kalrez Product Brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; and chemicals and even withstand environments where [[Plasma cleaning|Oxygen-Plasma]] are present for many hours. Certain grades have a maximum continuous service temperature of {{convert|327|C|F}}. They are commonly used to make O-rings and gaskets that are used in applications that involve contact with hydrocarbons or highly corrosive fluids, or when a wide range of temperatures is encountered.

For vacuum applications, demanding very low contamination (out-gassing and particle emission) as well as high temperature operation (200 - 300&amp;nbsp;°C) for prolonged out-baking or processing times and where a copper or metal sealing is not possible or very inconvenient/expensive, a custom-made, clean-room manufactured, sealing such as Kalrez® 9100,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.dupont.com/Kalrez/en_US/pfo/assets/downloads/Kalrez%209100%20for%20Photovoltaic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SCVBR&lt;ref&gt;http://o-ring.info/en/products/by-market/semiconductor-industry/&lt;/ref&gt; or Perlast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prepol.com/product-range/ppe-material-brands/perlast-|title=Perlast Perfluoroelastomer FFKM Seals and O Rings - a Rubber Form of PTFE|website=www.prepol.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used. After manufacturing, they are O-plasma vacuum cleaned (and/or vacuum baked) to reach out-gassing performance similar to [[Teflon]] while reaching vacuum leak tightness ([[Permeation|permeability]] rates) similar to FKM ([[Viton]]) compounds. This combination of properties allows FFKM seals to reach well into UHV pressures without the use of metal sealing. However, they are significantly more expensive than standard FKM O-rings.

Examples are the forces that act on passengers in an accelerating or braking automobile, and the force that pushes objects toward the rim of a centrifuge.

The fictitious force '''F''' is due to an object's inertia when the reference frame does not move inertially, and thus begins to accelerate relative to the free object. The fictitious force thus does not arise from any [[Force carrier|physical interaction]] between two objects (that is, it is not a "contact force"), but rather from the acceleration '''a''' of the [[non-inertial reference frame]] itself, which from the viewpoint of the frame now appears to be an acceleration of the object instead, requiring a "force" to make this happen. As stated by Iro:&lt;ref name=Iro&gt;{{cite book|author=Harald Iro|title=A Modern Approach to Classical Mechanics|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L5ckgdxA5YC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=force+%22non-inertial+%22#PPA180,M1|isbn=981-238-213-5|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coordinate&gt;In this connection, it may be noted that a change in coordinate system, for example, from Cartesian to polar, if implemented without any change in relative motion, does not cause the appearance of fictitious forces, despite the fact that the form of the laws of motion varies from one type of curvilinear coordinate system to another.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Such an additional force due to nonuniform relative motion of two reference frames is called a ''pseudo-force''.|H. Iro in ''A Modern Approach to Classical Mechanics'' p. 180}}
Assuming [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] in the form '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''a''', fictitious forces are always proportional to the mass ''m''.

The fictitious force on an object arises as an imaginary influence, when the frame of reference used to describe the object's motion is accelerating compared to a non-accelerating frame. The fictitious force "explains," using Newton's mechanics, why an object does not follow Newton's laws and "floats freely" as if weightless. As a frame can accelerate in any arbitrary way, so can fictitious forces be as arbitrary (but only in direct response to the acceleration of the frame).  However, four fictitious forces are defined for frames accelerated in commonly occurring ways: one caused by any relative acceleration of the origin in a straight line (rectilinear [[acceleration]]);&lt;ref&gt;The term ''d'Alembert force'' often is limited to this case. See Lanczos, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; two involving rotation: [[centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]]; and a fourth, called the [[Euler force]], caused by a variable rate of rotation, should that occur. 

[[Gravitational field|Gravitational force]] would also be a fictitious force based upon a field model in which particles distort [[spacetime]] due to their mass, such as [[General Relativity]].

==Background==
{{See also| Absolute space and time|Preferred frame}}
The role of fictitious forces in Newtonian mechanics is described by [[Marie-Antoinette Tonnelat|Tonnelat]]:&lt;ref name=Tonnelat&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Electromagnetic Theory and Relativity |author=Marie-Antoinette Tonnelat |year=2002 |publisher=Springer |isbn=90-277-0107-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2KICGm9TbUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=equivalence+%22covariant+law%22#PPA113,M1 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|For Newton, the appearance of acceleration always indicates the existence of absolute motion – absolute motion of matter where ''real'' forces are concerned; absolute motion of the reference system, where so-called ''fictitious'' forces, such as inertial forces or those of Coriolis, are concerned.|Marie-Antoinette Tonnelat in ''The Principles of Electromagnetic Theory and Relativity'', p. 113}}

Fictitious forces arise in [[classical mechanics ]] and [[special relativity]] in all non-inertial frames.&lt;ref name="Ferraro"&gt;{{cite|title=Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|first1=Rafael|last1=Ferraro|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2007|isbn=9780387699462}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|10}} Inertial frames are [[preferred frame|privileged]] over non-inertial frames because they do not have physics whose causes are outside of the system, while non-inertial frames do.&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|209}} Fictitious forces, or physics whose cause is outside of the system, are no longer necessary in [[general relativity]],&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|215&amp;mdash;223}} since these physics are explained with the [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]] of [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Mach's Principle II|first1=James G.|last1=Gilson|date=September 1, 2004|arxiv=physics/0409010|bibcode=2004physics...9010G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictitious forces on Earth==
{{See also|Centrifugal force|Coriolis force|Euler force}}
The surface of the Earth is a [[rotating reference frame]]. To solve [[classical mechanics]] problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the [[Coriolis force]], the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] (described below) and the [[Euler force]]. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, but they can be detected under careful conditions. For example, [[Léon Foucault]] used his [[Foucault pendulum]] to show that a [[Coriolis force]] results from the Earth's rotation. If the Earth were to rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily get the impression that such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel; people in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.

==Detection of non-inertial reference frame==
{{See also|Inertial frame of reference}}
Observers inside a closed box that is moving with a constant [[velocity]] cannot detect their own motion; however, observers within an accelerating reference frame can detect that they are in a non-inertial reference frame from the fictitious forces that arise. For example, for straight-line acceleration [[Vladimir Arnold]] presents the following theorem:&lt;ref name="Arnolʹd"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pd8-s6rOt_cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Mathematical+intitle:Methods+intitle:of+intitle:Classical+intitle:Mechanics#PPA129,M1|author=Vladimir Igorevich Arnold |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-96890-3 |year=1989 |pages=§27 pp. 129 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|In a coordinate system ''K'' which moves by translation relative to an inertial system ''k'', the motion of a mechanical system takes place as if the coordinate system were inertial, but on every point of mass ''m'' an additional "inertial force" acted: '''F'''&amp;nbsp;{{=}} −''m'''''a''', where '''a'''  is the acceleration of the system ''K''.}}
Other accelerations also give rise to fictitious forces, as described mathematically [[#Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces|below]]. The physical explanation of motions in an inertial frame is the simplest possible, requiring no fictitious forces: fictitious forces are zero, providing a means to distinguish inertial frames from others.&lt;ref name=transformations&gt;As part of the requirement of simplicity, to be an inertial frame, in all other frames that differ only by a uniform rate of translation, the description should be of the same form. However, in the Newtonian system the [[Galilean transformation]] connects these frames and in the special theory of relativity the [[Lorentz transformation]] connects them. The two transformations agree for speeds of translation much less than the [[speed of light]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the detection of a non-inertial, rotating reference frame is the precession of a [[Foucault pendulum]]. In the non-inertial frame of the Earth, the fictitious [[Coriolis force]] is necessary to explain observations. In an inertial frame outside the Earth, no such fictitious force is necessary.

==Examples of fictitious forces==

===Acceleration in a straight line===
[[Image:Accelerating car.PNG|thumb|350px|Figure 1: ''Top panel'': accelerating car of mass ''M'' with passenger of mass ''m''. The force from the axle is (''m'' + ''M'')'''a'''. In the inertial frame, this is the only force on the car and passenger.&lt;br /&gt; ''Center panel'': an exploded view in the inertial frame. The passenger is subject to the accelerating force ''m'''''a'''. The seat (assumed of negligible mass) is compressed between the reaction force –''m'''''a''' and the applied force from the car ''m'''''a'''. The car is subject to the net acceleration force ''M'''''a''' that is the difference between the applied force (''m'' + ''M'')'''a''' from the axle and the reaction from the seat −''m'''''a'''. &lt;br /&gt;''Bottom panel'': an exploded view in the non-inertial frame. In the non-inertial frame where the car is not accelerating, the force from the axle is balanced by a fictitious backward force −(''m'' + ''M'')'''a''', a portion −''M'''''a''' applied to the car, and −''m'''''a''' to the passenger. The car is subject to the fictitious force −''M'''''a''' and the force (''m'' + ''M'')'''a''' from the axle. The sum of these forces ''m'''''a''' is applied to the seat, which exerts a reaction −''m'''''a''' upon the car, so zero net force is applied to the car. The seat (assumed massless) transmits the force ''m'''''a''' to the passenger, who is subject also to the fictitious force −''m'''''a''', resulting in zero net force on the passenger. The passenger exerts a reaction force −''m'''''a''' upon the seat, which is therefore compressed. In all frames the compression of the seat is the same, and the force delivered by the axle is the same.]]
Figure 1 (top) shows an accelerating car. When a car [[acceleration|accelerates]], a passenger feels like they're being pushed back into the seat. In an inertial frame of reference attached to the road, there is no physical force moving the rider backward. However, in the rider's non-inertial reference frame attached to the accelerating car, there ''is'' a backward fictitious force. We mention two possible reasons for the force to clarify its (the force's) existence:&lt;ref name=Motz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concepts of Science: From Newton to Einstein |author1=Lloyd Motz |author2=Jefferson Hane Weaver |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnufjnGnqD8C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=history+velocity+%22law+of+inertia%22#PPA101,M1|page=101 |isbn=0-7382-0834-5 |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Figure 1 (center panel). To an observer at rest on an  [[inertial reference frame]] (like the ground), the car will seem to accelerate. In order for the passenger to stay inside the car, a force must be exerted on the passenger. This force is exerted by the seat, which has started to move forward with the car and is compressed against the passenger until it transmits the full force to keep the passenger moving with the car. Thus, the forces exerted by the seat are unbalanced,so the passenger is accelerating in this frame.
# Figure 1 (bottom panel). From the point of view of the interior of the car, an accelerating reference frame, there is a fictitious force pushing the passenger backwards, with magnitude equal to the [[mass]] of the passenger times the acceleration of the car. This force pushes the passenger back into the seat, until the seat compresses and provides an equal and opposite force. Thereafter, the passenger is stationary in this frame, because the fictitious force and the real force of the seat are balanced.

How can the accelerating frame be discovered to be non-inertial? In the accelerating frame, everything appears to be subject to zero net force, and nothing moves. Nonetheless, compression of the seat is observed and is explained in the accelerating frame (and in an inertial frame) by the force of acceleration on the seat from the car on one side, and the opposing force of reaction to acceleration by the passenger on the other. Identification of the accelerating frame as non-inertial cannot be based simply on the compression of the seat, which all observers can explain; rather it is based on the ''simplicity'' of the physical explanation for this compression.

The explanation of the seat compression in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from the axle of the car, but additional (fictitious) forces. In an inertial frame, only the thrust from the axle is necessary. Therefore, the inertial frame has a ''simpler'' physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the inertial frame, fictitious forces are zero. See [[inertial frame]] for more detail.

This example illustrates how fictitious forces arise from switching from an inertial to a non-inertial reference frame. Calculations of physical quantities (compression of the seat, required force from the axle) made in any frame give the same answers, but in some cases calculations are easier to make in a non-inertial frame. (In this simple example, the calculations are equally complex for the two frames described.)

===Circular motion===
{{See also|Centrifugal force|Coriolis force}}
A similar effect occurs in [[circular motion]], circular from the standpoint of an inertial frame of reference attached to the road. When seen from a non-inertial frame of reference attached to the car, the fictitious force called the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] appears.  If the car is moving at constant speed around a circular section of road, the occupants will feel pushed outside by this centrifugal force, away from the center of the turn.  Again the situation can be viewed from inertial or non-inertial frames:

# From the viewpoint of an inertial reference frame stationary with respect to the road, the car is accelerating toward the center of the circle. This acceleration is necessary because the ''direction'' of the velocity is changing, despite a constant speed. This inward acceleration is called [[centripetal acceleration]] and requires a [[centripetal force]] to maintain the circular motion.  This force is exerted by the ground upon the wheels, in this case thanks to the [[friction]] between the wheels and the road.&lt;ref&gt;The force in this example is known as ''[[Ground reaction force|ground reaction]],'' and it could exist even without friction, for example, a sled running down a curve of a bobsled track.&lt;/ref&gt; The car is accelerating, due to the unbalanced force, which causes it to move in a circle. (See also [[banked turn]].)
# From the viewpoint of a rotating frame, moving with the car, there is a fictitious centrifugal force that tends to push the car toward the outside of the road (and to push the occupants toward the outside of the car). The centrifugal force balances the friction between wheels and road, making the car stationary in this non-inertial frame.

A classic example of fictitious force in circular motion is the experiment of [[Centrifugal force#Rotating identical spheres|rotating spheres]] tied by a cord and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain the tension in the string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.

To consider another example, where a rotating reference frame is very natural to us, namely the surface of the rotating Earth, centrifugal force reduces the apparent force of gravity by about one part in a thousand, depending on latitude. This reduction is zero at the poles, maximum at the equator.

From the map frame perspective, what's dangerous on losing centripetal acceleration may be your speed.  From the spin frame perspective, the danger instead may lie with the geometric acceleration which gives rise to that fictitious force.''Note:'' With some browsers, you can hit [Esc] to freeze the motion for more detailed analysis.

The fictitious [[Coriolis force]], which is observed in rotational frames, is ordinarily visible only in very large-scale motion like the projectile motion of long-range guns or the circulation of the Earth's atmosphere (see [[Rossby number]]). Neglecting air resistance, an object dropped from a 50-meter-high tower at the [[equator]] will fall 7.7 millimeters eastward of the spot below where it is dropped because of the Coriolis force.&lt;ref name=Kleppner&gt;{{cite book |author1=Daniel Kleppner |author2=Robert J. Kolenkow |year=1973 |title=  An Introduction to Mechanics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page= 363 |isbn=0-07-035048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of distant objects and a rotating reference frame, what must be taken into account is the resultant force of centrifugal and Coriolis force. Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent centripetal acceleration. Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious centripetal force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in centripetal direction. The vector sum of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in centripetal direction.

===Fictitious forces and work===
Fictitious forces can be considered to do [[Mechanical work|work]], provided that they move an object on a [[trajectory]] that changes its [[energy]] from [[potential energy|potential]] to [[kinetic energy|kinetic]]. For example, consider a person in a rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, from the perspective of the rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.

==Gravity as a fictitious force==
{{Main article|General relativity}}
The notion of "fictitious force" comes up in Einstein's general theory of relativity.&lt;ref name=Rohrlich&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical charged particles |author=Fritz Rohrlich |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJrPrP6L6tQC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=acceleration+transformation+formula+%22Coriolis+force%22#PPA40,M1|isbn=981-270-004-8 |year=2007 |publisher=World Scientific |location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephani&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity |author=Hans Stephani |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAW-4nd-OeIC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=acceleration+transformation+formula+%22Coriolis+force%22#PPA105,M1|page=105 |isbn=0-521-01069-1 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; All fictitious forces are proportional to the mass of the object upon which they act, which is also true for [[gravity]].&lt;ref name="Eötvös"&gt;The gravitational mass and the inertial mass are found experimentally to be equal to within experimental error.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led [[Albert Einstein]] to wonder whether gravity was a fictitious force as well. He noted that a [[freefall]]ing observer in a closed box would not be able to detect the force of gravity; hence, freefalling reference frames are equivalent to an inertial reference frame (the [[equivalence principle]]). Following up on this insight, Einstein was able to formulate a theory with gravity as a fictitious force; attributing the apparent acceleration of gravity to the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]]. This idea underlies Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. See [[Eötvös experiment]].

Let the position of the particle in frame B be '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). What is the force on the particle as expressed in the coordinate system of frame B? &lt;ref name=Fetter&gt;{{cite book |author1=Alexander L Fetter |author2=John D Walecka |title=Theoretical Mechanics of Particles and Continua |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olMpStYOlnoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:theoretical+intitle:mechanics+inauthor:fetter#PPA32,M1 |year=2003 |isbn=0-486-43261-0 |pages=33–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lim&gt;{{cite book |title=Problems and Solutions on Mechanics: Major American Universities Ph.D. Qualifying Questions and Solutions |author1=Yung-kuo Lim |author2=Yuan-qi Qiang |isbn=981-02-1298-4 |page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93b3cjVJ2l4C&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=%22Coriolis+force%22+-snippet+date:1990-2008|publisher=World Scientific |location=Singapore|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To answer this question, let the coordinate axis in B be represented by unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; with ''j'' any of {&amp;thinsp;1,&amp;thinsp;2,&amp;thinsp;3&amp;thinsp;} for the three coordinate axes. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B} = \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \mathbf{u}_j \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The interpretation of this equation is that '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the vector displacement of the particle as  expressed in terms of the coordinates in frame B at time ''t''. From frame A the particle is located at:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_\mathrm{A} =\mathbf{X}_\mathrm{AB} +  \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \mathbf{u}_j \ . &lt;/math&gt;

As an aside, the unit vectors {&amp;thinsp;'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;} cannot change magnitude, so derivatives of these vectors express only rotation of the coordinate system B. On the other hand, vector '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; simply locates the origin of frame B relative to frame A, and so cannot include rotation of frame B.

Taking a time derivative, the velocity  of the particle is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{A}}{dt} =\frac{d \mathbf{X}_\mathrm{AB}}{dt} + \sum_{j=1}^3 \frac{dx_j}{dt} \mathbf{u}_j + \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The second term summation is the velocity of the particle, say '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; as measured in frame B. That is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{A}}{dt} =\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{AB}+ \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B} + \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt}. &lt;/math&gt;

The interpretation of this equation is that the velocity of the particle seen by observers in frame A consists of what observers in frame B call the velocity, namely '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, plus two extra terms related to the rate of change of the frame-B coordinate axes. One of these is simply the velocity of the moving origin '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;. The other is a contribution to velocity due to the fact that different locations in the non-inertial frame have different apparent velocities due to rotation of the frame; a point seen from a rotating frame has a rotational component of velocity that is greater the further the point is from the origin.

To find the acceleration, another time differentiation provides:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d^2 \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{A}}{dt^2} = \mathbf{a}_\mathrm{AB}+\frac {d\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B}}{dt} + \sum_{j=1}^3 \frac {dx_j}{dt} \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the same formula already used for the time derivative of '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, the velocity derivative on the right is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B}}{dt} =\sum_{j=1}^3 \frac{d v_j}{dt} \mathbf{u}_j+ \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} =\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} + \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt}. &lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|Eq. 1}}Consequently,
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \frac {d^2 \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{A}}{dt^2}=\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{AB}+\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} + 2\ \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

The interpretation of this equation is as follows: the acceleration of the particle in frame A consists of what observers in frame B  call the particle acceleration '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, but in addition there are three acceleration terms related to the movement of the frame-B coordinate axes: one term related to the acceleration of the origin of frame B, namely '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;, and two terms related to rotation of frame B. Consequently, observers in B will see the particle motion as possessing "extra" acceleration, which they will attribute to "forces" acting on the particle, but which observers in A say are "fictitious" forces arising simply because observers in B do not recognize the non-inertial nature of frame B.

The factor of two in the Coriolis force arises from two equal contributions: (i) the apparent change of an inertially constant velocity with time because rotation makes the direction of the velocity seem to change (a ''d'''''v'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'' term) and (ii) an apparent change in the velocity of an object when its position changes, putting it nearer to or further from the axis of rotation (the change in &lt;math&gt;\sum x_j\, d\mathbf{u}_j/dt&lt;/math&gt; due to change in ''x &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ).

To put matters in terms of forces, the accelerations are multiplied by the particle mass:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{A} = \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{B} + m\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{AB}+ 2m \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + m \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

The force observed in frame B, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m'''''a'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is related to the actual force on the particle, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{B} = \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{A} + \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{fictitious},&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{fictitious} = -m\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{AB} - 2m\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} - m \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we can solve problems in frame B by assuming that Newton's second law holds (with respect to quantities in that frame) and treating '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;fictitious&lt;/sub&gt; as an additional force.&lt;ref name="Arnolʹd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Mechanics |author=John Robert Taylor |location=Sausalito CA |isbn=1-891389-22-X |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn=1-891389-22-X#PPA343,M1 |publisher=University Science Books|pages=343–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kleppner, pages 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are a number of examples applying this result for fictitious forces. More examples can be found in the article on [[centrifugal force]].

===Rotating coordinate systems===
A common situation in which noninertial reference frames are useful is when the reference frame is rotating. Because such rotational motion is non-inertial, due to the acceleration present in any rotational motion, a fictitious force can always be invoked by using a rotational frame of reference. Despite this complication, the use of fictitious forces often simplifies the calculations involved.

To derive expressions for the fictitious forces, derivatives are needed for the apparent time rate of change of vectors that take into account time-variation of the coordinate axes. If the rotation of frame 'B' is represented by a vector '''Ω''' pointed along the axis of rotation with orientation given by the [[right-hand rule]], and with magnitude given by

:&lt;math&gt; |\boldsymbol{\Omega} | = \frac {d \theta }{dt} = \omega (t), &lt;/math&gt;

then the time derivative of any of the three unit vectors describing frame B is&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example, {{cite book |author1=JL Synge |author2=BA Griffith |title=Principles of Mechanics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=2nd |year=1949 |pages=348–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d  \mathbf{u}_j (t)}{dt} = \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{u}_j (t), &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2  \mathbf{u}_j (t)}{dt^2}= \frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \mathbf{u}_j +\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j (t)}{dt} = \frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \mathbf{u}_j+ \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left[  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times  \mathbf{u}_j (t) \right], &lt;/math&gt;

as is verified using the properties of the [[vector cross product]]. These derivative formulas now are applied to the relationship between acceleration in an inertial frame, and that in a coordinate frame rotating with time-varying angular velocity ω(''t''). From the previous section, where subscript A refers to the inertial frame and B to the rotating frame, setting '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 to remove any translational acceleration, and focusing on only rotational properties (see [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d^2 \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{A}}{dt^2}=\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} + 2\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \ \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{A} = \mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} +\ 2\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{u}_j (t) +    \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \mathbf{u}_j  \  + \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left[  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{u}_j (t) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} + 2 \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \mathbf{u}_j (t) + \frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \mathbf{u}_j + \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left[\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j  \mathbf{u}_j (t) \right].&lt;/math&gt;
Collecting terms, the result is the so-called ''acceleration transformation formula'':&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Mechanics: An Undergraduate Text |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAfUQmQbzOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22rigid+body+kinematics%22#PRA1-PA475,M1
|author=R. Douglas Gregory |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-82678-0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK |pages=Eq. (17.16), p. 475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{A}=\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} + 2\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B} + \frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B} + \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B} \right)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[proper acceleration|physical acceleration]] '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; due to what observers in the inertial frame A call ''real external forces'' on the object is, therefore, not simply the acceleration '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; seen by observers in the rotational frame B, but has several additional geometric acceleration terms associated with the rotation of B. As seen in the rotational frame, the acceleration '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; of the particle is given by rearrangement of the above equation as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} = \mathbf{a}_\mathrm{A} - 2\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B} - \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times (\boldsymbol\Omega \times   \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B})  - \frac{d \boldsymbol\Omega}{dt} \times \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The net force upon the object according to observers in the rotating frame is '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m'''''a'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.  If their observations are to result in the correct force on the object when using Newton's laws, they must consider that the additional force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;fict&lt;/sub&gt; is present, so the end result is '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; + '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;fict&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, the fictitious force used by observers in B to get the correct behavior of the object from Newton's laws equals:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{fict}}  = - 2 m \boldsymbol\Omega  \times \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B} - m \boldsymbol\Omega  \times (\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B}) - m \frac{d \boldsymbol\Omega}{dt} \times \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Orbiting coordinate systems===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
[[Image:Orbiter.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 3: An orbiting but fixed orientation coordinate system ''B'', shown at three different times. The unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, j = 1, 2, 3 do ''not'' rotate, but maintain a fixed orientation, while the origin of the coordinate system ''B'' moves at constant angular rate ω about the fixed axis '''Ω'''. Axis '''Ω''' passes through the origin of inertial frame ''A'', so the origin of frame ''B'' is a fixed distance ''R'' from the origin of inertial frame ''A''.]]
As a related example, suppose the moving coordinate system ''B'' rotates in a circle of radius ''R'' about the fixed origin of inertial frame ''A'', but maintains its coordinate axes fixed in orientation, as in Figure 3. The acceleration of an observed body is now (see [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d^2 \mathbf{x}_{A}}{dt^2}=\mathbf{a}_{AB}+\mathbf{a}_{B} + 2\ \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \ \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;+ \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \ \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\ . &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\mathbf{a}_{AB}\ +\mathbf{a}_B\ , &lt;/math&gt;
where the summations are zero inasmuch as the unit vectors have no time dependence. The origin of system ''B'' is located according to frame ''A'' at:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}_{AB} = R \left( \cos ( \omega t) , \ \sin (\omega t) \right)  \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
leading to a velocity of the origin of frame ''B'' as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{AB} = \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{X}_{AB} = \mathbf{\Omega \times X}_{AB} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

leading to an acceleration of the origin of ''B'' given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{AB} = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \mathbf{X}_{AB} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= \mathbf{ \Omega \ \times }  \left( \mathbf{ \Omega \times X}_{AB}\right) &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;=   - \omega^2 \mathbf{X}_{AB} \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Because the first term, which is
::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ \Omega \ \times }  \left( \mathbf{ \Omega \times X}_{AB}\right)\ , &lt;/math&gt;
is of the same form as the normal centrifugal force expression:
::::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{x}_B \right)\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
it is a natural extension of standard terminology (although there is no standard  terminology for this case) to call this term a "centrifugal force". Whatever terminology is adopted, the observers in frame ''B''  must introduce a fictitious force, this time due to the acceleration from the orbital motion of their entire coordinate frame, that is radially outward away from the center of rotation of the origin of their coordinate system:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{fict}} = m \omega^2 \mathbf{X}_{AB} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and of magnitude:
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{fict}}| = m \omega^2 R \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that this "centrifugal force" has differences from the case of a rotating frame. In the rotating frame the centrifugal force is related to the distance of the object from the origin of frame ''B'', while in the case of an orbiting frame, the centrifugal force is independent of the distance of the object from the origin of frame ''B'', but instead depends upon the distance of the origin of frame ''B'' from ''its'' center of rotation, resulting in the ''same'' centrifugal fictitious force for ''all'' objects observed in frame ''B''.

===Orbiting and rotating===
[[Image:Center-facing orbiting coordinate system.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 4: An orbiting coordinate system ''B'' similar to Figure 3, but in which unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, j = 1, 2, 3 rotate to face the rotational axis, while the origin of the coordinate system ''B'' moves at constant angular rate ω about the fixed axis '''Ω'''.]]
As a combination example, Figure 4 shows a coordinate system ''B'' that orbits inertial frame ''A'' as in Figure 3, but the coordinate axes in frame ''B'' turn so unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; always points toward the center of rotation. This example might apply to a test tube in a centrifuge, where vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; points along the axis of the tube toward its opening at its top. It also resembles the Earth-Moon system, where the Moon always presents the same face to the Earth.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;However, the Earth-Moon system rotates about its [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]], not the Earth's center; see {{cite book |author=Simon Newcomb |title=Popular Astronomy |page=307 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VS7aS8QS91oC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=centrifugal+revolution+and+rotation+date:1970-2009|isbn=1-4067-4574-X |year=2007 |publisher=Read Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; retains a fixed orientation, while vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotate at the same rate as the origin of coordinates. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1 = (-\cos \omega t ,\ -\sin \omega t )\ ;\  &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_2 = (\sin \omega t ,\ -\cos \omega t ) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{u}_1 = \mathbf{\Omega \times u_1}= \omega\mathbf{u}_2\ ;&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt; \ \frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{u}_2 = \mathbf{\Omega \times u_2} = -\omega\mathbf{u}_1\ \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, the acceleration of a moving object is expressed as (see [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d^2 \mathbf{x}_{A}}{dt^2}=\mathbf{a}_{AB}+\mathbf{a}_B + 2\ \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \ \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;+\ \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \ \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\  &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\mathbf{ \Omega \ \times }  \left( \mathbf{ \Omega \times X}_{AB}\right) +\mathbf{a}_B + 2\ \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j\ \mathbf{\Omega \times u_j}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt; \  +\  \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j\ \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{u}_j \right)\ &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\mathbf{ \Omega \ \times }  \left( \mathbf{ \Omega \times X}_{AB}\right) + \mathbf{a}_B + 2\ \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times\mathbf{v}_B\ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt; \  +\  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{x}_B \right)\ &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\mathbf{ \Omega \ \times }  \left( \mathbf{ \Omega \times} (\mathbf{ X}_{AB}+\mathbf{x}_B) \right) + \mathbf{a}_B  + 2\ \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times\mathbf{v}_B\  \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the angular acceleration term is zero for constant rate of rotation.
Because the first term, which is
::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ \Omega \ \times }  \left( \mathbf{ \Omega \times} (\mathbf{ X}_{AB}+\mathbf{x}_B) \right)\ , &lt;/math&gt;
is of the same form as the normal centrifugal force expression:
::::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{x}_B \right)\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
it is a natural extension of standard terminology (although there is no standard  terminology for this case) to call this term the "centrifugal force". Applying this terminology to the example  of a tube in a centrifuge, if the tube is far enough from the center of rotation, |'''X'''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;| = ''R'' ≫ |'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;|, all the matter in the test tube sees the same acceleration (the same centrifugal force).  Thus, in this case, the fictitious force is primarily a uniform centrifugal force along the axis of the tube, away from the center of rotation, with a value |'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;Fict&lt;/sub&gt;| = ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''R'', where ''R'' is the distance of the matter in the tube from the center of the centrifuge. It is standard specification of a centrifuge to use the "effective" radius of the centrifuge to estimate its  ability to provide centrifugal force. Thus, a first estimate of centrifugal force in a centrifuge can be based upon the distance of the tubes from the center of rotation, and corrections applied if needed.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite book |title=Constitutive and Centrifuge Modelling: Two Extremes |author1=Bea K Lalmahomed |author2=Sarah Springman |author3=Bhawani Singh |isbn=90-5809-361-1 |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJkz_IBZZS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=centrifuge#PPT102,M1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nen&gt;{{cite book |title=Consolidation of Soils: Testing and Evaluation: a Symposium |author=Raymond Nen |isbn=0-8031-0446-4 |year=1986 |publisher=ASTM International |page=590 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-BKqGTXA6kC&amp;pg=PA590&amp;dq=radius+centrifuge+effective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the test tube confines motion to the direction down the length of the tube, so '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is opposite to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the Coriolis force is opposite to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, against the wall of the tube. If the tube is spun for a long enough time, the velocity '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; drops to zero as the matter comes to an equilibrium distribution. For more details, see the articles on [[sedimentation]] and the [[Lamm equation]].

A related problem is that of centrifugal forces for the Earth-Moon-Sun system, where three rotations appear: the daily rotation of the Earth about its axis, the lunar-month rotation of the Earth-Moon system about their center of mass, and the annual revolution of the Earth-Moon system about the Sun. These three motions influence the [[tides]].&lt;ref name=Appleton&gt;{{cite book |title=The Popular Science Monthly |year=1877 |author=D Appleton |page=276 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YO0KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=rotation+revolution+%22centrifugal+force%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rider on the carousel walks radially across it at constant speed, in what appears to the walker to be the straight line path inclined at 45° in Figure 5. To the stationary observer, however, the walker travels a spiral path. The points identified on both paths in Figure 5 correspond to the same times spaced at equal time intervals. We ask how two observers, one on the carousel and one in an inertial frame, formulate what they see using Newton's laws.

====Inertial observer====
The observer at rest describes the path followed by the walker as a spiral. Adopting the coordinate system shown in Figure 5, the trajectory is described by '''r'''(''t''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(t) =R(t)\mathbf{u}_R = \begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ y(t) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} R(t)\cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \\ R(t)\sin (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;
where the added π/4 sets the path angle at 45° to start with (just an arbitrary choice of direction), '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is a unit vector in the radial direction pointing from the center of the carousel to the walker at time ''t''.  The radial distance ''R''(''t'') increases steadily with time according to:
:&lt;math&gt;R(t) = s t,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''s'' the speed of walking. According to simple kinematics, the velocity is then the first derivative of the trajectory:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t) = \frac{dR}{dt} \begin{bmatrix} \cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \\ \sin (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix} + \omega R(t) \begin{bmatrix} -\sin(\omega t + \pi/4) \\ \cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{dR}{dt} \mathbf{u}_R + \omega R(t) \mathbf{u}_{\theta}, &lt;/math&gt;
with '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; a unit vector perpendicular to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; at time ''t'' (as can be verified by noticing that the vector [[dot product]] with the radial vector is zero) and pointing in the direction of travel.
The acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(t) = \frac{d^2 R}{dt^2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \\ \sin (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix} + 2 \frac {dR}{dt} \omega \begin{bmatrix} -\sin(\omega t + \pi/4) \\ \cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix} - \omega^2 R(t) \begin{bmatrix} \cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \\ \sin (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=2s\omega \begin{bmatrix} -\sin(\omega t + \pi/4) \\ \cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix} -\omega^2 R(t) \begin{bmatrix} \cos (\omega t + \pi/4) \\ \sin (\omega t + \pi/4) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=2s\ \omega \   \mathbf{u}_{\theta}-\omega^2 R(t)\ \mathbf{u}_R  \ . &lt;/math&gt;
The last term in the acceleration is radially inward of magnitude ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''R'', which is therefore the instantaneous [[centripetal force|centripetal acceleration]] of [[circular motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Anchor|Note1}}'''Note''': There is a subtlety here: the distance ''R'' is the instantaneous distance from the rotational axis ''of the carousel''. However, it is not the [[osculating circle|radius of curvature]] ''of the walker's trajectory'' as seen by the inertial observer, and the unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is not perpendicular to the path. Thus, the designation "centripetal acceleration" is an approximate use of this term. See, for example, {{cite book |title=[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]] |author=Howard D. Curtis |isbn=0-7506-6169-0 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2005 |page=5 }} and
{{cite book |title=Accelerator physics |author=S. Y. Lee |page= 37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTc8Sdld5S8C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;vq=curvature&amp;dq=orbit+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=981-256-182-X |publisher=World Scientific |location=Hackensack NJ |edition=2nd |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The first term is perpendicular to the radial direction, and pointing in the direction of travel. Its magnitude is 2''s''ω, and it represents the acceleration of the walker as the edge of the carousel is neared, and the arc of circle traveled in a fixed time increases, as can be seen by the increased spacing between points for equal time steps on the spiral in Figure 5 as the outer edge of the carousel is approached.

Applying Newton's laws, multiplying the acceleration by the mass of the walker, the inertial observer concludes that the walker is subject to two forces: the inward, radially directed centripetal force, and another force perpendicular to the radial direction that is proportional to the speed of the walker.

====Rotating observer====
The rotating observer sees the walker travel a straight line from the center of the carousel to the periphery, as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, the rotating observer sees that the walker moves at a constant speed in the same direction, so applying Newton's law of inertia, there is ''zero'' force upon the walker. These conclusions do not agree with the inertial observer. To obtain agreement, the rotating observer has to introduce fictitious forces that appear to exist in the rotating world, even though there is no apparent reason for them, no apparent gravitational mass, electric charge or what have you, that could account for these fictitious forces.

To agree with the inertial observer, the forces applied to the walker must be exactly those found above. They can be related to the general formulas already derived, namely:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{fict}} =
- 2 m \boldsymbol\Omega  \times \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B} - m \boldsymbol\Omega  \times (\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B} ) - m \frac{d \boldsymbol\Omega}{dt} \times \mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In this example, the velocity seen in the rotating frame is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{B} = s \mathbf{u}_R, &lt;/math&gt;
with '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; a unit vector in the radial direction. The position of the walker as seen on the carousel is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_\mathrm{B} = R(t)\mathbf{u}_R, &lt;/math&gt;
and the time derivative of '''Ω''' is zero for uniform angular rotation. Noticing that
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Omega  \times \mathbf{u}_R =\omega \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \ &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Omega  \times \mathbf{u}_{\theta} =-\omega \mathbf{u}_R \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
we find:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{fict}}  = - 2 m \omega s \mathbf{u}_{\theta} + m \omega^2 R(t) \mathbf{u}_R.
&lt;/math&gt;
To obtain a [[straight-line motion]] in the rotating world, a force exactly opposite in sign to the fictitious force must be applied to reduce the net force on the walker to zero, so Newton's law of inertia will predict a straight line motion, in agreement with what the rotating observer sees. The fictitious forces that must be combated are the [[Coriolis force]] (first term) and the [[centrifugal force]] (second term). (These terms are approximate.&lt;ref&gt;A circle about the axis of rotation is not the [[osculating circle]] of the walker's trajectory, so "centrifugal" and "Coriolis" are approximate uses for these terms. [[#Note1|See note]].&lt;/ref&gt;) By applying forces to counter these two fictitious forces, the rotating observer ends up applying exactly the same forces upon the walker that the inertial observer predicted were needed.

Because they differ only by the constant walking velocity, the walker and the rotational observer see the same accelerations. From the walker's perspective, the fictitious force is experienced as real, and combating this force is necessary to stay on a straight line radial path holding constant speed. It's like battling a crosswind while being thrown to the edge of the carousel.

===Observation===
Notice that this [[kinematics|kinematical]] discussion does not delve into the mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That is the subject of [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]]. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.

While almost every [[weighing scale]] uses the same basic principle (the gravitational force exerted by an object divided by the area the force is applied on), industrial weighing scales are designed to do a lot more. They handle heavier loads, often in different conditions, both environmental and physical.

The terminology applied to different industrial weighing systems is widely ranged, with some terms adapted specifically for them, which are included in this glossary.  Modern scales are electronic, and often computer-networked; consequently, the field has imported a fair amount of terminology from [[electrical engineering]] and [[Computer networking|computerized data transfer]].

'''Herbig–Haro '''('''HH''')''' objects''' are turbulent looking patches of [[nebula|nebulosity]] associated with newborn [[star]]s. They are formed when narrow jets of partially [[ionized gas]] ejected by said stars collide with nearby clouds of gas and dust at speeds of several hundred kilometres per second. Herbig–Haro objects are ubiquitous in [[Star formation#Stellar nurseries|star-forming regions]], and several are often seen around a single star, aligned with its [[axis of rotation|rotational axis]]. Most of them lie within about one [[parsec]] of the source, although some have been observed several parsecs away. HH objects are transient phenomena that last around a few tens of thousand years. They can change visibly over quite short timescales of a few years as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds of interstellar space (the [[interstellar medium]] or ISM). [[Hubble Space Telescope]] observations have revealed the complex evolution of HH objects over the period of a few years, as parts of the nebula fade while others brighten as they collide with the clumpy material of the interstellar medium.

First observed in the late 19th century by [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham]], Herbig–Haro objects were not recognised as being a distinct type of [[emission nebula]] until the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were [[George Herbig]] and [[Guillermo Haro]], after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of [[star formation]] when they first analysed the objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process.

Although HH objects are a visible wavelength phenomena, many remain invisible at these wavelengths due to  dust and gas envelope and are only visible at infrared wavelengths. Such objects, when observed in near infrared, are called MHOs.

==Discovery and history of observations==
[[Image:HH1 and HH2 imaged by WFPC2.jpg|thumb|left|HH objects HH1 and HH2 lie about a [[light year]] apart, symmetrically flanking a young star which is ejecting material along its polar axis|alt=HH1 and HH2 both appear like turbulence in red-green smoke. The top of each object is bright bluish, due to impacting jet material.]]
The first HH object was observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, when he observed the star [[T Tauri]] with the {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} [[refracting telescope]] at [[Lick Observatory]] and noted a small patch of nebulosity nearby.&lt;ref name=Burnham1890/&gt; However, it was catalogued merely as an [[emission nebula]], later becoming known as [[Burnham's Nebula]], and was not recognised as a distinct class of object.&lt;ref name="Reipurth1997"/&gt; T Tauri was found to be a very young and variable star, and is the prototype of the class of similar objects known as [[T Tauri star]]s which have yet to reach a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] between [[gravitational collapse]] and energy generation through [[nuclear fusion]] at their centres.&lt;ref name="Caroll2014"/&gt;

Fifty years after Burnham's discovery, several similar nebulae were discovered which were so small as to be almost star-like in appearance. Both Haro and Herbig made independent observations of several of these objects in the [[Orion Nebula]] during the 1940s. Herbig also looked at Burnham's Nebula and found it displayed an unusual [[stellar spectrum|electromagnetic spectrum]], with prominent [[emission line]]s of [[hydrogen]], [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]]. Haro found that all the objects of this type were invisible in [[infrared]] light.&lt;ref name="Reipurth1997"/&gt;
[[File:Protostar HH-34.jpg|thumb|This three-colour composite of the young object HH34 reveals the jet and the nebular emission.|alt=Yellow-green emission cap produced by red jet from a star in a deep green nebula]]
Following their independent discoveries, Herbig and Haro met at an astronomy [[academic conference|conference]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[Arizona]] in December 1949. Herbig had initially paid little attention to the objects he had discovered, being primarily concerned with the nearby stars, but on hearing Haro's findings he carried out more detailed studies of them. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Viktor Ambartsumian]] gave the objects their name (Herbig–Haro objects, normally shortened to HH objects), and based on their occurrence near young stars (a few hundred thousand years old), suggested they might represent an early stage in the formation of T Tauri stars.&lt;ref name="Reipurth1997"/&gt;

Studies of the HH objects showed they were highly [[ionization|ionized]], and early theorists speculated that they were [[reflection nebulae]] containing low-luminosity hot stars deep inside. However, the absence of infrared radiation from the nebulae meant there could not be stars within them, as these would have emitted abundant infrared light. In 1975 American astronomer [[R. D. Schwartz]] theorized that winds from T Tauri stars produce shocks in ambient medium on encounter, resulting in generation of visible light.&lt;ref name="Reipurth1997"/&gt;

With discovery of collimated jet in HH 46/47, it became clear that HH objects are indeed shock induced phenomenon with shocks being driven by collimated jet from [[protostars]].&lt;ref name="Reipurth1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dopita1982/&gt;

==Formation==
{{main|Star formation|Astrophysical jet}}
[[Image:HH object diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright|Schematic diagram of how HH objects arise|alt=Drawing shows two arrows of matter movign outwards in opposite directions from a star-disk system, and creating bright emission caps at the ends, where they collide with the surrounding medium]]
Stars form by gravitational collapse of [[Interstellar cloud|interstellar gas clouds]]. As the collapse increases the density, [[radiation|radiative energy]] loss decreases due to increased [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]. This raises the temperature of the cloud which prevents further collapse, and a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] is established. Gas continues to fall towards the core in a [[accretion disk|rotating disk]]. This is called a [[protostar]].&lt;ref name="Dina2000"/&gt; Some of the accreting material is ejected out along the star's [[axis of rotation]] in two [[astrophysical jet|jets]] of partially-ionized gas ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]).
[[File:Cosmic Lightsaber in Orion.jpg|thumb|In this image of HH24, similarities with the above schematic can be seen.|alt=Grey-yellow bipolar jet emerges from a star obscured by grey, furry-looking dust clouds
]]

The mechanism for producing these [[collimation|collimated]] bipolar [[astrophysical jet|jets]] is not entirely understood, but it is believed that interaction between the [[accretion disk]] and the [[stellar magnetic field]] accelerates some of the accreting material from within a few [[astronomical units]] of the star away from the disk plane. At these distances the outflow is divergent, with fanning out at an angle in the range of 10−30°, but it becomes increasingly [[collimation|collimated]] at distances of tens to hundreds of astronomical units from the source, as its expansion is constrained.&lt;ref name="JBally2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frank2014/&gt; The jets also carry away the excess [[angular momentum]] resulting from accretion of material onto the star, which would otherwise cause the star to rotate rapidly and disintegrate.&lt;ref name=Frank2014/&gt; When these jets collide with the interstellar medium, they give rise to the small patches of bright [[Emission spectrum|emission]] which comprise HH objects.&lt;ref name="J. Bally 1996"/&gt;

==Properties==
Electromagnetic emission from HH objects is caused when [[shock wave]]s collide with the [[interstellar medium]], creating what is called the "terminal working surfaces".&lt;ref name="ReipurthBally2001"/&gt; Spectroscopic observations of their [[doppler shift]]s indicate velocities of several hundred kilometres per second, but the emission lines in those [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] are weaker than what would be expected from such high speed collisions. This suggests that some of the material they are colliding with is also moving along the beam, although at a lower speed.&lt;ref name=Dopita1978/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz1983"/&gt; Spectroscopic observations of HH objects show they are moving away from the source stars at speeds of several hundred km/s.&lt;ref name="Reipurth1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heathcote1998"/&gt; In recent years, the high [[optical resolution]] of Hubble Space Telescope has revealed the [[proper motion]] of many HH objects in observations spaced several years apart.&lt;ref name="Hartigan2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raga2016"/&gt; As they move away from the parent star, HH objects evolve significantly, varying in brightness on timescales of a few years. Individual knots within an object may brighten and fade or disappear entirely, while new knots have been seen to appear.&lt;ref name="Reipurth1997"/&gt; This is because of the [[precession]] of the jets&lt;ref name="Zealey1992"/&gt; and their pulsating, rather than steady, eruption from the parent stars.&lt;ref name="J. Bally 1996"/&gt; Faster jets catch up with earlier slower jets, creating the so-called "internal working surfaces", where streams of gas collide and generate shock waves and consequently emissions.&lt;ref name="Raga2017"/&gt;
[[File:HH30.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Hubble Space Telescope images of HH30 over a period of five years. Discontinuities in the jet are caused by the pulsating nature of the eruptions. Variations in brightness can also be noted.|alt=Three images of orange appearing disk-jet system from 1995, 1998 and 2000. Images differ slightly in brightness and jet appearance.]]

The total mass being ejected to form typical HH objects is estimated to be of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Solar mass|{{Solar mass}}]] per year,&lt;ref name="Zealey1992"/&gt; a very small amount of material compared to the mass of the stars themselves&lt;ref name="brugel"/&gt; but amounts to about 1–10% of the total mass accreted in a year.&lt;ref name="Hartigan1994"/&gt; Mass loss tends to decrease with increasing age of the source.&lt;ref name=Bally2007/&gt; The temperatures observed in HH objects are typically about 8000–12,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], similar to those found in other ionized nebulae such as [[H II region]]s and [[planetary nebula]]e. Densities, on the other hand, are higher than in other nebulae, ranging from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to generally less than 1000/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in H II regions and planetary nebulae.&lt;ref name="Bacciotti 1999"/&gt;

Densities also decrease as the source evolves over time.&lt;ref name=Bally2007/&gt; HH objects consist mostly of hydrogen and [[helium]], which account for about 75% and 24% of their mass respectively. Around 1% of the mass of HH objects is made up of heavier [[chemical element]]s, including [[oxygen]], [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]], [[iron]], [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]]. Abundances of these elements, determined from emission lines of respective ions, are generally similar to their [[cosmic abundance]]s.&lt;ref name="brugel"/&gt; Many chemical compounds found in surrounding interstellar medium, but not present in the source material, such as [[metal hydrides]], are believed to have been produced by shock induced chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="JBally2016"/&gt;

Near to the source star, about 20–30% of the gas in HH objects is ionized, but this proportion decreases at increasing distances. This implies the material is ionized in the polar jet, and recombines as it moves away from the star, rather than being ionized by later collisions.&lt;ref name="Bacciotti 1999"/&gt; Shocking at the end of the jet can re-ionize some material, however, giving rise to bright "caps" at the ends of the jets.

HH objects are named in order of their discovery; HH1 and HH2 being the earliest such objects to be identified.&lt;ref name=HerbigCat/&gt; About 500 individual objects are now known.&lt;ref name=Wu2002/&gt; They are ubiquitous in star-forming H II regions, and are often found in large groups.&lt;ref name="J. Bally 1996"/&gt; They are typically observed near [[Bok globule]]s ([[dark nebula]]e which contain very young stars) and often emanate from them. Several HH objects have been seen near a single energy source, forming a string of objects along the line of the [[rotation#Astronomy|polar axis]] of the parent star.&lt;ref name="JBally2016"/&gt;

The number of known HH objects has increased rapidly over the last few years, but that is a very small proportion of the estimated up to 150,000 in the [[Milky Way]],&lt;ref name=Giulbudagian1984/&gt; the vast majority of which are too far away to be resolved. Most HH objects lie within about one [[parsec]] of their parent star. Many, however, are seen several parsecs away.&lt;ref name=Bally2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacciotti 1999"/&gt;

[[HH 47|HH46/47]] is located about 450 parsecs away and is powered by [[Protostar#Observed classes of young stars|class I protostar]] [[Binary star|binary]]. Bipolar jet is slamming into the surrounding medium at a velocity of 300&amp;nbsp;km/s, producing two emission caps about 2.6 parsecs apart. Jet outflow is accompanied by a 0.3 parsec long molecular gas outflow which is swept up by the jet itself.&lt;ref name="JBally2016"/&gt; Infrared studies by [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] have revealed a variety of chemical compounds in the molecular outflow, including [[water]] ([[ice]]), [[methanol]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]] ([[dry ice]]) and various [[silicates]].&lt;ref name="JBally2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spitzeroutflow/&gt;

Located around 460 parsecs away in Orion nebula, [[HH 34|HH34]] is produced by a highly collimated bipolar jet powered by class I protostar. Matter in the jet is moving at about 220&amp;nbsp;km/s. Two bright bow shocks, separated by about 0.44 parsec, are present on the opposite sides of the source, followed by series of fainter ones at larger distances, making the whole complex about 3 parsecs long. Jet is surrounded by 0.3 parsec long weak molecular outflow near the source.&lt;ref name="JBally2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HH342002/&gt;

==Source stars==
[[Image:Herbig-Haro object HH32.jpg|thumb|left|Herbig–Haro object HH32 is one of the brightest HH objects|alt=HH32 looks just like a star due to its intense brightness. The surrounding gas appears like clouds around a full moon]]

The stars from which HH jets are emitted are all very young stars, few tens of thousands to about a million years old. Youngest of these are still protostars in the process of collecting from their surrounding gases. Astronomers divide these stars into classes 0, I, II and III, according to how much infrared radiation the stars emit.&lt;ref name=Reidel1985/&gt; A greater amount of infrared radiation implies a larger amount of cooler material surrounding the star, which indicates it is still coalescing. The numbering of the classes arises because class 0 objects (the youngest) were not discovered until classes I, II and III had already been defined.&lt;ref name="Andre1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKee2007"/&gt;

Class 0 objects are only a few thousand years old, so young that they are not yet undergoing nuclear fusion reactions at their centres. Instead, they are powered only by the [[gravitational potential energy]] released as material falls onto them.&lt;ref name=Andre1993/&gt; Nuclear fusion has begun in the cores of Class I objects, but gas and dust are still falling onto their surfaces from the surrounding nebula, and most of luminosity is accounted for by gravitational energy. They are generally still shrouded in dense clouds of dust and gas, which obscure all their [[visible light]] and as a result can only be observed at infrared and [[radio]] wavelengths. The in-fall of gas and dust has largely finished in Class II objects (Classical T Tauri stars), but they are still surrounded by disks of dust and gas, while class III objects (Weak-line T Tauri stars) have only trace remnants of their original accretion disk.&lt;ref name="Stahler2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKee2007"/&gt;

About 80% of the stars giving rise to HH objects are in fact [[binary star|binary]] or multiple systems (two or more stars orbiting each other), which is a much higher proportion than that found for low mass stars on the [[main sequence]]. This may indicate that binary systems are more likely to generate the jets which give rise to HH objects, and evidence suggests the largest HH outflows might be formed when multiple star systems disintegrate.&lt;ref name="Reipurth2000"/&gt; It is thought that most stars originate from multiple star systems, but that a sizable fraction are disrupted before they reach the main sequence by [[gravitation]]al interactions with nearby stars and dense clouds of gas.&lt;ref name=Reipurth2004/&gt;

==Infrared counterparts==
[[Image:Orion-jet-JHH2.jpg|thumb|Infrared image of molecular bow shocks (MHO 27) associated with [[bipolar outflow]]s in Orion. Credit: UKIRT/Joint Astronomy Centre|alt=At infrared wavelengths MHO27 looks like mix of violet, orange, yellow and turquoise clouds]]

HH objects associated with very young stars or very massive protostars are often hidden from view at optical wavelengths by the cloud of gas and dust from which they form. The intervening material can diminish the visual magnitude by factors of tens or even hundreds at optical wavelengths. Such deeply embedded objects can only be observed at infrared or radio wavelengths,&lt;ref name=Davis1995/&gt; usually in the frequencies of hot molecular hydrogen or warm carbon monoxide emission.&lt;ref name=Giannini2006/&gt;

In recent years, infrared images have revealed dozens of examples of "infrared HH objects". Most look like bow waves (similar to the waves at the head of a ship), and so are usually referred to as molecular "bow shocks". The physics of infrared bow shocks can be understood in much the same way as that of HH objects, since these objects are essentially the same&amp;nbsp;– supersonic shocks driven by collimated jets from the opposite poles of a protostar.&lt;ref name="MHOcat"/&gt; It is only the conditions in the jet and surrounding cloud that are different, causing infrared emission from molecules rather than optical emission from atoms and ions.&lt;ref name=Smith2003/&gt;

In 2009 the acronym "MHO", for Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Object, was approved for such objects, detected in near infrared, by the [[International Astronomical Union]] Working Group on Designations, and has been entered into their on-line Reference Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects.&lt;ref name="MHOcat"/&gt; The MHO catalogue (see external links below) contains over 2000 objects.

'''Cyclone mitigation''' encompasses the actions and planning taken before a [[tropical cyclone]] strikes to mitigate damage and injury from the storm.   Knowledge of tropical cyclone impacts on an area help plan for future possibilities.  Preparedness may involve preparations made by individuals as well as centralized efforts by governments or other organizations.  Tracking storms during the tropical cyclone season helps individuals know current threats.  Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers provide current information and forecasts to help individuals make the best decision possible.

{{Main article|Effects of tropical cyclones}}
Tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves, [[heavy rain (meteorology)|heavy rain]], [[flood]] and high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks.&lt;ref name="18cva"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Roth, David  |author2=Cobb, Hugh  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=Eighteenth Century Virginia Hurricanes|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=February 24, 2007|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/va18hur.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On land, strong [[wind]]s can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The [[storm surge]], or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.&lt;ref name="Shultz Epid Reviews 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxi011| title = Epidemiology of Tropical Cyclones: The Dynamics of Disaster, Disease, and Development| journal = Epidemiologic Reviews| volume = 27| pages = 21–35| year = 2005| last1 = Shultz | first1 = J.

The broad rotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone, and vertical [[wind shear]] at its periphery, spawns [[History of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes|tornadoes]]. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of [[eyewall mesovortices]], which persist until landfall.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ L6"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Are TC tornadoes weaker than midlatitude tornadoes? |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/L6.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914103006/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/L6.html |archivedate=September 14, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past two centuries, tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1.9&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in [[Emergency shelter|shelters]] increase the risk of disease propagation.&lt;ref name="Shultz Epid Reviews 2005"/&gt; Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name="Shultz Epid Reviews 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Power failures"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|date=August 30, 2005|title=Hurricane Katrina Situation Report #11|publisher=Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) [[United States Department of Energy]]|accessdate=February 24, 2007|url=http://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/docs/katrina/katrina_083005_1600.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 or greater. However, category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burroughs|first=William James|title=Climate change : a multidisciplinary approach|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-87015-3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.&lt;ref name="2005 EPac outlook"&gt;[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

Tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values.&lt;ref name="Christopherson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopherson, Robert W.|year=1992|title=Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography|pages=222–224|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-02-322443-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean, salt is introduced to many freshwater areas and raises the [[salinity]] levels too high for some habitats to withstand. Some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the ocean, but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it. Because of this, some species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Thomas|title=Wind damage and Salinity Effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on Coastal Baldcypress Forests of Louisiana|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1306/pdf/c1306_ch6_f.pdf|accessdate=February 13, 2014|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, hurricanes can carry [[toxins]] and [[acids]] onto shore when they make landfall. The flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over.  The toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area, as well as the environment around them. The flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cappielo|first=Dina|title=Spills from hurricanes stain coast With gallery - Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/news/hurricanes/article/Spills-from-hurricanes-stain-coast-With-gallery-1915858.php|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=February 12, 2014|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent windstorm activity, in the [[United States]] in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, has focused interest in measures that can be used to lower the likelihood of damage to structures. Billions of dollars of damages have resulted from such strong [[wind]]s and the manner in which structures have been built in the affected areas in the [[United States]].  Some building codes address mitigation measures. For example, the Florida Building Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridabuilding.org/c/default.aspx |title=Florida Building Code Online |publisher=Floridabuilding.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifies the type of nail used to secure roof sheathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ihrc.fiu.edu/research/projects/hurricane-loss-reduction/|title = Hurricane Loss Reduction for Residences and Mobile Homes in Florida|publisher = Florida International University|date = |accessdate = 2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification was determined by scientific research conducted by [[Florida International University]]'s International Hurricane Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ihrc.fiu.edu/|title = International Hurricane Research Center|publisher = Ihrc.fiu.edu|date = |accessdate = 2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many lessons learned about individual preparedness since Hurricane Katrina. The biggest responsibility was helping the children of New Orleans. Supplies were sufficient until there was more damage than the hospitals were prepared for. People were afraid that their safety was in danger due to lack of security and support at hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolan|first1=Margaret A.|last2=Krug|first2=Steven E.|title="Pediatric Disaster Preparedness in the Wake of Katrina: Lessons to be Learned."|journal=Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine|date=2006|volume=7|issue=1|pages=59–66|doi=10.1016/j.cpem.2006.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important decision in individual preparedness is determining if and when to evacuate an area that will be affected by a tropical cyclone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/disaster_prevention.shtml National Hurricane Center - "Be Prepared"]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tropical cyclone tracking chart]]s allow people to track ongoing systems to form their own opinions regarding where the storms are going and whether or not they need to prepare for the system being tracked, including possible evacuation.  This continues to be encouraged by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and National Hurricane Center.&lt;ref name="FTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/for_fun/FollowthatHurricane.pdf|title=Follow That Hurricane!|author=National Ocean Service|author-link=National Ocean Service|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2017-06-02|date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some agencies provide track storms in their immediate vicinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php/forecast-division/tropical-cyclone/vanuatu-cyclone-tracking-map|title=Vanuatu Cyclone Tracking Map|date=2017|accessdate=2017-06-04|author=Vanuatu Meteorology &amp; Geo-Hazards Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others cover entire ocean basins.  One can choose to track one storm per map, use the map until the table is filled, or use one map per season.  Some tracking charts have important contact information in case of an emergency or to locate nearby hurricane shelters.&lt;ref name="BTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://la.water.usgs.gov/publications/pdfs/PAR_2000-1.pdf|title=East Baton Rouge Parish Hurricane Response Map|date=2000|accessdate=2017-06-04|author=East Baton Rouge Parish Office of Emergency Management|publisher=Louisiana Section of the [[United States Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tracking charts allow tropical cyclones to be better understood by the end user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-use-a-hurricane-tracking-chart-3443976|title=How to Use a Hurricane Tracking Chart|first=Tiffany|last=Means|date=2016-05-18|accessdate=2017-06-03|publisher=Thought Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If evacuation is not possible or necessary, other preparedness actions include storing supplies, securing a home against extreme winds and rain, and making plans with others prior to the storm's landfall.

Hurricane preparedness kits usually include drinkable water, sealed pre-prepared meals [[MRE]], [[first-aid]] kits, prescription medications in sealed containers, waterproof battery-powered or hand-crank-powered flashlights and radios, a whistle or other sound-signaling device, a [[multi-tool]] with a knife, identification and medical cards, any necessary medical records, waterproof bags or portable waterproof containers, and other supplies helpful to a survival situation. If your pets will be with you make sure you include canned or dry food for them as well(any dry food included should be rotated every 2 months).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bounceenergy.com/docs/2016-be-hurricane-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; You should also include veterinarian records and proof of vaccinations for all of your pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bounceenergy.com/blog/2016/08/keep-your-pets-safe-during-hurricane/|title=How To Keep Your Pets Safe During a Hurricane [Infographic]|website=Bounce Energy Blog|access-date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparedness also may include having discussed evacuation plans and routes, and informing others of those plans before a disaster occurs.

Evacuation to hurricane shelters is an option of last resort{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Shelter space is first-come, first-served and only intended preserve human life. Buildings designated as shelters in Florida are required to only have been constructed to meet minimum code requirements applicable at the time of design{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Some shelters are expected to protect occupants from wind and water but are not expected to provide food, water, sanitation, or bedding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridadisaster.org/Response/engineers/documents/2006SRR/2006-SRR-Chapt5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on preparedness of the people in a region, the preparedness level was greatly affected by the salary, race, age, etc. Many people are not prepared for the worst-case scenario, but they should be. Being prepared for a huge disaster is what will ultimately save your life if worse comes to worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Earl J.|title=Household preparedness for the Aftermath of Hurricanes in Florida|journal=Applied Geography|date=2011|volume=31|issue=1|pages=46–52|doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2010.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitals are needed to be prepared in advance for huge natural disasters. Nurses are in high demand when people are in trouble. They need to be prepared for ready for any situation that enters the hospital. After hurricanes such as Katrina and Rita, nurses are needed to be fully capable of any possible scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donohue|first1=Rebecca|title=What Important Changes Have Been Made in Your Practice's Emergency Preparedness Plan Since Hurricane Katrina?|journal=ONS Connect|date=September 2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home retrofitting==
An important decision a homeowner should make is to locate the building outside of range from the coast that is exposed to [[storm surge]]. Regardless of protection from the effects of wind, a building can be flooded or destroyed by storm surge waters.

To mitigate the effects of high winds and associated debris impact, the home can be examined out by an experienced [[hurricane mitigation]] professional. Many [[hurricane]] protection companies offer free consultations as part of their marketing strategy. The State of Florida has taken steps to help its homeowners in the area of hurricane preparedness through its My Safe Florida Home grant program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysafefloridahome.com/ |title=(program expired on June 30, 2009) |publisher=My Safe Florida Home |date=2002-07-22 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Qualified homeowners receive a free in-home assessment of their home's hurricane readiness. The state matches funds spent by the homeowner, up to a $5,000 limit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

When making these types of home improvements, there are two major areas of focus: the roof and the openings.

Homes may be retrofitted to withstand the extreme conditions of a tropical cyclone. Common modifications include reinforcing [[gabled roofs]], applying additional adhesives to [[roof shingles]], installing [[hurricane straps]] and clips to ensure the roof stays in place despite high winds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/retrofit/secure_home.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Hurricane resistant [[Hurricane shutter|shutters]], as well as impact resistant glass may help keep windows closed from driving rain, despite flying debris.

External patio and pool screen enclosures are especially vulnerable during a hurricane. A homeowner who anticipates sustained winds greater than 100 mph may use a razor knife taped to a telescopic pole to cut down the screens from the enclosure's skeleton structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpatioscreens.com/hurricane.html|title=Screen enclosure repair from Hurricane Matthew|website=Pool Enclosures West Palm Beach {{!}} Screen Enclosures West Palm Beach {{!}} Palm Beach Patio Screens|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will prevent the screens from acting as a sail and pulling down the entire enclosure structure.

Reinforcing garage doors and entry doors is also common practice for hurricane preparing a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disastersafety.org/ibhs-news-releases/ibhs-provides-top-5-recommendations-reduce-property-damage-hurricanes/|title=IBHS Provides Top 5 Recommendations to Reduce Property Damage from Hurricanes - IBHS|date=2015-05-20|language=English|access-date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garage doors may be protected by fabric screens, made of a strong woven fabric, to keep out projectiles and to reinforce the door.

The goal of these mitigation measures and products is to decrease the likelihood of severe damage to a home. There is no guarantee that these measures will safeguard any home against any kind of [[storm]] and the [[projectile]]s that may come with a [[storm]], but a well-protected home is far more likely to come through a hurricane in better shape than a home that has little or no protection.

==Organized preparation==

{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Hurricane mitigation uses policies to make buildings and other infrastructure more resistant to the effects of tropical cyclones. In addition to facilities themselves being at risk, the internal contents of the structures can be damaged as result of exposure to water if the building envelope is breached, usually as a result of the strong [[wind]]s associated with [[hurricane]]s and [[tropical storms]]. Although the negative pressure caused by high velocity wind flowing over a building roof can cause the roof to fail with the building envelope intact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roofingcontractor.com/CDA/Archives/33165f18c67ad010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ |title=Understanding Wind Uplift Ratings |publisher=Roofingcontractor.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; broken windows allow the air pressure to rise inside a building, creating an even greater pressure difference, and increasing the likelihood of roof failure. This pressure increase results after an opening, that is, a window or door, is breached after being struck and broken by wind blown debris.

==Product certification==

Few codes make the use of hurricane mitigation products mandatory{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. As the field is rather new to [[construction]], few standards exist to address uniform testing or [[product certification]] of product installations{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

==Test facilities==
There is no single test standard or facility capable of qualifying the protection of an entire [[building]]. The Cyclone Testing Station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.jcu.edu.au/cts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819074416/http://eng.jcu.edu.au/cts/ |archivedate=2006-08-19 |df= }} Cyclone Testing Station&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia can test building systems (e.g., roofs, exterior cladding), and indirectly test entire small buildings with structural loading to simulate wind pressures.

The university is currently designing water-resistant windows, wind-proof tiles and altogether stronger structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallacher |first=Andy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7431142.stm |title=news.bbc.co.uk, Florida's hurricane simulator |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-06-07 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freshnews.in/scientists-develop-world%E2%80%99s-most-powerful-portable-hurricane-simulator-home-28217 |title=freshnews.in/scientists, Scientists develop world's most powerful portable hurricane simulator Home |publisher=Freshnews.in |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This machine was used in the ''MythBusters'' [[MythBusters (2009 season)#Hurricane Windows|2009 season]] to test the myth that it's better to leave the windows open during a hurricane than closed (the myth was declared Busted).

'''Juan Pablo Orrego''' is a Chilean ecologist, musician and environmentalist. He is the current president of the Ecosistemas (NGO). He is one of the most influential environmental voices in Chile, and Latin America as consequence of his important participation in campaigns against damming projects in Chile that threatened local communities and valuable eecosystems. During the 90's he was president of the activist group ''Grupo de Acción por el Biobío'', which represents the indigenous [[Pehuenche]] people in the [[Biobío Region]]. He was awarded the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 1997, for his organizing of protests against the ecological damages from a series of dam building projects involving the [[Biobío River]], including the [[Pangue Hydroelectric Plant|Pangue]] and [[Ralco Hydroelectric Plant]]s.&lt;ref name=goldman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldmanprize.org/2009/southcentralamerica |title=South &amp; Central America 1997.

It is prepared by packing bay salt in a thick bamboo stem, and baking it nine times on high temperature using pine firewood. This baking method transforms bay salt into a healthy food product. During the baking processes, the impurities in the bay salts are either removed or neutralized while its inorganic contents, such as calcium, potassium, iron, copper, and zinc are increased; allowing the finished product to contribute to ion balance.

== Production ==
To make Jugyeom, [[sea salt]] is packed into [[bamboo]] canisters and sealed with yellow clay. The mixture is baked in an iron oven and roasted in a [[pine]] fire.&lt;ref name="Bitterman"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.comr/books?id=wDiADAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;pg=PA47|title=Bitterman's Craft Salt Cooking|last=Bitterman|first=Mark|publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4494-8377-7|location=Kansas City, Missouri|page=47|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bamboo stem is filled with bay salt produced from the west coast, sealed with red clay, and baked in a kiln with pine tree firewood. The baked salt lumps, hardening after baking. It is taken out, crushed, and repacked in the bamboo stem for the next cycle. During baking the salt absorbs the bamboo constituents that bring a distinctive sweetness, which is called Gamrojung flavor. Baking darkens the salt. The ninth baking process uses the highest temperature, over 1,000℃. Afterwrards the bamboo salt contains blue, yellow, red, white and black.

Well-baked bamboo salt, with a temperature above 1,500℃, is called “Purple bamboo salt” because of its unique purple color, which indicates the best quality. While the quality of bamboo salt cannot be solely determined by color, its crystal structure and hardiness is definitive.

[[File:Lightning-rod-diagram.svg|thumb|alt=A lightning rod at the highest point of a tall building, connected to a ground rod by a wire.|Diagram of a simple lightning protection system]]
A '''lightning rod''' ([[American English|US]], [[Australian English|AUS]]) or '''lightning conductor''' ([[British English|UK]]) is a [[metal]] rod  mounted on a structure and intended to protect the structure from a [[lightning]] strike. If lightning hits the structure, it will preferentially strike the rod and be conducted to ground through a wire, instead of passing through the structure, where it could start a fire or cause [[electrocution]]. Lightning rods are also called [[finial]]s, air terminals or strike termination devices.

In a lightning protection system, a lightning rod is a single component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to perform its protective function. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods is that they are all made of conductive materials, such as [[copper]] and [[aluminum]]. Copper and its [[alloy]]s are the most common materials used in lightning protection.&lt;ref&gt;Copper lightning protection systems save lives, billions; Building and Architectural News, #80, Winter 1995; {{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/cutopics/ct80/lightning.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315110652/http://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/cutopics/Ct80/lightning.html |archivedate=2013-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The principle of the lightning rod was first detailed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1749,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Benjamin Franklin's "Electrical Kite" and Lightning Rod|publisher=The New England Quarterly|jstor=359764|pages=180–196|last1=Jernegan|first1=M. W.|volume=1|issue=2|journal=The New England Quarterly|date=1928|doi=10.2307/359764}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in the subsequent years developed his invention for household application (published in 1753) and further improvements towards a reliable system around 1760.

[[File:Nevjansk tower ground upwards view.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Leaning Tower of Nevyansk|Nevyansk Tower]] in [[Russia]] crowned with a metallic rod grounded through a complex system of [[rebar]]s (some are seen at the basement)]]

Bernard Cohen, The Two Hundredth Anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's Two Lightning Experiments and the Introduction of the Lightning Rod, in: Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 96, No. 3. (Jun. 20, 1952), pp. 331–366.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As buildings become taller, lightning becomes more of a threat. Lightning can damage structures made of most materials, such as [[masonry]], [[wood]], [[concrete]] and [[steel building|steel]], because the huge [[electric current|currents]] and [[voltage]]s involved can [[heat]] materials to high [[temperature]], causing a potential for [[structure fire|fire]].

=== Russia ===
A lightning conductor may have been intentionally used in the [[Leaning Tower of Nevyansk]]. The [[spire]] of the tower is crowned with a metallic rod in the shape of a [[gilding|gilded]] [[sphere]] with spikes. This lightning rod is [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] through the [[rebar]] carcass, which pierces the entire building.

The Nevyansk Tower was built between 1721 and 1745, on the orders of industrialist [[Akinfiy Demidov]]. The Nevyansk Tower was built 28 years before Benjamin Franklin's experiment and scientific explanation.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2002/42/102260.html The office of the first Russian oligarch] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; However, the true intent behind the metal rooftop and rebars remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Rebar |publisher=Whaley Steel |url=http://www.whaleysteel.com/rebar-news/83-history-of-rebar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127233539/http://www.whaleysteel.com/rebar-news/83-history-of-rebar |archivedate=2011-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The church tower of many European cities, which was usually the highest structure in the city, was likely to be hit by lightning. Early on, Christian churches tried to prevent the occurrence of the damaging effects of lightning by prayers. Peter Ahlwardts ("Reasonable and Theological Considerations about Thunder and Lightning", 1745) advised individuals seeking cover from lightning to go anywhere except in or around a church.&lt;ref&gt;Seckel, Al, and John Edwards, "''[http://www.evolvefish.com/freewrite/franklgt.htm Franklin's Unholy Lightning Rod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526223201/http://www.evolvefish.com/freewrite/franklgt.htm |date=2006-05-26 }}''". 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ongoing debate over whether a "metereological machine", invented by [[Premonstratensian]] [[priest]] [[Prokop Diviš]] and erected in [[Přímětice]] near [[Znojmo]], [[Moravia]] (now [[Czech Republic]]) in June 1754, does count as an individual invention of the lightning rod. Diviš's apparatus was, according to his private theories, aimed towards preventing thunderstorms altogether by constantly depriving the air of its superfluous electricity. The apparatus was, however, mounted on a free-standing pole and probably better grounded than Franklin's lightning rods at that time, so it served the purpose of a lightning rod.&lt;ref&gt;See the following two articles for conflicting views of this being an independent invention by Diviš:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/348159 | issn = 0021-1753 | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 351–357 | last = Hujer | first = Karel | title = Father Procopius Diviš — The European Franklin | journal = Isis | date = December 1952 | jstor = 227388}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/348160 | issn = 0021-1753 | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 358–364 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = I.

Bernard Cohen | last2 = Schofield | first2 = Robert | title = Did Diviš Erect the First European Protective Lightning Rod, and Was His Invention Independent? | journal = Isis | date = December 1952 | jstor = 227389}}&lt;/ref&gt; After local protests, Diviš had to cease his weather experiments around 1760.

=== America ===
In what later became the [[United States]], the pointed lightning rod conductor, also called a '''lightning attractor''' or '''Franklin rod''', was invented by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1749 as part of his groundbreaking exploration of [[electricity]]. Although not the first to suggest a correlation between electricity and lightning, Franklin was the first to propose a workable system for testing his hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recovering Benjamin Franklin: an exploration of a life of science and service|publisher=Open Court Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hySRKOq8sBQC&amp;pg=PA59 |isbn=978-0-8126-9387-4|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin speculated that, with an [[iron]] rod sharpened to a point,

:''"The electrical fire would, I think, be drawn out of a cloud silently, before it could come near enough to strike...."''

Franklin speculated about lightning rods for several years before his reported [[kite experiment]]. This experiment, it is said, took place because he was tired of waiting for [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] in [[Philadelphia]] to be completed so he could place a lightning rod on top of it.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In the 19th century, the lightning rod became a decorative motif. Lightning rods were embellished with ornamental [[glass]] balls&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.antiquebottles.com/lightningrod/fame.html Antique Lightning Rod Ball Hall of Fame]''". Antique Bottle Collectors Haven.  (glass lightning balls collection)&lt;/ref&gt; (now prized by collectors). The ornamental appeal of these glass balls has been used in [[weather vane]]s. The main purpose of these balls, however, is to provide evidence of a lightning strike by shattering or falling off. If after a storm a ball is discovered missing or broken, the property owner should then check the building, rod, and grounding wire for damage.

Balls of solid glass occasionally were used in a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was that glass objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, there must be something about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' [[confirmation bias]] ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.

The first lightning conductors on ships were supposed to be hoisted when lightning was anticipated, and had a low success rate. In 1820 [[William Snow Harris]] invented a successful system for fitting lightning protection to the wooden sailing ships of the day, but despite successful trials which began in 1830, the British [[Royal Navy]] did not adopt the system until 1842, by which time the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] had already adopted the system.

In the 1990s, the 'lightning points' were replaced as originally constructed when the [[Statue of Freedom]] atop the United States Capitol building in [[Washington, D.C.]] was restored.&lt;ref&gt;Statue of Freedom http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/freedom.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was designed with multiple devices that are tipped with platinum. The Washington Monument also was equipped with multiple lightning points,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9511/Binczewski-9511.html#RTFToC5 The Point of a Monument: A History of the Aluminum Cap of the Washington Monument: The Functional Purpose]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Statue of Liberty]] in New York Harbor gets hit by lightning, which is shunted to ground.

== Lightning protection system ==
A ''lightning protection system'' is designed to protect a structure from damage due to [[lightning]] strikes by intercepting such strikes and safely passing their extremely high [[Electric current|currents]] to [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. A lightning protection system includes a network of air terminals, bonding [[electrical conductor|conductors]], and ground [[electrode]]s designed to provide a low impedance path to ground for potential strikes.

Lightning protection systems are used to prevent or lessen [[lightning strike]] damage to structures. Lightning protection systems mitigate the fire hazard which lightning strikes pose to structures. A lightning protection system provides a low-impedance path for the lightning current to lessen the heating effect of current flowing through flammable structural materials. If lightning travels through porous and water-saturated materials, these materials may literally explode if their water content is [[steam explosion|flashed to steam]] by heat produced from the high current. This is why trees are often shattered by lightning strikes.

Because of the high energy and current levels associated with lightning (currents can be in excess of 150,000 amps), and the very rapid [[rise time]] of a lightning strike, no protection system can guarantee absolute safety from lightning. Lightning current will divide to follow every conductive path to ground, and even the divided current can cause damage. Secondary "side-flashes" can be enough to ignite a fire, blow apart brick, stone, or concrete, or injure occupants within a structure or building. However, the benefits of basic lightning protection systems have been evident for well over a century.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory-scale measurements of the effects of [any lightning investigation research] do not scale to applications involving natural lightning.&lt;ref name=Cooray10&gt;Vernon Cooray (ed.) ''Lightning Protection'', The Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-84919-106-7}} pp. 240-260, p 320&lt;/ref&gt;  Field applications have mainly been derived from trial and error based on the best intended laboratory research of a highly complex and variable phenomenon.

The parts of a lightning protection system are air terminals (lightning rods or strike termination devices), bonding conductors,  ground terminals (ground or "earthing" rods, plates, or mesh), and all of the connectors and supports to complete the system. The air terminals are typically arranged at or along the upper points of a roof structure, and are electrically bonded together by bonding conductors (called "down conductors" or "[[downlead (disambiguation)|downlead]]s"), which are connected by the most direct route to one or more grounding or earthing terminals.&lt;ref name="scitation.aip.org"&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_59/iss_1/42_1.shtml Benjamin Franklin and Lightning Rods – Physics Today January 2006], Accessed 2008-06-1 9:00pm GMT.&lt;/ref&gt; Connections to the earth electrodes must not only have low resistance, but must have low self-[[inductance]].

An example of a structure vulnerable to lightning is a wooden barn. When lightning strikes the barn, the wooden structure and its contents may be ignited by the heat generated by lightning current conducted through parts of the structure. A basic lightning protection system would provide a conductive path between an air terminal and earth, so that most of the lightning's current will follow the path of the lightning protection system, with substantially less current traveling through flammable materials.

A controversy over the assortment of operation theories dates back to the 18th century, when [[Benjamin Franklin]] himself stated that his lightning protectors protected buildings by dissipating electric charge. He later retracted the statement, stating that the device's exact mode of operation was something of a mystery at that point.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Originally, scientists believed that such a lightning protection system of air terminals and "downleads" directed the current of the lightning down into the earth to be "dissipated". However, high speed photography has clearly demonstrated that lightning is actually composed of both a cloud component and an oppositely charged ground component. During "cloud-to-ground" lightning, these oppositely charged components usually "meet" somewhere in the atmosphere well above the earth to equalize previously unbalanced charges. The heat generated as this electric current flows through flammable materials is the hazard which lightning protection systems attempt to mitigate by providing a low-resistance path for the lightning [[Electrical network|circuit]]. No lightning protection system can be relied upon to "contain" or "control" lightning completely (nor thus far, to prevent lightning strikes entirely), but they do seem to help immensely on most occasions of lightning strikes.

Steel framed structures can [[Electrical bonding|bond]] the structural members to earth to provide lightning protection. A metal flagpole with its foundation in the earth is its own extremely simple lightning protection system. However, the flag(s) flying from the pole during a lightning strike may be completely incinerated.

The majority of lightning protection systems in use today are of the traditional [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] design.&lt;ref name="scitation.aip.org" /&gt;  The fundamental principle used in Franklin-type lightning protections systems is to provide a sufficiently low impedance path for the lightning to travel through to reach ground without damaging the building.&lt;ref name=note1&gt;NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition – Annex B.3.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by surrounding the building in a kind of [[Faraday cage]]. A system of lightning protection conductors and lightning rods are installed on the roof of the building to intercept any lightning before it strikes the building.

=== Lightning arrester ===
[[File:Statue auf dem Bayerischen Landtag 3427.JPG|thumb|Lightning rod on a statue.]]
{{Main|Lightning arrester}}

In [[telegraphy]] and [[telephony]], a lightning arrester is a device placed where wires enter a structure, in order to prevent damage to electronic instruments within and ensuring the safety of individuals near the structures. Lightning arresters, also called [[surge protector]]s, are devices that are connected between each electrical conductor in a power or communications system, and the ground. They help prevent the flow of the normal power or signal currents to ground, but provide a path over which high-voltage lightning current flows, bypassing the connected equipment. Arresters are used to limit the rise in voltage when a communications or power line is struck by lightning or is near to a lightning strike.

=== Protection of electric distribution systems ===
In overhead electric transmission (high-tension) systems, one or two lighter gauge conductors may be mounted to the top of the [[Electricity pylon|pylons, poles, or towers]] not specifically used to send electricity through the grid. These conductors, often referred to "static", "pilot" or "shield" wires are designed to be the point of lightning termination instead of the high-voltage lines themselves. These conductors are intended to protect the primary power conductors from [[lightning]] strikes.

These conductors are bonded to earth either through the metal structure of a pole or tower, or by additional ground electrodes installed at regular intervals along the line. As a general rule, overhead power lines with voltages below 50 kV do not have a "static" conductor, but most lines carrying more than 50 kV do. The ground conductor cable may also support [[OPGW|fibre optic cables]] for data transmission.

In some instances, these conductors are insulated from direct bonding with earth and may be used as low voltage communication lines. If the voltage exceeds a certain threshold, such as during a lightning termination to the conductor, it "jumps" the insulators and passes to earth.

Protection of electrical substations is as varied as lightning rods themselves, and is often proprietary to the electric company.

=== Lightning protection of mast radiators ===
Radio [[mast radiator]]s may be insulated from the ground by a gap at the base. When lightning hits the mast, it jumps this gap. A small inductivity in the feed line between the mast and the tuning unit (usually one winding) limits the voltage increase, protecting the transmitter from dangerously high voltages.
The transmitter must be equipped with a device to monitor the antenna's electrical properties. This is very important, as a charge could remain after a lightning strike, damaging the gap or the insulators.
The monitoring device switches off the transmitter when the antenna shows incorrect behavior, e.g. as a result of undesired electrical charge. When the transmitter is switched off, these charges dissipate. The monitoring device makes several attempts to switch back on. If after several attempts the antenna continues to show improper behavior, possibly as result of structural damage, the transmitter remains switched off.

=== Lightning conductors and grounding precautions ===

Ideally, the underground part of the assembly should reside in an area of high ground conductivity. If the underground cable is able to resist [[corrosion]] well, it can be covered in [[salt]] to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, [[Counterpoise (ground system)|counterpoise]] (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor ([[Ufer ground]]). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [dispersion] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition – Annex B – B.4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional precautions must be taken to prevent side-flashes between conductive objects on or in the structure and the lightning protection system. The surge of lightning current through a lightning protection conductor will create a voltage difference between it and any conductive objects that are near it. This voltage difference can be large enough to cause a dangerous side-flash (spark) between the two that can cause significant damage, especially on structures housing flammable or explosive materials. The most effective way to prevent this potential damage is to ensure the electrical continuity between the lightning protection system and any objects susceptible to a side-flash. Effective bonding will allow the voltage potential of the two objects to rise and fall simultaneously, thereby eliminating any risk of a side-flash.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition – Annex C&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lightning protection system design ===
Considerable material is used to make up lightning protection systems, so it is prudent to consider carefully where an air terminal will provide the greatest protection. Historical understanding of lightning, from statements made by Ben Franklin, assumed that each ''lightning rod'' protected a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] of 45 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Donlon, Tim, "''[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/lightning/lightn.htm Lightning Protection for Historic Buildings]''". Cathedral Communications Limited, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been found to be unsatisfactory for protecting taller structures, as it is possible for lightning to strike the side of a building.

A modeling system based on a better understanding of the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the [[step leader]] of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the [[ground (electricity)|grounded]] objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the ''critical distance'' and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46&amp;nbsp;m near the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Installation requirements for lightning protection systems – UL 96A 4.7.3.4.2&lt;/ref&gt;

An object outside the critical distance is unlikely to be struck by the leader if there is a solidly grounded object within the critical distance. Locations that are considered safe from lightning can be determined by imagining a leader's potential paths as a [[sphere]] that travels from the cloud to the ground. For lightning protection, it suffices to consider all possible spheres as they touch potential strike points. To determine strike points, consider a sphere rolling over the terrain. At each point, a potential leader position is simulated. Lightning is most likely to strike where the sphere touches the ground. Points that the sphere cannot roll across and touch are safest from lightning. Lightning protectors should be placed where they will prevent the sphere from touching a structure. A weak point in most lightning diversion systems is in transporting the captured discharge from the lightning rod to the ground, though.&lt;ref&gt;Lightning protection installation, {{US patent|3919956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning rods are typically installed around the perimeter of flat roofs, or along the peaks of sloped roofs at intervals of 6.1 m or 7.6 m, depending on the height of the rod.&lt;ref&gt;Installation requirements for lightning protection systems – UL 96A 8.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; When a flat roof has dimensions greater than 15&amp;nbsp;m by 15&amp;nbsp;m, additional air terminals will be installed in the middle of the roof at intervals of 15&amp;nbsp;m or less in a rectangular grid pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Standard for the installation of lightning protection systems 2008 edition – NFPA-780 4.8.2.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rounded versus pointed ends ===
[[File:Pointed Lightning Rod.jpg|thumb|Pointed lightning rod on a building]]
The optimal shape for the tip of a lightning rod has been controversial since the 18th century. During the period of political confrontation between Britain and its American colonies, British scientists maintained that a lightning rod should have a ball on its end, while American scientists maintained that there should be a point. {{As of|2003}}, the controversy had not been completely resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/03/26/816484.htm |title=Franklin letter to King fans flames of lightning debate |author=Ian Godwin |date=March 26, 2003 |work=ABC Science Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is difficult to resolve the controversy because proper controlled experiments are nearly impossible, but work performed by [[Charles B. Moore]], et al.,&lt;ref&gt;C. B. Moore, William Rison, James Mathis, and Graydon Aulich, "''[http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-abstract&amp;issn=1520-0450&amp;volume=039&amp;issue=05&amp;page=0593 Lightning Rod Improvement Studies]''". Journal of Applied Meteorology: Vol. 39, No. 5, pp. 593–609. Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, New Mexico. April 10, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000 has shed some light on the issue, finding that moderately rounded or blunt-tipped lightning rods act as marginally better strike receptors. As a result, round-tipped rods are installed on most new systems in the United States, though most existing systems still have pointed rods. According to the study,

{{Quote|[c]alculations of the relative strengths of the electric fields above similarly exposed sharp and blunt rods show that while the fields are much stronger at the tip of a sharp rod prior to any emissions, they decrease more rapidly with distance. As a result, at a few centimeters above the tip of a 20-mm-diameter blunt rod, the [[Electric field|strength of the field]] is greater than over an otherwise similar, sharper rod of the same height. Since the field strength at the tip of a sharpened rod tends to be limited by the easy formation of ions in the surrounding air, the field strengths over blunt rods can be much stronger than those at distances greater than 1&amp;nbsp;cm over sharper ones.&lt;br /&gt;The results of this study suggest that moderately blunt metal rods (with tip height to tip radius of curvature ratios of about 680:1) are better lightning strike receptors than sharper rods or very blunt ones.}}

In addition, the height of the lightning protector relative to the structure to be protected and the Earth itself will have an effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1266175}}, Tesla, "Lightning-Protector".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|3371144}}, Griscom, "Transmission-line lightning-proofing structures". Page 25, Column 5. (cf. […] ''the charge on a leader as a function of height above ground''[…])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charge transfer theory ===
The charge transfer theory states that a lightning strike to a protected structure can be prevented by reducing the electrical potential between the protected structure and the thundercloud. This is done by transferring electric charge (such as from the nearby Earth to the sky or vice versa).&lt;ref name="Zini"&gt;{{US patent|6307149}}, Richard Ralph Zini, et al., Non-contaminating lightning protection system. Claim one and claim ten.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Richard Gumley, {{US patent|6320119}}, Lightning air terminals and method of design and application&lt;/ref&gt; Transferring electric charge from the Earth to the sky is done by installing engineered products composed of many points above the structure. It is noted that pointed objects will indeed transfer charge to the surrounding atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;Emitter of ions for a lightning rod with a parabolic reflector, Manuel Domingo Varela, {{US patent|6069314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lightning-protector for electrical conductors, Johathan H. Vail, {{US patent|357050}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that a considerable electric current can be measured through the conductors as ionization occurs at the point when an electric field is present, such as happens when thunderclouds are overhead.

In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) does not currently{{when?|date=July 2017}} endorse a device that can prevent or reduce lightning strikes. The NFPA Standards Council, following a request for a project to address Dissipation Array[tm] Systems and Charge Transfer Systems, denied the request to begin forming standards on such technology (though the Council did not foreclose on future standards development after reliable sources demonstrating the validity of the basic technology and science were submitted).&lt;ref&gt;Casey C. Grant, "''[http://www.lightningsafetyalliance.com/documents/das_cts.pdf To: Interested Parties]''"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early streamer emission (ESE) theory ===
[[File:Lightning Rod Meteora.jpg|right|thumb|150px|ESE lightning rod mounted at the Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapausas (Μονή του Αγίου Νικολάου), [[Meteora]], [[Greece]]]]

The theory of early streamer emission proposes that if a lightning rod has a mechanism producing ionization near its tip, then its lightning capture area is greatly increased. At first, small quantities of radioactive isotopes ([[radium-226]] or [[americium-241]]) were used as sources of ionization&lt;ref&gt;B. Charpentier, S. Rodde: "Decommissioning of radioactive
lightning rods in France", [http://www.french-nuclear-safety.fr/ Autorité de sûreté nucléaire (ASN)], March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; between 1930 and 1980, later replaced with various electrical and electronic devices. According to an early patent, since most lightning protectors' ground potentials are elevated, the path distance from the source to the elevated ground point will be shorter, creating a stronger field (measured in volts per unit distance) and that structure will be more prone to ionization and breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1869661}}, Bumbraugh, "Lightning protection system and method".&lt;/ref&gt;

AFNOR, the French national standardization body, issued a standard, NF C 17-102, covering this technology. The [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] also investigated the subject and there was a proposal to issue a similar standard in the USA. Initially, an NFPA independent third party panel stated that "the [Early Streamer Emission] lightning protection technology appears to be technically sound" and that there was an "adequate theoretical basis for the [Early Streamer Emission] air terminal concept and design from a physical viewpoint".&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, R. G., et al., 1999, "Report of the Third-Party Independent Evaluation Panel on the Early Streamer Emission Lightning Protection Technology".&lt;/ref&gt;) The same panel also concluded that "the recommended [NFPA 781 standard] lightning protection system has never been scientifically or technically validated and the Franklin rod air terminals have not been validated in field tests under thunderstorm conditions."

In response, the American Geophysical Union concluded that "[t]he Bryan Panel reviewed essentially none of the studies and literature on the effectiveness and scientific basis of traditional lightning protection systems and was erroneous in its conclusion that there was no basis for the Standard." AGU did not attempt to assess the effectiveness of any proposed modifications to traditional systems in its report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agu.org/focus_group/ASE/NFPAreport.pdf Report of The Committee on Atmospheric And Space Electricity of The American Geophysical Union on The Scientific Basis for Traditional Lightning Protection Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; The NFPA withdrew its proposed draft edition of standard 781 due to a lack of evidence of increased effectiveness of Early Streamer Emission-based protection systems over conventional air terminals.

Members of the Scientific Committee of the [[International Conference on Lightning Protection]] (ICLP) have issued a joint statement stating their opposition to Early Streamer Emission technology.&lt;ref&gt;Mousa, Abdul M. "''Scientists Oppose Early Streamer Air Terminals''", 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ICLP maintains a web page with information related to ESE and related technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclp-centre.org/ESE_issue.html ICLP ESE issue webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126142952/http://www.iclp-centre.org/ESE_issue.html |date=2013-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the number of buildings and structures equipped with ESE lightning protection systems is growing as well as the number of manufacturers of ESE air terminals from Europe, Americas, Middle East, Russia, China, South Korea, ASEAN countries, and Australia.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intlpa.org/ese-statics/s5 |title=Statistics - ILPA |publisher=Intlpa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis of strikes ==
Lightning strikes to a metallic structure can vary from leaving no evidence—except, perhaps, a small pit in the metal—to the complete destruction of the structure.&lt;ref name="Rakov"&gt;Rakov, et al., ''Lightning: physics and effects'', p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; When there is no evidence, analyzing the strikes is difficult. This means that a strike on an uninstrumented structure must be visually confirmed, and the random behavior of lightning renders such observations difficult.&lt;ref name="Rakov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Uman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0486414639&amp;id=9AaG3JnpfcgC Lightning Discharge]''. Courier Dover Publications, 2001. 377 pages. {{ISBN|0-486-41463-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. MacGorman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0195073371&amp;id=_NbHNj7KJecC The Electrical Nature of Storms]''. Oxford University Press (US), 1998. 432 pages. {{ISBN|0-19-507337-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Volland, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0849386470&amp;id=MNPPh7B3WTIC Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics, Volume I]''. CRC Press, 1995. 408 pages. {{ISBN|0-8493-8647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also inventors working on this problem,&lt;ref&gt;Method and apparatus for the artificial triggering of lightning, Douglas A. Palmer, {{US patent|6012330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lightning rocket, Robert E. Betts, {{US patent|6597559}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as through a [[lightning rocket]]. While controlled experiments may be off in the future, very good data is being obtained through techniques which use radio receivers that watch for the characteristic electrical 'signature' of lightning strikes using fixed directional antennas.&lt;ref&gt;Lightning locating system, Ralph J. Markson et al., {{US patent|6246367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lightning locating system, Airborne Research Associates, Inc., {{US patent|5771020}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;System and method of locating lightning strikes, The United States of America as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, {{US patent|6420862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Single station system and method of locating lightning strikes, The United States of America as represented by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, {{US patent|6552521}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through accurate timing and triangulation techniques, lightning strikes can be located with great precision, so strikes on specific objects often can be confirmed with confidence.

The energy in a lightning strike is typically in the range of 1 to 10 billion [[joule]]s.  This energy is released usually in a small number of separate strokes, each with duration of a few tens of microseconds (typically 30 to 50 microseconds), over a period of about one fifth of a second. The great majority of the energy is dissipated as heat, light and sound in the atmosphere.

== Aircraft protectors ==

Lightning protection for aircraft is provided by mounting devices on the aircraft structure. The protectors are provided with extensions through the [[structure]] of the aircraft's outer surface and within a [[static discharger]]. Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical [[electronic equipment]]. Aircraft lightning protection provides an electrical path having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high [[voltage]] [[field (physics)|field]] form an [[ionization]] channel due to the system's [[breakdown voltage]]. Various lightning protection systems must reject the [[surge current]]s associated with the lightning strikes. Lightning protection means for aircraft include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of [[Composite material|composite]] structures. Various ground connection means to the layers comprises a section of [[wire mesh]] fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent ground structure. Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.

Some aircraft lightning protection systems use a [[shielded cable]] system.  These systems consist of one or more conductors enclosed by a conductive shield.  The cable has both conductors of one end connected to a grounding element.  This is intended to provide protection from [[electromagnetic interference]].  Such systems reduce the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetically]] [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] voltage in a shielded conductor.  This is intended to provide protection against induced electromagnetic interference from lightning.  This network provides a normally-high [[electrical impedance|impedance]] which breaks down to a very low impedance in response to a momentary voltage surge electromagnetically induced in the shield.  This establishes a conductive path between the shield and ground.  Any surge voltage from lightning creates a current through the cable.  This results in an electromagnetic field of the opposite direction, which cancels or reduces the magnitude of the electromagnetic field within the shielded cable.

== Watercraft protectors ==
A lightning protection installation on a [[watercraft]] comprises a ''lightning protector'' mounted on the top of a [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] or superstructure, and a ''[[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] conductor'' in contact with the water. [[Electrical conductor]]s attach to the protector and run down to the conductor. For a vessel with a conducting (iron or steel) hull, the grounding conductor is the hull. For a vessel with a non-conducting hull, the grounding conductor may be retractable, attached to the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], or attached to a [[centerboard]].

== Risk assessment ==
Some structures are inherently more or less at risk of being struck by lightning. The risk for a structure is a function of the size (area) of a structure, the height, and the number of lightning strikes per year per mi² for the region.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition – Annex L.1.3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a small building will be less likely to be struck than a large one, and a building in an area with a high density of lightning strikes will be more likely to be struck than one in an area with a low density of lightning strikes. The National Fire Protection Association provides a risk assessment worksheet in their lightning protection standard.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition – Annex L&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) lightning risk-assessment comprises four parts: loss of living beings, loss of service to public, loss of cultural heritage, and loss of economic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Christian |last=Bouquegneau |date=2011 |title=Lightning Protection IEC EN 62305 Standard |url=http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~serec/EVENTS%20WEF%202011/LIGHTNING_14OCT11/5_The%20IEC%20EN62305%20Standard_BOUQUEGNEAU.pdf |accessdate=September 2, 2012 |doi= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of living beings is rated as the most important and is the only loss taken into consideration for many nonessential industrial and commercial applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28351">'''Lorentz force velocimetry'''&lt;ref name="ThessPRL"/&gt; (LFV) is a noncontact [[electromagnetic]] flow measurement technique. LFV is particularly suited for the measurement of velocities in liquid metals like steel or [[aluminium]] and is currently under development for [[metallurgical]] applications.The measurement of flow velocities in hot and aggressive liquids such as liquid aluminium and molten glass constitutes one of the grand challenges of industrial fluid mechanics. Apart from liquids, LFV can also be used to measure the velocity of solid materials as well as for detection of micro-defects in their structures.

A Lorentz force [[velocimetry]] system is called Lorentz force flowmeter (LFF). A LFF measures the integrated or bulk [[Lorentz force]] resulting from the interaction between a liquid metal in motion and an applied magnetic field. In this case the characteristic length of the magnetic field is of the same order of magnitude as the dimensions of the channel. It must be addressed that in the case where localized magnetic fields are used, it is possible to perform local velocity measurements and thus the term Lorentz force [[velocimeter]] is used.

==Introduction==

The use of magnetic fields in flow measurement date back to 19th century, when in 1832 [[Michael Faraday]] attempted to determine the velocity of the [[River Thames]]. Faraday applied a method in which a flow (the river flow) is exposed to a magnetic field (earth magnetic field) and the induced voltage is measured using two electrodes across the same flow. This method is the basis of the one of the most successful commercial applications in flow metering known as the inductive flowmeter. The theory of such devices has been developed and comprehensively summarized by Prof. J. A. Shercliff&lt;ref name="Shercliff"&gt;Arthur J. Shercliff: ''Theory of Electromagnetic Flow Measurement''. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-33554-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in early 1950s. While inductive flowmeters are widely used for flow measurement in fluids at room temperatures such as beverages, chemicals and waste water, they are not suited for flow measurement of media such as hot, aggressive or for local measurements where surrounding obstacles limit access to the channel or pipe. Since they require electrodes to be inserted into the fluid, their use is limited to applications at temperatures far below the melting points of practically relevant metals.

The Lorentz force velocimetry was invented by the A. Shercliff. However, it did not find practical application in these early years up until recent technical advances; in manufacturing of rare earth and non rare-earth strong permanent magnets, accurate force measurement techniques, multiphysical process simulation software for [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) problems that this principle could be turned into a feasible working flow measurement technique. LFV is currently being developed for applications in metallurgy&lt;ref name="Kolesnikov2011"&gt;Y. Kolesnikov, C. Karcher, A. Thess, "Lorentz Force Flowmeter for Liquid Aluminum: Laboratory Experiments and Plant Tests" (in German), ''Metall. Mat. Trans.''

Based on theory introduced by Shercliff there have been several attempts to develop flow measurement methods which do not require any mechanical contact with the fluid,.&lt;ref name="Priede2011"&gt;J. Priede, D. Buchenau., G. Gerbeth, "Contactless Electromagnetic Phase-Shift Flowmeter for Liquid Metals", ''Measur. Sci. Tech.'' 22 (2011) 055402,2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thess2007"/&gt; Among them is the eddy current flowmeter which measures flow-induced changes in the electric impedance of coils interacting with the flow. More recently, a non-contact method was proposed in which a magnetic field is applied to the flow and the velocity is determined from measurements of flow-induced deformations of the applied magnetic field,.&lt;ref name="Baumgartl1993"&gt;J. Baumgartl, A. Hubert, and G. M¨uller, "The use of magnetohydrodynamic effects to investigate fluid flow in electrically conducting melts", ''Phys. Fluids A'' 5, 3280 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stefani2004"&gt;Stefani F., Gundrum T., Gerbeth G., "Contactless inductive flow tomography", ''Phys Rev E'' 70,056306 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle and physical interpretation==

[[File:LFV.png|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 1 : Working principle of LFV. (a) An electrically conductive fluid is exposed to a magnetic field. (b) The magnetic field induces eddy currents inside the fluid. (c) The eddy currents give rise to a secondary magnetic field. (d) A braking force on the fluid results,which is matched by an accelerating force on the magnet.]]

The principle of Lorentz force velocimetry is based on measurements of the [[Lorentz force]] that occurs due to the flow of a conductive fluid under the influence of a variable [[magnetic field]]. According to [[Electromagnetic induction|Faraday's law]], when a metal or conductive fluid moves through a magnetic field, [[eddy current]]s generate there by [[electromotive force]] in zones of maximal magnetic field gradient (in the present case in the inlet and outlet zones). [[Eddy current]] in its turn creates induced magnetic field according to [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]]. The interaction between eddy currents and total magnetic field gives rise to Lorentz force that breaks the flow. By virtue of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]] "actio=reactio" a force with the same magnitude but opposite direction acts upon its source - permanent magnet. Direct measurement of the magnet's reaction force allows to determine fluid's velocity, since this force is proportional to flow rate. The Lorentz force used in LFV has nothing to do with magnetic attraction or repulsion. It is only due to the eddy currents whose strength depends on the electrical conductivity, the relative velocity between the liquid and the permanent magnet as well as the magnitude of the magnetic field.

So, when a liquid metal moves across magnetic field lines, the interaction of the magnetic field (which are either produced by a current-carrying coil or by a permanent magnet) with the induced eddy currents leads to a Lorentz force (with density &lt;math&gt; \vec{f} = \vec{j} \times \vec{B} &lt;/math&gt;) which brakes the flow. The Lorentz force density is roughly

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
f \sim \sigma v B^2
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] of the fluid, &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; its velocity, and &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; the magnitude of the magnetic field. This fact is well known and has found a variety of applications. This force is proportional to the velocity and conductivity of the fluid, and its measurement is the key idea of LFV. With the recent advent of powerful rare earth permanent magnets (like [[Neodymium magnet|NdFeB]], [[Samarium–cobalt magnet|SmCo]] and other kind of magnets) and tools for designing sophisticated systems by permanent magnet the practical realization of this principle has now become possible.

The primary magnetic field &lt;math&gt; \vec{B}\left(\vec{r}\right) &lt;/math&gt; can be produced by a permanent magnet or a primary current &lt;math&gt; \vec{J}\left(\vec{r}\right) &lt;/math&gt; (see Fig. 1). The motion of the fluid under the action of the primary field induces eddy currents which are sketched in figure  3. They will be denoted by &lt;math&gt; \vec{j}\left(\vec{r}\right) &lt;/math&gt; and are called secondary currents. The interaction of the secondary current with the primary magnetic field is responsible for the Lorentz force within the fluid
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
 \vec{F}_f = \int _f \vec{j} \times \vec{B} d^3\vec{r}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
which breaks the flow.

The secondary currents create a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\vec{b}\left(\vec{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, the secondary magnetic field. The interaction of the primary electric current with the secondary magnetic field gives rise to the Lorentz force on the magnet system
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
 \vec{F}_m = \int _m \vec{J} \times \vec{b} d^3\vec{r}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The reciprocity principle for the Lorentz force velocimetry states that the electromagnetic forces on the fluid and on the magnet system have the same magnitude and act in opposite direction, namely
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\vec{F}_m = - \vec{F}_f
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
The general scaling law that relates the measured force to the unknown velocity can be derived with reference to the simplified situation shown in Fig. 2. Here a small permanent magnet with dipole moment &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; is located at a distance &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; above a semi-infinite fluid moving with uniform velocity &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; parallel to its free surface.
[[File:Analyticalmodel.png|right|thumb|Fig. 2 : Spatial distribution of magnetic fields in Lorentz force velocimetry: (a) primary magnetic field &lt;math&gt; \vec{B} &lt;/math&gt; and eddy currents &lt;math&gt;\vec{J}&lt;/math&gt; produced by a magnetic dipole interacting with a uniformly moving electrically conducting fluid; (b) secondary magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\vec{b}&lt;/math&gt; due to the horizontal eddy currents &lt;math&gt; \vec{J} &lt;/math&gt;. Adapted from.&lt;ref name="ThessPRL"/&gt;]]

The analysis that leads to the scaling relation can be made quantitative by assuming that the magnet is a point dipole with dipole moment &lt;math&gt; \vec{m} = m  \hat{e}_z &lt;/math&gt; whose magnetic field is given by
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\vec{B} \left( \vec{R}\right) = \frac{\mu _0}{4 \pi} \left\lbrace 3 \frac{\left( \vec{m} \cdot \vec{R} \right) \vec{R} }{ R^5} - \frac{\vec{m}}{R^3} \right\rbrace
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \vec{R} = \vec{r} - L \hat{e} _z &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; R = \mid \vec{R} \mid &lt;/math&gt;. Assuming a velocity  field &lt;math&gt; \vec{v} = v \hat{e} _x &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; z &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the eddy currents can be computed from Ohm's law for a moving electrically conducting fluid
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\vec{J} = \sigma \left( -\nabla \phi + \vec{v} \times \vec{B} \right)
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
subject to the boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;J_z=0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_z \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;z \to  1&lt;/math&gt;. First, the scalar electric potential is obtained as
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\phi \left( \vec{r} \right) =  - \frac{\mu_0 v m}{4 \pi} \frac{x}{R^3}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
from which the electric current density is readily calculated. They are indeed horizontal. Once they are known, the [[Biot–Savart law]] can be used to compute the secondary magnetic field &lt;math&gt; \vec{b} \left( \vec{r}\right) &lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the force is given by
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\vec{F} = \left( \vec{m} \cdot \nabla \right) \vec{b}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
where the gradient of &lt;math&gt;\vec{b}&lt;/math&gt; has to be evaluated at the location of the dipole. For the problem at hand all these steps can be carried out analytically without any approximation leading to the result
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
F = \frac{\mu_0^2 \sigma v m^2}{128 \pi L^3}\hat{e}_z
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
This provides us with the estimate
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
F \sim \mu_0^2 \sigma v m^2  L^{-3}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

== Conceptual setups ==

Lorentz force flowmeters are usually classified in several main conceptual setups. Some of them designed as static flowmeters where the magnet system is at rest and one measures the force acting on it. Alternatively, they can be designed as rotary flowmeters where the magnets are arranged on a rotating wheel and the spinning velocity is a measure of the flow velocity. Obviously, the force acting on a Lorentz force flowmeter depends both on the velocity distribution and on the shape of the magnet system. This classification depends on the relative direction of the magnetic field that is being applied respect to the direction of the flow. In Figure 3 one can distinguish diagrams of the '''longitudinal''' and the '''transverse''' Lorentz force flowmeters.

[[File:Trans longit.png|center|thumb|400px|Fig. 3 : Principle sketch of Lorentz force velocimetry: arrangement of the coil (a) and structure of the primary magnetic field (b) for a longitudinal flux flowmeter. (c, d) Same for a transverse flux flowmeter. Adapted from.&lt;ref name="Thess2007"&gt;A. Thess et al., Theory of the Lorentz force flowmeter, 2007 New J. Phys. 9 299&lt;/ref&gt;]]

It is important to mention that even that in figures only a coil or a magnet are sketched, the principle holds for both.

'''Rotary LFF''' consists of a freely rotating permanent magnet&lt;ref name="Priede2010"&gt;J. Priede, D. Buchenau., G. Gerbeth, Single-Magnet Rotary Flowmeter for Liquid Metals, J. Appl. Phys. 110 (2010) pp. 03451., doi:10.1063/1.3610440&lt;/ref&gt; (or an array of magnets mounted on a flywheel as shown in figure 4), which is magnetized perpendicularly to the axle it is mounted on. When such a system is placed close to a duct carrying an electrically conducting fluid flow, it rotates so that the driving torque due to the eddy currents induced by the flow is balanced by the braking torque induced by the rotation itself. The equilibrium rotation rate  varies directly with the flow velocity and inversely with the distance between the magnet and the duct. In this case it is possible to measure either the torque on the magnet system or the angular velocity at which the wheel spins.

== Practical applications ==

LFV is sought to be extended to all fluid or solid materials, providing that they are electrically conductors. As shown before, the Lorentz force generated by the flow depend linearly on the conductivity of the fluid. Typically, the electrical  conductivity of molten metals is of the order of &lt;math&gt;10^6 ~ S/m&lt;/math&gt; so the Lorentz force is in the range of some ''mN''. However, equally important liquids as glass melts and electrolytic solutions have a conductivity of &lt;math&gt;\sim ~ 1 ~ S/m &lt;/math&gt; giving rise to a Lorentz force of the order of micronewtons or even smaller.

=== High Conducting media: liquid or solid metals ===

Among different possibilities to measure the effect on the magnet system, it has been successfully applied those based on the measurement of the deflection of a parallel spring under an applied force.&lt;ref name="Heinecke2012"&gt;C. Heinicke et al., Interaction of a small permanent magnet with a liquid metal duct flow.
Journal of Applied Physics (2012) 112&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly using a strain gauge and then recording the deflection of a quartz spring with an interferometer, in whose case the deformation is detected to within 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm.

=== Low Conducting media: Electrolytic solution or glass melts ===

Recent advance in LFV made it possible for metering flow velocity of media which has very low electroconductivity, particularly by varying parameters as well as using some state-of-art force measurement devices enable to measure flow velocity of [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|electrolyte solutions with conductivity]] that is 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than that for the liquid metals. There are variety of industrial and scientific applications where noncontact flow measurement through opaque walls or in opaque liquids is desirable. Such applications include flow metering of chemicals, food, beverages, blood, aqueous solutions in the pharmaceutical industry, molten salts in solar thermal power plants,&lt;ref name="Herrmann"&gt;U. Herrmann, B. Kelly, and H. Price, Energy 29, 883–893 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and high temperature reactors  &lt;ref name="Forsberg"&gt;C. W. Forsberg, P. F. Peterson, and P. S. Pickard, Nucl. Technol. 144, 289 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as glass melts for high-precision optics.&lt;ref name="LangeandLoch"&gt;U. Lange and H. Loch, "Instabilities and stabilization of glass pipe flow" in ''Mathematical Simulation in Glass Technology'', Schott Series on Glass and Glass Ceramics, edited by D. Krause and H. Loch (Springer Verlag, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

A noncontact flowmeter is a device that is neither in mechanical contact with the liquid nor with the wall of the pipe in which the liquid flows. Noncontact flowmeters are equally useful when walls are contaminated like in the processing of radioactive materials, when pipes are strongly vibrating or in cases when portable flowmeters are to be developed. If the liquid and the wall of the pipe are transparent and the liquid contains tracer particles, optical measurement techniques,&lt;ref name="Tropea"&gt;C. Tropea, A. L. Yarin, and J. F. Foss, Handbook of Experimental Fluid Mechanics, Springer-Verlag, GmbH, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durst"&gt;F. Durst, A. Melling, and J. H. Whitelaw, ''Principles and Practice of Laser-Doppler Anemometry'', 2nd ed. Academic, London, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; are effective enough tool to perform noncontact measurements. However, if either the wall or the liquid are opaque as is often the case in food production, chemical engineering, glass making, and metallurgy, very few possibilities for noncontact flow measurement exist.

The force measurement system is an important part of the Lorentz force velocimetry. With high resolution force measurement system makes the measurement of even lower conductivity possible.Up to date has the force measurement system continually being developed.   At first the pendulum-like setups was used (Figure 5). One of the experimental facilities consists of two high power (410 mT) magnets made of [[Neodymium magnet|NdFeB]] suspended by thin wires on both side of channel thereby creating magnetic field perpendicular to the fluid flow, here deflection is measured by interferometer system,.&lt;ref name="Wegfrass2"&gt;Wegfrass, A. et al. "Flow rate measurement of weakly conducting fluids using Lorentz force velocimetry" ''Meas. Sci.Technol.'' 23 105307 (2012), http://stacks.iop.org/MST/23/105307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diethold 2012"/&gt; The second setup consists of state-of-art weighting balance system (Figure 6) from which is being hanged optimized magnets on the base of Halbach array system. While the total mass of both magnet systems are equal (1&amp;nbsp;kg), this system induces 3 times higher system response due to arrangement of individual elements in the array and it's interaction with predefined fluid profile. Here use of very sensitive force measuring devices is desirable, since flow velocity is being converted from the very tiny detected Lorentz Force. This force in combination with unavoidable dead weight &lt;math&gt; F_G&lt;/math&gt; of the magnet (&lt;math&gt; F_G = m\cdot g &lt;/math&gt;) is around &lt;math&gt; F/F_G = 10^{-7} &lt;/math&gt;. After that, the method of differential force measurement was developed. With this method two balance were used, one with magnet and the other is with same-weight-dummy. In this way the influence of environment would be reduced. Recently, it have been reported that the flow measurements by this method is possible for saltwater flows whose electrical conductivity is as small as 0.06 S/m (range of electrical conductivity of the regular water from tap).&lt;ref name=Vasilyan1&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vasilyan|first1=Suren|title=Towards metering tap water by Lorentz Force Velocimetry|journal=Measurement Science and Technology|volume=26|issue=11|pages=115302|url=http://iop.com|ref=Vasilyan1|doi=10.1088/0957-0233/26/11/115302|year=2015|bibcode=2015MeScT..26k5302V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lorentz force sigmometry ===

[[File:LOFOS.png|right|thumb|Fig. 8 : LOFOS working principle.]]

Lorentz force sigmometry (LOFOS)&lt;ref name="Uhlig2012"&gt;Uhlig, R. P., Zec, M., Ziolkowski, M., Brauer, H. and Thess, A. 2012 Lorentz force sigmometry: A contactless method for electrical conductivity measurements. ''Journal of Applied Physics'', 111&lt;/ref&gt; is a contactless method for measuring the thermophysical properties of materials, no matter whether it is a fluid or a solid body. The precise measurements of electrical value, density, viscosity, thermal  conductivity and surface tension of molten metals are in great importance in industry applications. One of the major problems in the experimental measurements of the thermophysical properties at high temperature (&gt;1000 K) in the liquid  state  is  the  problem  of  chemical  reaction  between  the  hot  fluid  and  the  electrical  probes.
The basic equation for calculating the electrical conductivity is derived from the equation that links the mass flow rate &lt;math&gt; \dot{m} &lt;/math&gt; and Lorentz force &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; generated by magnetic field in flow:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\dot{m} \left(t \right) = \frac{K}{\Sigma} F \left(t \right) \quad
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Sigma = \frac{\sigma}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt; is the specific electrical conductivity equals to the ratio of the electrical conductivity &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; and the  mass density of fluid &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt;  is a calibration factor  that depends on the  geometry of the LOFOS system.

From equation above the cumulative mass during operating time is determined as
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
M=\int _{t1}^{t2} \dot{m} \left(t \right) dt = \frac{K}{\Sigma} \int _{t1}^{t2} F \left(t \right) dt = \frac{K}{\Sigma} \tilde{F} \quad ,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \tilde{F} &lt;/math&gt;  is the integral of Lorentz force  within the time process. From this equation and considering the specific  electrical  conductivity formula, one can derive the final equation to compute the electrical conductivity for the fluid, in the form

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\sigma = \rho K \frac{\tilde{F}}{M} \quad .
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

=== Time-of-flight Lorentz force velocimetry ===

[[File:ToFLFV2.jpg|right|thumb|Fig. 9 : Time-of-flight working principle. Taken from &lt;ref name="Jian2012"/&gt;]]

Time-of-flight Lorentz force velocimetry,&lt;ref name="Jian2012"&gt;Jian, D. and Karcher, C. 2012 "Electromagnetic flow measurements in liquid metals using time-of-flight Lorentz force velocimetry". ''Measurement Science and Technology'', 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vire2010"&gt;A. Viré, B. Knaepen, and A. Thess, "Lorentz force velocimetry based on time-of-flight measurements", ''Phys. Fluids'' 22, 125101 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; is intended for contactless determination of flow rate in conductive fluids. It can be successfully used even in case when such material properties as electrical conductivity or density are not precisely known under specific outer conditions. The last reason makes time-of-flight LFV especially important for industry application. According to time-of-flight LFV (Fig. 9) two coherent measurement systems are mounted on a channel one by one. The measurement is based on getting of cross-correlating function of signals, which are registered by two magnetic measurement's system. Every system consists of permanent magnet and force sensor, so inducing of Lorentz force and measurement of the reaction force are made simultaneously. Any cross-correlation function is useful only in case of qualitative difference between signals and for creating the difference in this case turbulent fluctuations are used. Before reaching of measurement zone of a channel liquid passes artificial vortex generator that induces strong disturbances in it. And when such fluctuation-vortex reaches magnetic field of measurement system we can observe a peak on its force-time characteristic while second system still measures stable flow. Then according to the time between peaks and the distance between measurement system observer can estimate mean velocity and, hence, flow rate of the liquid by equation:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;
Q_{flow} = k \frac{D}{\tau}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is the distance between magnet system, &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; the time delay between recorded peaks, and &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is obtained experimentally for every specific liquid, as shown in figure 9.

== Lorentz force eddy current testing ==

[[File:LET.png|right|thumb|Fig. 10 : LET working principle. Adapted from &lt;ref name="Zec2013"&gt;M. Zec et al., Fast Technique for Lorentz Force Calculations in Nondestructive Testing Applications, COMPUMAG 2013, Budapest, Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A different, albeit physically closely related challenge is the detection of deeply lying flaws and inhomogeneities in electrically conducting solid materials.

In the traditional version of eddy current testing an alternating (AC) magnetic field is used to induce eddy currents inside the material to be investigated. If the material contains a crack or flaw which make the spatial distribution of the electrical conductivity nonuniform, the path of the eddy currents is perturbed and the impedance of the coil which generates the AC magnetic field is modified. By measuring the impedance of this coil, a crack can hence be detected. Since the eddy currents are generated by an AC magnetic field, their penetration into the subsurface region of the material is limited by the [[skin effect]]. The applicability of the traditional version of eddy current testing is therefore limited to the analysis of the immediate vicinity of the surface of a material, usually of the order of one millimeter. Attempts to overcome this fundamental limitation using low frequency coils and superconducting magnetic field sensors have not led to widespread applications.

A recent technique, referred to as Lorentz force eddy current testing (LET),&lt;ref name="Zec2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uhlig2013"&gt;Uhlig, R. P., Zec, M., Brauer, H. and Thess, A. 2012 "Lorentz Force Eddy Current Testing:a Prototype Model". ''Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation'', 31, 357–372&lt;/ref&gt; exploits the advantages of applying DC magnetic fields and relative motion providing deep and relatively fast testing of electrically conducting materials. In principle, LET represents a modification of the traditional eddy current testing from which it differs in two aspects, namely (i) how eddy currents are induced and (ii) how their perturbation is detected. In LET eddy currents are generated by providing the relative motion between the conductor under test and a permanent magnet (see figure 10). If the magnet is passing by a defect, the Lorentz force acting on it shows a distortion whose detection is the key for the LET working principle. If the object is free of defects, the resulting Lorentz force remains constant.

== Advantages &amp; Limitations ==

The advantages of LFV are
* LFV is a non-contact techniques of flow rate measurement.
* LFV can be successfully applied for aggressive and high-temperature fluids like liquid metals.
* Mean flow rate or mean velocity of fluid can be obtained without depending on flow's inhomogeneities and zones of turbulence.

The limitations of the LFV are
* Necessity of temperature control of measurement system because of strong dependence of magnet's magnetic field on temperature. High temperature could cause irretrievable loss of the magnetic properties of permanent magnet (Curie temperature).
* Restriction of measurement zone by permanent magnet's dimensions.
* Necessity of liquid level's control in case of work with open channel.
* Rapid decay of the magnetic fields give rise to tiny forces on the magnet system.

The '''Madison Symmetric Torus''' ('''MST''') is a [[reversed field pinch]] (RFP) [[physics]] experiment with applications to both [[Fusion power|fusion energy]] research and [[astrophysical plasma]]s located at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. RFPs are significantly different from [[tokamak]]s (the most popular [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]] scheme) in that they tend to have a higher power density and better confinement characteristics for a given average magnetic field. RFPs also tend to be dominated by non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects. MST is one of the sites in the Center for Magnetic Self Organization (CMSO).

==Classification==
[[File:Madison Symmetric Torus.png|thumbnail|The geometry inside the Madison Symmetric Torus.&lt;ref&gt;Almagri, A. F., S. Assadi, S. C. Prager, J. S. Sarff, and D. W. Kerst. "Locked Modes and Magnetic Field Errors in the Madison Symmetric Torus." Physics of Fluids B: Plasma Physics 4.12 (1992): 4080.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As in most such experiments the MST plasma is a toroidal [[Pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]], which means the plasma is shaped like a donut and confined by a magnetic field generated by a large current flowing through it. MST falls into an unconventional class of machine called a reversed field pinch (RFP.) The RFP is so named because the toroidal magnetic field that permeates the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] spontaneously reverses direction near the edge.

A reversed field pinch is formed similarly to other toroidal pinch devices, by driving current through the plasma from an associated capacitor bank or other high-current power source. In a [[tokamak]] the toroidal field is much stronger than the poloidal field, but in an RFP it's just the opposite. In fact, in an RFP the externally applied toroidal field is switched off shortly after startup. The plasma in an RFP is also much closer to the wall than in a Tokamak. This permits a peculiar arrangement of the magnetic field lines, which will 'relax' into a new state such that the total magnetic energy in the plasma is minimized and the total [[magnetic helicity]] is conserved. The relaxed state, called a Taylor state, is marked by a peculiar arrangement of magnetic field lines where the toroidal magnetic field at the edge spontaneously reverses direction.

==Ongoing experiments in the MST program==

===Oscillating field current drive===

Like most toroidal confinement schemes, the RFP relies on a transient burst of current to create the plasma and the magnetic fields that confine it. But for the RFP to be a viable fusion energy candidate the plasma must be sustained by a steady state current source. OFCD is a scheme for driving a steady current in a relaxed plasma by adding sizable oscillating perturbations to the toroidal and poloidal fields injecting both power and helicity into the plasma.

A nonlinear reaction in the plasma combines the two oscillations in such a way that, on average, a steady
current is maintained.

===Pellet injection===
One of the challenges facing the RFP is fueling the hot core of the plasma directly, rather than relying on the deuterium gas
to seep in slowly from the edge. The Pellet Injector fires a frozen pellet of deuterium into the plasma using a blast of gas or
a mechanical punch. The pellet is vaporized and ionized as it travels into the core of the plasma.

===Pulsed poloidal current drive===
Every [[gradient]] is a source of free energy, especially if it's across a magnetic field. In MST the current is stronger
in the core than at the edge. This peaked current profile serves as a source of free energy for magnetic fluctuations
culminating in violent events in the plasma called [[Sawtooth wave|sawteeth]].

PPCD alleviates this effect by driving a current at the edge of the plasma, flattening the current profile. Small pulses
are added to the power supply currents that drive the toroidal field. The resultant pulsed toroidal magnetic field,
with the aid of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], creates a [[Toroidal and poloidal|poloidal]] electric field and hence a poloidal current. A great deal of research on MST is devoted to the study of this effect and its application for enhanced confinement.

===Neutral beam injection===
In order to initiate a sustained fusion reaction, it is usually necessary to use many methods to heat the plasma. Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) involves injecting a high energy beam of neutral atoms, typically hydrogen or deuterium, into the core of the plasma. These energetic atoms transfer their energy to the plasma, raising the overall temperature. The neutral atoms injected don't remain neutral. As the beam passes through the plasma, the atoms are ionized as they bounce off the ions in the plasma. Because the magnetic field inside the torus is bent into a circle, the fast ions are hoped to be confined in the background plasma. The confined fast ions are slowed down by the background plasma, the same way air resistance slows down a baseball. The energy transfer from the fast ions to the plasma increases the plasma temperature.
The actual injector can be seen from the observation window. It looks like a long silver cylinder laying on its side but tilted slightly downward against the torus near the back of the machine. When the injector is pulsed, 20,000 volts accelerates the beam to about 30 amperes of current for about 1.5 milliseconds.

Problems would occur if the fast ions aren't confined within the plasma long enough for them to deposit their energy. Magnetic fluctuations bedevil plasma confinement in this type of device by scrambling what we hoped were well behaved magnetic fields. If the fast ions are susceptible to this type of behavior, they can escape very quickly. However, there is evidence to suggest that they aren't.

===Electron Bernstein wave current drive===
EBW is an acronym for Electron Bernstein Wave and is named after the plasma physicist, Ira Bernstein.

Bernstein Wave Mode relates to a method of injecting ion or electron energy (IBW or EBW) into a plasma to increase its temperature in an attempt to reach fusion conditions. A plasma is a phase of matter which occurs naturally during lightning and electrical discharges and which is created artificially in fusion reactors to produce extremely high temperatures.

A [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716230359/http://plasmadictionary.llnl.gov/terms.lasso?-MaxRecords=1&amp;-SkipRecords=6&amp;-SortField=Term&amp;-SortOrder=ascending&amp;ABC=B&amp;page=detail definition] may be found in the Laurence Livermore Plasma dictionary.

This is an experiment on the MST to heat the plasma and to drive electric current inside the plasma.

There is a large electric current in the plasma inside this machine; it is responsible for creating the necessary magnetic fields to make the reversed field pinch configuration. It also heats the plasma very quickly — the same way wires inside your toaster get hot. Your toaster probably uses about 10 ampere of current, while the plasma in MST is heated by up to 600,000 amperes. But even though the plasma reaches over 10,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it is not hot enough for practical fusion energy and we need to find other ways to deposit energy into the plasma. The EBW is a way to inject microwave power to further heat the plasma. The standard microwave oven produces around 1&amp;nbsp;kW of power at a frequency of 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz; the EBW experiment is currently producing 150&amp;nbsp;kW at 3.6&amp;nbsp;GHz, and it is a goal of the team to upgrade to over 2 MW. To generate this type of power (on a low budget), decommissioned military radar equipment and home-made voltage power supplies are used.

The second (and perhaps more scientifically important) goal of the EBW experiment is to drive electric current in a
prescribed place within the plasma. The main plasma current distributes itself naturally, and the plasma tends to concentrate current
into the center, leaving less current near the edge. This can lead to instability of the plasma. It has been shown (both
theoretically and by experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus) that driving current in the edge makes the plasma more stable to fluctuations in the magnetic field, resulting in better confinement of the hot plasma and leading to much higher temperature. Using the EBW to drive this
stabilizing current would be a very important scientific result. The ability to deposit very specifically the auxiliary current
gives us the opportunity to optimize our current drive schemes. The heating is also very localized, allowing us to study how hot (at least locally) the plasma can become within this magnetic confinement scheme — in plasma physics terms, this is called finding the beta limit. This is an unanswered question for the RFP and will give insight on whether or not this type of machine could be scaled up to a cost effective, efficient fusion reactor.

===The heavy ion beam probe===
The Heavy Ion Beam Probe (HIBP) fires potassium ions into the plasma. By measuring their trajectory we get a profile of
several key properties inside the plasma.

This versatile diagnostics tool has been used in magnetic confinement fusion experiments to
determine the electric potential, electron density, electron temperature, and magnetic vector potential of the plasma.

A stream of sodium ions (the primary beam) is injected from the ion gun across the magnetic field
into the plasma. As the singly charged particles pass through the plasma, they are further ionized creating
the doubly charged secondary beam.

The secondaries are then detected and analyzed outside the plasma. By curving the trajectories, the magnetic field separates secondary
ions from primary ions. Because of this, only secondaries ionized at a given plasma position reach a given detector location.
This allows the HIBP to make measurements localized to the ionization position.
The secondary current is related to local electron density and the ionization cross-section of the primary ions, which is itself
a function of the electron temperature. The electric potential can be obtained from the energy difference between primary and secondary
ion beams. The energy of the secondary beam can be determined from the angle at which it enters the energy analyzer.

The MST-HIBP system consists of:

#A 200 keV electrostatic accelerator that forms, focuses and accelerates the diagnostic ion beam;
#The primary and secondary beamlines with sweep systems that provide beam transmission and steering;
#An [[electrostatic analyzer]] that measures the energy, intensity and position of the secondary beam;
#Auxiliary components and systems which include the primary beam detectors and the plasma/UV suppression structures, etc.

===Far infrared polarimetry-interferometry system===
FIR, or Far Infrared, refers to light with wavelengths between 1 and 10&amp;nbsp;mm. The FIR system in MST is based on the FIR lasers enclosed in the beige-colored laser safety room to the right of the picture shown, in the second floor hallway.
There are four FIR lasers in the system. One is a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser which produces a continuous power of about 120 W. This beam is then split in three. Each beam optically pumps a Formic Acid vapor laser operating at a wavelength of 432.6&amp;nbsp;mm, and a power of about 20&amp;nbsp;mW. The FIR system has 2 modes of operation: interferometry and polarimetry.

'''What does FIR diagnostic system measure?'''

The electron density, plasma current density, and magnetic field are three important plasma parameters of MST.
The FIR system is used to measure their spatial and temporal distributions.

'''How does FIR interferometry work?'''

Like glass, a plasma has a refractive index different from that of vacuum (or air) that depends on plasma electron density.
We send one laser beam through the plasma (the probe beam), one through the air (the reference beam), and measure the phase difference
between them. This experimental configuration is called a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The measured phase
is proportional to the average plasma electron density along the beam path.

In MST, we send multiple probe beams (blue lines in the figure) through the plasma at different radii. We then apply the
so-called Abel inversion technique to obtain a profile of the plasma electron density.

'''How does FIR polarimetry work?'''

A plasma is also an optically active media, meaning when a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is propagating parallel (or anti-parallel)
to the magnetic field, the polarization of the wave exiting the plasma will rotate a small angle.
This is called Faraday rotation, and the angle is called the Faraday rotation angle. The FIR
system measures the Faraday rotation, which is proportional to the line average of the electron density times the magnetic
field component parallel to the beam path.

The reason for Faraday rotation is as follows: When a linearly polarized wave is propagating along a magnetic field line,
it is de-composed into left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized components. The phase difference between them as they
exit the plasma causes the recombined linearly polarized wave to rotate its polarization direction. In MST, we launch two co-propagating, counter-rotating waves to probe the plasma. We then measure the phase difference between these two beams, which will be twice the Faraday rotation angle.

In the figure, each of the 11 blue probe beams is a combination of two counter-rotating, circularly polarized beams, measuring the Faraday rotation angles along the same chords as the interferometer does. The combined interferometer phases and Faraday rotation angles can then be combined to determine the poloidal magnetic field distribution. Using Ampere's law, the toroidal plasma current can be determined as well.

'''How well does the FIR diagnostic system work?'''

The FIR system for MST is very precise. The Faraday rotation angle for MST plasmas is typically
within 5 degrees. To measure such small signal, we have achieved an accuracy of 0.06 degree. The temporal resolution is less than 1 microsecond.

'''What are some of the research topics related to FIR?'''

FIR is an essential tool for most of the research topics in MST since it provides information about the basic plasma parameters. The system measures electron density, toroidal current, poloidal magnetic field, and the spatial profiles of each.

Currently, we are exploring the possibility of measuring toroidal magnetic field and poloidal plasma current by using the
plasma bi-refringence effect, or the Cotton-Mouton effect. When a linearly polarized EM wave is propagating perpendicular to
the magnetic field, the refractive index depends on whether the wave polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic
field direction.

'''Why choose FIR lasers?'''

For plasma polarimetry-interferometry, the wavelength we chose is sufficiently long to provide measurable plasma induced phase changes, but sufficiently short to avoid
complicated plasma-wave interactions, including the bending of the beam. There are many high power molecular laser lines available in this wavelength range, and many commercially available detectors.

===Thomson scattering===
'''What is Thomson Scattering?'''

Thomson scattering is the result of a collision between a photon (an electromagnetic wave) and a charged particle, such as an electron. When an electron and photon "collide" the electron feels a Lorentz force from the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the photon and is accelerated. This acceleration causes the electron to emit a different photon in a different direction. This emitted photon has a wavelength shifted from that of the incident photon by an amount dependent on the electron energy. Another way of looking at this is that the electron absorbs the energy of the photon and re emits the energy in the form of a different electromagnetic wave. This scattering of a photon by an electron is called Thomson Scattering.

'''How is Thomson Scattering useful to plasma physicists?'''

Since the wavelength of the scattered photon depends on the energy of the scattering electron, Thomson scattering is good way to measure the energy of an electron. This is done by creating a photon of known wavelength and measuring the wavelength of the scattered photon. The Thomson Scattering configuration at MST uses a 1064&amp;nbsp;nm Nd:YAG Laser System, which produces the best time-resolution electron temperature readings in the world.&lt;ref name=Hartog2010&gt;Pulse-burst laser systems for fast Thomson scattering. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 10D513 (2010); {{doi|10.1063/1.3475723}}&lt;/ref&gt; We create our photons with high power lasers that we shine into a window on the top of the MST, and collect scattered photons with a large collection lens on the side of the MST.

The wavelength distribution of the scattered photons tells us the energy distribution of the electrons in the plasma, giving us a direct unobtrusive way of getting the temperature of the electrons. The amount of photons we actually collect can also tell us something about the density of the electrons in the plasma.

===Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy and ion Doppler spectroscopy===
Fusion plasmas are typically generated from ionization of a neutral gas. In most cases, an isotope of hydrogen — called deuterium — is used as the plasma fuel. These plasmas are therefore primarily made up of deuterium ions (plus electrons), and it is necessary to diagnose the behavior of these ions if the relevant plasma physics is to be understood. However, in any fusion device, other types of ions ("impurities") are also present. These exist naturally due to the inability to achieve a perfect vacuum in a fusion reactor before fueling. Thus, materials such as water vapor, nitrogen, and carbon will be found in small amounts in typical plasma discharges. Impurities may also be generated during plasma discharges due to plasma-wall interactions. These interactions primarily cause material from the wall to be ejected into the plasma through sputtering. In the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST), properties of the impurity ions (e.g. carbon, oxygen, etc.) are closely linked to properties of the deuterium ions as a result of strong interaction between the ion species. Thus, impurity ion measurements can, in principle, provide direct information about the deuterium ions. Measurements of the impurity ion temperature (''T''&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt;) and flow velocity (''v''&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt;) are obtained on MST using Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy, or CHERS.

The CHERS process can be broken down into two separate steps: Charge Exchange and Radiative Decay. In the first stage, an electron is transferred from a neutral atom (e.g. deuterium) to an impurity ion that has no electrons (e.g. C&lt;SUP&gt;+6&lt;/SUP&gt;).
During this transfer, the electron typically winds up in an excited state (high energy level) of the impurity ion. As the electron decays down to the ground state (minimum energy level), energy conservation requires radiation to be emitted by the impurity ion. This emission has discrete values of energy, or wavelength, which correspond to the energy differences between the initial and final atomic levels of a particular electron transition. For example, consider charge exchange between a deuterium atom and a C&lt;SUP&gt;+6&lt;/SUP&gt; ion: if the electron is transferred to the ''n''=7 energy level of the carbon ion, then the ion will emit radiation at discrete energies given by the difference in energy between the ''n''=7 and ''n''=6 levels, the ''n''=6 and ''n''=5 levels, the ''n''=5 and ''n''=4 levels, and so on (down to ''n=1''). This line emission is Doppler-broadened as a result of ion thermal motion, and Doppler-shifted as a result of ion flow. The Doppler shift causes the emission to be blue-shifted (towards shorter wavelength/higher frequency) if the ions are moving towards the point of observation, or red-shifted (towards longer wavelength/lower frequency) if the flow is away from the point of observation. Measurements of the carbon emission line shape are therefore used to extract values for the impurity ion temperature and velocity.

''Charge Exchange'': H + C&lt;SUP&gt;+6&lt;/SUP&gt;  →

H&lt;SUP&gt;+1&lt;/SUP&gt; + C&lt;SUP&gt;+5&lt;/SUP&gt; (''n=7'', ''l=6'')

''Radiative decay'': C&lt;SUP&gt;+5&lt;/SUP&gt; (''n=7'', ''l=6'') →

C&lt;SUP&gt;+5&lt;/SUP&gt; (''n=6'', ''l=5'') + h (photon)

In a typical fusion device the neutral atom density is small. Therefore, the amount of radiated emission that results from charge exchange between impurity ions and neutrals is also small. On MST, the neutral density is enhanced by injection of fast hydrogen atoms via a diagnostic neutral beam (DNB). As a result, the radiated emission is greatly increased, though primarily along the beam injection path (the DNB is located below the deck, and cannot be seen from here; the injection path is from right to left across the plasma).
Perpendicular to the beam path, there exist a number of optical ports for viewing the plasma at different radial positions. For a given plasma discharge, a fiber bundle system is placed on one of these ports, and is used to collect emission along its line-of-sight (black tubes on top of the machine contain light collection optics; fibers are placed in the long, curved white tube when not in use). This emission is sent to a spectrometer (located in big purple box), where it is dispersed over a finite wavelength range — which is centered on the emission line of interest — by a pair of optical gratings. However, because the collected emission is dominated by radiation from along the beam path, the measurements are effectively localized to the intersection volume between the fiber view and the beam. On MST, this intersection volume is small (~ 2&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;) compared to the plasma volume, allowing spatially resolved measurements of ''T''&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt; and ''v''&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt; to be obtained. Data collected from a number of plasma discharges — for which the location of the fiber bundle system is varied — are used to construct radial profiles of the impurity ion temperature and velocity, providing important information for understanding the physics of plasmas in MST. Typical ion temperatures measured by CHERS on MST are in the range of 100 to 800 eV (2 million to 17 million degrees Fahrenheit), depending on position in the plasma and type of discharge. Likewise, measured equilibrium ion velocities are on the order of 1,000 to 10,000 meters per second.

Planck made many contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], which revolutionized human understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. In 1948 the German scientific institution the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]]  (of which Planck was twice president) was renamed the [[Max Planck Society]] (MPS). The MPS now includes 83 institutions representing a wide range of scientific directions.

==Early life and career==
Planck came from a traditional, intellectual family.  His paternal great-grandfather and grandfather were both theology professors in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]; his father was a law professor in [[University of Kiel|Kiel]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]].

Planck was born in [[Kiel]], [[Holstein]], to Johann Julius Wilhelm Planck and his second wife, Emma Patzig. He was baptized with the name of ''Karl Ernst Ludwig Marx Planck''; of his given names, ''Marx'' (a now obsolete variant of ''Markus'' or maybe simply an error for ''Max'', which is actually short for ''Maximilian'') was indicated as the [[German name#Forenames|"appellation name"]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Seidler, [http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,549404,00.html ''Gestatten, Marx Planck''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629070656/http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,549404,00.html |date=29 June 2011 }}, Spiegel Online, 24 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the age of ten he signed with the name ''Max'' and used this for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpg.de/bilderBerichteDokumente/dokumentation/pressemitteilungen/2008/pressemitteilung20080424/index.html Press release] of the [[Max Planck Society]] about Max Planck's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the 6th child in the family, though two of his siblings were from his father's first marriage. Among his earliest memories was the marching of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops into Kiel during the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864. In 1867 the family moved to [[Munich]], and Planck enrolled in the Maximilians [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] school, where he came under the tutelage of Hermann Müller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth, and taught him [[astronomy]] and [[mechanics]] as well as mathematics. It was from Müller that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy. Planck graduated early, at age 17.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica: Max Planck''&lt;/ref&gt; This is how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics.

Planck was gifted when it came to music. He took singing lessons and played piano, organ and cello, and composed songs and operas. However, instead of music he chose to study [[physics]].
[[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|left|upright|Planck as a young man, 1878]]

The Munich physics professor [[Philipp von Jolly]] advised Planck against going into physics, saying, "in this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lightman|first=Alan P.|title=The discoveries: great breakthroughs in twentieth-century science, including the original papers|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf Canada|location=Toronto|year=2005|isbn=0-676-97789-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planck replied that he did not wish to discover new things, but only to understand the known fundamentals of the field, and so began his studies in 1874 at the [[University of Munich]]. Under Jolly's supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the [[diffusion]] of [[hydrogen]] through heated [[platinum]], but transferred to [[theoretical physics]].

In 1877 he went to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms University]] in Berlin for a year of study with physicists [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and mathematician [[Karl Weierstrass]]. He wrote that Helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated endlessly, and bored his listeners, while Kirchhoff spoke in carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. He soon became close friends with Helmholtz. While there he undertook a program of mostly self-study of [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius's]] writings, which led him to choose thermodynamics as his field.

In October 1878 Planck passed his qualifying exams and in February 1879 defended his dissertation, ''Über den zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen Wärmetheorie'' (''On the second law of thermodynamics''). He briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in Munich.

In June 1880, he presented his [[habilitation]] thesis, ''Gleichgewichtszustände isotroper Körper in verschiedenen Temperaturen'' (''Equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different temperatures'').

===Academic career===
With the completion of his habilitation thesis, Planck became an unpaid [[Privatdozent]] (German academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant professor) in Munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position. Although he was initially ignored by the academic community, he furthered his work on the field of [[theory of heat|heat theory]] and discovered one after another the same [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]]al formalism as [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] without realizing it. Clausius's ideas on [[entropy]] occupied a central role in his work.

In April 1885 the [[University of Kiel]] appointed Planck as associate professor of [[theoretical physics]]. Further work on entropy and its treatment, especially as applied in [[physical chemistry]], followed.  He published his ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'' in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Vorlesungen über Thermodynamik|year=1897|publisher=Verlag Von Veit &amp; Company|location=Leipzig|url=http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/31564|accessdate=27 June 2012}}  English translation:  {{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Treatise on Thermodynamics|year=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4sJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Treatise+on+Thermodynamics|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a thermodynamic basis for [[Svante Arrhenius]]'s theory of [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]].

In 1889 he was named the successor to Kirchhoff's position at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-bio.html |title=Max Planck - Biographical |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Prize Organisation |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – presumably thanks to Helmholtz's intercession – and by 1892 became a full professor. In 1907 Planck was offered [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s position in [[Vienna]], but turned it down to stay in Berlin. During 1909, as a University of Berlin professor, he was invited to become the Ernest Kempton Adams Lecturer in Theoretical Physics at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. A series of his lectures were translated and co-published by Columbia University professor [[Albert Potter Wills|A. P. Wills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Hadamard|title=Four lectures on mathematics: delivered at Columbia University in 1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ck8qAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7|accessdate=5 July 2011|year=1915|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from Berlin on 10 January 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Max Planck — Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/about/history/nobel-laureates/planck/|website=www.hu-berlin.de|accessdate=15 May 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erwin Schrödinger — Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|url=https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/about/history/nobel-laureates/schroedinger|website=www.hu-berlin.de|accessdate=15 May 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
In March 1887 Planck married Marie Merck (1861–1909), sister of a school fellow, and moved with her into a sublet apartment in Kiel. They had four children: Karl (1888–1916), the twins Emma (1889–1919) and Grete (1889–1917), and [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] (1893–1945).

After the apartment in Berlin, the Planck family lived in a villa in Berlin-Grunewald, Wangenheimstrasse 21. Several other professors from [[University of Berlin]] lived nearby, among them theologian [[Adolf von Harnack]], who became a close friend of Planck. Soon the Planck home became a social and cultural center. Numerous well-known scientists, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]] were frequent visitors. The tradition of jointly performing music had already been established in the home of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]].

After several happy years, in July 1909 Marie Planck died, possibly from [[tuberculosis]]. In March 1911 Planck married his second wife, Marga von Hoesslin (1882–1948); in December his fifth child Hermann was born.

During the [[First World War]] Planck's second son Erwin was taken prisoner by the French in 1914, while his oldest son Karl was killed in action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. Grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child. Her sister died the same way two years later, after having married Grete's widower. Both granddaughters survived and were named after their mothers. Planck endured these losses stoically.

In January 1945, [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]], to whom he had been particularly close, was sentenced to death by the [[Nazi]] [[People's Court (German)|Volksgerichtshof]] because of his participation in the [[July 20 plot|failed attempt to assassinate Hitler]] in July 1944. Erwin was executed on 23 January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jürgen Heideking|author2=Christof Mauch|title=American Intelligence and the German Resistance to Hitler: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xoTWkzhf2uUC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=5 October 1998|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-3636-7|pages=361–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor at Berlin University===
As a professor at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin]], Planck joined the local Physical Society. He later wrote about this time: "In those days I was essentially the only theoretical physicist there, whence things were not so easy for me, because I started mentioning entropy, but this was not quite fashionable, since it was regarded as a mathematical spook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Max Planck Wirkungsquantums 20050815.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]:  "Max Planck, discoverer of the elementary quantum of action ''h'', taught in this building from 1889 to 1928."]]

Planck started a six-semester course of lectures on theoretical physics, "dry, somewhat impersonal" according to [[Lise Meitner]], "using no notes, never making mistakes, never faltering; the best lecturer I ever heard" according to an English participant, [[J. R. Partington|James R. Partington]], who continues: "There were always many standing around the room. As the lecture-room was well heated and rather close, some of the listeners would from time to time drop to the floor, but this did not disturb the lecture". Planck did not establish an actual "school"; the number of his graduate students was only about 20, among them:

===Black-body radiation===
In 1894 Planck turned his attention to the problem of [[black-body radiation]]. He had been commissioned by electric companies to create maximum light from [[lightbulb]]s with minimum energy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: "how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]] (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the [[frequency]] of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?". The question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment agreed with experimental values. [[Wilhelm Wien]] proposed [[Wien approximation|Wien's law]], which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies. The [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]], another approach to the problem, created what was later known as the "[[ultraviolet catastrophe]]", but contrary to many textbooks this was not a motivation for Planck.&lt;ref name="Kragh"&gt;For a solid approach to the complexity of Planck's intellectual motivations for the quantum, for his reluctant acceptance of its implications, see Helge Kragh, 
[https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary/ Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary], ''Physics World''. December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Planck's first proposed solution to the problem in 1899 followed from what Planck called the "principle of elementary disorder", which allowed him to derive Wien's law from a number of assumptions about the entropy of an ideal oscillator, creating what was referred-to as the [[Wien–Planck law]]. Soon it was found that experimental evidence did not confirm the new law at all, to Planck's frustration. Planck revised his approach, deriving the first version of the famous [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|Planck black-body radiation law]], which described the experimentally observed black-body spectrum well. It was first proposed in a meeting of the DPG on 19 October 1900 and published in 1901. This first derivation did not include energy quantisation, and did not use [[statistical mechanics]], to which he held an aversion. In November 1900, Planck revised this first approach, relying on [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s statistical interpretation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law. As Planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of Boltzmann's approach, his recourse to them was, as he later put it, "an act of despair ... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics."&lt;ref name="Kragh"/&gt;

The central assumption behind his new derivation, presented to the DPG on 14 December 1900, was the supposition, now known as the [[Planck postulate]], that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit:

:&lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''h''}} is [[Planck's constant]], also known as Planck's action quantum (introduced already in 1899), and {{math|''ν''}} is the frequency of the radiation. Note that the elementary units of energy discussed here are represented by {{math|''hν''}} and not simply by {{math|''ν''}}. Physicists now call these quanta photons, and a photon of frequency {{math|''ν''}} will have its own specific and unique energy. The total energy at that frequency is then equal to {{math|''hν''}} multiplied by the number of photons at that frequency.

[[File:Max Planck (Nobel 1918).jpg|thumb|upright|Planck in 1918, the year he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]]]
At first Planck considered that quantisation was only "a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it..."; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with [[classical physics]], is regarded as the birth of [[quantum physics]] and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]] had been discussing in a theoretical paper in 1877 the possibility that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete). The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the Planck length and the Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of Planck's fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918 (he actually received the award in 1919).&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, Helge (1 December 2000), Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary, PhysicsWorld.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1918|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Planck tried to grasp the meaning of energy quanta, but to no avail. "My unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me much trouble." Even several years later, other physicists like [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]], [[James Jeans|Jeans]], and [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] set Planck's constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but Planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value. "I am unable to understand Jeans' stubbornness – he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as [[Hegel]] was for philosophy. So much the worse for the facts if they don't fit."&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&amp;pg=PA8 page 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Born]] wrote about Planck: "He was, by nature, a conservative mind; he had nothing of the revolutionary and was thoroughly skeptical about speculations. Yet his belief in the compelling force of logical reasoning from facts was so strong that he did not flinch from announcing the most revolutionary idea which ever has shaken physics."&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

===Einstein and the theory of relativity===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Max-Planck-und-Albert-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Max Planck presents [[Albert Einstein]] with the Max-Planck medal, Berlin 28 June 1929]] --&gt;
In 1905, the three epochal papers by [[Albert Einstein]] were published in the journal ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''. Planck was among the few who immediately recognized the significance of the [[special theory of relativity]]. Thanks to his influence, this theory was soon widely accepted in Germany. Planck also contributed considerably to extend the special theory of relativity. For example, he recast the theory in terms of classical [[Action (physics)|action]].&lt;ref&gt;''Einstein and the Quantum'', A.Douglas Stone, Princeton University Press, Princeton and Oxford, chapter 9, ''Tripping the light heuristic'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein's hypothesis of light ''quanta'' ([[photons]]), based on [[Heinrich Hertz#Electromagnetic research|Heinrich Hertz's]] 1887 discovery (and further investigation by [[Philipp Lenard#Photoelectric investigations|Philipp Lenard]]) of the [[photoelectric effect]], was initially rejected by Planck. He was unwilling to discard completely [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electrodynamics]]. "The theory of light would be thrown back not by decades, but by centuries, into the age when [[Christiaan Huygens]] dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of [[Isaac Newton]] ..."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1910, Einstein pointed out the anomalous behavior of [[specific heat]] at low temperatures as another example of a phenomenon which defies explanation by classical physics. Planck and [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]], seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions, organized the First [[Solvay Conference]] (Brussels 1911). At this meeting Einstein was able to convince Planck.

Meanwhile, Planck had been appointed dean of Berlin University, whereby it was possible for him to call Einstein to Berlin and establish a new professorship for him (1914). Soon the two scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music together.

===First World War===
At the onset of the [[First World War]] Planck endorsed the general excitement of the public, writing that, "Besides much that is horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic political problems by the unification of all parties (and) ... the extolling of everything good and noble."&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&amp;pg=PA72 page 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Planck refrained from the extremes of nationalism. In 1915, at a time when Italy was about to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], he voted successfully for a scientific paper from Italy, which received a prize from the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], where Planck was one of four permanent presidents.

Planck also signed the infamous "[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|Manifesto of the 93 intellectuals]]", a pamphlet of polemic war propaganda (while Einstein retained a strictly pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, being spared by his [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] citizenship). But in 1915 Planck, after several meetings with Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]], revoked parts of the Manifesto. Then in 1916 he signed a declaration against German [[wikt:annexationism|annexationism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Post-war and the Weimar Republic===
In the turbulent post-war years, Planck, now the highest authority of German physics, issued the slogan "persevere and continue working" to his colleagues.

In October 1920 he and [[Fritz Haber]] established the ''[[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft]]'' (Emergency Organization of German Science), aimed at providing financial support for scientific research. A considerable portion of the money the organization would distribute was raised abroad.

Planck also held leading positions at Berlin University, the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the German Physical Society and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (which in 1948 became the [[Max Planck Society]]). During this time economic conditions in Germany were such that he was hardly able to conduct research. In 1926 Planck became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002335 |title=Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858–1947) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interwar period, Planck became a member of the Deutsche Volks-Partei ([[German People's Party]]), the party of Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Gustav Stresemann]], which aspired to liberal aims for domestic policy and rather revisionistic aims for politics around the world.

Planck disagreed with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] and later expressed the view that the Nazi dictatorship resulted from "the ascent of the rule of the crowds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Quantum mechanics===
[[File:Nernst, Einstein, Planck, Millikan, Laue in 1931.jpg|thumb|330px|From left to right: [[Walther Nernst|W. Nernst]], [[Albert Einstein|A. Einstein]], '''''M. Planck''''', [[Robert Andrews Millikan|R.A. Millikan]] and [[Max von Laue|von Laue]] at a dinner given by von Laue in Berlin on 11 November 1931]]
At the end of the 1920s [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] had worked out the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, but it was rejected by Planck, and by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Max von Laue|Laue]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] as well. Planck expected that [[Schrödinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]] would soon render quantum theory—his own child—unnecessary. This was not to be the case, however. Further work only cemented quantum theory, even against his and Einstein's philosophical revulsions. Planck experienced the truth of his own earlier observation from his struggle with the older views in his younger years: "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi dictatorship and the Second World War===
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Planck was 74. He witnessed many Jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrated from [[Nazi Germany]]. Again he tried to "persevere and continue working" and asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in Germany. Nevertheless, he did help his nephew, the economist [[Hermann Kranold]] to emigrate to [[London]] after his arrest.&lt;ref name="IJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Johanna Kranold Stein|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theithacajournal/obituary.aspx?n=johanna-kranold-stein&amp;pid=87920213|website=Ithaca Journal|publisher=Legacy.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would improve.

[[Otto Hahn]] asked Planck to gather well-known German professors in order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of Jewish professors, but Planck replied, "If you are able to gather today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and speak against it, because they are eager to take over the positions of the others."&lt;ref&gt;In a slightly different translation, Hahn remembers Planck saying:  "If you bring together 30 such men today, then tomorrow 150 will come to denounce them because they want to take their places."  This translated quote is found in:  Heilbron, 2000, p. 150. Heilbron, at the end of the paragraph, on p. 151, cites the following references to Hahn’s writings:  Otto Hahn ''Einige persönliche Erinnerungen an Max Planck'' MPG, ''Mitteilungen'' (1957) p. 244, and Otto Hahn ''My Life'' (Herder and Herder, 1970) p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Planck's leadership, the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (KWG) avoided open conflict with the Nazi regime, except concerning [[Fritz Haber]]. Planck tried to discuss the issue with [[Adolf Hitler]] but was unsuccessful. In the following year, 1934, Haber died in exile.

One year later, Planck, having been the president of the KWG since 1930, organized in a somewhat provocative style an official commemorative meeting for Haber. He also succeeded in secretly enabling a number of Jewish scientists to continue working in institutes of the KWG for several years. In 1936, his term as president of the KWG ended, and the Nazi government pressured him to refrain from seeking another term.

As the political climate in Germany gradually became more hostile, [[Johannes Stark]], prominent exponent of [[Deutsche Physik]] ("German Physics", also called "Aryan Physics") attacked Planck, [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] and Heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], calling them "white Jews". The "Hauptamt Wissenschaft" (Nazi government office for science) started an investigation of Planck's ancestry, claiming that he was "1/16 Jewish", but Planck himself denied it.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&amp;pg=PA191 page 191]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stadtfriedhof Göttingen Max Planck Familie.jpg|thumb|Max Planck's grave in Göttingen]]
In 1938, Planck celebrated his 80th birthday. The DPG held a celebration, during which the Max-Planck medal (founded as the highest medal by the DPG in 1928) was awarded to French physicist [[Louis de Broglie]]. At the end of 1938, the Prussian Academy lost its remaining independence and was taken over by Nazis (''[[Gleichschaltung]]''). Planck protested by resigning his presidency. He continued to travel frequently, giving numerous public talks, such as his talk on Religion and Science, and five years later he was sufficiently fit to climb 3,000-metre peaks in the [[Alps]].

During the [[Second World War]] the increasing number of Allied bombing missions against Berlin forced Planck and his wife to temporarily leave the city and live in the countryside. In 1942 he wrote: "In me an ardent desire has grown to persevere this crisis and live long enough to be able to witness the turning point, the beginning of a new rise." In February 1944 his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. His rural retreat was threatened by the rapid advance of the Allied armies from both sides.

In 1944, Planck's son [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] was arrested following the attempted assassination of Hitler in the [[20 July plot]]. Erwin consequently died at the hands of the [[Gestapo]]; his death destroyed much of Max Planck's will to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nobel.brainparad.com/max_karl_ernst_ludwig_planck.html |title=Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck |accessdate=2010-06-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512151051/http://physics.nobel.brainparad.com/max_karl_ernst_ludwig_planck.html |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war Planck, his second wife, and his son by her were brought to a relative in [[Göttingen]], where Planck died on 4 October 1947.

==Religious views==
Planck was a member of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Dinkler, ''Planck, Max'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Third Edition, Volume V, Tübingen (Germany), 1961, col. 404-405&lt;/ref&gt; However, Planck was very tolerant towards alternative views and [[religions]].&lt;ref name="adherents.com"&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/people/pp/Max_Planck.html The Religious Affiliation of Physicist Max Planck]. adherents.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a lecture in 1937 entitled "Religion und Naturwissenschaft" he suggested the importance of these symbols and rituals related directly with a believer's ability to worship God, but that one must be mindful that the symbols provide an imperfect illustration of divinity. He criticized atheism for being focused on the derision of such symbols, while at the same time warned of the over-estimation of the importance of such symbols by believers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Max_Planck.aspx The Life Max Planck]. encyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was favorable to all religions, but he himself chose Christianity. He did, however, regret the Church's demands for unquestioning belief, which served to repel questioners. For example, he believed "the faith in miracles must yield, step by step, before the steady and firm advance of the facts of science, and its total defeat is undoubtedly a matter of time." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pp/Max_Planck.html|title=The religion of Max Planck, physicist|website=www.adherents.com|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1937 lecture "Religion and Naturwissenschaft," Planck expressed the view that God is everywhere present, and held that "the holiness of the unintelligible Godhead is conveyed by the holiness of symbols." Atheists, he thought, attach too much importance to what are merely symbols. Planck was a churchwarden from 1920 until his death, and believed in an almighty, all-knowing, beneficent God (though not necessarily a personal one). Both science and religion wage a "tireless battle against skepticism and dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition" with the goal "toward God!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pp/Max_Planck.html|title=The religion of Max Planck, physicist|website=www.adherents.com|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Planck said in 1944, "As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent spirit (orig. geist). This spirit is the matrix of all matter."&lt;ref&gt;Das Wesen der Materie [The Nature of Matter], speech at Florence, Italy (1944) (from Archiv zur Geschichte der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Abt. Va, Rep. 11 Planck, Nr. 1797)&lt;/ref&gt;

Planck regarded the scientist as a man of imagination and Christian faith. He said: "Both religion and science require a belief in God. For believers, God is in the beginning, and for physicists He is at the end of all considerations… To the former He is the foundation, to the latter, the crown of the edifice of every generalized world view".&lt;ref&gt;Religion and Natural Science (Lecture Given 1937) Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, trans. F. Gaynor (New York, 1949), pp. 184 (from http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Max_Planck)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Planck wrote, "...'to believe' means 'to recognize as a truth,' and the knowledge of nature, continually advancing on incontestably safe tracks, has made it utterly impossible for a person possessing some training in natural science to recognize as founded on truth the many reports of extraordinary occurrences contradicting the laws of nature, of miracles which are still commonly regarded as essential supports and confirmations of religious doctrines, and which formerly used to be accepted as facts pure and simple, without doubt or criticism. The belief in miracles must retreat step by step before relentlessly and reliably progressing science and we cannot doubt that sooner or later it must vanish completely."&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Planck's views on God were that of a [[deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dilemmas of an Upright Man: Max Planck and the Fortunes of German Science|year=1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674004399|author=J. L. Heilbron|page=198|quote=On the other side, Church spokesmen could scarcely become enthusiastic about Planck's deism, which omitted all reference to established religions and had no more doctrinal content than Einstein's Judaism. It seemed useful therefore to paint the lily, to improve the lesson of Planck's life for the use of proselytizers and to associate the deanthropomorphizer of science with a belief in a traditional Godhead.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, six months before his death a rumour started that Planck had converted to [[Catholicism]], but when questioned what had brought him to make this step, he declared that, although he had always been deeply religious, he did not believe "in a personal God, let alone a Christian God."&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&amp;pg=PA198 page 198]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myrmekite''' describes a [[wikt:vermicular|vermicular]], or wormy, [[Rock microstructure#Graphic and other intergrowth textures|intergrowth]] of [[quartz]] in [[plagioclase]]. The intergrowths are microscopic in scale, typically with maximum dimensions less than 1 millimeter. The [[plagioclase]] is [[sodium]]-rich, usually [[albite]] or [[oligoclase]].  These quartz-plagioclase intergrowths are associated with and commonly in contact with [[potassium]] [[feldspar]]. Myrmekite is formed under [[Metasomatism|metasomatic conditions]], usually in conjunction with tectonic [[deformation (engineering)|deformations]]. It has to be clearly separated from [[micrographic texture|micrographic]] and [[granophyre|granophyric]] intergrowths, which are [[magma]]tic.

== Etymology ==
The word myrmekite is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] '''μὑρμηχἰα''' (wart) or '''μὑρμηξ''' (ant) and was used by [[Jakob Sederholm]] in 1899 for the first time to describe these structures.

== Myrmekite formed during K-metasomatism ==
{{stack|[[File:Rim myrmekite.gif|thumb|Rim myrmekite on zoned [[plagioclase]] against interstitial [[microcline]] (gray and black)]]
[[File:Wartlike myrmekite.gif|thumb|Wartlike myrmekite in megacrystal [[quartz monzonite]] from Twentynine Palms, California]]
[[File:Ghost myrmekite.gif|thumb|Ghost myrmekite in Mount Rubidoux [[leucogranite]]]]}}
During K-metasomatism of plagioclase several different types of myrmekite can appear:
* ''rim myrmekite''
* ''wartlike myrmekite''
* ''ghost myrmekite''

=== Rim myrmekite ===
This is the initial stage of [[potassium|K]]-[[metasomatism]] in [[Cataclastic rock|cataclastically]]-deformed [[magma]]tic plutonic rocks. The breakage happens primarily along [[grain boundary]] seals and the K-metasomatism may locally replace rims of zoned [[plagioclase]] crystals to form interstitial [[alkali feldspar]] and ''rim myrmekite'' (see illustration).

=== Wartlike myrmekite ===
When tectonic strains increase and the cataclasis becomes more intense interior breakage in the crystals ensues and albite-twinned plagioclase crystals are bent. The K-metasomatism therefore can reach deeper into the crystals and increase its effects. Nearly complete to complete replacement of plagioclase takes place and leads to the formation of ''wartlike myrmekite'' in places where the replacement was incomplete. The illustration shows tartan-twinned microcline having completely replaced plagioclase. The places with incomplete replacement are taken up by wartlike myrmekite.

Gradations occur from rocks containing exclusively rim myrmekite to those containing both rim myrmekite and wartlike myrmekite and finally to those containing exclusively wartlike myrmekite.

A very important observation is that the maximum coarseness (tubular diameter) of the [[quartz]] vermicules shows a strong correlation with the [[calcium|Ca]] content of the plagioclase in the original, unreplaced, non-myrmekite-bearing magmatic rock. The coarsest vermicules occur in the 
metasomatized rock where the original plagioclase was the most calcic.

An example for the formation of wartlike myrmekite can be found at the [[Twentynine Palms, California]] [[quartz monzonite]] which issued from an older, yet undated [[diorite]].

=== Ghost myrmekite ===
This is the third type of quartz-feldspar intergrowth in metasomatic [[granite|granitoids]]. Again this process depends on tectonically deformed crystals. In this particular case an irregular subtraction of Ca, Na and [[aluminium|Al]] from deformed plagioclase happens which causes an imbalance in the relative amounts of residual Al and [[silicon|Si]]. More Si remains than can fit into the lattice structure of the alkali feldspar that replaces the plagioclase. The result is ''ghost myrmekite'' – either as tiny quartz ovoids in remnant [[albite]] islands in the alkali feldspar or as tiny quartz ovoids as clusters without albite hosts in the alkali feldspar (see illustration).

Examples for this structure are found in California in the [[Mount Rubidoux]] [[leucogranite]] and in [[granodiorite]]s in the [[Sierra Nevada (California)|Sierra Nevada]].

== Myrmekite formed during Ca-metasomatism ==
During Ca- metasomatism myrmekite can be formed under different circumstances:
* Ca-metasomatism of deformed K-feldspar in magmatic rocks
* Ca-metasomatism of deformed K-feldspar in [[charnockite]]s
* Ca-metasomatism of deformed plagioclase in [[anorthosite]]s

=== Ca-metasomatism of deformed K-feldspar in magmatic rocks ===
[[File:Ca-myrmekite.gif|thumb|Fractured [[alkali feldspar]] filled with central quartz and myrmekite during Ca-metasomatism]]
Here Ca-bearing fluids enter primary alkali feldspar through cracks and react with the alkali feldspar. Through this reaction cracks are filled with quartz and myrmekite. The replacement reactions can affect large portions (&gt; 60%) of the primary alkali feldspar. An important distinctive feature of this type of myrmekite formation is the constant thickness of the vermicules, whereas in the K-metasomatism their thickness changes as a function of the Ca-content of the plagioclase and they also taper towards the alkali feldspar.

An example for this type of Ca-metasomatism is found in a megacrystal granite near [[Alastaro]] in [[Finland]].

=== Ca-metasomatism of deformed K-feldspar in charnockites ===
The process stays the same, the only difference being the country rocks the Ca-bearing fluids act upon. Charnockites distinguish themselves from ordinary granitoids by the appearance of [[orthopyroxene]] ([[hypersthene]]) and can also be of [[metamorphism|metamorphic]] origin.

An example for this type of Ca-metasomatism is found in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;Perchuk, L. L., Gerya, T. V., and Korsman, K., 1994, A model for charnockitization of gneissic complexes: Petrology, v. 2, p. 395-423.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ca-metasomatism of deformed plagioclase in anorthosites ===
In this type of Ca-metasomatism instead of the alkali feldspar it is the ubiquitous plagioclase that gets attacked by the Ca-bearing fluids. The resulting myrmekite also shows vermicules with constant thickness but unlike in the first case the vermicules formed in anorthosites can taper locally to the primary, non-quartz-bearing plagioclase. This behaviour can be explained by the incorporation of Na demanding more silica in the feldspar lattice.

Examples are found in [[Layered intrusion|layered igneous complexes]].&lt;ref&gt;Iskandar Taib, L. R., and Brown, G. M., 1967, Layered Igneous Rocks. San Francisco, Freeman and Company, 588 p. {{ISBN|978-0-05-001763-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myrmekite formed during Na-Ca-metasomatism ==
[[File:Myrmekite LyonMtn.gif|thumb|Myrmekite replacing K-feldspar in perthite during Na-Ca-metasomatism, showing isolated quartz vermicules of irregular shape. Lyon Mountain granite gneiss, Ausable Forks, New York]]
A first variety of this type of metasomatism affects only [[enclave]]s within a granitoid. Here the influx of Na-rich fluids in the temperature range 450&amp;nbsp;°C to 650&amp;nbsp;°C from the host leads to the replacement of alkali feldspar by myrmekite within the enclaves. During this process a reequilibration with the Na-poorer feldspars (plagioclase) in the enclaves takes place. As a consequence Ca gets released in plagioclase which in turn can now react upon K-feldspar to form myrmekite. Basically this process is very similar to the Ca-metasomatism on K-feldspar described above except for the Na-fluids acting as a trigger.

An example is the [[Velay granite]] in the northeastern [[Massif Central]] in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, D., Pascal, M-L., and Roux, J., 1996, Hydrothermal replacement of feldspars in igneous enclaves of the Velay granite and the genesis of myrmekite: European Journal of Mineralogy, v. 8, p. 703-711.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second variety Na- and Ca-bearing fluids truly act together. This leads via the replacement of primary K-feldspar (perthitic and non-perthitic microcline) to the formation of plagioclase (albite or oligoclase) and in certain places also to the formation of myrmekite. The myrmekite does not show wartlike tapering vermicules, but vermicules that are nearly constant in size because the host plagioclase containing the quartz vermicules has nearly a constant Na/Ca composition. These vermicules are confined and scattered entirely within the interior of the plagioclase forming irregular spindles, arcuate patterns and ovals.

For this process to operate it is important that Ca is sufficiently present so that a fairly calcic plagioclase can be formed which in turn releases enough silica for the myrmekite vermicules. If only Na is present then no myrmekite will form.

An example can be found in the [[Lyon Mountain granite gneiss]] north of [[Ausable Forks]] in [[New York (state)|New York]].

== Myrmekite formed during progressive deformation ==
During progressive deformation in [[mylonite|mylonitic]], ductile [[shear zone]]s myrmekite is commonly concentrated in shortening quarters in the rim of sigmoidal K-feldspar crystals.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, C. and Wintsch, R. P., 1989, Evidence for deformation-induced K-feldspar replacement by myrmekite: J. Metam. Geol., v. 7, p. 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson and Wintsch (1989) explain the asymmetric distribution of myrmekite by a preferential proceeding of the K-feldspar breakdown reaction at sites of high differential [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] (stress-concentration sites) during [[metamorphism|retrograde metamorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, D., 1993, Igneous and metamorphic rocks under the microscope: Chapman and Hall, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Internally the arrangement of the quartz vermicules in the myrmekites also shows a [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] symmetry, which independently can serve as an internal [[shear (geology)|shear sense]] indicator. Asymmetric myrmekite is therefore a [[quarter structure]].

Yet [[Lorence G. Collins]] does not agree with the assumption of the K-feldspar being primary magmatic and the myrmekite being formed due to deformation-induced Na-Ca-metasomatism. His sampling beyond the shear zone revealed an undeformed, felsic [[diorite|biotite diorite]]  whose primary plagioclase was being replaced from the inside out by K-feldspar due to K-metasomatism. The deformations were therefore more or less continuous and had not only affected the shear zone but also the older plutonic country rocks, thence bringing about a metasomatic change in mineralogy.

== Occurrence ==
Myrmekite can appear in many different rock types and different geologic settings. Typically it occurs in [[granite]]s and similar [[igneous rock]]s (granitoids, [[diorite]]s, [[gabbro]]s) and in [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[gneiss]]es similar to granite in composition. It can also occur in [[mylonite]]s, in [[anorthosite]]s and the orthopyroxene-bearing [[charnockite]]s.

==Formation==
These characteristic intergrowths have been explained in a variety of ways:

* One explanation is Castle &amp; Lindsley's exsolution silica-pump model.&lt;ref&gt;Castle, R. O., and Lindsley, D. H., 1993, An exsolution silica-pump model for the origin of myrmekite. Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology, v. 115, pages 58-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the [[Rock microstructure|texture]] was created as plagioclase formed by [[exsolution]] from [[feldspar|alkali feldspar]] during cooling, under conditions in which [[silicon]] was mobile in the rock. The process does not require that [[magma]] be present during myrmekite formation.
* L.G. Collins explains the formation of myrmekite by:
** the K-metasomatic replacement of deformed primary plagioclase by secondary K-feldspar
** different varieties of Ca- and Na-Ca-metasomatism acting mainly upon deformed primary alkali feldspar, an exception being the replacement of deformed plagioclase in anorthosite.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2009 }}

[[File:DragRacerPurgingNitrousOxide.jpg|thumb|right|A performance vehicle using a nitrous oxide purging system]]

A '''nitrous oxide engine''' is an engine which requires oxygen for burning the fuel in order to create power (mainly stems from the decomposition of [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) rather than air). The system increases the [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine's]] power output by allowing fuel to be burned at a higher-than-normal rate, because of the higher [[partial pressure]] of oxygen injected with the fuel mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2011/09/27/nitrous-everything-you-need-to-know/|title=Nitrous: Everything You Need to Know|publisher=Automoblog.net |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrous injection systems may be "dry", where the nitrous oxide is injected separately from fuel, or "wet" in which additional fuel is carried into the engine along with the nitrous. Nitrous oxide systems may not be permitted for street or highway use, depending on local regulations. Nitrous oxide use is permitted in certain classes of auto racing. Reliable operation of an engine with nitrous injection requires careful attention to the strength of engine components and to the accuracy of the mixing systems, otherwise destructive detonations or exceeding engineered component maximums may occur. Nitrous oxide injection systems were applied as early as World War II for certain aircraft engines.

==Terminology==
In the context of racing, nitrous oxide is often termed '''nitrous''' or '''NOS'''. The term NOS is derived from the initials of the company name [[Nitrous Oxide Systems]], one of the pioneering companies in the development of nitrous oxide injection systems for automotive performance use.

==Mechanism==
When a [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of nitrous oxide decomposes, it releases half a mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (oxygen gas), and one mole of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (nitrogen gas). This decomposition allows an oxygen concentration of 36.36% to be reached. Nitrogen gas is non-combustible and does not support combustion. [[Earth's atmosphere|Air]]—which contains only 21% oxygen, the rest being nitrogen and other equally non-combustible and non-combustion-supporting gasses—permits a 12-percent-lower maximum-oxygen level than that of nitrous oxide. This oxygen supports combustion; it combines with fuels such as gasoline, alcohol, [[diesel fuel]], propane, or CNG to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water vapor, along with heat, which causes the former two products of combustion to expand and exert pressure on pistons, driving the engine.

Nitrous oxide is stored as a liquid in tanks, but is a gas under atmospheric conditions. When injected as a liquid into an inlet manifold, the vaporization and expansion causes a reduction in air/fuel charge temperature with an associated increase in density, thereby increasing the cylinder's [[volumetric efficiency]].

As the decomposition of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into oxygen and nitrogen gas is [[exothermic]] and thus contributes to a higher temperature in the combustion engine, the decomposition increases engine efficiency and performance, which is directly related to the difference in temperature between the unburned fuel mixture and the hot combustion gasses produced in the cylinders. 

All systems are based on a single stage kit, but these kits can be used in multiples (called two-, three-, or even four-stage kits). The most advanced systems are controlled by an electronic progressive delivery unit that allows a single kit to perform better than multiple kits can. Most Pro Mod and some Pro Street drag race cars use three stages for additional power, but more and more are switching to pulsed progressive technology. Progressive systems have the advantage of utilizing a larger amount of nitrous (and fuel) to produce even greater power increases as the additional power and torque are gradually introduced (as opposed to being applied to the engine and transmission immediately), reducing the risk of mechanical stress and, consequently, damage.

==Identification==
Cars with nitrous-equipped engines may be identified by the "purge" of the delivery system that most drivers perform prior to reaching the starting line. A separate electrically operated valve is used to release air and gaseous nitrous oxide trapped in the delivery system. This brings liquid nitrous oxide all the way up through the plumbing from the storage tank to the [[solenoid]] valve or valves that will release it into the engine's intake tract. When the purge system is activated, one or more plumes of nitrous oxide will be visible for a moment as the liquid flashes to vapor as it is released. The purpose of a nitrous purge is to ensure that the correct amount of nitrous oxide is delivered the moment the system is activated as nitrous and fuel jets are sized to produce correct air / fuel ratios, and as liquid nitrous is denser than gaseous nitrous, any nitrous vapor in the lines will cause the car to "bog" for an instant (as the ratio of nitrous / fuel will be too rich reducing engine power) until liquid nitrous oxide reaches the injection nozzle.

==Types of nitrous systems==
There are two categories of nitrous systems: ''dry'' &amp; ''wet'' with four main delivery methods of nitrous systems: ''single nozzle'', ''direct port'', ''plate'', and ''bar'' used to discharge nitrous into the [[Plenum chamber|plenum]]s of the [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]]. Nearly all nitrous systems use specific orifice inserts, called jets, along with pressure calculations to meter the nitrous, or nitrous and fuel in wet applications, delivered to create a proper [[air-fuel ratio]] (AFR) for the additional horsepower desired.

===Dry===
In a ''dry'' nitrous system the nitrous delivery method provides nitrous only. The extra fuel required is introduced through the [[Fuel injection|fuel injectors]], keeping the manifold dry of fuel. This property is what gives the dry system its name. Fuel flow can be increased either by increasing the pressure or by increasing the time the fuel injectors remain open. 

Dry nitrous systems typically rely on a single nozzle delivery method, but all of the four main delivery methods can be used in dry applications. Dry systems are not typically used in carbureted applications due to the nature of a carburetor's function and inability to provide large amounts of on-demand fuel. Dry nitrous systems on fuel injected engines will use increased fuel pressure or injector pulsewidth upon system activation as a means of providing the correct ratio of fuel for the nitrous. 

===Wet===
In a ''wet'' nitrous system the nitrous delivery method provides nitrous and fuel together resulting in the intake manifold being "wet" with fuel, giving the category its name. Wet nitrous systems can be used in all four main delivery methods.

In wet systems on fuel/direct injected engines care must be taken to avoid backfires caused by fuel pooling in the intake tract or manifold and/or uneven distribution of the nitrous/fuel mixture. Port and direct fuel injection engines have intake systems engineered for the delivery of air only, not air and fuel. Since most fuels are heavier than air and not in a gaseous state when used with nitrous systems it does not behave in the same way as air alone; thus the possibility of the fuel being unevenly distributed to the combustion chambers of the engine causing lean conditions/detonation and/or pooling in parts of the intake tract/manifold presenting a dangerous situation in which the fuel may be ignited uncontrollably causing catastrophic failure to components. Carbureted and single point/throttle body injected engines use a wet manifold design that is engineered to evenly distribute fuel and air mixtures to all combustion chambers, making this mostly a non-issue for these applications.

===Single nozzle===
A ''single nozzle'' nitrous system introduces the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture via a single injection point. The nozzle is typically placed in the intake pipe/tract after the air filter, prior to the intake manifold and/or throttle body in fuel injected applications, and after the throttle body in carbureted applications. In wet systems the high pressures of the nitrous injected causes the [[aerosolization]] of the fuel injected in tandem via the nozzle, allowing for more thorough and even distribution of the nitrous/fuel mixture.

===Direct port===
A ''direct port'' nitrous system introduces the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture as close to the intake ports of the engine as is feasible via individual nozzles directly in each intake runner. Direct port nitrous systems will use the same or similar nozzles as those in single nozzle systems, just in numbers equal to or in multiples of the number of intake ports of the engine. Being that direct port systems do not have to rely on intake tract/manifold design to evenly distribute the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture they are inherently more precise than other delivery methods. The greater number of nozzles also allows a greater total amount of nitrous to be delivered than other systems. Multiple "stages" of nitrous can be accomplished by using multiple sets of nozzles at each intake port to further increase the power potential. Direct port nitrous systems are the most common delivery method in racing applications.

===Plate===
A ''plate'' nitrous system uses a spacer placed somewhere between the throttle body and intake ports with holes drilled along its interior surfaces, or in a tube that is suspended from the plate, for the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture to be distributed through. Plate systems provide a drill-less solution compared to other delivery methods as the plates are generally application specific and fit between existing components such as the throttle body-to-intake-manifold or upper-intake-manifold-to-lower-intake-manifold junctions. Requiring little more than longer fasteners, plate systems are the most easily reversed systems as they need little to no permanent changes to the intake tract. Dependent on application, plate systems can provide precise nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture distribution similar to that of direct port systems.

===Bar===
A ''bar'' nitrous system utilizes a hollow tube, with a number of holes drilled along its length, placed inside the intake plenum to deliver nitrous. Bar nitrous delivery methods are almost exclusively dry nitrous systems due to the non-optimal fuel distribution possibilities of the bar. Bar nitrous systems are popular with racers that prefer their nitrous use to be hidden, as the nitrous distribution method is not immediately apparent and most associated components of the nitrous system can be obscured from view.

===Propane or CNG===
Nitrous systems can be used with a gaseous fuel such as propane or compressed natural gas.  This has the advantage of being technically a ''dry'' system as the fuel is not in a liquid state when introduced to the intake tract. 

==Reliability concerns==
[[Image:Nitrous piston.JPG|thumb|A piston which was cracked due to nitrous use.]]

The use of nitrous oxide carries with it concerns about the reliability and longevity of an engine present with all power adders. Due to the greatly increased cylinder pressures, the engine as a whole is placed under greater stress, primarily those components associated with the engine's rotating assembly. An engine with components unable to cope with the increased stress imposed by the use of nitrous systems can experience major engine damage, such as cracked or destroyed pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, and/or blocks. Proper strengthening of engine components in addition to accurate and adequate fuel delivery are key to nitrous system use without catastrophic failure.

==Street legality==
Nitrous oxide injection systems for automobiles are illegal for road use in some countries. For example, in [[New South Wales]], Australia, the [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] '''Code of Practice for Light Vehicle Modifications''' (in use since 1994) states in clause 3.1.5.7.3 that ''The use or fitment of nitrous oxide injection systems is not permitted.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | title = Code of Practice for Light Vehicle Modifications
  | publisher = [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] of [[New South Wales]]
  | year = 1994
  | isbn = 0-7310-2923-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain, there are no restrictions on use of {{chem|N|2|O}}, but the modification must be declared to the insurance company, which is likely to result in a higher premium for Motor Vehicle insurance or refusal to insure.

In Germany, despite its strict [[TÜV]] rules, a nitrous system could be installed and used legally in a street driven car. The requirements for the technical standard of the system are similar to those of aftermarket [[Natural gas vehicle|natural gas conversions]].

==Racing rules==
Several sanctioning bodies in drag racing allow or disallow the use of nitrous oxide in certain classes or have nitrous oxide specific classes. Nitrous is allowed in [[Formula Drift]] competition.

==History==
A similar basic technique was used during [[World War II]] by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft with the [[GM-1]] system to maintain the power output of [[aircraft engine]]s when at high altitude where the air density is lower. Accordingly, it was only used by specialized planes like high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, high-speed bombers and high-altitude interceptors. It was sometimes used with the Luftwaffe's form of [[Water injection (engine)|methanol-water injection]], designated [[MW 50]] (both meant as ''Notleistung'' short-term power boosting measures), to produce substantial increases in performance for fighter aircraft [[War emergency power|over short periods of time]], as with their combined use on the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 152]]H fighter prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hermann |first=Dietmar |date=1998 |title=Focke-Wulf Ta 152: Der Weg zum Höhenjäger (in German) |url= |location=Oberhaching, Germany |publisher=AVIATIC Verlag GmbH |pages=12, 141 |isbn=3-925505-44-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

British World War II usage of nitrous oxide injector systems were modifications of [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin engines]] carried out by the Heston Aircraft Company for use in certain night fighter variants of the [[de Havilland Mosquito]] and PR versions of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]].

India has encountered effective local [[anti-nuclear]] opposition, growing national wariness about foreign nuclear reactors, and a nuclear liability controversy that threatens to prevent new reactor imports. There have been mass protests against the French-backed 9900 MW [[Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project]] in Maharashtra and the 2000 MW [[Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant]] in Tamil Nadu. The state government of West Bengal state has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 MW facility near the town of Haripur that intended to host six Russian reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3889&amp;Itemid=614 |title=India's Rising Nuclear Safety Concerns |author=Siddharth Srivastava |date=27 October 2011 |work=Asia Sentinel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] was a national strategic priority in [[Japan]], but there has been concern about the ability of Japan's nuclear plants to withstand seismic activity. The [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]] was completely shut down for 21 months following an earthquake in 2007.

Following [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|an earthquake, tsunami]], and the failure of cooling systems at the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] on March 11, 2011, a nuclear emergency was declared. This was the first time a nuclear emergency had been declared in Japan, and 140,000 residents within 20&amp;nbsp;km of the plant were evacuated. The total amount of radioactive material released is unclear, as the crisis is ongoing.&lt;ref name=bi-emergency&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisenthal|first=Joe|title=Japan Declares Nuclear Emergency, As Cooling System Fails At Power Plant|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fukushima-nuclear-plant-2011-3|accessdate=11 March 2011|newspaper=Business Insider|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Nuclear power in Belgium}}
The [[Belgian government]] in 2003 passed legislation banning the construction of new reactors for power generation. The existing ones were to be phased out after a 40-year lifespan. This implies that by 2025 all seven operating reactors would be shut down. The first three reactors were originally to be closed by 2015, however the lifespan of the Tihange-1 reactor was expanded through to 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Main article|Nuclear power in Bulgaria}}
The [[Bulgarian government]] has favored nuclear energy to generate electricity since 1956 and its first commercial nuclear reactor began to operate in 1974. Currently, two reactors are operational providing approximately 35% of the country's electricity.&lt;ref name=Bulgaria&gt;{{cite web | publisher = World Nuclear Organization | url = http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf87.html | title = Nuclear Power in Bulgaria |date = August 2010| accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government had plans to build two new units at the [[Belene Nuclear Power Plant]].

The [[Czechoslovak]] government completed its first [[nuclear power plant]] – a [[Gas Cooled Reactor|gas-cooled]] [[heavy water reactor]] – in 1972 in [[Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Bohunice]].  The country's first commercial nuclear power plant began operating in 1985, and the government is still committed to [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] today.  The [[Czech Republic]] currently has six nuclear reactors with a net [[MWe]] of 3,472 and plans to build two more 1,500 [[MWe]] reactors by 2020.&lt;ref name=Czech&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power in the Czech Republic|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=February 2007|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf90.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to data from 1990 to 2005, the Czech Republic posted the largest increase in nuclear energy capacity (114%) and energy production (96%) of any EU country.  Furthermore, the Czech Republic exported 24,985 [[GWh]] in 2005.&lt;ref name = Eurostat_new&gt;

===Finland===

{{Main article|Nuclear power in Finland}}

[[Finland]] has [[List of nuclear reactors#Finland|four]] commercial reactors, which provide 27% of the country's electricity. Two [[VVER]]-440 [[pressurized water reactor]]s built by [[Atomenergoeksport]] and commissioned in 1977 and 1980, are located in [[Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant]]. They are operated by [[Fortum]]. Two [[boiling water reactor]]s built by [[Asea-Atom]] (nowadays [[Westinghouse Electric Company]]) and commissioned in 1978 and 1980, are located at the Olkiluoto plant in [[Eurajoki]], near [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]].  They are owned and operated by [[Teollisuuden Voima]], a subsidiary of [[Pohjolan Voima]]. In 2002, the cabinet's decision to allow the construction of fifth reactor (the third at Olkiluoto) was accepted in the parliament. The reactor under construction is the [[European Pressurized Reactor]], built by French company [[Areva]]. It is scheduled to start electricity production no earlier than 2015, a schedule slippage of at least six years.&lt;ref&gt;

On 21 April 2010, the [[Cabinet of Finland|cabinet]] decided to grant permits for construction of the sixth and seventh commercial reactors to Teollisuuden Voima and [[Fennovoima]], a subsidiary of [[E.ON]]. The former will build the reactor at the Olkiluoto plant, and the latter at a new site in [[Pyhäjoki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.fi/Sivut/Fennovoima-nuclear-power-plant-to-beconstructed-in-Pyhajoki.aspx Fennovoima nuclear power plant to be constructed in Pyhäjoki]&lt;/ref&gt; The cabinet rejected the third application, by Fortum, to build a new reactor at Loviisa.&lt;ref&gt;

The nuclear power companies are responsible for storage and disposal of [[nuclear waste]].  Prior to 1994, Finnish companies exported their nuclear waste to the [[Soviet Union]]. However, a Finnish law passed in 1994 prohibited the transport of nuclear waste abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://energia.fi/sites/default/files/nuclearwaste25-9-2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  With this law, Finland became the first country that decided to encapsulate spent nuclear fuel into [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]].  The construction of the first such repository, [[Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository|Onkalo]], is set to begin in 2012, with an estimated completion date of 2020.  Once in operation, the disposal process will involve putting twelve fuel assemblies into a boron steel canister and enclosing it into a copper capsule.  Each capsule will then be placed in its own hole in the repository and packed with [[bentonite clay]].  The estimated cost of this project is about €818 million, which includes construction, encapsulation, and operating costs.  The State Nuclear Waste Management Fund has saved approximately €1.4 billion from charges for generated electricity.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear Power in Finland." ''World Nuclear Association.'' February 2008. http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf76.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a TNS Gallup survey conducted in January 2010, 48% of Finns had a positive view of nuclear power, and 17% were negative.&lt;ref name=wnn150210&gt;

===France===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in France}}
[[File:Electricity production in France.PNG|thumb|right|Graph shows the increase in electricity production from nuclear power in France]]
After the oil crisis of the early 1970s, the French government decided in 1974 to move towards self-sufficiency in electricity production, primarily through the construction of [[Nuclear power in France|nuclear power]] stations. France today produces around 78.1% of its electricity through nuclear power.&lt;ref name="uic28"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Because France produces an overall electricity surplus, it exports nuclear-produced energy. The Board of Electricité de [[France]] ([[Électricité de France|EDF]]) has approved construction of a 1630&amp;nbsp;MWe European Pressurized Reactor at Flamanville, Normandy. Construction is expected to begin in late 2007, with completion in 2012.&lt;ref name="uic28"/&gt;

France established a law in 2005 requiring that nuclear power be central to energy policy and security. Under this law, France would build a [[third-generation nuclear reactors]], by 2015, of which it may decide to build forty more.&lt;ref name = France&gt;"French Nuclear Power." ''World Nuclear Association.'' April 2007. &lt;http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf40.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Each EPR reactor would produce 1,600 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] of electricity versus the 900 MW that current reactors produce. The EPR reactor was also recognized as safer and more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;"France: Energy Profile." ''SperoNews.'' 8 June 2007. &lt;http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idarticle=9839&amp;t=France%3A+Energy+profile&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2005, EDF announced that it wanted to replace all of its reactors with EPR reactors.&lt;ref name = France/&gt;

EDF reprocesses approximately 850 of the 1,200 tons of used fuel each year.  The reprocessed [[spent fuel]] is made into [[plutonium]].&lt;ref name = France/&gt;  The plutonium is then converted into fresh [[mixed oxide]] ([[MOX]]) fuel, which is used in over 35 reactors across [[Europe]].  These reactors can load approximately 20-50% of their cores with the [[MOX fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;"Radioactive Waste Management." ''Australian Uranium Association.'' November 2007. &lt;http://www.uic.com.au/wast.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], the head of France's nuclear safety agency has said that France needs to upgrade the protection of vital functions in all its nuclear reactors to avoid a disaster in the event of a natural calamity, adding there was no need to close any plants.

Many problems brought [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] to the nuclear power in France however. The initial budget for building Flamanville-3 of €3.3 billions jumped to €8.5 billions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2012/12/03/le-cout-de-l-epr-de-flamanville-encore-revu-a-la-hausse_1799417_3244.html&lt;/ref&gt;  at the moment and the power price might reach 100EUR/MWh. EDF could not go below a price of 100GBP/MWh for a 30-year contract when they had to make an offer to UK for replacement of some old nuclear reactors.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0003.htm&lt;/ref&gt; That is around 115EUR/MWh, when an average price of only 60EUR/MWh for producing power from any source could be considered profitable in Western Europe. Francois Hollande sticks to his campaign pledge to reduce the share of nuclear energy in the power supply in France to 50% from 75% by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-energy-nuclear-idUSBRE88D1DR20120914 | work=Reuters | title=Nuclear power champions Japan and France turn away | date=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areva, which was the symbol of the nuclear power in Europe for long time, lost over 80% of its shares and had to start investing in wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/19/areva-scotland-idUSL5E8MJ6ZJ20121119?type=companyNews | work=Reuters | title=French group Areva to produce wind turbines in Scotland | date=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a poll conducted by BBC, the opposition to building new reactors in pro-nuclear France has risen from 66% in 2005 to 83% in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 | work=BBC News | title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' | date=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Germany}}
{{Further information|Anti-nuclear movement in Germany}}
Nuclear power in Germany accounted for 23% of national electricity consumption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/EN/press/pr/2011/04/PE11__144__433,templateId=renderPrint.psml | title = 17% of Germany's electricity consumption was met by renewable energy in 2010 | publisher=[[Federal Statistical Office of Germany]] | accessdate =6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the permanent shutdown of 8 plants in March 2011. German nuclear power began with research reactors in the 1950s and 1960s with the first commercial plant coming online in 1969. It has been high on the political agenda in recent decades, with continuing debates about when the technology should be phased out. The topic received renewed attention at the start of 2007 due to the political impact of the [[Russia-Belarus energy dispute]] and in 2011 after the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]].&lt;ref name="Germany: Nuclear power plants to close by 2022"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13592208 |title= Germany: Nuclear power plants to close by 2022 |date=30 May 2011 |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2011, Germany formally announced plans to abandon nuclear energy completely within 11&amp;nbsp;years. The plan includes the immediate permanent closure of six nuclear power plants that had been temporarily shut down for testing in March 2011, and two more that have been offline a few years with technical problems. The remaining nine plants will be shut down between now and 2022. The announcement was first made by [[Norbert Röttgen]], head of the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]], after late-night talks.&lt;ref name="Germany: Nuclear power plants to close by 2022"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530 |title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest |first=Annika |last=Breidthardt |date=30 May 2011 |publisher=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] said the phase-out of plants, previously scheduled to go offline as late as 2036, would give Germany a competitive advantage in the renewable energy era, stating, "As the first big industrialized nation, we can achieve such a transformation toward efficient and renewable energies, with all the opportunities that brings for exports, developing new technologies and jobs". Merkel also pointed to Japan's "helplessness" – despite being an industrialized, technologically advanced nation – in the face of its nuclear disaster.&lt;ref name="Germany Decides to Abandon Nuclear Power by 2022"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=13717078 |title= Germany Decides to Abandon Nuclear Power by 2022 |first=Juergen |last=Baetz |date=30 May 2011 |agency=Associated Press   |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some German manufacturers and energy companies have criticized the plans, warning that Germany could face blackouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nuclear Phaseout Is an 'Historic Moment' |work=Der Spiegel |date=30 May 2011 |url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,765681,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energiewende (Energy U-turn) policies have suffered from inadequate investment in power infrastructure to bring power to markets. The reduced dependence on nuclear power has resulted in higher consumption of fossil fuels and therefore of greenhouse gas production.

===Italy===

===Romania===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Romania}}
Romania's 1,400 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] [[Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant]] produces around 18% of the nation's electrical power. It is based on Canadian technology and uses [[heavy water]] produced at [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]] as its [[neutron moderator]] and water from the [[Danube]] for cooling. Two reactors are fully operational and another three are partially finished. When fully functional the plant will produce around 40% of Romania's total electricity needs.

Currently, [[nuclear waste]] is stored at the reactors for up to ten years.  Then the waste is transported to dry storage. The government has conducted studies into a permanent geological [[Deep geological repository|repository]].&lt;ref name = Romania&gt;"Nuclear Power in Romania." ''World Nuclear Association.''

While producing only a small fraction of the power of a standard Russian land-based plant, it can supply power to a city of 200,000, or function as a [[desalination]] plant. The [[Rosatom]], the state-owned nuclear energy company said that at least 12&amp;nbsp;countries were also interested in buying floating nuclear plants.&lt;ref name="float"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1662889.ece |title=Floating nuclear power stations raise specter of Chernobyl at sea | work=The Times | location=London | first=Tony | last=Halpin | date=2007-04-17 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Serbia}}
Serbia presently doesn't have any nuclear power plants. Previously, [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]] operated two research reactors; RA and RB. The research reactors were supplied by the USSR. The larger of the two reactors was rated at 6.5 MW and used Soviet-supplied 80% enriched uranium fuel.

On October 15, 1958, there was a criticality accident at one of the research reactors. Six workers received large doses of radiation; one died shortly afterwards. The other five received the first ever bone marrow transplants in Europe.

The nuclear research programme ended in 1968, while the reactors were switched off in 1984.

After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster a nationwide campaign against usage of nuclear energy delivered a moratorium in a form of Law in 1989, which not only prohibited the construction of nuclear power plants, nuclear fuel fabrication and reprocessing facilities for used nuclear fuel but also criminalized any activity related to the aforementioned making it a criminal offense punishable by 5 years of prison.

After the break up of the former Yugoslavia a new law was adopted on March 10, 1995, which confirmed the previous moratorium, although it removed the controversial article related to the nuclear criminal offense.

Even though majority of people and politicians still support moratorium on usage of nuclear energy, past couple of years are marked with an increasing public campaign pointed towards repeal of the 1995 Law, or, at least, its limitation to 10 years, after which it would be possible to build nuclear reactors in Serbia.

===Spain===

===Sweden===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Sweden}}
[[Sweden]] began research into [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in 1947 with the establishment of the atomic energy research organization. In 1964, the country built its first small [[heavy water reactor]]. The country decided to use [[hydropower]] and supplement it with nuclear energy to avoid the volatility in oil prices. Six reactors began commercial service in both the 1970s and 1980s, with one unit closed in 1999 and another in 2005.  Currently, Sweden has 10&amp;nbsp;nuclear power reactors which provide over 40% of its electricity.&lt;ref name="inf42"&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Switzerland}}
Switzerland has [[List of nuclear reactors#Switzerland|five nuclear reactors]], and around 40% of its electricity is generated by nuclear power.  The country has had several [[referendum|referenda]] on the nuclear energy, beginning in 1979 with a [[initiative|citizens' initiative]] for nuclear safety, which was rejected. In 1984, there was a vote on an initiative "for a future without further nuclear power stations" with the result being a 55% to 45% vote against. On 23&amp;nbsp;September 1990, the people passed a motion to halt the construction of nuclear power plants (for a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] period of ten years) but rejected a motion to initiate a phase-out.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Ukraine}}
Ukraine operates 15 reactors, which supply 47.5% of Ukraine's electricity production of 195 billion kWh (2007). Ukraine's power sector is the twelfth-largest in the world in terms of installed capacity, with 54&amp;nbsp;gigawatts (GW).&lt;ref name=eia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|title=Ukraine|accessdate=2007-12-22|work=[[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA)|publisher=US government|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015222346/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|archivedate=2009-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the government planned to build 11 new [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] by the year 2030, in effect, almost doubling the current amount of nuclear [[electricity|power capacity]].&lt;ref name="Nuclear UA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf46.html|title=Nuclear Power in Ukraine|accessdate=2007-12-22|publisher=World Nuclear Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in the United Kingdom}}
The first full-scale nuclear reactor in Europe opened in [[Sellafield#Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]], located in [[Cumberland]], [[United Kingdom]] on October 17, 1956. Calder Hall was the world's first [[nuclear power reactor]] producing power for a national grid, though its primary purpose was military plutonium production. At its peak, Calder Hall produced 240 [[MWe]] of electricity. Over the next ten years, nine more nuclear reactors were built across the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;"1956: Queen switches on nuclear power."

Recently, the UK privatized its [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] industry but government oversight remains. As of 2010, the United Kingdom has 19 reactors generating 18% of the country's electricity. By current accounting lifetimes all but one of them will be decommissioned by 2023, though many are likely to be life-extended. The government is encouraging the building of new generation plants as replacements. Currently, the reactors have a net capacity of 10,962 [[MWe]].&lt;ref name = UK&gt;"Nuclear Power in the United Kingdom." ''World Nuclear Association.''

===Canada===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Canada}}
Canada operates 18 reactors accounting for about 15% of electrical generation, all in the province of Ontario except for one in New Brunswick.  Increasing demands for electricity and environmental considerations have led Ontario to announce that it will maintain existing nuclear capacity by replacing older reactors with new ones.&lt;ref name="ontario"&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.energy.gov.on.ca/index.cfm?fuseaction=english.news&amp;body=yes&amp;news_id=134 | title = McGuinty Government Delivers A Balanced Plan For Ontario's Electricity Future | date=2006-06-13 | publisher = Ontario Ministry of Energy | accessdate = 2007-07-13 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070724171838/http://www.energy.gov.on.ca/index.cfm?fuseaction=english.news&amp;body=yes&amp;news_id=134 | archivedate = 2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has never had any serious accidents related to nuclear power, CANDU reactors are a particularly safe design.

&lt;/ref&gt;

After a time was thought to stop the use of nuclear energy then Mexico finally decided in 2007 by repowering the [[Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Station]], which has two reactors of 683MW each, after the upgrading, reactors are increase their production to 817MW each,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnnexpansion.com/obras/laguna-verde-recargada&lt;/ref&gt; accounting 4.6% of the electricity production. On May 14, 2010 Energy Secretary Georgina Kessel announced that Mexico provides full development of nuclear energy in its energy mix as an alternative to discourage the use of fossil fuels and increase the generation of clean electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2010/201187/ 6/mexico-apostara-por-la-energia-nuclear.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Mexico abandoned plans to build as many as 10 new nuclear reactors and will focus instead on natural gas-fired electricity plants after boosting discoveries of the fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-02/mexico-scraps-plans-to-build-as-many-as-10-nuclear-plants-focus-on-gas.html |title=Mexico Scraps Plans to Build 10 Nuclear Power Plants in Favor of Using Gas |author=Carlos Manuel Rodriguez  |date=Nov 4, 2011   |work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In 2007, there were 104 (69 pressurized water reactors, 35 boiling water reactors) commercial nuclear generating units licensed to operate in the United States, producing approximately 20% of the country's electrical energy needs. In absolute terms, the United States is the world's largest supplier of commercial nuclear power. However, the development of nuclear power in the United States has been stymied ever since the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] in 1979. Future development of nuclear power in the U.S. was to be enabled by the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]]  and co-ordinated by the [[Nuclear Power 2010 Program]],&lt;ref name="dailysentinel"&gt;

As of October 2011, plans for about 30 new reactors in the United States have been "whittled down to just four, despite the promise of large subsidies and President Barack Obama's support of nuclear power, which he reaffirmed after Fukushima".&lt;ref name="Stephanie Cooke"/&gt; The only reactor currently under construction in America, at [[Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station|Watts Bar]], [[Tennessee]], was begun in 1973 and may be completed in 2012.&lt;ref name=matt2010&gt;Matthew L.

Australia has no nuclear power plants. However, Australia has up to 40% of the world's uranium deposits and is the world's second largest producer of [[uranium]] after [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=wec/&gt; At the same time Australia's extensive, low-cost [[coal]] and [[natural gas]] reserves have historically been used as strong arguments for avoiding nuclear power.

In 2005, the Australian government threatened to use its [[constitution]]al powers to take control of the approval process for new [[Mining|mines]] from the [[anti-nuclear]] [[Northern Territory]] government. They are also negotiating with China to weaken safeguard terms so as to allow uranium exports there.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} States controlled by the [[Australian Labor Party]] are blocking the development of new mines in their jurisdictions under the ALP's "No New Mines policy."

[[John Howard]] went to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|November 2007 federal election]] with a pro-nuclear power platform but his government was defeated by Labor, which opposes nuclear power for Australia.&lt;ref name=australian301206&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|New Zealand's nuclear-free zone}}
[[New Zealand]] has no nuclear power plants. It enacted the ''[[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]]'' which prohibits the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of New Zealand and the entry into New Zealand waters of nuclear armed or [[Nuclear marine propulsion|propelled]] ships. This Act of Parliament, however, does not prevent the construction of nuclear power plants.  A 2008 survey shows that relatively few New Zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy source.&lt;ref&gt;The 2008 Shape NZ survey found that nuclear power is favoured by 19% of respondents as the best energy source for the country in the next 10&amp;nbsp;years, but the majority want wind and solar power.  Seventy seven percent prefer wind as the best energy source, 69%&amp;nbsp;solar, 47%&amp;nbsp;geothermal, 40%&amp;nbsp;wave power, 35% small and large scale hydro, 19%&amp;nbsp;nuclear, 10%&amp;nbsp;gas and 8%&amp;nbsp;coal. See [http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/413551/1690587 Nuclear power backed by 19%].&lt;/ref&gt; However a 2005 survey of business leaders showed that nearly two-thirds supported investigation of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10344116.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A research reactor was operated by the University of Canterbury until 1981. A nuclear reactor provided electricity for McMurdo Station, in the New Zealand Antarctic Territory from 1962-1972.
From the mid-1960s until the early 1980s official energy policy was that nuclear energy would be required. The Royal Commission on Nuclear Power Generation in New Zealand in its 1978 report said that there was no immediate need for New Zealand to embark upon a nuclear power program, but suggested that early in the 21st Century "a significant nuclear programme should be economically possible."

The term "Oil Field Engine" can refer to any sort of [[internal combustion engine]] used as a power source in the production of crude [[petroleum]], but most commonly refers to a class of reciprocating engines built in the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries, which is the focus of this article.

==Evolution==
With the drilling of the first commercially successful oil well by [[Edwin Drake]] in 1859, a new industry was born- one that would rapidly demand new technologies for extraction.  Initially, the steam engine used for drilling the well was kept in-place to lift the oil to the surface.  As the well's production dropped off, the economic feasibility of firing a boiler and maintaining a steam operation at each individual well fell far short of the income from the well's production (often only a fraction of a barrel per day.)  The ideal solution was to install a new gas engine at each well, thus eliminating hours of preparatory work and large quantities of fuel required to steam a boiler for only a few hours of production.  High initial cost prevented this in most cases, so it became much more feasible to convert an abundance of existing steam engines to gas engines.  The idea of a converted engine is most commonly credited to Dr. Edwin J. Fithian, a [[Portersville, PA]] physician with a great interest in mechanics.  His 1897 prototype for a 10-horsepower conversion cylinder was turned down by the [[Oil Well Supply Company]] of [[Oil City, PA]], so in 1898 Dr. Fithian partnered with John Carruthers and formed the Carruthers-Fithian Clutch Company, with headquarters in [[Grove City, PA]].  The "half-breed" concept (as these engines- being half steam engine, half gas engine, were often referred to) was an immediate success, with an oil producer being able to convert a steam engine with a 10HP gas cylinder and clutch for $120.00.  Soon after, multiple companies capitalized on the market for conversion cylinders, most producing a simple [[two-stroke]] gas cylinder to bolt onto a steam bedplate, thus avoiding patent infringement from Carruthers-Fithian (which by 1899 had formed the Bessemer Gas Engine Company in Grove City.)  &lt;ref&gt;Historical Sketch: 'Half-Breed Engines', Gas Engine Magazine  http://gasengine.farmcollector.com/Gas-Engines/HISTORICAL-SKETCH-HALF-BREED-ENGINES.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Other manufacturers produced engines that were purely of an internal-combustion design, and examples of both exist to this day.

==Basic Design==
Whether two or four-stroke in design, all oilfield engines share some common parts.  A heavy cast iron bedplate secures the engine to its base, usually of concrete.  The cylinder is attached to one end of the bedplate, the crankshaft bearings are at the other.  The crankshaft rests in these bearings, with either one or two flywheels and a clutch fastened to it.  A great number of oil field engines used a crosshead to connect the piston rod to the connecting rod; this slides back and forth between the bedplate and crosshead guides.  Ignition in the combustion chamber is either by [[hot tube]] or [[spark plug]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4456">The '''''Oswego-Guardian''–''Texanita'' collision''' was a maritime accident between two supertankers near [[Stilbaai]], South Africa on 21 August 1972.&lt;ref name="Inerting"&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/pub/igs.pdf|title=The Strange History of Tank Inerting|author=Jack Devanney|publisher=Center for Tankship Excellence|date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Texanita'' exploded and sank with the loss of 47 men, while a further life was lost on the ''Oswego Guardian''.  The accident was a catalyst for change to marine traffic separation procedures as well as oil tanker [[inert gas|inerting]].

The ''Oswego-Guardian'' was rounding the southern tip of Africa, fully loaded with crude oil from the Middle East, while the ''Texanita'' was in ballast, and headed in the opposite direction from [[Trinidad]] to [[Ras Tanura]]. Both ships were approximately 100,000 tons deadweight and registered in [[Liberia]]. The ships collided in dense fog off [[Stilbaai]], near [[Cape Agulhas]].  The oil vapours in the ''Texanita'''s two empty tanks ignited, creating a massive explosion that tore the ship apart, causing it to sink in four minutes with the loss of 47 of its 50 crew;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0AyAQAAIAAJ|title=Naval Review|publisher=United States Naval Institute|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; the explosion was heard {{convert|63|mi|km}} away, inland from the coast.

A [[United Nations resolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]|url=http://www.imo.org/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-for-the-safety-of-life-at-sea-(solas),-1974.aspx|title=International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would have made the use of [[inert gas]] safety systems mandatory for oil tankers, was still in draft in 1972.  Experts believe that were the ''Texanita'' inerted, her fate might have been less tragic, possibly like that of the [[Venpet-Venoil collision|''Venoil'']].&lt;ref name="Inerting"/&gt;

The subsequent investigation determined that the masters of both ships failed to maintain an adequate lookout or to plot the course of the opposite ship; both ships also failed to reduce speed, despite observing one another on radar.  At the time, the accident was the biggest tanker collision on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Economist]]|year=1972|volume= 244|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the ''Texanita'''s lifeboats was found at [[Bunbury, Western Australia]] two years later.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Aftermath==
The accident contributed to an overhaul of the international maritime [[Traffic Separation Scheme|traffic separation system]] that was in force at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWFWAAAAMAAJ|title=|journal=Navigation|volume= 27-28|page=260|publisher=Institute of Navigation|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polycarbonates''' ('''PC''') are a group of [[thermoplastic]] polymers containing [[carbonate ester|carbonate group]]s in their chemical structures. Polycarbonates used in engineering are strong, tough materials, and some grades are optically transparent. They are easily worked, [[injection molding|molded]], and [[thermoforming|thermoformed]].  Because of these properties, polycarbonates find many applications. Polycarbonates do not have a unique [[resin identification code|resin identification code (RIC)]] and are identified as "Other", 7 on the RIC list. Products made from polycarbonate can contain trace quantities of the precursor monomer [[bisphenol A]] (BPA).

==Structure==
Polycarbonates received their name because they are [[polymers]] containing [[carbonate ester|carbonate group]]s (−O−(C=O)−O−). A balance of useful features, including temperature resistance, impact resistance and optical properties, positions polycarbonates between [[commodity plastics]] and [[engineering plastic]]s.

==Production==
The main polycarbonate material is produced by the reaction of [[bisphenol A]] (BPA) and [[phosgene]] {{chem|COCl|2}}. The overall reaction can be written as follows:

[[File:Polycarbonatsynthese.svg|450px]]

The first step of the synthesis involves treatment of bisphenol A with [[sodium hydroxide]], which [[deprotonates]] the [[hydroxyl group]]s of the bisphenol A.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Volker Serini "Polycarbonates" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(HOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 NaOH   →  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The di[[phenoxide]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reacts with phosgene to give a [[chloroformate]], which subsequently is attacked by another phenoxide.  The net reaction from the diphenoxide is:

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →  1/n [OC(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 NaCl

In this way, approximately {{convert|1|e9kg|e6t|abbr=off|spell=on|0}} of polycarbonate is produced annually. Many other [[diol]]s have been tested in place of bisphenol A (e.g., 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane and [[dihydroxybenzophenone]]). The cyclohexane is used as a comonomer to suppress crystallisation tendency of the BPA-derived product. [[Tetrabromobisphenol A]] is used to enhance fire resistance. [[Tetramethylcyclobutanediol]] has been developed as a replacement for BPA.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

An alternative route to polycarbonates entails [[transesterification]] from BPA and [[diphenyl carbonate]]:
:(HOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO   →  1/n [OC(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH
The diphenyl carbonate was derived in part from [[carbon monoxide]], this route being greener than the phosgene method.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

The ring-opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates has been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Making Plastics from Carbon Dioxide: Salen Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Production of Polycarbonates from Epoxides and CO2|author=Donald J. Darensbourg|journal=Chem. Rev.|year=2007|volume=107|pages=2388–2410|doi=10.1021/cr068363q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and processing==
Polycarbonate is a durable material.  Although it has high impact-resistance, it has low scratch-resistance. Therefore, a hard coating is applied to polycarbonate [[eyewear]] [[corrective lens|lenses]] and polycarbonate exterior automotive components. The characteristics of polycarbonate compare to those of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA, acrylic), but polycarbonate is stronger and will hold up longer to extreme temperature. Polycarbonate is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] to [[visible light]], with better light transmission than many kinds of glass.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Polycarbonate has a [[glass transition temperature]] of about {{convert|147|C|F K|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100210070124/http://www.bayermaterialsciencenafta.com/faq_pcs/index.html Answers to Common Questions about Bayer Polycarbonate Resins]. bayermaterialsciencenafta.com&lt;/ref&gt; so it softens gradually above this point and flows above about {{convert|155|C|F K|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="city"&gt;{{cite web |title=Polycarbonate |publisher=city plastics 
|url=http://www.cityplastics.com.au/materials-polycarbonate/ |accessdate=2013-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools must be held at high temperatures, generally above {{convert|80|C|F K|abbr=on}} to make strain-free and stress-free products. Low [[molecular mass]] grades are easier to mold than higher grades, but their strength is lower as a result. The toughest grades have the highest molecular mass, but are much more difficult to process.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Unlike most thermoplastics, polycarbonate can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can be processed and formed at room temperature using [[sheet metal]] techniques, such as bending on a [[Brake (sheet metal bending)|brake]]. Even for sharp angle bends with a tight radius, heating may not be necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal. [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA/Acrylic]], which is similar in appearance to polycarbonate, is brittle and cannot be bent at room temperature.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Main transformation techniques for polycarbonate resins:
*[[extrusion]] into tubes, rods and other profiles including multiwall{{fact|date=June 2018}}
*extrusion with cylinders ([[calender]]s) into sheets ({{convert|0.5|-|20|mm|in thou|abbr=on}}) and films (below {{convert|1|mm|in thou|abbr=on}}), which can be used directly or manufactured into other shapes using [[thermoforming]] or secondary [[Manufacturing|fabrication]] techniques, such as bending, drilling, or routing. Due to its chemical properties it is not conducive to laser-cutting.{{fact|date=June 2018}}
*[[injection molding]] into ready articles{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Polycarbonate may become [[Brittleness|brittle]] when exposed to ionizing radiation above {{nowrap|25 [[Gray (unit)|kGy]] (J/kg).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Radiation Sterilization on Plastics

==Applications==

===Electronic components===
Polycarbonate is mainly used for electronic applications that capitalize on its collective safety features.  Being a good electrical insulator and having heat-resistant and flame-retardant properties, it is used in various products associated with electrical and telecommunications hardware. It can also serve as a [[dielectric]] in high-stability [[capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; However, commercial manufacture of polycarbonate capacitors mostly stopped after sole manufacturer [[Bayer AG]] stopped making capacitor-grade polycarbonate film at the end of year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.execpc.com/~endlr/film.html|title=Film|work=execpc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.com/EN/polycarbonate.htm|title=WIMA|work=wima.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction materials===
[[File:Polycarbonate Greenhouse-00.jpg|thumb|Polycarbonate sheeting in a greenhouse]]
The second largest consumer of polycarbonates is the construction industry, e.g. for domelights, flat or curved glazing, and [[sound wall]]s, which all use extruded flat solid or multiwall sheet, or corrugated sheet.

===Data storage===
[[File:CD DVD Collections.jpg|thumb|CDs and DVDs]]
A major application of polycarbonate is the production of [[Compact Disc]]s, [[DVD]]s, and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s.  These discs are produced by [[Injection moulding|injection molding]] polycarbonate into a mold cavity that has on one side a metal stamper containing a negative image of the disc data, while the other mold side is a mirrored surface.

===Automotive, aircraft, railway, and security components===
In the automotive industry, injection-molded polycarbonate can produce very smooth surfaces that make it well-suited for [[sputter deposition]] or [[Evaporation (deposition)|evaporation deposition]] of aluminium without the need for a base-coat. Decorative bezels and optical reflectors are commonly made of polycarbonate. Due to its low weight and high impact resistance, polycarbonate is the dominant material for making automotive headlamp lenses. However, automotive headlamps require outer surface coatings because of its low scratch resistance and susceptibility to ultraviolet degradation (yellowing). The use of polycarbonate in automotive applications is limited to low stress applications. Stress from fasteners, [[plastic welding]] and molding render polycarbonate susceptible to [[stress corrosion cracking]] when it comes in contact with certain accelerants such as salt water and [[plastisol]]. It can be laminated to make [[bullet-proof glass|bullet-proof "glass"]], although "bullet-resistant" is more accurate for the thinner windows, such as are used in bullet-resistant windows in automobiles. The thicker barriers of transparent plastic used in teller's windows and barriers in banks are also polycarbonate.

[[File:Mazda MX-5 Roadster-Coupé Facelift Heck.JPG|thumb|Mazda MX-5 (NC) Power Retractable Hard Top]]
The [[Mazda MX-5 (NC)#Power Retractable Hard Top|third generation Mazda MX-5]] was offered with a [[Retractable hardtop|Power Retractable Hard Top (PRHT)]] variant that uses a folding hardtop made of polycarbonate, which added only {{convert|36|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to the weight of a comparably equipped soft top without diminishing trunk space when retracted.&lt;ref name="autoweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/2007-mazda-mx-5-miata-power-retractable-hardtop-new-hardtop-one-more-reason-love-mx|title=2007 Mazda MX-5 Miata Power Retractable Hardtop |accessdate=2014-12-27 |publisher=Autoweek |first=Mark |last=Vaughn|date=2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called "theft-proof" large plastic packaging for smaller items, which cannot be opened by hand, is uniformly made from polycarbonate.

===Niche applications===
Polycarbonate, being a versatile material with attractive processing and physical properties, has attracted myriad smaller applications.  The use of injection molded drinking bottles, glasses and food containers is common, but the use of BPA in the manufacture of polycarbonate has stirred serious controversy (see [[#Potential hazards in food contact applications|Potential hazards in food contact applications]]), leading to development and use of "BPA-free" plastics in various formulations.

[[File:Laboratory protection goggles-blue.jpg|thumb|Laboratory safety goggles]]

Polycarbonate is commonly used in eye protection, as well as in other projectile-resistant viewing and lighting applications that would normally indicate the use of [[glass]], but require much higher impact-resistance. Polycarbonate lenses also protect the eye from [[Eyeglass#Polycarbonate|UV]] light. Many kinds of lenses are manufactured from polycarbonate, including automotive headlamp lenses, lighting lenses, [[sunglass]]/[[eyeglass]] [[Corrective lens|lenses]], swimming goggles and SCUBA masks, and safety glasses/goggles/visors including visors in sporting helmets/masks and police [[riot gear]] (helmet visors, riot shields, etc.). Windscreens in small motorized vehicles are commonly made of polycarbonate, such as for motorcycles, ATVs, golf carts, and small planes and helicopters.

Typical products of sheet/film production include applications in advertisement (signs, displays, poster protection).&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; But also applications as automotive safety glazing (ECE R 43). 

The light weight of polycarbonate as opposed to glass has led to development of electronic display screens that replace glass with polycarbonate, for use in mobile and portable devices. Such displays include newer [[e-ink]] and some LCD screens, though CRT, plasma screen and other LCD technologies generally still require glass for its higher melting temperature and its ability to be etched in finer detail.

As more and more governments are restricting the use of glass in pubs and clubs due to the increased incidence of [[glassing]]s, polycarbonate glasses are becoming popular for serving alcohol because of their strength, durability, and glass-like feel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130428193825/http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/alcohol_restrictions_for_violent_venues.asp Alcohol restrictions for violent venues].

Standard polycarbonate resins are not suitable for long term exposure to UV radiation.   To overcome this the primary resin can have UV stabilisers added. These grades are sold as UV stabilized polycarbonate to injection moulding and extrusion companies. Other applications including polycarbonate sheet may have the anti-UV layer added as a special coating or a [[Plastics extrusion#Coextrusion|coextrusion]] for enhanced weathering resistance.

Polycarbonate is also used as a printing substrate for [[nameplate]]s and other forms of industrial grade under printed products. The polycarbonate provides a barrier to wear, elements, and fading.

====Medical applications====
Many polycarbonate grades are used in medical applications and comply with both ISO 10993-1 and USP Class VI standards (occasionally referred to as PC-ISO). Class VI is the most stringent of the six USP ratings. These grades can be sterilized using steam at 120&amp;nbsp;°C, [[gamma radiation]], or by the [[ethylene oxide]] (EtO) method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://devicelink.com/mpb/archive/98/09/003.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990223191619/http://www.devicelink.com/mpb/archive/98/09/003.html|archivedate=23 February 1999|title=Medical Applications of Polycarbonate|last=Powell|first=Douglas G.|work=Medical Plastics and Biomaterials Magazine|date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific research indicates possible problems with [[biocompatibility]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Dow Chemical strictly limits all its plastics with regard to medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plastics.dow.com/plastics/medical/|title=Dow Plastics Medical Application Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omnexus.com/tc/polycarbonate/index.aspx?id=biocompatibility|title=Makrolon Polycarbonate Biocompatibility Grades}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scientists at the [[IBM Research - Almaden |IBM Almaden Research Center]] have developed aliphatic polycarbonates with improved biocompatibility and degradability for nanomedicine applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Julian M.

===Phones===
Some major smartphone manufacturers use polycarbonate. Nokia has used polycarbonate in their phones starting with the [[Nokia N9|N9]]'s unibody case in 2011. This practice continues with various phones in the [[Lumia series|Lumia]] series. Samsung has started using polycarbonate with [[Samsung Galaxy S III|Galaxy S III]]'s battery cover in 2012. This practice continues with various phones in the [[Samsung Galaxy|Galaxy]] series. Apple started using polycarbonate with the [[iPhone 5C]]'s unibody case in 2013.

==History==
Polycarbonates were first discovered in 1898 by [[Alfred Einhorn]], a German scientist working at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polycarbonate (PC)|url=http://www.ides.com/pm/9_Polycarbonate.asp|publisher=[[UL (safety organization)|UL]] Prospector|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, after 30 years of laboratory research, this class of materials was abandoned without commercialization. Research resumed in 1953, when Hermann Schnell at [[Bayer]] in Uerdingen, Germany patented the first linear polycarbonate. The brand name "Merlon" was registered in 1955, Later changed to Makrolon in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="KotlerPfoertsch2010"&gt;{{cite book

Also in 1953, and one week after the patent was submitted by Bayer, [[Daniel Fox (chemist)|Daniel Fox]] at [[General Electric]] in Schenectady, New York, independently submitted a closely related patent on a [[Branching (polymer chemistry)|branched]] polycarbonate. Both companies filed for U.S. patents in 1955, and agreed that the company lacking priority would be granted a license to the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemicallyspeaking.com/archive/2010/11/16/polycarbonate-is-polyfunctional.aspx|title=Polycarbonate is Polyfunctional|publisher=Chemical Institute of Canada|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome T.

The production of Lexan was taken over by [[SABIC]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Oxidative Carbonylation: Diphenyl Carbonate|editors=Shannon S. Stahl, andPaul L.

Their patented innovative Vision Protection System (VPS) is specific treatment of polycarbonate that makes it fog- and scratch-resistant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nolan: Safety and Norms of Use, p.5. |url=https://www.motorcycleid.com/images/nolan-helmets/items/pdf/n87-motogp-instruction-sheet.pdf |date= July 2016 |publisher=Nolan}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After 1970, the brownish original polycarbonate tint was improved to "glass-clear."

==Potential hazards in food contact applications==
{{Main article|Bisphenol A|Endocrine disruptor}}
The use of polycarbonate containers for the purpose of food storage is controversial.  The basis of this controversy is their hydrolysis (degradation by water, often referred to as leaching) occurring at high temperature, releases [[bisphenol A]]:
:1/n [OC(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →   (HOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

More than 100 studies have explored the bioactivity of bisphenol A derived from polycarbonates. Bisphenol A appeared to be released from polycarbonate animal cages into water at room temperature and it may have been responsible for enlargement of the reproductive organs of female mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = KL|last = Howdeshell|author2=Peterman PH |author3=Judy BM |author4=Taylor JA |author5=Orazio CE |author6=Ruhlen RL |author7=Vom Saal FS |author8=Welshons WV |year = 2003|title = Bisphenol A is released from used polycarbonate animal cages into water at room temperature|journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|volume = 111|issue = 9|pages = 1180–7|pmid = 12842771|doi = 10.1289/ehp.5993|pmc = 1241572}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the animal cages used in the research were fabricated from industrial grade polycarbonate, rather than FDA food grade polycarbonate.

An analysis of the literature on bisphenol A leachate low-dose effects by vom Saal and Hughes published in August 2005 seems to have found a suggestive correlation between the source of funding and the conclusion drawn. Industry-funded studies tend to find no significant effects whereas government-funded studies tend to find significant effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=vom Saal FS, Hughes C |title=An extensive new literature concerning low-dose effects of bisphenol A shows the need for a new risk assessment |journal=Environ.

==Environmental impact==

===Disposal===
Studies have shown that at high temperatures between 70 and 80&amp;nbsp;°C and high humidity, polycarbonates hydrolyzes to [[bisphenol A]] (BPA). This condition is similar to that observed in most incinerators. After about 30 days under such conditions, surface crystals were formed. Measurements indicated that about 70% by mass of the surface crystals were bisphenol A (BPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1981-06-01|title=Hydrolysis of polycarbonate to yield BPA|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|language=en|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1777|doi=10.1002/app.1981.070260603|last1=Bair|first1=H.

G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPA is a compound that is currently on the list of potential environmental hazardous chemicals. It is on the watch list of many countries, such as United States and Germany.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morin|first=Nicolas|last2=Arp|first2=Hans Peter H.|last3=Hale|first3=Sarah E.|title=Bisphenol A in Solid Waste Materials, Leachate Water, and Air Particles from Norwegian Waste-Handling Facilities: Presence and Partitioning Behavior|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=49|issue=13|pages=7675–7683|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b01307|pmid=26055751|year=2015|bibcode=2015EnST...49.7675M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaching of BPA from polycarbonate can also occur at environmental temperature and normal pH (in landfills). The amount of leaching increases as the material becomes older. A study found that the decomposition of BPA in landfills (under anaerobic conditions) does not occur.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; It will therefore be persistent in landfills. Eventually, it will find its way into water bodies and contribute to aquatic pollution.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chin|first=Yu-Ping|last2=Miller|first2=Penney L.|last3=Zeng|first3=Lingke|last4=Cawley|first4=Kaelin|last5=Weavers|first5=Linda K.|title=Photosensitized Degradation of Bisphenol A by Dissolved Organic Matter †|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=38|issue=22|pages=5888–5894|doi=10.1021/es0496569|year=2004|bibcode=2004EnST...38.5888C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photo-oxidation of polycarbonate===

In the presence of UV light, oxidation of this polymer yields compounds such as ketones, phenols, o-phenoxybenzoic acid, benzyl alcohol and other unsaturated compounds. This has been suggested through kinetic and spectral studies. The yellow color formed after long exposure to sun can also be related to further oxidation of phenolic end group&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=T.|first=Chow, Jimmy|date=2007-08-06|title=Environmental assessment for bisphenol-a and polycarbonate|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2097/368|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: (OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, R* → (OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)CO)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

This product can be further oxidized to form smaller unsaturated compounds. This can proceed by two different pathways, the products formed depends on which mechanism takes place.

;Pathway A

: (OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)CO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H* → HO(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)OCO + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)OCO

;Pathway B

Photo-oxidation reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroccio|first=Sabrina|last2=Puglisi|first2=Concetto|last3=Montaudo|first3=Giorgio|title=Mechanisms of Thermal Oxidation of Poly(bisphenol A carbonate)|journal=Macromolecules|volume=35|issue=11|pages=4297–4305|doi=10.1021/ma012077t|year=2002|bibcode=2002MaMol..35.4297C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photo-aging reaction===

Photo-aging is another degradation route for polycarbonates. Polycarbonate molecules (such as the aromatic ring) absorb UV radiation. This absorbed energy causes cleavage of covalent bonds, which initiates the photo-aging process. The reaction can be propagated by side chain oxidation, ring oxidation or photo-fries rearrangement. Products formed include phenyl salicylate, dihydroxybenzophenone groups, and hydroxydiphenyl ether groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collin|first=S.|last2=Bussière|first2=P.-O.|last3=Thérias|first3=S.|last4=Lambert|first4=J.-M.|last5=Perdereau|first5=J.|last6=Gardette|first6=J.-L.|date=2012-11-01|title=Physicochemical and mechanical impacts of photo-ageing on bisphenol a polycarbonate|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=97|issue=11|pages=2284–2293|doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.07.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The effects of ultraviolet radiation on polycarbonate glazing|year=1999|author=Tjandraatmadja, G.

===Thermal degradation===

Waste polycarbonate will degrade at high temperatures to form solid, liquid and gaseous pollutants. A study showed that the products were, by mass, about 40–50% liquid, 14–16% gases, while 34–43% remained as solid residue. Liquid products contained mainly phenol derivatives (∼75%) and bisphenol (∼10%) also present.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, burning of these discs{{what?|date=December 2017}} is also not a viable method of disposal.

Phenol derivatives are environmental pollutants, classified as [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOC). Studies show that they are likely to facilitate ground-level ozone formation and increase photo-chemical smog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pollution.unibuc.ro/?substance=47|title=Pollution Database|website=pollution.unibuc.ro|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In aquatic bodies, they can potentially accumulate in organisms. They are persistent in landfills, do not readily evaporate and would remain in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.sepa.org.uk/spripa/Pages/SubstanceInformation.aspx?pid=81|title=Pollutant Fact Sheet|website=apps.sepa.org.uk|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of fungi===
In 2001, a species of fungus, ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'', was found to consume the polycarbonate found in [[compact disc]]s (CD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title= Fungus eats CD|date=2001-06-27|author=Bosch, Xavier|doi=10.1038/news010628-11  |journal=Nature News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has prospects for [[bioremediation]].{{clarifyme|date=June 2018}}{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The '''Pony Express Pipeline''' ('''PXP''') is a {{convert|760|mi|adj=on}} pipeline connecting [[Guernsey, Wyoming]] with the oil hub of [[Cushing, Oklahoma]].

==Overiew==
In 2013 agreement was reached to convert the [[natural gas]] pipeline to carry crude oil from the [[Bakken formation]] shale plays in [[North Dakota]] and [[Montana]]. It is supposed to connect with the planned [[Double H Pipeline]]. The project is being developed by Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline, LLC ([[Tallgrass Energy Partners]]). Construction was completed in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2014/10/09/tallgrass-energy-partners-pony-express-pipeline.html|title=Tallgrass completes 690-mile Pony Express pipeline project - Kansas City Business Journal|website=Kansas City Business Journal|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pony Express Pipeline will have a capacity of {{convert|230,000|oilbbl/d}} and be expandable to more than {{convert|400,000|oilbbl/d}}.

The '''Saab 9-X Biohybrid''' [[concept car]] was developed by [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] in 2008, and first shown on the [[Geneva Motor Show]]. It is based on the [[GM Delta platform]], and was thought to give an idea of the cancelled [[Saab 9-1X]].

It has keyless entry and small cameras instead of [[rear-view mirror]]s. On the roof, there is a [[solar panel]], like in the [[Saab EV-1]], for charging the [[car battery|battery]], both when driving and when parked. The [[headlights]] are automatic. A front mounted camera detects if you meet another car.

The front of the car follows the design of the [[Saab Aero-X]] while the rear has a cut off look, similar to the [[Saab 9-X]]. It is powered by a direct injected, E85 flex fuel capable turbocharged inline four cylinder engine of 1.4 liters giving {{convert|200|hp||0|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|280|Nm|ftlbf|0|abbr=on}} at 1750-5000 rpm. Connected to the engine by a belt is GM's BAS+ hybrid system which can provide a boost up to 19 hp. 

The engine is connected to a manual six speed [[gearbox]] with automatic [[clutch]]. 0-100 km/h (62 mph) is achieved in 7.9 seconds and it has a top speed of {{convert|216|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. It has four seats although the headroom in the rear is somewhat restricted. As the name suggests, it runs both regular gasoline and [[E85]]. 

The fuel consumption (running on E85) is {{convert|6.41|L/100 km}} and the tank to wheel [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions are 105 g/km. If driven faster than {{convert|70|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, the rear spoiler is extended and an underbody diffuser is deployed from the bottom of the rear bumper. When braking at speeds above {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, the spoiler acts like an air brake and also is used to increase the [[downforce]] of the car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1064&amp;a=748524 Koncept-Saab med hybriddrift och solpanel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">The '''Sahara and Sahel Observatory''' ({{lang-fr|Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel}}, OSS) is an [[Africa]]n [[intergovernmental organisation]] established in 1992 and based in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]]. Its aim is to protect the environment in [[Sahara]] and [[Sahel]], supervise the usage of natural resources in the region, and lobby for environmental accords, especially those pertaining [[desertification]] and [[climate change]]. The membership of the organisation comprises 22 African countries, five countries outside Africa (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland), ten international organisations (including five sub-regional representatives from [[West Africa|West]], [[East Africa|East]] and [[North Africa]]) and one [[non-governmental organisation]]. The organisation raised [[Euro|€]]17&amp;nbsp;million between 2006 and 2011.&lt;ref name="wmo presentation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sahara and Sahel Observatory|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/drought/hmndp/documents/presentations/SE-W5.pdf|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organisation]]|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the [[Kingdom of Morocco]] was elected to a four-year term presiding the organisation.&lt;ref name="lemag.ma morocco presidency"&gt;{{cite web|title=Morocco Elected Chair of Sahara-Sahel Observatory|url=http://www.lemag.ma/Morocco-Elected-Chair-of-Sahara-Sahel-Observatory_a99008.html|website=Lemag.ma|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of OSS projects include the Long Term Ecological Observatory Network ({{lang-fr|Réseau d'Observatoires de Surveillance Ecologique à long Terme}}, ROSELT), which  consists of 25 observatories in 12 countries; a drought early warning system in [[Maghreb]]; and cross-border [[groundwater]] management in [[Algeria]], [[Libya]] and Tunisia.&lt;ref name="wmo presentation" /&gt;

The '''Seebeck coefficient''' (also known as '''thermopower''',&lt;ref&gt;Thermo''power'' is a misnomer as this quantity does not actually express a power quantity: Note that the unit of thermopower (V/K) is different from the unit of power ([[watt]]s).&lt;/ref&gt; '''thermoelectric power''', and '''thermoelectric sensitivity''') of a material is a measure of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across that material, as induced by the [[Seebeck effect]].&lt;ref name=Blundell&gt;''Concepts in Thermal Physics'', by Katherine M. Blundell [https://books.google.com/books?id=v2W5ha0E_D4C&amp;pg=PA393&amp;dq=thermopower+seebeck&amp;lr=&amp;ei=nLQ7Ss2uI4uwkASkzpS6BQ Weblink through Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The SI unit of the Seebeck coefficient is [[volt]]s per [[kelvin]] (V/K),&lt;ref name=Blundell/&gt; although it is more often given in [[microvolt]]s per kelvin (μV/K).

The use of materials with a high Seebeck coefficient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/anie.200900598 |title=New and Old Concepts in Thermoelectric Materials |authors=Joseph R. Sootsman, Duck Young Chung Dr., Mercouri G. Kanatzidis |date=2009 |journal=Angewandte Chemie}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of many important factors for the efficient behaviour of [[thermoelectric generator]]s and [[thermoelectric cooler]]s. More information about high-performance thermoelectric materials can be found in the [[Thermoelectric materials]] article. In [[thermocouple]]s the Seebeck effect is used to measure temperatures, and for accuracy it is desirable to use materials with a Seebeck coefficient that is stable over time.

Physically, the magnitude and sign of the Seebeck coefficient can be approximately understood as being given by the [[entropy]] per unit charge carried by electrical currents in the material. It may be positive or negative. In conductors that can be understood in terms of independently moving, nearly-free [[charge carrier]]s, the Seebeck coefficient is negative for negatively charged carriers (such as [[electron]]s), and positive for positively charged carriers (such as [[electron hole]]s).

==Definition==

{{main|Seebeck effect}}

One way to define the Seebeck coefficient is the voltage built up when a small temperature gradient is applied to a material, and when the material has come to a steady state where the [[current density]] is zero everywhere. If the temperature difference  Δ''T'' between the two ends of a material is small, then the Seebeck coefficient of a material is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
S = -{\Delta V \over \Delta T}
&lt;/math&gt;
where Δ''V'' is the thermoelectric voltage seen at the terminals. (See below for more on the signs of Δ''V'' and  Δ''T''.)

Note that the voltage shift expressed by the Seebeck effect cannot be measured directly, since the measured voltage (by attaching a voltmeter) contains an additional voltage contribution, due to the temperature gradient and Seebeck effect in the measurement leads. The voltmeter voltage is always dependent on ''relative'' Seebeck coefficients among the various materials involved.

Most generally and technically, the Seebeck coefficient is defined in terms of the portion of electric current driven by temperature gradients, as in the vector [[differential equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = -\sigma \boldsymbol \nabla V - \sigma S \boldsymbol \nabla T&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf J&lt;/math&gt; is the [[current density]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical conductivity]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol \nabla V&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage gradient, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol \nabla T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient. The zero-current, steady state special case described above has &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf J=0&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that the two current density terms have cancelled out and so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol \nabla V = -S\boldsymbol \nabla T&lt;/math&gt;.

===Sign convention===

The sign is made explicit in the following expression:
:&lt;math&gt;S = -\frac{V_{\rm left}-V_{\rm right}}{T_{\rm left}-T_{\rm right}}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, if ''S'' is positive, the end with the higher temperature has the lower voltage, and vice versa. The voltage gradient in the material will point against the temperature gradient.

The Seebeck effect is generally dominated by the contribution from charge carrier diffusion (see below) which tends to push charge carriers towards the cold side of the material until a compensating voltage has built up. As a result, in [[p-type semiconductor]]s (which have only positive mobile charges, [[electron hole]]s), ''S'' is positive. Likewise, in [[n-type semiconductor]]s (which have only negative mobile charges, [[electron]]s), ''S'' is negative. 
In most conductors, however, the charge carriers exhibit both hole-like and electron-like behaviour and the sign of ''S'' usually depends on which of them predominates.

===Relationship to other thermoelectric coefficients===

{{main|Thomson relations}}

According to the [[second Thomson relation]] (which holds for all non-magnetic materials in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field), the Seebeck coefficient is related to the [[Peltier coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Pi&lt;/math&gt; by the exact relation
:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{\Pi}{T}, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic temperature]].

According to the [[first Thomson relation]] and under the same assumptions about magnetism, the Seebeck coefficient is related to the [[Thomson coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal K&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int \frac{\mathcal K}{T}\, dT. &lt;/math&gt;
The [[constant of integration]] is such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S=0&lt;/math&gt; at absolute zero, as required by [[Nernst's theorem]].

==Measurement==

===Relative Seebeck coefficient===
{{see also|Thermocouple}}
In practice the absolute Seebeck coefficient is difficult to measure directly, since the voltage output of a thermoelectric circuit, as measured by a voltmeter, only depends on ''differences'' of Seebeck coefficients. This is because electrodes attached to a voltmeter must be placed onto the material in order to measure the thermoelectric voltage. The temperature gradient then also typically induces a thermoelectric voltage across one leg of the measurement electrodes. Therefore, the measured Seebeck coefficient is a contribution from the Seebeck coefficient of the material of interest and the material of the measurement electrodes. This arrangement of two materials is usually called a [[thermocouple]].

The measured Seebeck coefficient is then a contribution from both and can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{AB} = S_B-S_A = {\Delta V_B \over \Delta T} - {\Delta V_A \over \Delta T}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Absolute Seebeck coefficient===

[[File:Absolute Seebeck coefficient of lead at low temperature.svg|thumb|Absolute Seebeck coefficient of [[lead]] at low temperature, according to Christian, Jan, Pearson, Templeton (1958). Below the critical temperature of lead (indicated by the dashed line, approximately 7 K) the lead is superconducting.]]

[[File:Absolute Seebeck coefficients of various metals up to high temperatures.svg|thumb|Absolute Seebeck coefficients of various metals up to high temperatures, mainly from Cusack &amp; Kendall (1958). The data for lead (Pb) is from Christian, Jan, Pearson, Templeton (1958).]]

Although only relative Seebeck coefficients are important for externally measured voltages, the absolute Seebeck coefficient can be important for other effects where voltage is measured indirectly. Determination of the absolute Seebeck coefficient therefore requires more complicated techniques and is more difficult, but such measurements have been performed on standard materials. These measurements only had to be performed once for all time, and for all materials; for any other material, the absolute Seebeck coefficient can be obtained by performing a relative Seebeck coefficient measurement against a standard material.

A measurement of the Thomson coefficient &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, which expresses the strength of the [[Thomson effect]], can be used to yield the absolute Seebeck coefficient through the relation: &lt;math&gt;S(T) = \int_0^T {\mu(T') \over T'} dT'&lt;/math&gt;, provided that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is measured down to [[absolute zero]]. The reason this works is that &lt;math&gt;S(T)&lt;/math&gt; is expected to decrease to zero as the temperature is brought to zero—a consequence of [[Nernst's theorem]]. Such a measurement based on the integration of &lt;math&gt;\mu/T&lt;/math&gt; was published in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it relied on the interpolation of the Thomson coefficient in certain regions of temperature.

[[Superconductor]]s have zero Seebeck coefficient, as mentioned below. By making one of the wires in a thermocouple superconducting, it is possible to get a direct measurement of the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the other wire, since it alone determines the measured voltage from the entire thermocouple. A publication in 1958 used this technique to measure the absolute Seebeck coefficient of [[lead]] between 7.2 K and 18 K, thereby filling in an important gap in the previous 1932 experiment mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Christian | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Jan | first2 = J.-P. | last3 = Pearson | first3 = W. B. | last4 = Templeton | first4 = I. M. | title = Thermo-Electricity at Low Temperatures. VI.

The combination of the superconductor-thermocouple technique up to 18 K, with the Thomson-coefficient-integration technique above 18 K, allowed determination of the absolute Seebeck coefficient of [[lead]] up to room temperature. By proxy, these measurements led to the determination of absolute Seebeck coefficients for ''all materials'', even up to higher temperatures, by a combination of Thomson coefficient integrations and thermocouple circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cusack | first1 = N. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1088/0370-1328/72/5/429 | title = The Absolute Scale of Thermoelectric Power at High Temperature | journal = Proceedings of the Physical Society | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 898 | year = 1958 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1958PPS....72..898C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of these measurements, and the rarity of reproducing experiments, lends some degree of uncertainty to the absolute thermoelectric scale thus obtained. In particular, the 1932 measurements may have incorrectly measured the Thomson coefficient over the range 20 K to 50 K. Since nearly all subsequent publications relied on those measurements, this would mean that all of the commonly used values of absolute Seebeck coefficient (including those shown in the figures) are too low by about 0.3 μV/K, for all temperatures above 50 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.

==Seebeck coefficients for some common materials==

{{For|the thermoelectric properties of high-performance thermoelectric materials|Thermoelectric materials}}

In the table below are Seebeck coefficients at room temperature for some common, nonexotic materials, measured relative to platinum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronics-cooling.com/2006/11/the-seebeck-coefficient/ The Seebeck Coefficient, Electronics Cooling.com (accessed 2013-Feb-01)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Seebeck coefficient of platinum itself is approximately −5 μV/K at room temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = J. P. | title = Absolute Seebeck coefficient of platinum from 80 to 340 K and the thermal and electrical conductivities of lead from 80 to 400 K | doi = 10.1063/1.1662324 | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 1174 | year = 1973 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1973JAP....44.1174M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so the values listed below should be compensated accordingly. For example, the Seebeck coefficients of Cu, Ag, Au are 1.5 μV/K, and of Al −1.5 μV/K. The Seebeck coefficient of semiconductors very much depends on doping, with generally positive values for p doped materials and negative values for n doping.

==Physical factors that determine the Seebeck coefficient==

A material's temperature, crystal structure, and impurities influence the value of thermoelectric coefficients. The Seebeck effect can be attributed to two things:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kong|first1=Ling Bing|title=Waste Energy Harvesting|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-54634-1|pages=263–403|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-54634-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; charge-carrier diffusion and phonon drag.

=== Charge carrier diffusion ===

On a fundamental level, an applied voltage difference refers to a difference in the thermodynamic [[chemical potential]] of charge carriers, and the direction of the current under a voltage difference is determined by the universal thermodynamic process in which (given equal temperatures) particles flow from high chemical potential to low chemical potential. In other words, the direction of the current in Ohm's law is determined via the thermodynamic [[Entropy (arrow of time)|arrow of time]] (the difference in chemical potential could be exploited to produce work, but is instead dissipated as heat which increases entropy). On the other hand, for the Seebeck effect not even the sign of the current can be predicted from thermodynamics, and so to understand the origin of the Seebeck coefficient it is necessary to understand the ''microscopic'' physics.

[[Charge carrier]]s (such as thermally excited electrons) constantly diffuse around inside a conductive material. Due to thermal fluctuations, some of these charge carriers travel with a higher energy than average, and some with a lower energy. When no voltage differences or temperature differences are applied, the carrier diffusion perfectly balances out and so on average one sees no current: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf J = 0&lt;/math&gt;. A net current can be generated by applying a voltage difference (Ohm's law), or by applying a temperature difference (Seebeck effect). To understand the microscopic origin of the thermoelectric effect, it is useful to first describe the microscopic mechanism of the normal Ohm's law electrical conductance—to describe what determines the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf J = -\sigma\boldsymbol\nabla V&lt;/math&gt;. Microscopically, what is happening in Ohm's law is that higher energy levels have a higher concentration of carriers per state, on the side with higher chemical potential. For each interval of energy, the carriers tend to diffuse and spread into the area of device where there are fewer carriers per state of that energy. As they move, however, they occasionally scatter dissipatively, which re-randomizes their energy according to the local temperature and chemical potential. This dissipation empties out the carriers from these higher energy states, allowing more to diffuse in. The combination of diffusion and dissipation favours an overall drift of the charge carriers towards the side of the material where they have a lower chemical potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780521631457 | title = Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor | last1 = Datta | first1 = Supriyo | authorlink1 = Supriyo Datta | year = 2005 | publisher = Cambridge University Presss  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.11}}

For the thermoelectric effect, now, consider the case of uniform voltage (uniform chemical potential) with a temperature gradient. In this case, at the hotter side of the material there is more variation in the energies of the charge carriers, compared to the colder side. This means that high energy levels have a higher carrier occupation per state on the hotter side, but also the hotter side has a ''lower'' occupation per state at lower energy levels. As before, the high-energy carriers diffuse away from the hot end, and produce entropy by drifting towards the cold end of the device. However, there is a competing process: at the same time low-energy carriers are drawn back towards the hot end of the device. Though these processes both generate entropy, they work against each other in terms of charge current, and so a net current only occurs if one of these drifts is stronger than the other. The net current is given by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf J = -\sigma S\boldsymbol\nabla T&lt;/math&gt;, where (as shown below) the thermoelectric coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sigma S&lt;/math&gt; depends literally on how conductive high-energy carriers are, compared to low-energy carriers. The distinction may be due to a difference in rate of scattering, a difference in speeds, a difference in density of states, or a combination of these effects.

==== Mott formula ====

The processes described above apply in materials where each charge carrier sees an essentially static environment so that its motion can be described independently from other carriers, and independent of other dynamics (such as phonons). In particular, in electronic materials with weak electron-electron interactions, weak electron-phonon interactions, etc. it can be shown in general that the linear response conductance is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int c(E)  \Bigg( -\frac{df(E)}{dE} \Bigg) \, dE,&lt;/math&gt;
and the linear response thermoelectric coefficient is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma S = \frac{k_{\rm B}}{-e} \int \frac{E - \mu}{k_{\rm B}T} c(E)  \Bigg( -\frac{df(E)}{dE} \Bigg) \, dE&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the energy-dependent conductivity, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi–Dirac distribution function]]. These equations are known as the Mott relations, of [[Sir Nevill Francis Mott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cutler | first1 = M. | last2 = Mott | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.181.1336 | title = Observation of Anderson Localization in an Electron Gas | journal = Physical Review | volume = 181 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1969PhRv..181.1336C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivative&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; -\frac{df(E)}{dE} = \frac{1}{4k_{\rm B}T} \operatorname{sech}^2\left( \frac{E-\mu}{2k_{\rm B}T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;is a function peaked around the chemical potential ([[Fermi level]]) &lt;math&gt; \mu&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Full width at half maximum|width]] of approximately &lt;math&gt;3.5 k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;. The energy-dependent conductivity (a quantity that cannot actually be directly measured — one only measures &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated as &lt;math&gt;c(E) = e^2 D(E) \nu(E)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;D(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the electron [[diffusion constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the electronic [[density of states]] (in general, both are functions of energy).

In materials with strong interactions, none of the above equations can be used since it is not possible to consider each charge carrier as a separate entity. The [[Wiedemann–Franz law]] can also be exactly derived using the non-interacting electron picture, and so in materials where the Wiedemann–Franz law fails (such as [[superconductor]]s), the Mott relations also generally tend to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jonson | first1 = M. | last2 = Mahan | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.21.4223 | title = Mott's formula for the thermopower and the Wiedemann-Franz law | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 4223 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1980PhRvB..21.4223J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formulae above can be simplified in a couple of important limiting cases:

===== Mott formula in metals =====
In [[semimetal]]s and [[metal]]s, where transport only occurs near the Fermi level and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c(E)&lt;/math&gt; changes slowly in the range &lt;math&gt;E \approx \mu \pm k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;, one can perform a [[Sommerfeld expansion]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c(E) = c(\mu) + c'(\mu) (E-\mu) + O[(E-\mu)^2]&lt;/math&gt;, which leads to
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\rm metal} = \frac{\pi^2 k_{\rm B}^2 T}{-3 e} \frac{c'(\mu)}{c(\mu)} + O[(k_{\rm B}T)^3], \quad \sigma_{\rm metal} = c(\mu) + O[(k_{\rm B}T)^2].&lt;/math&gt;
This expression is sometimes called "the Mott formula", however it is much less general than Mott's original formula expressed above.

In the [[free electron model]] with scattering, the value of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c'(\mu) / c(\mu) &lt;/math&gt; is of order  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1/(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm F}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi temperature]], and so a typical value of the Seebeck coefficient in the Fermi gas is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S_{\rm Fermi~gas} \approx \tfrac{\pi^2 k_{\rm B}}{-3e} T/T_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; (the prefactor varies somewhat depending on details such as dimensionality and scattering). In highly conductive metals the Fermi temperatures are typically around 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; K, and so it is understandable why their absolute Seebeck coefficients are only of order 1 – 10 μV/K at room temperature. Note that whereas the free electron model predicts a negative Seebeck coefficient, real metals actually have complicated [[band structure]]s and may exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients (examples: Cu, Ag, Au).

The fraction &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c'(\mu) / c(\mu)&lt;/math&gt; in semimetals is sometimes calculated from the measured derivative of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma_{\rm metal} &lt;/math&gt; with respect to some energy shift induced by [[Field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]]. This is not necessarily correct and the estimate of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c'(\mu) / c(\mu) &lt;/math&gt; can be incorrect (by a factor of two or more), since the disorder potential depends on screening which also changes with field effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hwang | first1 = E.

===== Mott formula in semiconductors =====

In [[semiconductor]]s at low levels of doping, transport only occurs far away from the Fermi level. At low doping in the conduction band (where &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle E_{\rm C} - \mu \gg k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle E_{\rm C} &lt;/math&gt; is the minimum energy of the conduction band edge), one has &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\frac{df(E)}{dE} \approx \tfrac{1}{k_{\rm B}T} e^{-(E-\mu)/(k_{\rm B}T)}&lt;/math&gt;. Approximating the conduction band levels' conductivity function as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle  c(E) = A_{\rm C} (E - E_{\rm C})^{a_{\rm C}} &lt;/math&gt; for some constants &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\rm C} = \frac{k_{\rm B}}{-e} \Big[ \frac{E_{\rm C} - \mu}{k_{\rm B}T} + a_{\rm C} + 1\Big], \quad \sigma_{\rm C} = A_{\rm C} (k_{\rm B}T)^{a_{\rm C}} e^{-\frac{E_{\rm C} - \mu}{k_{\rm B}T}} \Gamma(a_{\rm C}+1).&lt;/math&gt;
whereas in the valence band when &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \mu - E_{\rm V}\gg kT&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle  c(E) = A_{\rm V} (E_{\rm V} - E)^{a_{\rm V}} &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\rm V} = \frac{k}{e} \Big[ \frac{\mu - E_{\rm V}}{k_{\rm B}T} + a_{\rm V} + 1\Big], \quad \sigma_{\rm V} = A_{\rm V} (k_{\rm B}T)^{a_{\rm V}} e^{-\frac{\mu - E_{\rm V}}{k_{\rm B}T}} \Gamma(a_{\rm V}+1).&lt;/math&gt;
The values of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a_{\rm V}&lt;/math&gt; depend on material details; in bulk semiconductor these constants range between 1 and 3, the extremes corresponding to acoustic-mode lattice scattering and ionized-impurity scattering.&lt;ref&gt;Semiconductor Physics: An Introduction， Karlheinz Seeger&lt;/ref&gt;

In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors either the conduction or valence band will dominate transport, and so one of the numbers above will give the measured values. In general however the semiconductor may also be intrinsic in which case the bands conduct in parallel, and so the measured values will be
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\rm semi} = \frac{\sigma_{\rm C} S_{\rm C} + \sigma_{\rm V} S_{\rm V}}{\sigma_{\rm C} + \sigma_{\rm V}}, \quad \sigma_{\rm semi} = \sigma_{\rm C} + \sigma_{\rm V} &lt;/math&gt;
The highest Seebeck coefficient is obtained when the semiconductor is lightly doped, however a high Seebeck coefficient is not necessarily useful. For thermoelectric power devices (coolers, generators) it is more important to maximize the [[thermoelectric power factor]]  &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \sigma S^2 &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.64.241104&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[thermoelectric figure of merit]], and the optimum generally occurs at high doping levels.&lt;ref&gt;G. Jeffrey Snyder, "Thermoelectrics". http://www.its.caltech.edu/~jsnyder/thermoelectrics/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonon drag ===
{{Main|Phonon drag}}
Phonons are not always in local thermal equilibrium; they move against the thermal gradient. They lose momentum by interacting with electrons (or other carriers) and imperfections in the crystal. If the phonon-electron interaction is predominant, the phonons will tend to push the electrons to one end of the material, hence losing momentum and contributing to the thermoelectric field. This contribution is most important in the temperature region where phonon-electron scattering is predominant. This happens for
:&lt;math&gt;T \approx {1 \over 5} \theta_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Debye model|Debye temperature]]. At lower temperatures there are fewer phonons available for drag, and at higher temperatures they tend to lose momentum in phonon-phonon scattering instead of phonon-electron scattering. This region of the thermopower-versus-temperature function is highly variable under a magnetic field.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

=== Relationship with entropy ===

The Seebeck coefficient of a material corresponds thermodynamically to the amount of [[entropy]] "dragged along" by the flow of charge inside a material; it is in some sense the entropy per unit charge in the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bulusu | first1 = A. | last2 = Walker | first2 = D. G. | doi = 10.1016/j.spmi.2008.02.008 | title = Review of electronic transport models for thermoelectric materials | journal = Superlattices and Microstructures | volume = 44 | pages = 1 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2008SuMi...44....1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superconductors ===

[[Superconductivity|Superconductor]]s have zero Seebeck coefficient, because the current-carrying charge carriers ([[Cooper pair]]s) have no [[entropy]]; {{citation needed|date=January 2014}} hence, the transport of charge carriers (the supercurrent) has zero contribution from any temperature gradient that might exist to drive it.

[[File:Influent raw wastewater (note grey colour in glass jar) (3232393634).jpg|thumb|Raw sewage arriving at a [[sewage treatment]] plant in [[Syria]]]]

'''Sewage''' (or '''domestic wastewater''' or '''municipal wastewater''') is a type of [[wastewater]] that is produced by a [[community]] of people. It is characterized by [[volume]] or [[Volumetric flow rate|rate of flow]], physical condition, chemical and toxic constituents, and its [[bacteriology|bacteriologic]] status (which organisms it contains and in what quantities). It consists mostly of [[greywater]] (from sinks, tubs, showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers), [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] (the water used to flush [[toilet]]s, combined with the [[human waste]] that it flushes away); soaps and detergents; and [[toilet paper]] (less so in regions where [[bidet]]s are widely used instead of paper). 

Sewage usually travels from a building's [[plumbing]] either into a [[sewerage|sewer]], which will carry it elsewhere, or into an [[onsite sewage facility]] (of which there are many kinds). Whether it is combined with surface runoff in the sewer depends on the sewer design ([[sanitary sewer]] or [[combined sewer]]). The reality is, however, that most wastewater produced globally remains untreated causing widespread [[water pollution]], especially in low-income countries: A global estimate by [[UNDP]] and [[UN-Habitat]] is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=Corcoran, E., C.

&lt;/ref&gt; In common British usage, and in American technical and professional English usage, "sewerage" refers to the [[infrastructure]] that conveys sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sewerage |title=sewerage – definition of sewerage in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134232/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sewerage |archivedate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Before the 20th century, sewers usually discharged into a [[body of water]] such as a stream, river, lake, bay, or ocean. There was no treatment, so the breakdown of the [[human waste]] was left to the [[ecosystem]]. Today, the goal is that sewers route their contents to a [[wastewater treatment plant]] rather than directly to a body of water. In many countries, this is the norm; in many [[developing countries]], it may be a yet-unrealized goal. 

Current approaches to sewage management may include handling surface runoff separately from sewage, handling greywater separately from [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] ([[Flush toilet|flush toilets]]), and coping better with abnormal events (such as peaks [[stormwater]] volumes from extreme weather).

Proper collection and safe, nuisance-free disposal of the liquid wastes of a community are legally recognized as a necessity in an urbanized, industrialized society.&lt;ref name="scitech"&gt;McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology (View excerpt at [http://www.answers.com/topic/sewage Answers.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212034411/http://www.answers.com/topic/sewage |date=2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Types ==
[[File:Greywater samples before and after treatment in a VFB (5547295000).jpg|thumb|[[Greywater]] samples before and after treatment in a [[constructed wetland]] in Peru]]
* The [[wastewater]] from residences and institutions, carrying bodily wastes (primarily [[feces]] and [[urine]]), [[washing]] water, food preparation wastes, laundry wastes, and other waste products of normal living, are classed as domestic or sanitary sewage. 
* Liquid-carried wastes from stores and service establishments serving the immediate community, termed commercial wastes, are included in the sanitary or domestic sewage category if their characteristics are similar to household flows. Wastes that result from industrial processes such as the production or manufacture of goods are classed as [[industrial wastewater]], not as sewage. 
* [[Surface runoff]], also known as storm flow or overland flow, is that portion of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that runs rapidly over the ground surface to a defined  [[Channel (geography)|channel]]. Precipitation absorbs gases and particulates from the [[atmosphere]], dissolves and [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaches]] materials from [[vegetation]] and [[soil]], suspends matter from the land, washes [[Spill containment|spills]] and debris from urban streets and highways, and carries all these pollutants as wastes in its flow to a [[Waste collection|collection point]].

== Pollutants ==

=== Organic pollutants and nutrients ===
Sewage is a complex mixture of chemicals, with many distinctive chemical characteristics. These include high concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], high conductivity (due to high dissolved solids), high alkalinity, with pH typically ranging between 7 and 8. The organic matter of sewage is measured by determining its [[Biochemical oxygen demand|biological oxygen demand]] (BOD) or the [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD).

=== Pathogens ===

Sewage contains [[human feces]], and therefore often contains [[pathogens]] of one of the four types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71253096|title=Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta, and greywater.|last=World Health Organization|first=|date=2006|publisher=World Health Organization|year=|isbn=9241546859|location=|pages=31|oclc=71253096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnström, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C.

* [[Bacteria]] (for example [[Salmonella]], [[Shigella]], [[Campylobacter]], [[Vibrio cholerae]]), 
* [[Virus]]es (for example [[hepatitis A]], [[rotavirus]], [[enteroviruses]]), 
* [[Protozoa]] (for example [[Entamoeba histolytica]], [[Giardia lamblia]], [[Cryptosporidium parvum]]) and 
* Parasites such as [[helminths]] and their eggs (e.g. [[ascaris]] (roundworm), [[ancylostoma]] (hookworm), [[trichuris]] (whipworm))
Sewage can be monitored for both disease-causing and benign organisms with a variety of techniques. Traditional techniques involve filtering, staining, and examining samples under a microscope. Much more sensitive and specific testing can be accomplished with [[DNA sequencing]], such as when looking for rare organisms, attempting [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]], testing specifically for drug-resistant strains, or discovering new species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_03/en/ Poliovirus detected from environmental samples in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104191619/http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_03/en/ |date=2013-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/drug-resistant-bug-review-ndm-1-new-delhi%E2%80%99s-sewage-who-calls-action-recent Drug resistant bug review: NDM-1 in New Delhi’s sewage, WHO calls to action, recent outbreaks of antibiotic resistant bacteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105042902/http://healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/drug-resistant-bug-review-ndm-1-new-delhi%E2%80%99s-sewage-who-calls-action-recent |date=2013-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbio.asm.org/content/2/5/e00180-11.full Raw Sewage Harbors Diverse Viral Populations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607085040/http://mbio.asm.org/content/2/5/e00180-11.full |date=2013-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sequencing DNA from an environmental sample is known as [[metagenomics]].

=== Micro-pollutants ===
Sewage also contains [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s. [[Trihalomethane|Trihalomethanes]] can also be present as a result of past [[disinfection]].

Sewage has also been analyzed to determine relative rates of use of prescription and illegal drugs among municipal populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/4 'Testing the waters': First International conference on drug wastewater analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209055215/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/4 |date=2014-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and environmental aspects==
All categories of sewage are likely to carry [[Pathogen|pathogenic organisms]] that can transmit disease to humans and animals. Sewage also contains organic matter that can cause odor and attract flies.

Sewage contains nutrients that may cause [[eutrophication]] of receiving water bodies; and can lead to [[ecotoxicity]].

{{Further|Sewage collection and disposal|Sewerage}}

A system of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] pipes (sewers) collects sewage and takes it for treatment or disposal. The system of sewers is called ''[[sanitary sewer|sewerage]]'' or ''sewerage system'' (see [[London sewerage system]]) in British English and ''sewage system'' in American English. Where a main sewerage system has not been provided, sewage may be collected from homes by pipes into [[septic tank]]s or [[cesspit]]s, where it may be treated or collected in [[vehicle]]s and taken for treatment or disposal. Properly functioning septic tanks require emptying every 2–5 years depending on the load of the system.

==Treatment==
{{Main|Sewage treatment}}
[[Sewage treatment]] is the process of removing the contaminants from sewage to produce liquid and solid ([[sludge]]) suitable for discharge to the environment or for reuse.  It is a form of [[waste management]].  A septic tank or other [[Onsite sewage facility|on-site wastewater treatment]] system such as [[biofilters]] or [[constructed wetland]]s can be used to treat sewage close to where it is created.

Sewage treatment results in [[sewage sludge]] which requires [[sewage sludge treatment]] before safe disposal or reuse. Under certain circumstances, the treated sewage sludge might be termed "[[biosolids]]" and can be used as a [[fertilizer]].

In [[developed countries]] sewage collection and treatment is typically subject to local and national [[Sewage - regulation and administration|regulations and standards]].

==Disposal==
Raw sewage is also disposed of to rivers, streams, and the sea in many parts of the world. Doing so can lead to serious pollution of the receiving water. This is common in [[developing countries]] and may still occur in some developed countries, for various reasons – usually related to costs.

Ships at sea are forbidden from discharging their sewage overboard unless three miles or more from shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819020650/http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/20/19926/P2_Documents/navydoc/gwpaper.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=19 August 2018|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Visible anchor|Reuse of treated or untreated sewage|Reuse in agriculture}} ==
{{Main|Reclaimed water}}
Increasingly, [[agriculture]] is using untreated wastewater for irrigation. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so are attractive to farmers. However, because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce water resources with industry and municipal users, there is often no alternative for farmers but to use water polluted with urban waste, including sewage, directly to water their crops. There can be significant health hazards related to using water loaded with pathogens in this way, especially if people eat raw vegetables that have been irrigated with the polluted water.

The [[International Water Management Institute]] has worked in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mexico and other countries on various projects aimed at assessing and reducing risks of wastewater irrigation. They advocate a ‘multiple-barrier’ approach to wastewater use, where farmers are encouraged to adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw, cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/PDF/Water_Issue_Brief_4.pdf Wastewater use in agriculture: ''Not only an issue where water is scarce!''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409024630/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/PDF/Water_Issue_Brief_4.pdf |date=2014-04-09 }} [[International Water Management Institute]], 2010. Water Issue Brief 4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] has developed guidelines for safe water use.

==Legislation==
=== European Union ===
{{Main article|Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive}}
Council Directive 91/271/EEC on Urban Wastewater Treatment was adopted on 21 May 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0271:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex – 31991L0271 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; amended by the Commission Directive 98/15/EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998L0015:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex – 31998L0015 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Commission Decision 93/481/EEC defines the information that Member States should provide the Commission on the state of implementation of the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993D0481:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex – 31993D0481 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The words "sewage" and "[[sanitary sewer|sewer]]" came from [[Old French]] ''essouier'' "to drain", which came from [[Latin]] ''exaquāre''. Their formal Latin antecedents are ''exaquāticum'' and ''exaquārium''. 

Both words are descended from Old French ''assewer'', derived from the Latin ''exaquare'', "to drain out (water)".

The term "solid state" became popular in the beginning of the semiconductor era in the 1960s to distinguish this new technology based on the transistor, in which the electronic action of devices occurred in a [[solid state physics|solid state]], from previous electronic equipment that used [[vacuum tube]]s, in which the electronic action occurred in a [[gaseous state]]. A semiconductor device works by controlling an electric current consisting of [[electron]]s or [[electron hole|holes]] moving within a solid crystalline piece of [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] material such as [[silicon]], while the [[thermionic]] vacuum tubes it replaced worked by controlling current conducted by a gas of particles, electrons or [[ion]]s, moving in a vacuum within a sealed tube. Although the first solid state electronic device was the [[cat's whisker detector]], a crude [[semiconductor diode]] invented around 1904, solid state electronics really started with the invention of the [[transistor]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos2"&gt;Papadopoulos (2013) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pYHBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22solid+state%22+amplification+transistor Solid-State Electronic Devices: An Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229001318/https://books.google.com/books?id=pYHBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22solid+state%22+amplification+transistor |date=2017-12-29 }}'', p. 11, 81-83&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, all electronic equipment used vacuum tubes, because vacuum tubes were the only [[electronic component]]s that could ''[[amplifier|amplify]]'', an essential capability in all electronics. The replacement of bulky, fragile, energy-wasting vacuum tubes by transistors in the 1960s and 1970s  created a revolution not just in technology but in people's habits, making possible the first truly portable [[consumer electronics]] such as the [[transistor radio]], [[cassette tape recorder|cassette tape player]], [[walkie-talkie]] and [[quartz watch]], as well as the first practical computers and [[mobile phone]]s.  

Today, almost all electronics are solid-state except in some applications such as [[radio transmitter]]s, in which vacuum tubes are still used, and some power industrial control circuits which use [[electromechanical]] devices such as [[relay]]s. Additional examples of solid state electronic devices are the [[microprocessor]] chip, [[LED]] lamp, [[solar cell]], [[CCD sensor|charge coupled device (CCD) image sensor]] used in cameras, and [[semiconductor laser]].

[[File:Woolaroc - Postkutsche.jpg|thumb|Overland wagon]]
[[File:Stage Waggon 1816 (14596016587).jpg|thumb|Passengers board the [[Kendal]] [[Fly (carriage)|Fly]]  (after) [[Thomas Rowlandson]] 1816]]
'''Stage wagons''' are light horse-drawn or mule-drawn public passenger vehicles often referred to as [[Stagecoach|stagecoaches]]. Like stagecoaches they made long scheduled trips using [[stage station]]s or posts where the horses would be replaced by fresh horses. Stage wagons were intended for use in particularly difficult conditions where standard stagecoaches would be too big and too heavy. 

This style of vehicle was often named a '''mud-coach''' or '''mud-wagon'''. More like wagons than coaches the sides of the vehicle gave passengers little protection from the dirt of the road. Abbot, Downing named their's an '''overland wagon'''. A brand-name, ''Celerity'', later became popular in place of mud (wagon).&lt;ref name=KW&gt;Ken Wheeling, ''They Called Them Mudders.'' The Carriage Journal, Vol 43 No 5 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
==Use==
They were employed wherever the poor state of the roads and or demand for services did not warrant the expense of a stagecoach. Most stagecoach routes in the United States' West were opened with them and often operators continued to use these vehicles as stagecoaches.&lt;ref name=KW/&gt;
==Structure==
[[File:Photograph of a stage coach. The coach is a "mudwagon" used to travel through rugged terrain. - NARA - 296584 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Mud-wagon]]
They were not unlike a freight wagon with a high driver's seat, bench seats on the tray and posts holding up canvas to shelter passengers from the weather. 

Those stage wagons with throroughbraces had an undercarriage like those used by a Concord coach but the thoroughbraces were much shorter and mounted to make sure there was much less motion of the body. The thoroughbraces were brought over a bar at each end and attached to another bar above the outer side of each axle.&lt;ref name=KW/&gt;

Stage wagon wheels and their iron tires were as much as fifty per cent wider than those of conventional stagecoaches

==Development==
[[File:Hammond Tenterden.jpg|thumb|Trade card of R Hammond of Tenterden, 1750. Freight 65 miles to [[Southwark]] at the south end of [[London Bridge]] from [[Tenterden]] in the Kentish Weald and return, once each week]]
Wagons carrying freight had been taking passengers in Europe since 1500. This particular stage wagon type was first recorded near the end of the 18th century in use in eastern North America, US and Upper and Lower Canada. It was an unsprung wagon with the driver's bench seat providing room for two more passengers beside him. It might also carry more passenger seats on the tray behind. These extra seats were reached by climbing over the driver's seat. About this time, the Postmaster General [[Joseph Habersham]] required the driver's seat to be moved from the tray onto a front wall to improve the driver's vision and by dropping the tray improve the wagon's stability. This created the characteristic stagecoach-like profile of the stage wagon.&lt;ref name=KW/&gt;

Their relatively simple design and construction allowed them to be sold by [[Abbot-Downing Company|Abbot, Downing]] at around half the price of full-size [[Concord stagecoach]]es. Their suspension employed thoroughbraces that were much shorter than those used on Concord stagecoaches.&lt;ref name=KW/&gt;


==Some manufacturers==

* Abbot, Downing, [[Concord, New Hampshire]]
* Milton P Henderson of [[Stockton California]] made stage wagons of the same style as Abbot, Downing. The firm began in 1869 as a partnership with E G Clark.. They can be identified by the finish of the sides of the bodies and the method of attachment of iron stays back and front.
* P O LeMay and Livy Swan at [[Yreka, California]]
* Weisenhorn Carriage in Helena, Montana built a vehicle very like an Abbot, Downing ''Australian wagon''&lt;ref name=KW/&gt;
* Celerity was a brand of Stage wagon made in [[Troy, New York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">'''Toronto Solar Neighbourhoods Initiative''' (“Solar Neighbourhoods”) is a joint project of the [[Toronto Atmospheric Fund]] and Toronto Energy Efficiency Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/energy/ |title=Environment &amp; Energy - Living In Toronto &amp;#124; City of Toronto |publisher=Toronto.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with support from the Toronto Environment Office&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/teo/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toronto Hydro]]. Its goal is to encourage the installation of [[solar water heating]] systems in Toronto homes through financial incentives and other support to both homeowners and the local solar industry. Phase I (2008-2009) of the pilot project is targeting homes in Toronto’s Ward 30. The program was developed based on a directive in Toronto’s “Climate Change, Clean Air and Sustainable Energy Action Plan”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/changeisintheair/ |title=Environment &amp; Energy - Living In Toronto &amp;#124; City of Toronto |publisher=Toronto.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was approved by Toronto City Council in June 2007.

==Name==
Official named the Toronto Solar Neighbourhoods Initiative, the pilot program is referred to as "Solar Neighbourhoods" for short.

==Funding==
Solar Neighbourhoods was made possible by a provincially mandated grant of $400,000 from the Portlands Energy Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandsenergycentre.com/ |title=portlandsenergycentre.com |publisher=portlandsenergycentre.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a natural gas-based power plant located within Ward 30, to go toward local air quality initiatives.

==Process==
The Solar Neighbourhoods program offers incentives of up to $1,000 towards the purchase of [[solar water heating]] systems for eligible residents. Those who participate can choose to receive $1,000 up-front towards the cost of their system or a $500 up-front rebate along with zero-interest financing to cover the cost of the system (up to $10,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidetoronto.com/Article/50574 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719115247/http://www.insidetoronto.com/Article/50574 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to qualify for these savings homeowners must live within Ward 30, and have an ecoENERGY home assessment with the selected auditing partner, Windfall Ecology Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windfallcentre.ca |title=windfallcentre.ca |publisher=windfallcentre.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ecoENERGY assessment is necessary to access federal and provincial  government solar hot water incentives, as well as incentives for a number of other home energy improvements through the ecoENERGY-Retrofit Homes program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoaction.gc.ca/ECOENERGY-ECOENERGIE/retrofithomes-renovationmaisons-eng.cfm?ecoenergy_main |title=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=ecoACTION |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation must be done by a Solar Neighbourhoods eligible contractor who has met basic requirements, including Canadian Solar Industry Association (CanSIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cansia.ca |title=cansia.ca |publisher=cansia.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; membership, using CanSIA certified installers, providing basic labour and equipment warranties, and maintaining adequate WSIB and commercial insurance. This incentive can be received in conjunction with other government incentives such as the ecoENERGY incentive, Ontario Home Energy Savings Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeenergyontario.ca/ |title=homeenergyontario.ca |publisher=homeenergyontario.ca |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009 Home Renovation Tax Credit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/sgmnts/hmwnr/hrtc/menu-eng.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarneighbourhoods.ca/ |title=solarneighbourhoods.ca |publisher=solarneighbourhoods.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community Partners==
Solar Neighbourhoods works in conjunction with a local solar buying club called the Riverdale Initiative for Solar Energy (RISE Again),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riseagain.ourpower.ca/Portal.aspx?portalid=1 |title=TREC Education |publisher=Riseagain.ourpower.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is bringing together neighbours in Riverdale to purchase both solar water heating systems and solar [[photovoltaic]] systems. A number of community solar buying groups exist across Toronto and southern Ontario, and are working together under the OurPower.ca&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourpower.ca/ |title=ourpower.ca |publisher=ourpower.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; umbrella.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">A '''traction power station''' is a [[power station]] that produces only [[traction current]], that is, [[electric current]] used for [[railway]]s, [[tram]]s, [[trolleybus]]es or other conveyances.  Pure traction power stations are rare and there are many more power stations that generate current for other purposes, such as standard [[three-phase]] [[alternating current]] (AC), in addition to traction current.

A '''vortex generator''' ('''VG''') is an [[aerodynamic]] device, consisting of a small [[wikt:vane|vane]] usually attached to a lifting surface (or [[airfoil]], such as an [[aircraft|aircraft wing]])&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; or a rotor blade of a [[wind turbine]].&lt;ref name="WindTurbineVortexGenerators"&gt;[http://www.upwindsolutions.com/upgrades/wind-turbine-vortex-generator/ Wind Turbine Vortex Generators], UpWind Solutions.&lt;/ref&gt; VGs may also be attached to some part of an aerodynamic vehicle such as an aircraft fuselage or a car.  When the airfoil or the body is in motion relative to the air, the VG creates a [[vortex]],&lt;ref name="Peppler"&gt;Peppler, I.L.: ''From The Ground Up'', page 23. Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, Ottawa Ontario, Twenty Seventh Revised Edition, 1996. {{ISBN|0-9690054-9-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroHow"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microaero.com/pages/v_howvgswrk.html|title = How Micro VGs Work|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Micro AeroDynamics|authorlink = |year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which, by removing some part of the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the airfoil surface, delays local [[flow separation]] and [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|aerodynamic stalling]], thereby improving the effectiveness of wings and [[Wing configuration#Tailplanes and foreplanes|control surfaces]], such as [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]], [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]], [[aileron]]s, and [[rudder]]s.&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt;

==Method of operation==
Vortex generators are most often used to delay [[flow separation]].  To accomplish this they are often placed on the external surfaces of vehicles&lt;ref name="Clancy"&gt;Clancy, L.J. ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.31&lt;/ref&gt; and wind turbine blades. On both aircraft and wind turbine blades they are usually installed quite close to the leading edge of the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] in order to maintain steady airflow over the control surfaces at the trailing edge.&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt; VGs are typically rectangular or triangular, about as tall as the local [[boundary layer]], and run in spanwise lines usually near the thickest part of the wing.&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; They can be seen on the wings and vertical tails of many [[airliner]]s.

Vortex generators are positioned obliquely so that they have an [[angle of attack]] with respect to the local airflow&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; in order to create a tip vortex which draws energetic, rapidly moving outside air into the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the surface. A turbulent boundary layer is less likely to separate than a laminar one, and is therefore desirable to ensure effectiveness of trailing-edge control surfaces. Vortex generators are used to trigger this transition. Other devices such as [[vortilon]]s, [[leading-edge extension]]s, [[leading edge cuff]]s,&lt;ref&gt;A drooped leading edge presents a "vortex-producing discontinuity", in "Spin Resistance Development for Small Airplanes", SAE paper 2000-01-1691&lt;/ref&gt; also delay flow separation at high angles of attack by re-energizing the boundary layer.&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt;

Examples of aircraft which use VGs include the [[Embraer 170]] and [[Symphony SA-160]]. For swept-wing transonic designs, VGs alleviate potential [[shock-stall]] problems (e.g., [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]], [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], [[Gloster Javelin]]).

==Aftermarket installation==
Many aircraft carry vane vortex generators from time of manufacture, but there are also aftermarket suppliers who sell VG kits to improve the [[STOL]] performance of some light aircraft.&lt;ref name="Micro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microaero.com/|title = Micro Vortex Generators for Single and Twin Engine Aircraft|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Micro AeroDynamics|authorlink = |year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aftermarket suppliers claim (i) that VGs lower stall speed and reduce take-off and landing speeds, and (ii) that VGs increase the effectiveness of ailerons, elevators and rudders, thereby improving controllability and safety at low speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landshorter.com/page2.html |title=Land Shorter! Benefits |publisher=Landshorter.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For home-built and experimental [[homebuilt aircraft|kitplane]]s, VGs are cheap, cost-effective and can be installed quickly; but for certified aircraft installations, [[Type certificate|certification]] costs can be high, making the modification a relatively expensive process.&lt;ref name="Micro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

Owners fit aftermarket VGs primarily to gain benefits at low speeds, but a downside is that such VGs may reduce cruise speed slightly. In tests performed on a [[Cessna 182]] and a [[Piper Cherokee|Piper PA-28-235 Cherokee]], independent reviewers have documented a loss of cruise speed of {{convert|1.5|to|2.0|kn|km/h|1|abbr=on}} .  However, these losses are relatively minor, since an aircraft wing at high speed has a small angle of attack, thereby reducing VG drag to a minimum.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAMay2003"&gt;Psutka, Kevin, ''Micro-vortex generators'', [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association|COPA Flight]], August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAJuly2004"&gt;Kirkby, Bob, ''Vortex Generators for the Cherokee 235'', [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association|COPA Flight]], July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners have reported that on the ground, it can be harder to clear snow and ice from wing surfaces with VGs than from a smooth wing, but VGs are not generally prone to inflight icing as they reside within the boundary layer of airflow. VGs may also have sharp edges which can tear the fabric of airframe covers and may thus require special covers to be made.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAMay2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAJuly2004" /&gt;

For twin-engined aircraft, manufacturers claim that VGs reduce single-engine control speed ([[V speeds|Vmca]]), increase zero fuel and gross weight, improve the effectiveness of ailerons and rudder, provide a smoother ride in turbulence and make the aircraft a more stable instrument platform&lt;ref name="Micro" /&gt;

==Increase in maximum takeoff weight==
Some VG kits available for light twin-engine airplanes may allow an increase in [[maximum takeoff weight]].&lt;ref name="Micro"/&gt;  The maximum takeoff weight of a twin-engine airplane is determined by structural requirements and single-engine climb performance requirements (which are lower for a lower stall speed).  For many light twin-engine airplanes, the single-engine climb performance requirements determine a lower maximum weight rather than the structural requirements.  Consequently, anything that can be done to improve the single-engine-inoperative climb performance will bring about an increase in maximum takeoff weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

In the USA from 1945&lt;ref&gt;USA Civil Air Regulations, Part 3, §3.85a&lt;/ref&gt; until 1991,&lt;ref name="FAR23"&gt;USA Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 23, §23.67, amendment 23-42, February 4, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement for multi-engine airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight of {{convert|6000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} or less was as follows:
{{quote|All multi-engine airplanes having a stalling speed &lt;math&gt;V_{s0}&lt;/math&gt; greater than 70 miles per hour shall have a steady rate of climb of at least &lt;math&gt;0.02(V_{s0})^2&lt;/math&gt; in feet per minute at an altitude of 5,000 feet with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines operating at not more than maximum continuous power, the inoperative propeller in the minimum drag position, landing gear retracted, wing flaps in the most favorable position …}}
where &lt;math&gt;V_{s0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] speed in the landing configuration in miles per hour.

Installation of vortex generators can usually bring about a slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane&lt;ref name="Clancy"/&gt; and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative climb performance.  The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements.&lt;ref name="Busch"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/news/reviews/182564-1.html|title = Vortex Generators: Band-Aids or Magic?|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Busch|first = Mike|authorlink = |date=November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a [[maximum zero fuel weight]] or, if a maximum zero fuel weight is already specified as one of the airplane's limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum zero fuel weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;  For these reasons, vortex generator kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum zero fuel weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

The one-engine-inoperative rate-of-climb requirement does not apply to single-engine airplanes, so gains in the maximum takeoff weight (based on stall speed or structural considerations) are less significant compared to those for 1945–1991 twins.

After 1991, the airworthiness certification requirements in the USA specify the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement as a gradient independent of stalling speed, so there is less opportunity for vortex generators to increase the maximum takeoff weight of multi-engine airplanes whose certification basis is FAR 23 at amendment 23-42 or later.&lt;ref name="FAR23"/&gt;

==Maximum landing weight==
Because the landing weights of most light aircraft are determined by structural considerations and not by stall speed, most VG kits increase only the takeoff weight and &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; the landing weight.  Any increase in landing weight would require either structural modifications or re-testing the aircraft at the higher landing weight to demonstrate that the certification requirements are still met.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;  However, after a lengthy flight, sufficient fuel may have been used, thereby bringing the aircraft back below the permitted maximum landing weight.

==Aircraft noise reduction==
Vortex generators have been used on the wing underside of [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft to reduce noise generated by airflow over circular pressure equalisation vents for the fuel tanks. Lufthansa claims a noise reduction of up to 2&amp;nbsp;dB can thus be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2014/february/12/article/2797.html More than 200 Lufthansa A320 aircraft to become quieter.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504034353/http://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2014/february/12/article/2797.html |date=2014-05-04 }} Retrieved 2014-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Xingang Port oil spill''' is a spill that occurred in July 2010 caused by a rupture and subsequent explosion of two [[Petroleum#Crude oil|crude oil]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s that run to an oil storage depot of the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] in [[Xingang Harbour]], [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]]. The 1,500 tonnes of oil spilled from the pipes created an {{convert|180|km2|abbr=on}} slick in the Yellow Sea that grew to {{convert|430|km2|abbr=on}} within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Agence France-Presse |title=China rushes to clean up oil spill |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100719/wl_asia_afp/chinaenvironmentoilpollution |work=Yahoo!

==Incident==
{{Location map |China Liaoning |lat=38.92 |long=121.63 |type = landmark |width=250 |float=left |caption=''Location in Liaoning''}}

The spill occurred after a process to [[Hydrodesulfurization|desulfurize]] oil in a pipeline at the port began, triggering a fire which subsequently burned for 15 hours.  The fire burned from oil that was released from a filled storage tank with a 90,000 ton capacity that collapsed as a result of the fire. Oil from other nearby tanks was, according to a [[Greenpeace]] report released several weeks after the incident, intentionally released to prevent the fire from expanding towards a tank containing [[dimethylbenzene]], a flammable chemical.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalian Oil Spill: Preliminary Findings and Recommendations |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/release/dalian-oil-recommendations-steiner |publisher=Greenpeace |accessdate=10 August 2010 |date=2 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805232029/http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/press/release/dalian-oil-recommendations-steiner |archivedate=August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Containment and cover-up ==
Although Chinese government officials reported that as little as 1,500 tonnes of oil spilled,&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; a former University of Alaska marine conservation specialist, Rick Steiner, estimates the spill to have a much higher total, with somewhere in the range of 60,000 to 90,000 tons (18.47 to 27.70 million gallons) of oil spilled into the [[Yellow Sea]]. He said that "[i]t's enormous. That's at least as large as the official estimate of the Exxon Valdez disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |title=US expert: China oil spill far bigger than stated |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100730/ap_on_bi_ge/as_china_pipeline_explosion |work=Yahoo!

According to leaks on Weibo, the accident may have begun as early as June, 10. However, because the government never formally acknowledged the accident took place, as well as threatened informed citizens to delete their posts, the true nature of the accident was not clear to the public. No assessment on the effect on wildlife was ever carried out.

The ensuing fire burned for 15 hours and one firefighter drowned after being swept overboard into the water. There was extensive damage to local wildlife areas, aquaculture, and beaches were closed following the spill and conflagration which appeared to have been caused by the injection of a highly oxidizing sulfur reducing agent into a pipeline.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

On 26 July 2010, the Chinese local government announced the spill had been contained and that the spill had failed to reach open waters.&lt;ref name="Xinhua" /&gt; Cleanup efforts continued two weeks after the original explosion began, with operations to remove the oil performed at night when the oil is most viscous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hogg | first = Chris | title = China struggles to recover from 'worst ever' oil spill | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10819987 | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 30 July 2010 | accessdate = 31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cleanup effort largely used low-tech methods, including containment booms and straw mats to absorb the oil, as well as a fleet of fishermen manually scooping oil out of the water and transferring it to barrels for storage and eventual disposal. Additionally, limited amounts of chemical dispersants were used, as well as a material to increase biodegradation of oil.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;

== Reaction ==
After the incident the Chinese government announced that safety standards would be tightened up at ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/23/c_13411979.htm|title=China orders ports to enhance safety after Dalian pipeline accident|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=23 July 2010|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The oil spill affected several aspects of the area's economy. [[Tourism]] was affected after oil began washing ashore on beaches, some of which were closed after the spill; according to Greenpeace, additional oil washing ashore was a possibility that remained for the rest of the summer.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;  The oil  severely affected fishing industry near Dalian, especially offshore [[shellfish]] farms, many of which were contaminated by the oil, either killing the fish or rendering them unfit for consumption. The economic loss was estimated to be as high as tens of million [[US dollar]]s.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;  Environmental damage was also serious as a result of the spill; the majority of wildlife inhabiting the area was exposed to oil, which led to the deaths of some, while others were expected to display longer-term effects.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;

[[Lu Guang (photographer)|Lu Guang's]] pictures of the oil spill and the subsequent funeral of firefighter Zhang Liang were awarded a third prize in the category "Spot News" in the 2011 World Press Photo contest.&lt;ref&gt;Jess Miller: "[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/dalian-oil-spill-photographer-receives-award-/blog/34625/ Dalian oil spill photographer receives award at World Press Photo]," Greenpeace News, 8 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Press Photo: [http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2011 2011 Photo Contest].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Press Photo: [http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2011/spot-news/lu-guang Lu Guang - 2011 Photo Contest].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zirconium dioxide''' ({{chem|ZrO|2}}), sometimes known as '''zirconia''' (not to be confused with [[zircon]]), is a white crystalline [[oxide]] of [[zirconium]]. Its most naturally occurring form, with a [[monoclinic]] crystalline structure, is the [[mineral]] [[baddeleyite]]. A dopant stabilized cubic structured zirconia, [[cubic zirconia]], is synthesized in various colours for use as a [[gemstone]] and a [[diamond simulant]].

==Production, chemical properties, occurrence==
Zirconia is produced by [[calcination|calcining]] zirconium compounds, exploiting its high [[thermal stability]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Ralph Nielsen "Zirconium and Zirconium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
Three phases are known: monoclinic below 1170&amp;#8239;°C, tetragonal between 1170&amp;#8239;°C and 2370&amp;#8239;°C, and cubic above 2370&amp;#8239;°C.&lt;ref&gt;R. Stevens, 1986. Introduction to Zirconia. Magnesium Elektron Publication No 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend is for higher symmetry at higher temperatures, as is usually the case. A small percentage of the oxides of calcium or yttrium stabilize in the cubic phase.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;  The very rare mineral tazheranite (Zr,Ti,Ca)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]].  Unlike TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which features six-coordinate Ti in all phases, monoclinic zirconia consists of seven-coordinate zirconium centres.  This difference is attributed to the larger size of Zr atom relative to the Ti atom.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical reactions===
Zirconia is chemically unreactive.  It is slowly attacked by concentrated [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]].  When heated with carbon, it converts to [[zirconium carbide]].  When heated with carbon in the presence of chlorine, it converts to [[zirconium tetrachloride]].  This conversion is the basis for the purification of zirconium metal and is analogous to the [[Kroll process]].

==Engineering properties &lt;!--linked from 'Yttria-stabilized zirconia'--&gt;==
Zirconium dioxide is one of the most studied [[ceramic]] materials. ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adopts a [[monoclinic]] [[crystal structure]] at room temperature and transitions to [[tetragonal]] and [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] at higher temperatures. The change of volume caused by the structure transitions from tetragonal to monoclinic to cubic induces large stresses, causing it to crack upon cooling from high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Platt |first1=P. |last2=Frankel |first2=P. |last3=Gass |first3=M. |last4=Howells |first4=R. |last5=Preuss |first5=M. |title=Finite element analysis of the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation during oxidation of zirconium alloys |journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials |date=November 2014 |volume=454 |issue=1-3 |pages=290–297 |doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.08.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the zirconia is [[Doping (semiconductor)|blended with]] some other oxides, the tetragonal and/or cubic phases are stabilized.  Effective dopants include [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO), [[yttrium oxide]] (Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, yttria), [[calcium oxide]] (CaO), and [[cerium(III) oxide]] (Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite journal|author=Evans, A.G., Cannon, R.M.|title=Toughening of brittle solids by martensitic transformations|journal=Acta Metall.|volume=34|page=761|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0001-6160(86)90052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zirconia is often more useful in its phase 'stabilized' state. Upon heating, zirconia undergoes disruptive phase changes. By adding small percentages of yttria, these phase changes are eliminated, and the resulting material has superior thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. In some cases, the tetragonal phase can be [[metastable]]. If sufficient quantities of the metastable tetragonal phase is present, then an applied stress, magnified by the [[stress concentration]] at a crack tip, can cause the tetragonal phase to convert to monoclinic, with the associated volume expansion. This phase transformation can then put the crack into compression, retarding its growth, and enhancing the [[fracture toughness]]. This mechanism is known as transformation toughening, and significantly extends the reliability and lifetime of products made with stabilized zirconia.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Porter, D.L., Evans, A.G., Heuer, A.H.|title=Transformation toughening in PSZ|journal=Acta Metall.|volume=27|page=1649|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0001-6160(79)90046-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[band gap]] is dependent on the phase (cubic, tetragonal, monoclinic, or amorphous) and preparation methods, with typical estimates from 5–7&amp;#8239;eV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jane P. |last=Chang |author2=You-Sheng Lin |author3=Karen Chu  |title=Rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition of zirconium oxide for metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor application |journal=[[Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B]] |volume=19|issue=5… |pages=1782–1787 |year=2001| doi = 10.1116/1.1396639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special case of zirconia is that of [[Tetragonal polycrystalline zirconia|tetragonal zirconia polycrystal]], or TZP, which is indicative of polycrystalline zirconia composed of only the metastable tetragonal phase.

The main use of zirconia is in the production of hard ceramics, such as in dentistry (see below),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/zirconium/|title=USGS Minerals Information: Zirconium and Hafnium|first=Joseph|last=Gambogi|date=|website=minerals.usgs.gov|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218030521/https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/zirconium/|archivedate=18 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other uses including as a protective coating on particles of [[titanium dioxide]] pigments,&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;  as a [[refractory]] material, in [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], [[abrasive]]s and [[vitreous enamel|enamels]]. Stabilized zirconia is used in [[oxygen sensor]]s and [[fuel cell]] membranes because it has the ability to allow [[oxygen]] [[ion]]s to move freely through the crystal structure at high temperatures. This high [[ionic conductivity]] (and a low electronic conductivity) makes it one of the most useful [[electroceramics]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt; Zirconium dioxide is also used as the [[solid electrolyte]] in [[electrochromic devices]].

Zirconia is a precursor to the electroceramic [[lead zirconate titanate]] (''PZT''), which is a high-K dielectric, which is found in myriad components.

===Niche uses===
The very low [[thermal conductivity]] of [[cubic zirconia|cubic phase of zirconia]] also has led to its use as a [[thermal barrier coating]], or TBC, in [[Jet engine|jet]] and [[diesel engine]]s to allow operation at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://studylib.net/doc/12141427/thermal-barrier-coatings-for-more-efficient-gas-turbine-e...#|title=Thermal-barrier coatings for more efficient gas-turbine engines|website=studylib.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thermodynamically, the higher the operation temperature of an engine, [[Carnot heat engine|the greater the possible efficiency]]. Another low thermal conductivity use is a ceramic fiber insulation for crystal growth furnaces, fuel cell stack insulation and infrared heating systems.

This material is also used in dentistry in the manufacture of 1) subframes for the construction of [[dental restoration]]s such as [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]] and [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridges]], which are then veneered with a conventional [[Feldspar|feldspathic]] [[porcelain]] for aesthetic reasons, or of 2) strong, extremely durable dental prostheses constructed entirely from monolithic zirconia, with limited but constantly improving aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Panos |last=Papaspyridakos |author2=Kunal Lal  |title=Complete arch implant rehabilitation using subtractive rapid prototyping and porcelain fused to zirconia prosthesis: A clinical report |journal=The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry |volume=100 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=165–172 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3913(08)00110-8 |pmid=18762028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zirconia stabilized with [[yttria]] (yttrium oxide), known as [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]], can be used as a strong base material in some full ceramic crown restorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shen|first1=edited by James|title=Advanced ceramics for dentistry|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/BH|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0123946195|page=271|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transformation toughened zirconia is used to make ceramic knives. Because of the hardness, ceramic-edged cutlery stays sharp longer than steel edged products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/kyocera-advantage-1|title=Best Ceramic Knives, Cutlery, &amp; Kitchenware - Kyocera Knives|author=|date=|website=kyoceraadvancedceramics.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221085217/http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/kyocera-advantage-1|archivedate=21 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its infusibility and brilliant luminosity when [[Incandescence|incandescent]], it was used as an ingredient of sticks for [[limelight]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Zirconia has been proposed to [[electrolysis|electrolyze]] [[carbon monoxide]] and oxygen from the [[atmosphere of Mars]] to provide both fuel and oxidizer that could be used as a store of chemical energy for use with surface transportation on Mars.  [[Carbon monoxide/oxygen engine]]s  have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced by zirconia electrolysis without requiring use of any of the Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed for the production of methane or any hydrogen-based fuels.&lt;ref name=landis2001&gt;

Zirconia is also a potential [[high-k dielectric]] material with potential applications as an insulator in [[transistor]]s.

Zirconia is also employed in the deposition of [[optical coating]]s; it is a high-index material usable from the [[Near UV#Subtypes|near-UV]] to the [[Mid-infrared#CIE division scheme|mid-IR]], due to its low absorption in this spectral region. In such applications, it is typically deposited by [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://materion.com/ResourceCenter/ProductData/InorganicChemicals/Oxides/BrochuresAndDataSheets/ZirconiumOxideZr02.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020212333/http://materion.com/ResourceCenter/ProductData/InorganicChemicals/Oxides/BrochuresAndDataSheets/ZirconiumOxideZr02.aspx |archivedate=October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In jewelry making, some watch cases are advertised as being "black zirconium oxide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/speedmaster/moonwatch/omega-co-axial-chronograph/31192445101003/|title=Omega Co-Axial Chronograph 44.25 mm|website=OMEGA Watches|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326103447/http://www.omegawatches.com/watches/speedmaster/moonwatch/omega-co-axial-chronograph/31192445101003/|archivedate=2016-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Omega released a fully ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; watch named "The Dark Side of The Moon" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/speedmaster/moonwatch/dark-side-of-the-moon/product/|title=Speedmaster Moonwatch Dark Side Of The Moon  {{!}} OMEGA®|website=Omega|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063908/https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/speedmaster/moonwatch/dark-side-of-the-moon/product/|archivedate=2018-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ceramic case, bezel, pushers and clasp, advertising it as four times harder than stainless steel and therefore much more resistant to scratches during everyday use.

===Diamond simulant===
{{main|Cubic zirconia}}
[[File:CZ brilliant.jpg|thumb|Brilliant-cut cubic zirconia]]

Single crystals of the cubic phase of zirconia are commonly used as [[diamond simulant]] in [[jewellery]]. Like diamond, cubic zirconia has a cubic crystal structure and a high [[index of refraction]]. Visually discerning a good quality cubic zirconia gem from a diamond is difficult, and most jewellers will have a thermal conductivity tester to identify cubic zirconia by its low [[thermal conductivity]] (diamond is a very good thermal conductor). This state of zirconia is commonly called ''cubic zirconia'', ''CZ'', or ''zircon'' by [[Jewellery|jewellers]], but the last name is not chemically accurate. [[Zircon]] is actually the mineral name for naturally occurring [[zirconium silicate]] (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
