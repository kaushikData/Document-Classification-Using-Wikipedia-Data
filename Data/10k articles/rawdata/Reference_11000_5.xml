{{Cuban Revolution}}
The '''26th of July Movement''' ({{lang-es|Movimiento 26 de Julio}}; '''M-26-7''') was a [[Vanguard party|vanguard]] revolutionary organization then a party led by [[Fidel Castro]] that in 1959 overthrew the [[Fulgencio Batista]] [[dictatorship]] in [[Cuba]]. The Movement fought the Batista regime on both rural and urban fronts. The movement’s main objectives were distribution of land to peasants, nationalization of public services, industrialization, honest elections, and large scale education reform.

==Origins==
The 26th&amp;nbsp;of July Movement's name originated from the failed attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]], an army facility in the city of [[Santiago de Cuba]], on 26 July 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, Miguel A. "Fidel Castro and the 26th of July Movement,"  27 July 2004.  http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/7/27/110928.shtml Saved page https://web.archive.org/web/20081011015901/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/7/27/110928.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; This attack was led by a young Fidel Castro, who was a legislative candidate in a free election that had been cancelled by Batista.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cuba/The-Republic-of-Cuba#ref515701|title=Cuba – The Republic of Cuba {{!}} history – geography|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack had been intended as a rallying cry for the revolution. Castro was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison but, along with his group, was granted an amnesty after two years following a political campaign on their behalf. Castro travelled to Mexico to reorganize the movement in 1955 with several other exiled revolutionaries (including [[Raúl Castro]], [[Camilo Cienfuegos]], and [[Juan Almeida Bosque]]).  Their task was to form a disciplined [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force to overthrow [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]].

==Role in the Cuban Revolution==
On 2 December 1956, 82 men landed in [[Cuba]], having sailed in the boat ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' from [[Tuxpan]], [[Veracruz]], ready to organize and lead a revolution. The early signs were not good for the movement. They landed in daylight, were attacked by the [[Cuban Air Force]], and suffered numerous casualties. The landing party was split into two and wandered lost for two days, most of their supplies abandoned where they landed. They were also betrayed by their peasant guide in an ambush, which killed more of those who had landed. Batista mistakenly announced Fidel Castro's death at this point. Of the 82 who sailed aboard the ''Granma,'' only 12 eventually regrouped in the [[Sierra Maestra]] [[mountain range]]. While the revolutionaries were setting up camp in the mountains, "Civic Resistance" groups were formulating in the cities, putting pressure on the Batista regime. Many middle-class and professional persons flocked toward Castro and his movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/26th-of-July-Movement|title=26th of July Movement {{!}} Cuban history|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the Sierra Maestra mountains the guerrilla forces attracted hundreds of Cuban volunteers and won several battles against the Cuban Army. [[Ernesto 'Che' Guevara]] was shot in the neck and chest during the fighting, but was not severely injured. (Guevara, who had studied medicine, continued to give [[first aid]] to other wounded guerrillas.) This was the opening phase of the war of the [[Cuban Revolution]], which continued for the next two years.  It ended in January 1959, after Batista fled Cuba for [[Dominican Republic]], on New Year's Eve when the Movement's forces marched into [[Havana]].

==Post-1959==
After the takeover, anti-Batistas, liberals, urban workers, peasants, and idealists became the dominant followers of the M-26-7 movement, which gained control over Cuba. The Movement was joined with other bodies to form the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution, which in turn became the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] in 1965. Cuba modeled itself after the soviet-bloc countries of eastern Europe, becoming the first socialistic government in the Americas. Once it was learned that Cuba would adopt a strict Marxist–Leninist political and economic system, opposition was raised not only by dissident party members, but by the United States as well.&lt;ref&gt;DeFronzo, James. ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Movements''. (University of Connecticut. 2007) pp. 207–08&lt;/ref&gt; Fidel Castro's government seized private land, nationalized hundreds of private companies—including several local subsidiaries of U.S. corporations—and taxed American products so heavily that U.S. exports were cut half in just two years. The Eisenhower Administration then imposed trade restrictions on everything except food and medical supplies. As a result, Cuba turned to the Soviet Union for trade instead. The US responded by cutting all diplomatic ties to Cuba, and have had a rocky relationship ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1891359,00.html|title=U.S.-Cuba Relations|last=Suddath|first=Claire|date=2009-04-15|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1961, a CIA-trained force of [[Cuban exiles]] and dissidents launched the unsuccessful [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] against Cuba.

The flag of the 26th&amp;nbsp;of July Movement is on the shoulder of the [[Cuban military]] uniform, and continues to be used as a symbol of the [[Cuban revolution]].

'''''Apostoliese Geloofsending van Suid-Afrika (Maitland Gemeente) v Capes'''''&lt;ref&gt;1978 (4) SA 48 (C).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]], especially in respect of the application of [[estoppel]], in its limitation of the ''[[rei vindicatio]]'', to [[immovable property]]. It was heard in the Cape Provincial Division by Friedman R from 1 November 1977, to 10 February 1978, with judgment handed down on 12 May.

The case involved a boundary dispute. Apostoliese Geloofsending van Suid-Afrika (AGS), the owner of two lots, had built a wall between them, but not exactly on the boundary. It later sold one lot to "J," who in turn transferred it to Capes, the defendant. AGS then sought an order to demolish the wall, so as to make use of all the property, but Capes opposed the action, claiming estoppel. The court allowed the plea of estoppel to succeed, holding that it may be applied to claims involving immovable property.

The '''''Anarchist Encyclopedia''''' was an [[encyclopedia]] initiated by the French [[anarchist]] activist [[Sebastien Faure]], between 1925 and 1934, published in four volumes.

The original project was to be in five parts:

#an anarchist dictionary
#a history of anarchist thought and action
# biographies of militants and thinkers
# biographies of individuals having contributed by their works to human emancipation
# a catalogue of anarchist books and reviews

Only the first part in four volumes of 2,893 pages was made. It included many anarchist tendencies. There were several hundred collaborators including, in addition to Sebastien Faure himself, [[Luigi Bertoni]], Pierre Besnard, [[Emile Armand]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Augustin Souchy]], [[Max Nettlau]], [[Voline]], [[Aristide Lapeyre]], [[Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers]], and others.

'''Azerbaijan State Theatre Museum''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dövlət Teatr Muzeyi}}) named after [[Jafar Jabbarli]] reflects the professional theatre history of Azerbaijan.
In 1934, the issue of establishing such a museum was raised at the Republican conference by theater workers. The museum was organized in the same year in the building of the Azerbaijan State Drama Theater. In fact, this exhibition was the foundation of a future museum. According to eyewitnesses, [[Jalil Mammadguluzadeh]] and [[Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev]], the great writers who cut the opening ribbon of the exhibition, said: "Long live the [[Theatre in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani theater]]!"

The exhibition is soon officially formalized as a Theater Department of the Azerbaijan State Museum. Finally, on the basis of the relevant department of the Azerbaijan State Museum in 1934, Azerbaijan State Theater Museum was established and Aghakarim Sharifov was appointed the director of the museum.

On 25 November 1934, the solemn opening ceremony of the museum was held. Famous art figures such as [[Bulbul (singer)|Bulbul]], [[Shovkat Mammadova]], [[Huseyngulu Sarabski]], Alexander Tuganov, [[Ulvi Rajab]], Ismayil Hidayatzade and others attend the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icom.azeurotel.com/en/theatre02en.html Azerbaijan State Theatre Museum named after Jafar Jabbarli]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the museum was named after [[Jafar Jabbarli]], the great Azerbaijani playwright.

In 1963, the Azerbaijan State Theatre Museum was annulled and became the Theater and Drama Department of the [[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature|Azerbaijan Literature Museum named after Nizami]].

In 1968, the Government of the Republic made a decision on the organization of the Azerbaijan State Theater Museum named after J. Jabbarli on the basis of this department. The rooms on the 4th floor of the building of the Azerbaijan Literature Museum named after Nizami are given to the newly created museum. In these rooms, it was possible to place only the museum stock and employees. The most remarkable transformation in the history of the Azerbaijan State Theater Museum took place in 1991. After Baku branch of the central [[Vladimir Lenin|V.I.lenin]] Museum was given to [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture of Azerbaijan]], the "Museum Center" was created here, along with the State Museum of Carpet and Applied Art and the Museum of Independence of Azerbaijan, the State Theater Museum placed in this building. The Museum Center is located on the seaside Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumcenter.az/index/lang,en/ museumcenter.az]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerbaijan24.com/about/azerbaijan_cities/baku/museums_in_baku/ museums in Baku]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Billy Robinson''' (September 18, 1938 – March 3, 2014)&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[professional wrestler]], [[author]] and [[catch wrestling]] instructor. Robinson was well known in [[Japan]] where he trained [[mixed martial arts]] fighters in catch wrestling. Robinson was one of the few wrestlers who was successful in several continents ([[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]]), winning titles in promotions nearly everywhere he wrestled.

==Career==

===Early days in Europe===
Robinson began his amateur wrestling career in [[UK|Britain]]. He was the British National Wrestling Champion in 1957, and in 1958 he was the European Open Wrestling Champion in the light heavyweight class, beating an Olympic bronze medal winner in the finals. Billy Robinson also attended the fabled "Snake Pit" started by legendary trainer [[Billy Riley]]. The Snake Pit was one of the most respected catch wrestling training schools in all of the world. Legends such as [[Karl Gotch]] had trained in catch wrestling in the Snake Pit with Riley. Robinson had to survive bare minimum amenities (luxuries such as a toilet were not provided at the Snake Pit), a very rough training environment (Riley was very impatient with those who showed even the slightest bit of weakness on the mat) and rigorous conditioning. Robinson stayed at the Snake Pit for eight years.

As a professional wrestler, Robinson was an undefeated double-crown British and European Heavyweight Champion for [[Joint Promotions]]. He defeated older fellow Snake Pit wrestler Billy Joyce for the European title on 12 June 1965&lt;ref name=eurohwt&gt;http://www.wrestling-titles.com/europe/uk/joint/joint-eu-h.html&lt;/ref&gt; and then beat Joyce again for [[British Heavyweight Championship|the British title]] on 18 January 1967,&lt;ref name=brihwt&gt;http://www.wrestling-titles.com/europe/uk/bri-h.html&lt;/ref&gt; vacating both titles in 1970 when he went off to America.&lt;ref name=brihwt /&gt;&lt;ref name=eurohwt /&gt; He also had a high-profile feud with legendary masked wrestler [[Peter Thornley|Kendo Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestlingheritage.co.uk/simplythebest.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Robinson made a brief homecoming tour of the UK including a televised win over Lee Bronson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnlisterwriting.com/itvwrestling/78.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===In North America===
Robinson traveled to [[North America]] in 1970 and began wrestling for [[Verne Gagne]]'s [[American Wrestling Association]]. He was one of the successful wrestlers of the American promotion known for hiring the "Real Deals" in wrestling. Billy Robinson was also the AWA British Empire Heavyweight Champion; he defended the title in both the United States and Canada, winning on 3 separate occasions. 12 October 1974 Robinson's image as a legitimate wrestler landed him a role in the film ''[[The Wrestler (1974 film)|The Wrestler]]'' alongside Verne Gagne and [[Ed Asner]]. He wrestled in [[Montreal]] in 1982 and 1983 becoming the International Champion beating [[Dino Bravo]] and was also International Tag Team champions with Pierre Mad Dog Lefebvre. He wrestled to a 60-minutes time-limit draw against then [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWWF Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]] in 1982 as well in Montreal.

===Japan===
Robinson travelled to [[Japan]] where he became immensely popular as a legitimate wrestler versed in submission holds. He participated in a professional wrestling match against legendary [[Antonio Inoki]] in 1975. The match was billed as "The Match Between the World's Top Two Technicians" by the Japanese press. Robinson continued an active professional wrestling career, travelling throughout the world to participate in various events. Japanese professional wrestlers learned the art of "hooking" and "shooting" from another of catch wrestling's greatest icons, Karl Gotch. The new movement led to the formation of the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|Universal Wrestling Federation]]. The UWF had wrestlers like [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]] who had also been to the Snake Pit in Wigan. Robinson became a part of the [[shoot style]] movement when he wrestled in an exhibition match for the [[Union of Wrestling Forces International|UWFi]] against fellow AWA legend [[Nick Bockwinkel]] on May 8, 1992.

===Post-retirement===
Robinson, having previously trained wrestlers in England including [[Marty Jones]] and [[Johnny Saint]], began training wrestlers in catch wrestling at the UWF Snake Pit in Japan, including [[James Maritato]], [[Kazushi Sakuraba]] and [[El Signo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=1648 Billy Robinson's profile, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was inducted into the International Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Death==
Robinson died on March 3, 2014, at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10814166/Billy-Robinson-obituary.html|title=Billy Robinson - obituary|accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=83996&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Casón del Buen Retiro''' is an annex of the [[Museo del Prado]] complex in [[Madrid]]. Following major restoration work, which was completed in October 2007,&lt;ref name=lib&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/la-institucion/the-extension/el-cason-del-buen-retiro/el-cason-del-buen-retiro/ Library and study centre] [[Museo del Prado]].

[[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' canvas, and the sketches associated with its creation, were on display at the Casón from 1981, when it was delivered to Spain from New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), to 1992, when it was moved to its current permanent location in a purpose-built gallery at the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]].&lt;ref name=pais&gt;{{es icon}} [http://elpais.com/diario/1982/09/10/cultura/400456802_850215.html "Un millón de personas ha visto el 'Guernica' en el Casón del Buen Retiro"] ''[[El País]]''. Retrieved 25 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Casón del Buen Retiro was originally built as the ballroom, the ''Salón de Baile'', of the [[Buen Retiro Palace]], of which now only two buildings, the Casón and the [[Salón de Reinos]] still remain.  The Casón is located in front of the Puerta de Felipe IV entrance on the west side of [[Retiro Park]].

The artistic importance of [[Luca Giordano]]'s ''The Allegory of the Golden Fleece'', a ca.1697 [[fresco]] on the ceiling of the Casón commissioned by King [[Charles II of Spain]], is one of the possible reasons given for the building having survived when most of the other Bueno Retiro palace complex buildings were demolished in the 19th century.

From 1877 to 1960 the Casón was used as the ''Museo de Reproducciones Artísticas'', set up by the then President of the Government, [[Antonio Canovas del Castillo]], until it was moved to the ''[[Museo de América]]''. The building was then used as a temporary exhibition space until 1971. From 1971 to 1981 it was used by the Museo del Prado for the 19th-century collections paintings and sculptures which had formerly been in the ''[[Museo de Arte Moderno (Madrid)|Museo de Arte Moderno]]''. From 1981 to 1992 the Casón housed Picasso’s ''Guernica'' painting, now in the ''[[Museo Reina Sofía]]''.&lt;ref name=pais/&gt;

==Library==
The library of the Museo del Prado, on the ground floor of the Casón building, consists of the Reading Room for the use of researchers, the museum's technical staff and students of the Escuela del Prado, and the book stores located in the basements. It comprises some 70,000 books, including those acquired from two private collections, those of José María Cervelló and of the Daza-Madrazo family, the latter mostly books belonging to the painter [[José de Madrazo]], director of the Museo del Prado from 1838 to 1851.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

==Escuela del Prado==
The Escuela del Prado is a school of the Museo del Prado housed in the Casón building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/la-institucion/the-extension/chronology-of-the-extension/ Museo del Prado: "Chronology of the extension"] . accessed 25 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration work===
From 1997 to 2007,&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; the Casón building was closed for remodelling and enlargement.&lt;ref name=his&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/la-institucion/the-extension/el-cason-del-buen-retiro/historia/ The Casón del Buen Retiro: History] [[Museo del Prado]].

[[Image:CodexRunicus Dream.jpg|thumb|right|The last leaf (f. 100r) of the Codex Runicus manuscript with the oldest musical notation found in Scandinavia.]]
The '''Codex Runicus''' is a [[codex]] of 202 pages written in [[medieval runes]] around the year 1300 which includes the oldest preserved Nordic provincial law, [[Scanian Law]] (''Skånske lov'') pertaining to the [[Lands of Denmark|Danish land]] Scania ([[Skåneland]]). Codex Runicus is one of the few runic texts found on [[parchment]]. The manuscript's initials are painted various colors and the [[rubric]]s are red. Each rune corresponds to a letter of the [[Latin alphabet]].

==Runic manuscripts==
The Codex Runicus is considered by most scholars a nostalgic or revivalist use of runes and not a natural step from the Nordic runic script culture of the [[Viking Age]] to the medieval Latin manuscript culture.&lt;ref name="Fredriksen"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Frederiksen |first=Britta Olrik |authorlink= |editor-last=Bandle |editor-first=Oskar |contribution=The History of Old Nordic manuscripts IV: Old Danish |title=The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages |publisher=Walter De Gruyter |year=2003 |location=Berlin |pages=819–823 |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqkBXIJkkuEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn =3-11-014876-5|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar use of runes in a [[Scandinavia]]n manuscript from this era is known only from the small fragment ''SKB A 120'', a religious text about [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]'s lament at the cross. The two manuscripts are similar in how the runes are formed and also in their language use, and it has therefore been suggested that it they were both written by the same [[Scanian dialects|Scanian]] scribe. Some scholars argue that they were written at the scriptorium at the [[Cistercian]] monastery at [[Herrevad Abbey|Herrevad]] in Scania, although the idea is contested.&lt;ref&gt;Frederiksen, Britta Olrik (2003). "The History of Old Nordic manuscripts IV: Old Danish", p. 821: "Something of a similar kind is known only in the small fragment SKB A 120, and given that it stands close to AM 28 8vo in terms of the form of the runes and the language (Scanian), it has been suggested that it the two manuscripts come from the same scriptorium; it has been further suggested, on rather meager grounds, that this scriptorium may have been at the Cistercian monastery at Herrevad in Scania."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have considered it feasible that the Codex is a part and remainder of a formerly substantial collection of Scandinavian runic manuscripts, obliterated during the destruction of monasteries and libraries that followed the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Support for this idea has been found in reports written by [[Olaus Magnus]], a Catholic [[ecclesiastic]] active during the 16th century in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], who fled the country due to the Reformation. According to Olaus Magnus, there were many books written with runes in important Swedish religious centres, such as [[Skara]] and [[Uppsala]], before the Reformation.&lt;ref name="Enoksen"&gt;Enoksen, Lars Magnar. (1998). ''Runor : historia, tydning, tolkning''. Historiska Media, Falun. {{ISBN|91-88930-32-7}} p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have questioned the accuracy of his report.&lt;ref name="Enoksen"/&gt;

==Content of the Codex==
[[Image:Codex-Runicus.png|thumb|right|The sample page of the Codex written with Latin letters, for the reader's convenience]] 

The manuscript has three major parts: the Scanian Law (fol. 1-82), the [[Scanian Ecclesiastical Law]] (fol. 84–91), a chronicle of the early [[list of Danish monarchs|Danish monarchs]] (fol. 92-97) and a description of the Danish-Swedish border (fol. 97-100). The Scanian Ecclesiastical Law (''Skånske Kirkelov'') is a settlement detailing the administration of justice agreed upon by the [[Terra Scania|Scanians]] and the [[List of bishops of Lund|archbishop of Lund]] in the late 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Society for Danish Language and Literature]]. [http://smn.dsl.dk/index.php?teksterid=20&amp;side=sider&amp;litteraturbeskrivelse=true&amp;haandskriftid=-1&amp;trykid=-1&amp;tekstid=-1 Kulturhistorisk baggrund] (Cultural historic background). In Danish. Retrieved 20 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The two law texts are written in the same hand, but the non-legal material of the codex, beginning on leaf 92, is believed to have been added in another hand, at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/kk28.html Kr. Kålund, Katalog, II, p. 344] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991003125530/http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/kk28.html |date=1999-10-03 }}. The Arnamagnæan Institute, Faculty of Humanities, University of Copenhagen. Retrieved May 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The history section consists of a fragment of a list of Danish kings and a [[chronicle]] beginning with the legendary Danish king [[Hadingus|Hadding]]'s son [[Frotho I|Frode]] and ending with [[Eric VI of Denmark]]. Following the historical texts is a description of the oldest border between [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] (referred to as "the [[Daneholm]] settlement"). On the last leaf of Codex Runicus is a verse with musical notations - the first musical notations written in Scandinavia. It is the earliest written evidence of secular music in Denmark, a non-rhythmic notation on a four-line staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=374,477981&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL The Earliest Evidences of Musical Activities].

==Transliteration==
[[Image:CodRunFuthark.jpg|thumb|The runic alphabet utilized on f. 27r and f.100r. (Medieval Runes used for c and y are added.)]][[Image:CodRun1.jpg|thumb|Transliteration of f.27 r from the first rubric.]] 
Like other Scandinavian manifestations of Medieval runes, the runic alphabet of the Codex Runicus contains a sign for each [[phoneme]] of the language. A dotted variant had been introduced in order to separate voiceless k from the corresponding voiced consonant g. New runes introduced for the vowel sounds also appear in the codex. 

The text on leaf 27r, from the first rubric (line 3), reads:

:''Særær man annær man mæþæn kunung ær innæn lændæs bøtæ fore sar sum loh æræ :ok kunungi firitiuhu mark ok hinum ær sar fik firitiuhu mark fore friþbrut."
: (If a man wounds another man while the king is in the province he shall pay a fine for the wound in accordance with the law, and 40 marks to the king and 40 marks for breach of the peace to the one who was wounded.)&lt;ref name="am28" /&gt;

The verse with the musical notations is the first two lines of the folk song ''[[Drømde mig en drøm i nat]]'' (I dreamt a dream last night), about a girl who dreams of becoming a rich woman. The melody is one that is well known to all Danes, having been used as an [[interval signal]] on [[Danmarks Radio|Danish radio]] since 1931. 

The section with the verse and musical notations are on the last leaf and reads:
  
:''Drømde mik en drøm i nat'' (I dreamt a dream last night),
:''um silki ok ærlik pæl'' (of silk and fine fur / of justice and fair play).&lt;ref&gt;See the article [[Drømde mig en drøm i nat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex Runicus has the shelfmark ''AM 28 8vo'' and is part of the [[Arnamagnæan Collection]] in the [[Arnamagnæan Institute]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name="am28"&gt;[http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/am28.html AM 28 8vo – Codex runicus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991002053657/http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/am28.html |date=1999-10-02 }}. Scanned version of Codex Runicus. The Arnamagnæan Institute, a teaching and research institute within the Faculty of Humanities at the [[University of Copenhagen]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Det Arnamagnæanske Haandskrift No 28, 8vo: Codex Runicus''. Kommissionen for det Arnamagnæanske Legat, København: 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--- I have moved the entire section about other manuscripts containing the Scanian Law to the article [[Scanian Law]] instead, since it is more general information.---&gt;

=== Terminology ===
In the table above, the following terminology is intended to be used to describe some important features:
*'''Listening mode''': where a server connects to a viewer. The server site does not have to configure its firewall/NAT to allow access on port 5900 (or 5800); the onus is on the viewer, which is useful if the server site has no computer expertise, while the viewer user would be expected to be more knowledgeable.
*'''Built-in Encryption''': the software has at least one method of [[encryption|encrypting]] the data between the local and remote computers, and the encryption mechanism is built into the remote control software.
*'''File Transfer''': the software allows the user to transfer files between the local and remote computers, from within the client software's user interface.
* '''Audio Support''': the remote control software transfers audio signals across the network and plays the audio through the speakers attached to the local computer. For example, music playback software normally sends audio signals to the locally attached speakers, via some sound controller hardware. If the remote control software package supports audio transfer, the playback software can run on the remote computer, while the music can be heard from the local computer, as though the software were running locally.
* '''Multiple sessions''': the ability to connect to a server in many users, and each one see his different desktop
*'''Seamless Window''': the software allows an application to be run on the server, and just the application window to be shown on the clients desktop.  Normally the remote [[user interface chrome]] is also removed, giving the impression that the application is running on the client machines.
*'''Remote Assistance''': remote and local users are able to view the same screen at the same time, so remote user can assist a local user.
*'''Access Permission Request''': local user should approve a remote access session start.
*'''NAT Passthrough''': the ability to connect to the server behind a NAT without configuring the router's port forwarding rules. It offers an advantage when you can't reconfigure the router/firewall (for example in case it is on the Internet service provider's side), but is a serious security risk (unless the traffic is end-to-end encrypted), because all the traffic will pass through some proxy server which in most cases is owned by the remote access application's developers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* '''Maximum simultaneous connections''': number of clients connected to the same session
*'''Screen blanking''': the ability to prevent the user of the host/server from viewing what is currently being displayed on the screen while a remote user is connected.

[[File:Cronaca Fiorentina.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''Cronaca fiorentina di Marchionne di Coppo Stefani''&lt;br /&gt; Title page of [[Niccolò Rodolico|Rodolico]]'s edition of 1903&lt;ref name="scriptores2"&gt;[[Niccolò Rodolico]], ed., ''[https://archive.org/details/rerumitalicarums301murauoft Marchionne di Coppo Stefani, Cronaca fiorentina]'', Citta di Castello, S. Lapi, 1903–1955 (Rerum italicarum scriptores, vol. XXX, part I)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Cronaca fiorentina di Marchionne di Coppo Stefani''''' ({{Lang-en|Florentine Chronicle of Marchionne di Coppo Stefani}}) written by [[Baldassarre Bonaiuti]] is considered today as one of the best works written on the [[Black Death]] in [[Florence]] in the year 1348. It is the only known literary work by Bonaiuti.&lt;ref name="Sestan"&gt;Ernesto Sestan, 'Bonaiuti Baldassarre, detto Marchionne' in ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'', vol. XV (Rome, Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana, 1972), pp. 105-112; [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/buonaiuti-baldassarre-detto-marchionne_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ online version] online at treccani.it, accessed 31 July 2011 ([[Italian language|Italian]])&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in [[vulgar Latin]]. There is no information as to when he may have started his work, but he devoted much time on it in his retirement from about 1378 until his death, a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Sestan points out that if Bonaiuti died in August 1385, as Panella affirms, rubrics 994–96 of the Cronaca which cover events in 1386 must be the work of another hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Cronaca fiorentina'' is not only a detailed history of the [[Black Death]] in Florence, but also a history of Florentine political groups and the political ambitions of individuals.&lt;ref name="scriptores2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FlorenceBio"&gt;'[http://www.dssg.unifi.it/SDF/dizionario/Stefani.htm Marchionne di Coppo Stefani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929205659/http://www.dssg.unifi.it/SDF/dizionario/Stefani.htm |date=2011-09-29 }}' in ''Storia di Firenze'' at dssg.unifi.it, accessed 31 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Bonaiuti stresses the economic disruption in Florence during the fourteenth century which was the result of the [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/perspectives/marchionne.php Florentine Chronicle of Marchionne di Coppo di Stefano Buonaiuti (1327-1385)] at brown.edu, accessed 31 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle is a didactic work as well as a detailed historical record of Florence up to 1386.&lt;ref name="Sestan"/&gt;

==Editions==
The first edition of the chronicle was by [[Ildefonso di San Luigi]] (1724–1792), who had available to him four [[codex|codices]] of the work. [[Niccolò Rodolico]], in preparing a new edition, was able to refer to a further seven codices, the earliest of which dated from about twenty-five years after Bonaiuti's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Atti del Congresso internazionale di scienze storiche'' (Rome, Tipografia della R. Accademia dei Lincei, 1906), Volumes 3–4, [https://archive.org/stream/attidelcongress06romgoog#page/n53/mode/2up p. xlix]&lt;/ref&gt; Rodolico's edition was published in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Rodolico, ed., ''Cronaca fiorentina di Marchionne di Coppo Stefani'' (Citta di Castello, S. Lapi, 1903)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
On the first page of his Chronicle Bonaiuti declares, of his chosen language and his research: {{cquote| ''Whereas those who want to read will see an orderly and systematic history of the past, if they delight in that, so the future can take example from the past, and so that the layman as well as the lettered can take of the fruit of my labors, I write in [[vulgar Latin]]&amp;nbsp;... I put time and care into finding books and other writings&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref name="Sestan"/&gt;}}

The Chronicle gives some of the history of the Bonaiuti family, placing the writer's ancestors at the beginning of the thirteenth century among the noble [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]].&lt;ref name="Sestan"/&gt; His Chronicle, however, is mainly about the history of Florence from ancient times (its legendary foundation by Caesar in 70&amp;nbsp;BCE) up to 1385. Bonaiuti devotes a major part of the work to the destruction caused to [[Florence]] and [[Fiesole]] by the [[bubonic plague]] of the [[Black Death]] in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ragone, pp. i, ii&lt;/ref&gt; For the first part of Bonaiuti's work up to 1348 he relied upon [[Giovanni Villani]]'s ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Avery, p. 896&lt;/ref&gt; but after that he diverges from the work of Villani.&lt;ref name="Sestan"/&gt; His own work focusses principally on Florence, while that of Villani extended over other parts of Europe, with no particular devotion to any geographical area.&lt;ref name="Sestan"/&gt;

Bonaiuti devotes in his Chronicle as much effort to the current "news" of the time, especially concerning the Black Death, as to the ancient history of earlier centuries.&lt;ref name="Sestan"/&gt; His account of Florentine events to 1367 contains little detail. This increases for the years 1368 to 1372, but for 1373-74 detail is again scarce. From 1375 until Bonaiuti's death there is again much detail of the current news events of Florence.&lt;ref name="Sestan"/&gt;

A passage in Bonaiuti's ''Cronaca fiorentina'' talks of the mortality rate and the small virtues of people living under such extreme conditions of the plague disease suffered by Florence in 1348. The plague not only killed people, but it killed also their domestic animals, including dogs and cats, and their livestock, such as oxen, donkeys, sheep and chickens. The disease arrived in Florence in March 1348 and did not stop killing until September of that year.&lt;ref name ="mortality"&gt;[http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/week2f.html Concerning A Mortality in the City of Florence in Which Many People Died]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Cronaca fiorentina'' explains that physicians of the day had no idea how to fight this deadly plague, as the medicine of the day knew of no defense against it. It caused such terror that even family members abandoned each other. If someone fell sick, his relations would tell him to go to bed, while they could fetch the doctor. But on leaving home they would fail to return. Once a patient was in bed he usually received no further care, not even food or water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/week2f.html excerpt from The Florentine Chronicle (c.1370-1380)]  "I'm going for the doctor."  Calmly walking out the door, the other left and did not return again.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work also describes the symptoms of the disease, which were a [[bubo]] in the groin area or the armpit. This was usually followed by a fever, with the sufferer spitting up saliva or blood. Those spitting up blood never survived, and most with these symptoms would die within a few days. There was such fear of getting the plague just by being near to sick people that their relations abandoned them. Many people died simply by being left alone with no help whatsoever: no medical assistance, nursing, or even food, if they had indicated they were ill. There was nothing to do but to go to bed and die. No one would enter a house that had a plague sufferer in it. People would not even deal with a healthy person if they suspected they came from a house of sickness. No one would enter an abandoned house if those in it had died of the plague. Everything in the house seemed poisoned. Nobody dared touch anything for fear they would contact the plague.&lt;ref name ="mortality"/&gt;

A passage from Bonaiuti's chronicle tells how most churches were overwhelmed with burials, so dug mass deep graves. Those responsible for disposing of the bodies carried them to the mass grave, dropped them in, and added earth. More bodies arrived the next day, upon which more earth was placed, and soon the mass graves were filled with layers of bodies. People willing to carry bodies to the graves were highly paid and were called ''beccamorti'', or vultures. Some made a fortune at the work, if they did not die of the plague themselves.&lt;ref name ="mortality"/&gt;

Bonaiuti recounts how in the months of the Black Death, goods became very expensive. Food prices increased astronomically. Services of all kinds also became very expensive. Wax was very scarce, so that few could afford a pound weight of it. The government of the city finally had to order a limit on the price of wax, so that people could afford candles for light and for the few funerals that took place, but only two candles could be carried in any funeral. The cost of funeral clothing climbed ten-fold. Finally, the custom of dressing in expensive clothing for a funeral was discontinued.&lt;ref name ="mortality"/&gt;

The ''Cronaca fiorentina'' explains that the spice-dealers and ''beccamorti'' sold burial items, such as perfumed spiced goods, benches, caskets, burial palls, [[bier]]s, and cushions, at outrageously high prices, so that the government finally had to step in and control such prices. It also forbade the custom of ringing bells during a funeral, to limit the knowledge of how many funerals there actually were. Crying out a funeral announcement was also forbidden. Knowing how many funerals there were discouraged the sick as well as the healthy. Priests and [[friar]]s served the rich, since they were paid large amounts of money for their services, and could become rich themselves. The local authorities then made laws prescribing how many clerics a church could have, usually setting the limit at six. Many rich people died, and many religious processions with relics went through the streets of Florence. The dead would be carried away by four ''beccamorti'' and a tonsured clerk carrying a [[Christian cross]], each wanting to be highly paid.&lt;ref name ="mortality"/&gt;
 
Bonaiuti makes it clear that the plague killed so many people that certain new customs were put into place. Fruits with a nut center, unhusked almonds, figs, and "unhealthy" fruits were forbidden to enter Florence, for fear of bringing in the pestilence. Men would gather and dine together. Each evening a man would provide the cooked meal for ten other men, rotating from night to night as the host.  Many times a host would provide dinner for ten, but two or three were missing. Often by the next evening only one of the ten was still present, the other nine having died or having fled the city for villages outside it, to get fresh air, but they took the plague with them and contaminated otherwise healthy villages. Thus the pestilence spread, killing people at an ever faster rate.&lt;ref name ="mortality"/&gt;

The ''Cronaca fiorentina'' also explains that the Florentine [[guild]]s were not operating during the plague epidemic of the fourteenth century. The craft shops were closed, as were the taverns, and only the [[apothecary|apothecaries]] and the churches remained open for business during the disaster. The overcharging for certain goods and services shows the morality of those providing them, and the rate at which the plague killed people made the apothecaries and doctors rich. Others enriched by the high death rate were poultry-farmers, gravediggers, grocers selling vegetables, and those who made [[poultice]]s to draw away the infirmity of the disease.&lt;ref name ="mortality"/&gt;

The '''Delaware Art Museum''' is an art museum located on the Kentmere Parkway in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], which holds a collection of more than 12,000 objects.

The museum building was expanded and renovated in 2005 and includes a {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} Sculpture Park, the [[Helen Farr Sloan]] Library and Archives, studio art classes, a children's learning area, as well as a cafe and museum store.

==History==
The museum was founded in 1912 after Howard Pyle's death as the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts (WSFA), with over 100 paintings, drawings, and prints purchased from Pyle's widow Anne. Pyle was the best-known American illustrator of his day; he died unexpectedly in 1911 while on a trip to Italy.  
[[File:Pyle pirates treasfight.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|''Who shall be captain?'' an illustration by Howard Pyle at the museum]]
Pyle left behind many students and patrons in his home town of Wilmington who wished to honor his memory through the museum, including [[Frank Schoonover]], [[Stanley Arthurs]], and [[Lammot du Pont Copeland|Louisa du Pont Copeland]]. The museum's charter stated its purpose "to promote the knowledge and enjoyment of and cultivation in the fine arts in the State of Delaware."&lt;ref name="DAM Treasures"&gt;{{cite book

  | pages =136  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=RZtIAQAAIAAJ  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1912 to 1922, the WSFA did not have a permanent home.  It held annual exhibitions at the [[Hotel duPont]] of work by Pyle, as well as juried exhibitions of his pupils and other Delaware artists.  The Pyle Collection continued to grow due to the largess of [[Willard S. Morse]], who gave over 100 Pyle pen and ink drawings to the WSFA between 1915 and 1919.  In 1922, the WSFA rented three rooms in the New Library Building on the corner of 10th and Market Streets in downtown Wilmington.&lt;ref name="flipbook of the museum's history"&gt;{{cite book

==Bancroft donation==
[[File:Portrait-of-elizabeth-siddal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|''Portrait of [[Elizabeth Siddal]]'' by Pre-Raphaelite [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]]]
In 1931, the estate of [[Samuel Bancroft]] contacted the WSFA with an offer to donate a collection of Pre-Raphaelite works, along with 11 acres of land to house a museum for the collection.  Bancroft acquired the collection beginning in the 1890s and it is the "largest and most important collection of British Pre-Raphaelite art and manuscript materials in the United States."&lt;ref name="DAM Treasures"/&gt; Despite the harships of the Great Depression, the WSFA raised $350,000 for the new building which opened in 1938.&lt;ref name='NYT 1933-03-26'&gt;{{cite news | first = Elizabeth Luther | last = Cary | title = Pre-Raphaelite Art for a Museum | date = 1933-03-26 | publisher = The New York Times Company | work = New York Times | pages = IX 10:6 | quote = The Bancroft estate has now made the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts an offer of ground for a museum, almost three acres on a charming site, with the Brandywine Creek for a rear boundary, the offer conditional on the erection of the museum in five years time. … if the museum is built, the Bancroft collection, consisting of many interesting items in addition to the pre Raphaelite material, will be housed within it… }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the name was changed to Delaware Art Center.

==Expansion==
The WSFA moved into the Delaware Art Center in June 1938, with the Wilmington Academy of Fine Arts running educational programs on the ground floor.  The onset of [[World War II]] resulted in strict gas rationing, which drastically reduced the attendance to the museum.  The Wilmington Academy of Fine Arts disbanded in 1943 and turned its assets over to the Delaware Art Center,  forming the basis of its education department, which grew to more than 500 students by 1954.

The rapid growth of educational programs after [[World War II]] required the Delaware Art Center to expand by 1956.  Studios and training facilities were included in the expansion, thanks to a $300,000 donation by H. Fletcher Brown.&lt;ref name="DAM Treasures"/&gt; A further renovation was completed in 1970, adding air conditioning and humidity control to the building.  In 1972, the Delaware Art Center was awarded accreditation by the [[American Alliance of Museums]].  Shortly thereafter, the Delaware Art Center was renamed the Delaware Art Museum to "reflect the growing strength of its collections, programs, and constituency." &lt;ref name = "Museum History: 100 Years of Art"&gt;{{cite web| title=Centennial History| url = http://www.delart.org/pdf/about/pdf/Centennial_History.pdf |work=Delaware Art Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further expansion was completed in 1987 which effectively doubled the size of the museum.&lt;ref name = "Delaware Art Museum Quartrely 1.3"&gt;{{cite news | title = Delaware Art Museum Quarterly 1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the rapid growth of attendance, programming, and outreach required a further expansion in 2005.

==Collections==
The Delaware Art Museum's collections are predominantly drawn from late 19th- and early 20th-century American illustration, as well as works from the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  The basis of the museum's collections are the works of [[Howard Pyle]] and his pupils [[N.C. Wyeth]], [[Frank Schoonover]], and Stanley Arthurs.  [[Helen Farr Sloan]] was the wife of artist [[John French Sloan]], and she began donations in 1961 that eventually totalled 5,000 objects.&lt;ref name="DAM Treasures"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inqu"&gt;{{cite news

In [[telecommunications]], '''directory assistance''' or '''directory enquiries''' is a phone service used to find out a specific [[telephone number]] and/or address of a residence, business, or government entity.

==Technology==
Directory assistance systems incorporate a wide range of automation to reduce the cost of human operators.  Almost all systems use custom [[database]] software to locate listings quickly.

Most directory assistance systems use automated readback systems to give out the phone number. This frees the directory assistance operator to move on to another caller as soon as the correct listing is located.

Some systems have "store and forward" technology which records "city and state" the caller is requesting and then plays the city and state speech to the operator before they come online and then say "Residential or business listing?" or simply "What listing please?"

[[Interactive voice response]] systems have been added to many directory assistance systems. These complex systems use [[speech recognition]] and recorded speech or [[speech synthesis]] to handle the entire call without live operator intervention.

Most systems recognize location and listing. If recognition confidence is high, the best result is played to the caller. If confidence is low, the caller's request is played back to a live operator, who locates the correct listing.

==North America==
In the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (covering [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]), directory assistance may be contacted by dialing [[4-1-1]] (one of the [[N11 code]]s).  To get a listing in a remote or non-local [[area code]], directory assistance is available at 1-''[[area code]]''-555-1212.  In some cases, a 411 call from a landline will yield local, national, and sometimes international listings.

Most telephone companies permit up to two listings per 411 call. All wireless carriers offer nationwide listings with 411, and some offer additional Enhanced Directory Assistance services. However, wireless numbers for residential customers are not available via 411. 

===Billing===
Historically, the [[Telecommunications_tariff|tariffs]] for wireline telephone service allowed subscribers to place a certain number of directory assistance calls for free each month.  More recently, telephone companies are charging subscribers for every directory assistance call.

U.S. wireline telephone companies classify DA into four rate classes:

# 411 LDA: Local Directory Assistance. 411 is dialled and the operator is requested to search for a listing in a group of area codes local to the caller ([[LATA]]). Example: the caller lives in area code 630 (Oak Brook, IL) and requests a listing for a business in area code 312 (Chicago, IL). In this case, [[AT&amp;T Illinois]] bills the call.
# 411 NDA: National Directory Assistance. 411 is dialled and the operator is requested to search for a listing in an area code not local to the caller. Example: The caller lives in area code 630 (Oak Brook, IL) and requests a listing for a business in area code 213 (Los Angeles, CA). In this case AT&amp;T Illinois bills the call.
# (area code) 555-1212: National Directory Assistance. This example assumes the caller is in Oak Brook, IL (area code 630) and uses Verizon as their long distance carrier. Example: The caller is looking for a listing in Los Angeles, CA (area code 213) and dials 213-555-1212. In this case Verizon bills the call.
# 00 and ask for the international directory assistance operator. [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] provides International Directory Assistance calls. See [http://www.consumer.att.com/global/english/country_codes.html www.consumer.att.com/global/english/country_codes.html] for additional information and country and city codes.

===Toll-free directory assistance===
In the U.S., directory assistance for companies with toll-free "[[800 number]]s" (with area codes 800, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888) is available from toll-free directory assistance.

Toll-free directory assistance is provided by telecommunication providers, namely AT&amp;T and Verizon, as mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. Companies must request to have their toll-free number listed and pay the providers each time their phone number is released to a Toll-free directory assistance caller. In 1999, AT&amp;T applied for permission to discontinue this service&lt;ref name="fcc"&gt;*{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Public_Notices/1999/da992541.html |title=Discontinuance - AT&amp;T Toll-Free Directory Assistance Service - 1-800-555-1212 |accessdate=2007-12-28 |author=[[AT&amp;T Inc.]] |date=16 November 1999 |work=FCC Public Notices |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains active.

===Directory assistance data sources===
The service of [[4-1-1]] queries is often outsourced to a [[call centre]] that specializes in that function. Historically, when a single carrier provided most of the telephony services for a region, the data used to satisfy the search could come exclusively from that carrier's subscriber rolls. Today, when the market is fragmented amongst many carriers, the data must be aggregated by a [[data aggregator]] specializing in directory listings. The [[data aggregator]] distributes the data to the 4-1-1 services either on a "live" basis, actually servicing each query, or by periodically transferring large swaths of listings to the call center's systems for local searching.

The [[data aggregator]] collects the data from the rolls of many telecommunication carriers. Some carriers such as [[Vonage]] do not send their customer rolls to the aggregator.

===Companies specializing in free directory assistance===
Private companies have entered the directory assistance market by offering free directory assistance.  Customers often must listen to an advertisement prior to receiving directory services.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/09/business/09cell.html |work=The New York Times |title=The 411 on Directory Assistance |first=Fred A. |last=Bernstein |date=9 March 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In Australia, there are two standard directory assistance numbers that can be accessed from any phone provider, these are '''1223''' for national directory assistance and '''1225''' for international directory assistance. Other directory service numbers are carrier specific and can only be accessed by customers of that particular provider, for example Sensis on '''1234''' is a premium operator-assist directory service that only certain [[Telstra]] customers are able to access. Other operator-assist directory services do exist, for example CallConnect on '''12456''' however these numbers are not guaranteed to be accessible from all phone providers within Australia.

==United Kingdom==
[[Image:Bt international directory assistance grimsby.jpg|thumb|The BT foreign directory assistance centre in Grimsby (1996)]]
In the United Kingdom, directory assistance is called '''''directory enquiries.''''' 

Directory enquires is provided by a variety of different companies, with a variety of call charges, each company reached by dialling a six-digit number beginning with 118. These companies supply information from the Operator Services Information System (OSIS), which is run by Directory Solutions, a division of BT Wholesale. OSIS accepts updates from telecoms providers seven days a week, and supplies that information to the enquiry companies six days a week.&lt;ref name="btw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btwholesale.com/pages/static/Products/Managed_Network_Solutions/Directory_Solutions/About_Us.html |title=BT Wholesale Directory Solutions - About Us |publisher=[[British Telecom]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130070319/http://www.btwholesale.com/pages/static/Products/Managed_Network_Solutions/Directory_Solutions/About_Us.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently over 200 providers.&lt;ref name="telecomtariffs_dialdq"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telecom-tariffs.co.uk/dialdirq.htm |title=Directory Enquiry Codes |publisher=Magenta Systems |date=2017-05-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506141502/https://www.telecom-tariffs.co.uk/dialdirq.htm |archivedate=2017-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of these, [[118 118 (UK)|118 118]] (The Number), 118 212 (Maureen), 118 247 ([[Yellow Pages]]) and 118 500 ([[British Telecom]]) are among the most expensive and yet have over 90% of the market, mostly due to heavy advertising.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Directory enquiries used to be reached by dialling 192 (domestic numbers) or 153 (foreign), with the service supplied by the telephone company providing the fixed or mobile service to the calling telephone. Historically the service was free at the point of use. During the 1990s charges were brought in to use this service from home or business lines, although for some years after directory enquiries were free from payphones. These numbers were switched off on 24 August 2003 following the introduction of competition to directory enquiries.

===Pricing===
The pricing structure for UK directory enquiries was reformed by Ofcom on 1 July 2015.&lt;ref name="ofcom_ukcalling"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/uk-calling |title=UK Calling |author= |work= |publisher=Ofcom |date=2014-09-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403141959/https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/uk-calling |archivedate=2017-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Call charges consist of an access charge and a service charge. The access charge is set and retained by the caller's landline or mobile provider. The service charge is set by the directory enquiries service but it is collected by the caller's phone provider and then passed on to the directory enquiries service.

The access charge is set at a per minute rate and is typically 2p to 13p per minute from landlines or 5p to 55p per minute from mobiles. The access charge is always the same rate as applies for calls to 084, 087 and 09 numbers and must be shown prominently in tariff lists.

The service charge may be charged per call, per minute, or a combination of the two. The per-call part may be anywhere from 5p to £16 and applies as soon as the call is answered. The per-minute part may be anywhere from 1p to £8 and may apply from the start of the call or may apply after the first 60 seconds has elapsed. There are 100 available service charge price points, known as SC001 to SC100.&lt;ref name="checkit_sclist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://checkit.uboss.com/Calling/UkNgnCallCharges/ |title=UK NGN Call Charges SC001 to SC100 |author= |work= |publisher=Uboss |date=2016-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609153020/http://checkit.uboss.com/Calling/UkNgnCallCharges/ |archivedate=2016-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BT_2016.07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.com/pricing/current/Call_Charges_boo/FrameworkImpl1350581.htm#FrameworkImpl1350581 |title=Subpart 6: Calls to Service Numbers (numbers starting 084, 087, 09 and 118) from 1 July 2016 |author= |work=Section 2:Call Charges &amp; Exchange Line Services - Part 1: Basic Inland Call Charge |publisher=BT |date=2016-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130141054/http://www.bt.com/pricing/current/Call_Charges_boo/FrameworkImpl1350581.htm#FrameworkImpl1350581 |archivedate=2017-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service charge must be declared alongside the number wherever it is advertised or promoted.&lt;ref name="ofcom_ukcallingbusinesses"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/uk-calling/uk-calling-for-businesses |title=How does UK Calling affect businesses? |author= |work= |publisher=Ofcom |date=2014-09-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404152009/https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/uk-calling/uk-calling-for-businesses |archivedate=2017-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
A number offering a directory enquiries service allowing people to request to be put through to a [[mobile phone]] number was established in June 2009.&lt;ref name="blogit_12674"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=12674 |title=118 800 To Connect UK to Millions of Mobile Numbers |publisher=Real Wire |date=9 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612040709/https://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=12674 |archivedate=2009-06-12 |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 118 800 proved to be controversial, however, when it was revealed that it was making available 15 million mobile numbers that it had bought from market researchers.&lt;ref name="guardian_2009jul13"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jul/13/mobile-phone-directory-suspended |title=Mobile phone directory suspended |first=Hilary |last=Osborne |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906232558/https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jul/13/mobile-phone-directory-suspended |archivedate=2013-09-06 |accessdate=14 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its website was suspended&lt;ref name="prlog_10295392"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.prlog.org/10295392-118800-mobile-enquiry-service-temporarily-suspended.html |title=118800 Mobile Enquiry Service Temporarily Suspended |publisher=PR Log |date=29 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830060855/http://www.prlog.org/10295392-118800-mobile-enquiry-service-temporarily-suspended.html |archivedate=2012-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; within weeks of its launch so that the company could re-engineer the site to enable the large number of ex-directory requests to be handled more efficiently.&lt;ref name="guardian_2009jul13" /&gt; {{asof|2017}} the 118800.co.uk site remains non-functional.

In 2014, the 118500 service run by BT was fined £225,000 by PhonepayPlus (now renamed as the [[Phone-paid Services Authority]]) for over-charging customers and failing to clearly display call costs.&lt;ref name="dailymail_2551432"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-2551432/Callers-BTs-118-500-directory-enquiries-claim-refund.html |title=Does BT owe you a refund?

Some directory enquiries services stand accused of inappropriate methods of promoting their services, effectively scamming people into calling. Various unallocated geographic and non-geographic numbers play an announcement directing callers to call a particular directory enquiries number for help. People may hear this message when they mis-dial a wanted number&lt;ref name="thesun_3522224"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/3522224/pensioner-hit-with-111-bill-after-being-tricked-into-calling-a-premium-118-number/ |title=New 118 Scam Exposed - Pensioner hit with £111 bill after being tricked into calling a premium 118 number |last=Jones |first=Daniel |publisher=The Sun |date=2017-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511091913/https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/3522224/pensioner-hit-with-111-bill-after-being-tricked-into-calling-a-premium-118-number/ |archivedate=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or may appear to have missed a call from the unallocated number and hear this message if they call back.

===Charities===
Some services donate part of their income to charities, such as animal welfare and football clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethcom.org/services.html |title=118 Numbers - 118donate |publisher=Ethcom |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717142736/http://ethcom.org/services.html |archivedate=2015-07-17 |access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7615">'''Distributed denial-of-service attacks on root nameservers''' are [[Internet]] events in which distributed [[denial-of-service attack]]s target one or more of the thirteen [[Domain Name System]] [[root nameserver]] clusters. The root nameservers are [[critical infrastructure]] components of the Internet, mapping [[domain name]]s to [[IP address]]es and other resource record (RR) data.

Attacks against the root nameservers could, in theory, impact operation of the entire global Domain Name System, and thus all Internet services that use the global DNS, rather than just specific websites. However, in practice, the root nameserver infrastructure is highly resilient and distributed, using both the inherent features of DNS (result caching, retries, and multiple servers for the same zone with fallback if one or more fail), and, in recent years, a combination of [[anycast]] and [[load balancer]] techniques used to implement most of the thirteen nominal individual root servers as globally distributed clusters of servers in multiple data centers.

In particular, the caching and redundancy features of DNS mean that it would require a sustained outage of all the major root servers for many days before any serious problems were created for most Internet users, and even then there are still numerous ways in which ISPs could set their systems up during that period to mitigate even a total loss of all root servers for an extended period of time: for example by installing their own copies of the [[DNS root zone|global DNS root zone]] data on nameservers within their network, and redirecting traffic to the root server IP addresses to those servers. Nevertheless, DDoS attacks on the root zone are taken seriously as a risk by the operators of the root nameservers, and they continue to upgrade the capacity and [[DDoS mitigation]] capabilities of their infrastructure to resist any future attacks.

An effective attack against DNS might involve targeting [[top-level domain]] servers (such as those servicing the [[.com]] domain) instead of root name servers. Alternatively, a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] or [[DNS spoofing|DNS poisoning]] attack could be used, though they would be more difficult to carry out.

==Attacks==

===October 21, 2002===
On October 21, 2002 an attack lasting for approximately one hour was targeted at all 13 DNS root name servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isc.org/f-root-denial-of-service-21-oct-2002|title=Events of 21-Oct-2002|last=Vixie|first=Paul|author2=Gerry Sneeringer|author3=Mark Schleifer|date=2002-11-24|accessdate=2008-07-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302164416/http://www.isc.org/f-root-denial-of-service-21-oct-2002|archivedate=2011-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers sent many [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] ping packets using a [[botnet]] to each of the servers. However, because the servers were protected by packet filters which were configured to block all incoming ICMP ping packets, they did not sustain much damage and there was little to no impact on Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurose|first=James F.|title=Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (6th Edition)|date=Feb 24, 2012|isbn=0132856204|page=143|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 6, 2007===
On February 6, 2007 an attack began at 10:00&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]] and lasted twenty-four hours. At least two of the root servers (G-ROOT and L-ROOT) reportedly "suffered badly" while two others (F-ROOT and M-ROOT) "experienced heavy traffic". The latter two servers largely contained the damage by distributing requests to other root server instances with [[anycast]] addressing. [[ICANN]] published a formal analysis shortly after the event.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/announcements/factsheet-dns-attack-08mar07_v1.1.pdf|title=Factsheet – Root server attack on 6 February 2007 |date=2007-03-01|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a lack of detail, speculation about the incident proliferated in the press until details were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dns-oarc.net/files/dnsops-2007/Kristoff-Feb07-attacks.pdf|title=Root DDoS Attack Analysis|last=Kristoff|first=John|date=2007-07-27|publisher=DNS-OARC|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 30, 2015===
During two intervals on November 30, 2015 and December 1, 2015, several of the root name servers received up to 5 million queries per second each, receiving valid queries for a single undisclosed domain name, and then a different domain the next day. Source addresses were spread throughout IPv4 space, however these may have been spoofed. Some root server networks became saturated, resulting in timeouts, however redundancy among the root servers prevented downstream issues from occurring during this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://root-servers.org/news/events-of-20151130.txt|title=Events of 2015-11-30|date=2015-12-04|accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Operation Global Blackout 2012===
On February 12, 2012, a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pastebin.com/NKbnh8q8|title=Untitled|date=12 February 2012|publisher=pastebin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was posted on [[Pastebin]] cited to be from [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], threatening an attack on the root servers on March 31, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pastebin.com/NKbnh8q8|title=Untitled|date=2012-02-12|publisher=pastebin.com|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"To protest [[Stop Online Piracy Act|SOPA]], [[Wall Street|Wallstreet]], our irresponsible leaders and the beloved bankers who are starving the world for their own selfish needs out of sheer sadistic fun, On March 31, anonymous will shut the Internet down," reads the statement. "Remember, this is a protest, we are not trying to ‘kill' the Internet, we are only temporarily shutting it down where it hurts the most…It may only last one hour, maybe more, maybe even a few days. No matter what, it will be global. It will be known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/02/16/anonymous-plans-to-take-down-the-internet-were-being-trolled/|title=Anonymous Plans To Take Down The Internet?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10322">'''Domain privacy''' (often called '''Whois privacy''') is a service offered by a number of [[domain name registrar]]s. A user buys privacy from the company, who in turn replaces the user's information in the [[WHOIS]] with the information of a forwarding service (for email and sometimes postal mail, it is done by a [[proxy server]]).

==Level of anonymity==
* Personal information is typically collected by these registrars to provide the service. Some registrars take little persuasion to release the so-called 'private' information to the world, requiring only a phone request or a [[cease and desist]] letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Private domains not so private? | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | date=2005-08-15 | accessdate=2016-02-03 | url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/private-domains-not-so-private/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=More on Domains By Proxy | author=Thomas Roessler | date=2003-04-15 | accessdate= | url=http://log.does-not-exist.org/archives/2003/04/15/299_more_on_domains_by_proxy.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=proxy fight &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Domains-by-proxy update&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; | author=Wendy Seltzer | date=2003-04-11 | accessdate=2008-06-16 | url=http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2003/04/11/proxy_fight_domains_by_proxy_update.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605230455/http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2003/04/11/proxy_fight_domains_by_proxy_update.html | archivedate=2008-06-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Others, however, handle privacy with more precaution, using measures including hosting domain names offshore and accepting [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] for payment so that the registrar has no knowledge of the domain name owner's personal information (which would otherwise be transmitted with credit card transactions). It is debatable whether or not this practice is at odds with the domain registration requirement of the ''Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers'' ([[ICANN]]).

===Privacy by default===
Note that some top-level domains have privacy caveats:
* [[.al]]: No information about the owner is disclosed.
* [[.at]], .co.at, .or.at: Since May 21, 2010, contact data (defined as phone number, fax number, e-mail address) is hidden by the registrar and must be explicitly made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Change of nic.at Whois policy | author=nic.at GmbH |authorlink=Nic.at | date=2010-05-21 | accessdate=2014-05-05 | url=http://www.nic.at/en/uebernic/current_issues/nicat_news/news_view/article//aenderung-der-whois-policy-bei-nicat/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[.ca]]: Since June 10, 2008, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority no longer posts registration details of individuals associated with .ca domains.
* [[.de]]: Since May 25, 2018, the German Internet Registration Authority [[denic]] put extensive changes into force for the Whois Lookup Service. Without a few exceptions, third parties can no longer access domain ownership data.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.denic.de/en/whats-new/press-releases/article/denic-putting-extensive-changes-into-force-for-de-whois-lookup-service-as-of-25-may-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[.eu]]: If the registrant is a natural person, only the e-mail address is shown in the public whois records unless specified otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= .eu domain name WHOIS policy| accessdate=2016-04-29 | author=EURid| url=https://eurid.eu/en/other-infomation/whois-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[.fr]]: By default, individual domain name holders benefit from the restricted publishing of their personal data in the AFNIC public Whois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= AFNIC Data publication and access policy| accessdate=2017-06-26 | author=AFNIC| url=https://www.afnic.fr/en/resources/reference/registry-policies/data-publication-and-access-policy-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[.gr]]: No information about the owner is disclosed.
* [[.is]]: May hide address and phone number.
* [[.nl]]: Since January 12, 2010, registrant postal addresses are no longer publicly available.&lt;ref name="Tweakers.net 2010-01-12"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://tweakers.net/nieuws/64894/sidn-anonimiseert-whois-gegevens.html|title = SIDN anonimiseert whois-gegevens|last1 = Van Miltenburg|first1 = Olaf|date = 12 January 2010|language = nl|trans-title=SIDN anonymizes whois data|accessdate = 4 September 2014|website = [[Tweakers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIDN 2010-01-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidn.nl/ace.php/c,728,6253,,,,SIDN_implements_Whois_changes_from_12_January_2010.html|title=SIDN implements Whois changes from 12 January 2010|date=1 January 2010|publisher=[[Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland|SIDN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129030637/http://www.sidn.nl/ace.php/c,728,6253,,,,SIDN_implements_Whois_changes_from_12_January_2010.html|archive-date=29 January 2010|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[.ovh]]: Contact data is hidden by the registrar and must be explicitly made public.
* [[.uk]]: Nominet, the guardian of UK domain namespace, provide domain privacy tools on their extensions (.co.uk, .me.uk etc.), providing that the registrant is not trading from the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Nominet WHOIS Opt Out | author=Nominet | url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/about-domain-names/domain-lookup-whois/opt-out }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the home address of the registrant can be hidden, the full name cannot.

===Privacy forbidden===
* [[.us]]: In March 2005, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA) said that owners of .us domains will not have the option of keeping their information private, and that it must be made public.
* [[.in]]: Registrants for Indian domain names may not use any proxy or privacy services provided by registrars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Registry.in | title=Terms and Conditions for registrants | url=https://registry.in/system/files/Terms_and_Conditions_for_Registrants_1_0.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[.li]] and [[.ch]]: According to the General Terms &amp; Conditions of SWITCH, the Swiss registry for .ch and .li domains,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=nic.ch | title=General Terms &amp; Conditions of SWITCH | url=https://www.nic.ch/terms/agb/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;, "... SWITCH is legally obliged to publish ... [the] full name of the holder of the domain name concerned [and the] postal address of the place of residence of the holder ..."
* [[.it]] Italian domain names can not keep information private for law.

==Implications==
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) broadly requires the [[mail]]ing [[Address (geography)|address]], [[phone number]], and [[e-mail address]] of those owning or administrating a [[domain name]] to be made publicly available through the "[[WHOIS]]" directories. However, that policy may enable spammers, direct marketers, identity thieves, or other attackers to use the directory to acquire personal information about those people. Although ICANN has been working to change WHOIS to enable greater privacy, there is a lack of consensus among major stakeholders as to what type of change should be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Privacy Conundrum in Domain Registration|url=http://www.actnowdomains.com/the-privacy-conundrum-in-domain-registration.htm|publisher=Act Now Domains|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the offer of private registration from many registrars, some of the risk has been mitigated, enabling those spammers, direct marketers, identity thieves, and other cyber-criminals to hide behind anonymous domain registrations to make it difficult or impossible for victims to identify those responsible.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Litigation==
With "private registration", the private registration service can be the legal owner of the domain. This has occasionally resulted in legal problems.  Ownership of a domain name is given by the organization name of the owner contact in the domain's WHOIS record.  There are typically four contact positions in a domain's WHOIS record: owner, administrator, billing, and technical.  Some registrars will not shield the owner organization name in order to protect the ownership of the domain name.

Ownership of domains held by a privacy service was also an issue in the [[RegisterFly]] case, in which a registrar effectively ceased operations and then went bankrupt.  Customers encountered serious difficulties in regaining control of the domains involved.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;ref name=CompBusinessReviewOnline2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbronline.com/news/anger_and_fear_as_domain_firm_slowly_implodes|title=Anger and fear as domain firm slowly implodes|work=Computer Business Review|date=February 21, 2007|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICANN has since remedied that situation by requiring all accredited registrars to maintain their customers' contact data in [[escrow]].  In the event a registrar loses its accreditation, gTLD domains along with the [[Escrow|escrowed]] contact data will be transferred to another accredited registrar.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

There have been several lawsuits against [[NameCheap]], Inc. for its role as owner/registrant.&lt;ref&gt;http://randazza.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/solid-host-v-namecheap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and also in Silverstein v. Alivemax, et al. Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number BC480994 although this case was dismissed in May of 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lacourt.org/casesummary/ui/|title=Case Summary - Online Services - LA Court|website=www.lacourt.org|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silverstein is well known for his anti-spam and email privacy campaigning, most notably in the case of William Siverstein v Keynetics, Inc., No. 17-15176 (9th Cir. 2018) - decided in March 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/silverstein-v-keynetics.php|title=Silverstein v Keynetics, Inc|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Eijirō'''|英辞郎}} is a very large database of English-Japanese translations. Developed by the editors of the Electronic Dictionary Project and aimed at translators, Eijirō is currently one of the most popular dictionaries on the Internet.  Although the contents are technically the same, EDP refers to the accompanying Japanese-English database as {{nihongo|'''Waeijirō'''|和英辞郎}}.

== History ==

The Eijirō project was started by a translator (who wishes to remain anonymous) as a way to keep track of his English vocabulary.  Noting the favorable reception it received when he shared it with his friends, he started the Electronic Dictionary Project, a wiki-like structure that allowed for and even encouraged contributions to the dictionary.  This resulted in a comprehensive database that grew to include over 1.66 million entries in the fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://shop.alc.co.jp/cnt/eijiro/ 英辞郎 第四版：アルクオンラインショップ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Although commonly termed a [[dictionary]], Eijirō differs from other [[Japanese dictionary|Japanese dictionaries]] such as the [[Kōjien]] by giving examples the same weight as definitions.  While this may result in less accurate definitions on a one-to-one basis, many translators use Eijirō specifically for this purpose, as this structure allows for a more nuanced understanding of the word and accounts for its appearance in commonly used sayings.{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}

== Access ==

Eijirō can be purchased online as either a [[CD-R]] or downloadable dictionary file for a comparatively low price. Eijirō was also released from SpaceALC in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.alc.co.jp/alc/eng/main_his_e3.htm History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the SpaceALC version has since gone through eight revisions as of 2016.

In addition, an online version of Eijirō is provided free of charge through the SpaceALC Japanese portal.

The '''Filmoteca de Catalunya''' is a [[film archive]] located in [[Catalunya]], [[Spain]], aiming at the preservation of film and the dissemination of audiovisual and [[film]] culture. Its head office and public rooms (cinemas, exhibition rooms, library) are located in the [[Raval]] neighbourhood, in central [[Barcelona]]. The '''Centre de Conservació i Restauració''' (the institution's Center for Conservation and Restoration) is located in the ''Parc Audiovisual''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parcaudiovisual.cat/filmoteca/ Centre de Conservació i restauració in Terrassa]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Terrassa]].

== History==
The Filmoteca de Catalunya did not exist as such until 1981.&lt;ref name = history&gt;[http://patrimoni.gencat.cat/en/collection/filmoteca-de-catalunya Filmoteca de Catalunya. More than 30 years conserving and disseminating film heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, from 1963 to 1981 it was the Spanish Filmoteca's branch in Barcelona. In 1981, once a democratic regime had been re-established in Spain, the Spanish Filmoteca transferred its responsibilities and cultural competences to the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]], which then created the Filmoteca de Catalunya. Since its foundation, the Filmoteca de Catalunya has been under the auspices of the Culture Department of the Catalan government.

For some years, the Filmoteca de Catalunya's main activity was the daily screening of worldwide and Catalan films. Yet efforts were soon made to create a film collection. Consequently, a Film Archive, now called ''Centre de Conservació i Restauració'' (Centre for Conservation and Restoration), was established in 1992.

Over the course of its history, the Filmoteca de Catalunya has also moved to different venues in Barcelona. Its first theatrical venue was located in Travessera de Gràcia, and in 1991 it moved to an old cinema, the Cinema Aquitània, where it held its screenings for more than twenty years. During this time, the Centre for Conservation and Restoration was located in a different area in Barcelona. In 2012 the Filmoteca de Catalunya relocated to its current headquarters in central Barcelona,&lt;ref name=relocation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/premium/cultura/nova-Filmoteca-obre-al-Raval_0_644335610.html|title=La nova seu de la Filmoteca obre per fi al Raval
|publisher=Diari Ara|last=Serra|first=Laura|date=11 February 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014, the Centre for Conservation and Restoration was opened in Terrassa.&lt;ref name=Terrassa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrassadigital.cat/detall_actualitat/?id=21117|title=El Centre de Conservació de la Filmoteca ja funciona a ple rendiment

== Filmoteca de Catalunya's activities ==

=== Dissemination of Cinema ===
[[File:Interior Filmoteca CAT.JPG|thumb|Main hall of the Filmoteca de Catalunya]]

The promotion and dissemination of cinema and film culture -in particular, of Catalan film heritage- is among the main aims of the Filmoteca de Catalunya. Such an aim is fulfilled through different activities and programs:

* Screenings: the Filmoteca de Catalunya runs two cinema screens, both located in its main headquarters in Barcelona. The Filmoteca shows films from all over the world, particularly critically acclaimed historical and specialized films that may not otherwise get a cinema showing. It also hosts several cinema festivals co-organized with third parties. It distributes films from its collection to other venues across Catalonia and worldwide as well, mainly through partnerships with other institutions.
* Educational programs: the Filmoteca de Catalunya offers a range of educational initiatives and programs, which include courses targeted towards formal and informal school schemes, as well as a program targeted at adults. The Filmoteca de Catalunya also develops workshops and other activities designed to promote audiovisual culture.
* Exhibitions: the Filmoteca de Catalunya organizes temporary exhibits on themes pertaining to cinema, showing both its own collection and outside collections.
* Publications: the Filmoteca de Catalunya publishes a full range of materials designed to foster common knowledge and appreciation of cinema.

=== Film Conservation and Restoration ===
The Filmoteca de Catalunya maintains the largest Catalan film archive, preserved and restored at the Centre for Conservation and Restoration, the ''Centre de Conservació i Restauració'' (in Catalan). The archive has more than 170,000 film reels containing nearly 23,500 titles, as well as 41,000 documents.&lt;ref name="official web"&gt;[http://www.filmoteca.cat/web/centre-de-conservacio-i-restauracio/la-colleccio/fons-i-colleccions Filmoteca de Catalunya's web. Film Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the collection is Catalan material, but it also features some holdings from around the world. The film holdings of the Filmoteca de Catalunya consist, among other things, of such important collections as: the Catalan Cinema Collection, the [[Segundo de Chomón]] Collection, the Laya Films Collection -which includes most of the films shot by the Republican production units during the [[Spanish Civil War]]- and several private collections that were donated to the institution.
  
The main objective of the Centre for Conservation and Restoration is the recovery, preservation, restoration, cataloguing and dissemination of its collection.

=== Film Library ===

The Filmoteca de Catalunya's Film [[Library]], the ''Biblioteca del Cinema'' (in Catalan) holds more that 40.000 documents &lt;ref name = "webFilmoteca"&gt;[http://www.filmoteca.cat/web/biblioteca/fons-i-colleccions/fons-bibliografic Filmoteca de Catalunya's web. Film Library Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of several Catalan and International library networks and catalogues: the Generalitat de Catalunya's Specialized Libraries Catalogue, the Collective Catalogue of the Catalan Universities and BiblioCi, the international network of Latin American, Caribbean and Spanish information units (documentation centers and libraries) specializing in cinema. The Library was born as a result of the transfer of the Spanish Filmoteca's collection and of the CO.CI.CA (Catalan Cinematographic Collection) collected by Miquel Porter i Moix. The Library also holds the Delmiro de Caralt Collection (formed by cameras and other cinema objects), created by Delmiro de Caralt and Pilar de Quadras in 1924.

=== International Activities ===
The Filmoteca de Catalunya is a member of the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] and in April 2013 held the organisation's International Congress in Barcelona,&lt;ref name = "FIAF Congress"&gt;[http://www.fiafnet.org/pages/Events/Past-Congresses.html FIAF Past Congresses]&lt;/ref&gt; which was attended by more than 300 members of [[film institutes]] from 62 different countries.

Since 2014, the Filmoteca de Catalunya has also been one of the venues hosting the simultaneous screening of the [[European Film Academy Young Audience Award]].&lt;ref name = "EYA"&gt;[http://yaa.europeanfilmawards.eu/en_EN/past-editions European Film Academy Young Audience Awards, Past editions ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the Filmoteca also held an international Seminar on [[Orson Welles]] on his centennial,&lt;ref name="Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/filmoteca-de-catalunya-unveils-mammoth-orson-welles-tribute|title=Filmoteca de Catalunya unveils mammoth Orson Welles tribute|publisher=Wellesnet|last=Kelly|first=Ray|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the participation of several experts in the director's career as well as Chris Welles Feder, Welles' daughter. During the seminar, the Filmoteca de Catalunya organized a special screening of ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'' in the Romanesque [[Church of St. Vicenç]] in [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], where the film was originally shot in 1964. As a result of this screening, in 2016 the church was listed as one of the Treasures of European Film Culture by the [[European Film Academy]].&lt;ref name="Wellesnet2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/chimes-at-midnight-church-to-receive-special-designation|title=‘Chimes at Midnight’ church to receive special designation|publisher=Wellesnet|date=29 July 2016|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-2016/ Orson Welles in the news 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Frisch–Peierls memorandum''' was the first technical exposition of a practical [[nuclear weapon]]. It was written by expatriate German physicists [[Otto Frisch]] and [[Rudolf Peierls]] in March 1940 while they were both working for [[Mark Oliphant]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] in Britain during [[World War II]].

The memorandum contained the first calculations about the size of the [[critical mass]] of [[fissile]] material needed for an [[atomic bomb]]. It revealed for the first time that the amount  required might be small enough to incorporate into a bomb that could be delivered by air. It also anticipated the strategic and moral implications of nuclear weapons.

It helped send both Britain and America down a path which led to the [[MAUD Committee]], the [[Tube Alloys]] project, the [[Manhattan Project]], and ultimately the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

=== Rudolf Peierls ===
{{Main|Rudolf Peierls}}
[[Rudolf Peierls]] was born in [[Berlin]] in 1907.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|p=3}} He studied [[physics]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]],{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=16–17}} at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]],{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=23–24}} the [[University of Leipzig]] under [[Werner Heisenberg]],{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=32–33}} and [[ETH Zurich]] under [[Wolfgang Pauli]].{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=40–41}} After receiving his [[DPhil]] from Leipzig in 1929, he became an assistant to Pauli in Zurich.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=44–46}} In 1932, he was awarded a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]], which he used to study in Rome under [[Enrico Fermi]],{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=82–86}}  and then at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] under [[Ralph H. Fowler]]. Due to [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in Germany, he elected to not return home in 1933, but to remain in Britain.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=89–93}} He worked with [[Hans Bethe]] at the [[University of Manchester]],{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=99–104}} then at the Mond Laboratory at Cambridge.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=115–118}} In 1937, [[Mark Oliphant]], the Australian, newly appointed professor of physics at the [[University of Birmingham]] recruited him for a new chair there in applied mathematics.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=127–128}}

=== Otto Frisch ===
{{Main|Otto Frisch}}
[[Otto Robert Frisch]] was born in [[Vienna]] in 1904. He studied physics at the [[University of Vienna]], from which he received his [[DPhil]] in 1926. He worked at the [[Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt]] in Berlin until 1930,&lt;ref name="obdn"&gt;{{cite odnb |id=31127 |title=Frisch, Otto Robert |first=Rudolf |last=Peierls |author-link=Rudolf Peierls  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  when he  obtained a position at the [[University of Hamburg]] under the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist [[Otto Stern]].{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=43–45}} As non-Aryans, Stern and Frisch [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|were dismissed]] after Hitler's accession. Stern found Frisch a position in Britain with [[Patrick Blackett]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birbeck College]] at the [[University of London]], and a grant from the [[Academic Assistance Council]].{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=50–53}} He followed this with a five-year stint at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] with [[Niels Bohr]] where he increasingly specialised in [[nuclear physics]], particularly the physics of [[neutron]]s,&lt;ref name="obdn" /&gt; which had been discovered by [[James Chadwick]] in 1932.{{sfn|Frisch|1979||pp=66–67}} Oliphant invited Frisch to come to the University of Birmingham in the summer of 1939. When the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939 prevented his return to Copenhagen, Oliphant found him a position at the University of Birmingham.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=120–122}}

=== Nuclear fission ===
During the Christmas holiday in 1938, Frisch visited his aunt [[Lise Meitner]] in [[Kungälv]] in Sweden, where she had been forced to relocate after Germany's [[annexation of Austria]] made her a German citizen. While there she received the news that her former colleagues [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in Berlin had discovered that the collision of a neutron with a [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] produced [[barium]] as one of its byproducts. Frisch and Meitner hypothesized that the uranium nucleus had split in two.

It was [[Christian Møller]], a Danish colleague, who first suggested to me that the fission fragments (the two freshly formed nuclei) might contain enough surplus energy each to eject a neutron or two; each of these might cause another fission and generate more neutrons... So from Møller's remark the exciting vision arose  that by assembling enough pure uranium (with appropriate care!) one might start a controlled chain reaction and liberate nuclear energy on a scale that really mattered.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|p=118}} }}

The news of the discovery of fission was brought to America by Bohr in January 1939.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John A. |last=Wheeler |author-link=John Archibald Wheeler |title=The Discovery of Fission – Mechanism of Fission |journal=Physics Today |volume=20 |issue=11 |pp=49–52 |date=1 November 1967 |doi=10.1063/1.3034021 |bibcode=1967PhT....20k..43F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John A.

Bohr had an epiphany that the fission at low energies was due to the [[uranium-235]] [[isotope]], while at high energies it was mainly due to the  more abundant [[uranium-238]] isotope.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; The former makes up just 0.7% of natural uranium; while that latter accounts for 99.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Begin/FrischPeierls.shtml |title=Frisch-Peierls Memorandum, March 1940 |publisher=Atomic Archive |date=21 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16 April, Bohr, Placzek, Wheeler, [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Leon Rosenfeld]] discussed whether it would be possible to use a [[nuclear chain reaction]] to make an [[atomic bomb]], and concluded that it was not. Bohr observed that  "It would take the entire efforts of a country to make a bomb."&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;

=== British response ===
In Britain, scientists also considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the [[University of Liverpool]], Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist [[Joseph Rotblat]] tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive.{{sfn|Farmelo|2013||pp=123–125}} At Cambridge, [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] laureates [[George Paget Thomson]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire [[uranium ore]] to keep it out of German hands. The Secretary of the [[Committee for Imperial Defence]], [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|Hastings Ismay]] asked Sir [[Henry Tizard]] for an opinion. Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=34–36}}

Even at such long odds, the danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously. It was not considered worthwhile to immediately acquire the uranium, but Tizard's [[Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence]] was directed to conduct research into the feasibility of atomic bombs.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=34–36}} Thomson, at [[Imperial College London]], and Oliphant, at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=37–39}}

== Memorandum ==
[[File:Poynting Physics building 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[John Henry Poynting|Poynting]] Physics building at the [[University of Birmingham]], where Peierls and Frisch wrote the Memorandum]]
As enemy aliens, at least until Peierls' [[naturalisation]] papers came through in February 1940,{{sfn|Clark|1961|p=50}} Frisch and Peierls were excluded from the most important–and secret–war work being done by Oliphant's team at Birmingham, that on radar.{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=442}} However, Oliphant would ask Peierls a theoretical question about, say, the solution to [[Maxwell's equations]] in a hemispheric cavity. Peierls knew that questions of this nature related to the work on [[microwave radar]], and Oliphant was doubtless aware of this too, but the façade of secrecy was maintained. The nuclear investigation was not yet secret, so Frisch was available to work on it. He began experimenting with [[uranium enrichment]] through [[Thermophoresis|thermal diffusion]], a process first demonstrated in Germany by [[Klaus Clusius]]. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=122–125}}

[[Francis Perrin]] had defined a [[critical mass]] of uranium to be the smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction, and had calculated the critical mass of uranium oxide (not metal) to be about {{convert|40|t}}. He reckoned that if a [[neutron reflector]] were placed around it of materials such as iron or lead which did not greatly impede fast neutrons, this might be reduced to {{convert|12|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrin|first=Francis|author-link=Francis Perrin|date=1 May 1939|title=Calcul relatif aux conditions éventuelles de transmutation en chaine de l'uranium|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6238836c/f28.item|journal=[[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences]]|language=French|volume=208|pages=|access-date=6 October 2017|via=|pp=1394–1396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peierls also attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He then calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium metal in a theoretical paper written in 1939.{{sfn|Clark|1961|pp=42–43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peierls |first=R. |date=November 1939 |title=Critical Conditions in Neutron Multiplication |journal=[[Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]] |issn=0305-0041 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pp=610–615 |doi=10.1017/S030500410002137X |bibcode=1939PCPS...35..610P }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later recalled that the size of the critical mass "was of the order of tons. It therefore appeared to me that the paper had no relevance to a nuclear weapon."{{sfn|Clark|1961|p=43}}

However, Bohr had argued that the uranium-235 isotope was far more likely to capture neutrons, so fissile even using neutrons of low energy. Frisch wondered what would happen if he were able to produce a sphere of pure uranium-235. When he used Peierls' formula to calculate this, he received a startling answer.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=125–126}} Peierls later observed that: {{quote|Any competent nuclear physicist would have come out with very similar answers to ours if he had been asked: "What is the likely fission cross-section of pure U235? What critical size for separated U235 follows from this? What will be the explosive power of such a mass? How much industrial effort would be needed to do the separation? And would the military value be worthwhile?" The only unusual thing that Frisch and I did at this point was ask those questions.{{sfn|Clark|1961|p=51}} }}

Realising the sensitive nature of the document, Peierls typed it himself. One carbon copy was made.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=154–155}}
Today the original is in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=444}}&lt;ref name="The Frisch-Peierls Memorandum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/e1c21196-d5a6-445e-8f33-18025d6024ff |title=The Frisch-Peierls Memorandum |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |access-date=22 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-technical ===
The memorandum was written in two parts. The first was an elegant and comprehensive outline of the implications of their calculations.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=154–155}} It included a proposal that the best defence against such a weapon would be to develop one before Germany did so. In a few short pages these two scientists anticipated the policies of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] which would shape [[Cold War]] [[geopolitics]]. The second was an explanation of the science supporting their conclusions.&lt;ref name="Memo" /&gt;  The memorandum opens with:
{{quote|text=The attached detailed report concerns the possibility of constructing a “super-bomb” which utilises the energy stored in atomic nuclei as a source of energy. The energy liberated in the explosion of such a super-bomb is about the same as that produced by the explosion of 1,000 tons of dynamite. This energy is liberated in a small volume, in which it will, for an instant, produce a temperature comparable to that in the interior of the sun. The blast from such an explosion would destroy life in a wide area. The size of this area is difficult to estimate, but it will probably cover the centre of a big city.

In addition, some part of the energy set free by the bomb goes to produce radioactive substances, and these will emit very powerful and dangerous radiations.  The effects of these radiations is greatest immediately after the explosion, but it decays only gradually and even for days after the explosion any person entering the affected area will be killed.

Some of this radioactivity will be carried along with the wind and will spread the contamination; several miles downwind this may kill people.&lt;ref name="Memo"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/history5n/FPmemo.pdf |title=The Frisch–Peierls Memorandum |access-date=21 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

=== Calculations ===
Peierls' starting point was a paper by Francis Perrin, in which he had derived [[critical mass]] calculations in terms of nuclear constants. The physicists considered a sphere, which has the minimum surface area for a given volume. A critical mass occurs when the number of neutrons produced equals the number that escape. Perrin assumed that the [[mean free path]] was much larger than the radius of the sphere. Peierls did not agree, and commenced his own calculations. A key insight came from Frisch, who wondered what would happen if, instead of natural uranium, someone gave you a sphere of the uranium-235 isotope,{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=153–154}} By definition, the mean free path is:
:&lt;math&gt;\ell = 1/\sigma n&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ℓ}} is the mean free path, {{mvar|n}} is the number of target particles per unit volume, and {{mvar|σ}} is the effective [[fission cross section]] area. Peierls did not perform the calculation, leaving this task to Frisch.{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=441}} The chemistry of uranium was not well known at the time, and Frisch believed that its density was {{convert|15|g/cm3}};{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=390}} the true value is more like {{convert|19|g/cm3}}.{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=443}} The fission cross section value was more problematic. For this, Frisch turned to a 1939 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] article by L. A. Goldstein, A. Rogozinski and R. J. Walen at the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Radium Institute]] in Paris, who gave a value of {{val|11.2|1.5|e=-24|u=cm2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. A. |last=Goldstein |first2=A. |last2=Rogozinski |first3=R. J. |last3=Walen |title=The Scattering by Uranium Nuclei of Fast Neutrons and the Possible Neutron Emission Resulting from Fission |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |issn=0028-0836 |volume=144 |issue=3639 |pp=201–202 |date=9 July 1939 |doi=10.1038/144201a0 |bibcode=1939Natur.144..201G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was too large by an [[order of magnitude]]; a modern value is about {{val|1.24|e=-24|u=cm2}}.{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=443}} Using the values he had, Frisch calculated the value of the mean free path for uranium-235 using [[Avogadro's constant]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\ell = 1 / (1 \times 10^{-23}\ cm^{2})(15\ g\ cm^{-3})(6 \times 10^{23}\ mol^{-1} / 235\ g\ mol^{-1}) = 235/90\ cm = 2.6\ cm &lt;/math&gt;

Peierls and Frisch claimed that the critical radius was about 0.8 times the mean free path.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=390}} From this, Frisch could calculate the volume of the sphere from the well-known equation:
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3  = \frac{4}{3}\pi (2.6 \times 0.8\ cm)^3 \approx 38\ cm^3&lt;/math&gt;

The mass then comes out to be:
:&lt;math&gt;38\ cm^3 \times 15 g\ cm^{-3} = 570\ g \approx 600\ g &lt;/math&gt;

Frisch and Peierls then considered the speed of a uranium fission chain reaction, exponential in nature, where "τ is the time required for the neutron density to multiply by a factor ''e''." It should be noted that the available data was very approximate, but their central point - that a bomb was possible using fast (~2MeV) neutrons - remains. [[Jeremy Bernstein]] remarked of this effort: "Let me make the same point by asking a somewhat different question but using the correct numbers. How much time does it take to fission a kilogram of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U using fast neutrons?"{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=444}} Using modern values he found that to be "equal to about a microsecond, which makes the point about the rapidity of fission with fact [sic] neutrons".{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=444}}

In the original memorandum, if the neutrons had velocities of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cm/s, then they would have an average time between fission collisions of {{val|2.6|e=-9|u=s}}. Therefore, Bernstein's time for a kilogram of uranium-235 to fission is found by solving:
:&lt;math&gt;1000 \times (6 \times 10^{23} /\ 235) = e ^ {t / \tau } &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|τ}} was the mean time for fission neutron density to increase by ''e''. Given the doubling-time
:&lt;math&gt;t^{1/2} = 2.6 \times 10^{-9} s&lt;/math&gt;
this implied a mean fission exponential folding time of
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = t^{1/2} / ln(2) \approx 4.0 \times 10^{-9}\ s&lt;/math&gt;

This led to a calculation of the energy released, which Peierls reckoned as approximately:
:&lt;math&gt; E = 0.2 M (r^2/\tau^2) (\sqrt {(r / r_0 )} - 1)  &lt;/math&gt;
where ''M'' is the mass of the sphere, ''r'' is the radius, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical mass radius.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=391}}

The conclusion drawn was that a few kilograms would explode with the energy of thousands of tons of dynamite.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=391}}

== Influence ==
The memorandum was given to Oliphant, who passed it on to Tizard  in his capacity as the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). He in turn passed them to Thomson, the chairman of the committee to which the CSSAW had delegated responsibility for uranium research.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=39–43, 407}} Thomson's committee was about to disband. It had studied nuclear reactions in uranium, and the use of [[graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]] in a [[nuclear reactor]], but its results had been negative, and it had concluded that the rate of capture of neutrons by the graphite was too great to make such a reactor a practical proposition. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum caused Thomson to reconsider.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=154–155}} After discussions between Cockcroft, Oliphant and Thomson, CSSAW created the [[MAUD Committee]] to investigate further.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=43–45}} As enemy aliens, Peierls and Frisch were initially excluded from its deliberations, but they were later added to its technical subcommittee.{{sfn|Peierls|1985|pp=154–155}}

The research from the MAUD committee was compiled in two reports, commonly known as the MAUD reports in July 1941. The first report, "Use of Uranium for a Bomb", discussed the feasibility of creating a super-bomb from uranium, which they now thought to be true.The second, "Use of Uranium as a Source of Power" discussed the idea of using uranium as a source of power, not just a bomb. The MAUD Committee and report helped bring about the British nuclear program, the Tube Alloys Project. Not only did it help start a nuclear project in Britain but it helped jump-start the American project. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the American program, the [[Manhattan Project]], would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=77–80}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://fissilematerials.org/library/maud.pdf|title=Report by the M.A.U.D. Committee on the use of Uranium for a bomb|publisher=International Panel on Fissile Materials |access-date=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Margaret Gowing]] noted that "events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history."{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=85}}

In August 1941, Oliphant was sent to the US to assist the Americans with microwave radar.{{sfn|Paul|2000|p=22}} He took the initiative to enlighten the scientific community there of the ground-breaking discoveries of the MAUD Committee. He travelled to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to meet with his friend [[Ernest Lawrence]], who soon caught his enthusiasm. Oliphant convinced the Americans to move forward with nuclear weapons, and his lobbying resulted in [[Vannevar Bush]] taking the report directly to the president.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=45–46}} [[Leo Szilard]] later wrote: "if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant would be the first to receive one."{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=372}}

The '''''Girgam''''' (or ''Diwan'') is the royal chronicle of the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]], written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Girgam is also used  as the name for written historical records in some kingdoms west of Bornu, including [[Daura]], [[Fika Emirate|Fika]] and [[Mandara Kingdom|Mandara]].

"A very meagre and incorrect abridgement" of the ''Girgam'' was provided by a local associated with the Sefuwa dynasty to the [[Germans|German]] traveller [[Heinrich Barth]] in 1851, in [[Kukawa]], the nineteenth century capital of Bornu&lt;ref&gt;Henry Barth 1857, ''Travels'', II, p. 253-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Barth 1857, ''Travels'', II, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;. Barth reported that a translation was published in 1852&lt;ref&gt;Blau 1852&lt;/ref&gt;

It provides the names of 69 rulers of Kanem-Bornu and some supplementary information concerning the length of their reigns, their ascendancy, and often some events of their reigns.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Bornu Sahara'', 89–95&lt;/ref&gt; The information given by several Arab authors ([[Ibn Said|Ibn Sa'īd]], [[al-Maqrizi|al-Maqrīzī]] and [[al-Qalqashandi|al-Qalqashandī]]) confirm the validity of the data provided by the Girgam.&lt;ref&gt;Levtzion/Hopkins, ''Corpus'', pp. 188, 347, 354-5.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of these sources, a nearly accurate chronology of the rulers of Kanem-Bornu can be established between the tenth and the nineteenth centuries. Since the fall of the [[Sefuwa dynasty]] in 1846, "the new dynasty of the Kánemíyín [Kānemī] endeavours to obliterate as much as possible the memory of the old Kanúri [Sefuwa] dynasty, and has assiduously destroyed all its records wherever they could be laid hold of."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Barth 1957, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;. The two copies of the chronicle obtained by Barth are the only ones that are known to have survived [citation needed].

'''GuidePal''' is a [[mobile apps|mobile]] and [[web-based application]] that provides city guides via [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Described as a "mobile travel and city discovery companion", their city guide app currently covers 57 destinations and can be accessed for free.&lt;ref&gt;GuidePal's guides,"[http://guidepal.com/GuidepalGuides.aspx]"&lt;/ref&gt;

GuidePal was founded in 2009. The company's head office is based in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]],

==Overview==
GuidePal’s city guides are created by collaboration between locals and travel journalists. In the guides, GuidePal aims to offer an unbiased selection of each city’s highlights, with all tips, and advice, curated by experts actually living in the city.&lt;ref&gt;GuidePal info page, "[http://www.guidepal.com/#!/about]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Users can build their own personalised guides, create itineraries, invite friends and share tips with them, and book restaurants, hotels, tours, event tickets, and so on. The guides and maps can be made available offline.

The guides are written in English.

The content is broadly divided into seven sections: More About the City, Essentials, See &amp; Do, Eat, Shop, Party, Stay. Subcategories include: Transportation, Airports and Useful Tips.

In March 2012, GuidePal released its first multi-destination app for iPhone. Three months later, the [[iPad]] version was released and achieved a "New and Noteworthy" status in the App Store. Since then, the company has also released a completely revamped multi-city app for [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;GuidePal raises the bar in the travel guide industry"[http://guidepal.blob.core.windows.net/media/mediafile79704.pdf]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile travel==
The mobile travel market has seen a lot of new entrants in recent years with a clear "mobile first" product approach. This means that the core product and service offering are [[Mobile apps]] for [[smartphone]] and [[tablet computer]]. In contrast to (incumbent) companies that start on the web and add auxiliary mobile web or app products to expand their reach.

While mobile travel is a crowded space with new companies entering the market every month, only a few young companies have managed to reach a meaningful size of a million users. Among those companies are: GuidePal, [[Ulmon]], [[Triposo]], Pocket Guide.

{{American socialism|Modern parties}}
The '''International Socialist Organization''' (ISO) is a socialist organization in the [[United States]] that identifies with [[Trotskyism]], [[Leninism]] and the [[Marxist]] political tradition of "[[socialism from below]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hal Draper: ''[http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm The Two Souls of Socialism]'', 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
The ISO advocates replacing the [[capitalist]] system with [[socialism]], a system in which society's collective wealth and resources would be democratically controlled to meet human need by those who produce that wealth, i.e. the [[working class]]. The organization specifically argues that this working-class majority can end capitalism by leveraging their power over [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|production]] through mass strikes, and that the creation of a revolutionary workers' party is necessary in coordinating and building the power of such a movement."&lt;ref name=&gt;[http://www.internationalsocialist.org/building-a-revolutionary-socialist-alternative Building a Revolutionary Socialist Alternative], InternationalSocialists.org&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO supports struggles for economic, political, and social reforms while also maintaining that exploitation, oppression, war, and environmental destruction cannot be eliminated until capitalism is overthrown and replaced with socialism.&lt;ref name="SW"&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/where-we-stand Where We Stand], SocialistWorker.org&lt;/ref&gt; Because capitalism is a global system, the ISO argues that capitalism cannot be successfully overthrown in individual countries. The ISO holds that the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] as well as [[China]] and [[Cuba]] are examples of bureaucratic, class-stratified states, not socialist societies.

== History ==
The ISO originated in 1976 among a number of groups in the American [[International Socialists (US)|International Socialists]] (IS) that were growing increasingly critical of the organization's leadership. Among them was the self-identified Left Faction, which was led by Cal and Barbara Winslow and supported by the IS's [[International Socialists (Canada)|Canadian]] and [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|British]] members. The Left Faction and its international supporters maintained that the IS's leadership had acquired a top-down style of operating that depoliticized the organization and placed too much emphasis on sending student activists into working class employment (a tactic referred to as "industrialization"). These disputes followed the disagreements over the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 revolution in Portugal]]. Additionally, the main part of IS thought that there should be attention to rank and file or reform caucuses in unions, ISO has said (to this day, the ISO is largely a campus-bases group although in recent years they have made some inroads into the union movement), whereas the Left Faction contended that in addition to rank and file work, agitation at the workplace for socialism should continue.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Sustar, "Toward a renewal of the labor movement", "International Socialist Review" No. 89, July 2013 http://isreview.org/issue/89/toward-renewal-labor-movement&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the Left Faction was expelled from the IS and immediately formed the International Socialist Organization.&lt;ref name="Fisk"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.marxists.de/trotism/fisk/ch7.htm|title=Socialism From Below in the US: Origins of the ISO|first=Milton|last=Fisk|year=1977|publisher=Hera Press|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO began publication of its paper, ''Socialist Worker'', shortly after its formation and continues to produce a monthly print version as well as a daily updated website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating our 500th|url=http://www.socialistworker.org/2004-2/500Supp/500Supp_Celebrating.shtml|publisher=''Socialist Worker''|date=2002-02-01|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the political theories adopted by the ISO had been developed in the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|British Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), including that of "[[state capitalism]]" developed though not originated by [[Tony Cliff]], the party's founder. State capitalist theory identifies the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc as exploitative class societies driven by military competition with private Western capitalism, rather than as the "[[deformed workers' states]]" that Trotsky maintained they were in ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]''.&lt;ref name="Cliff"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1955/statecap/index.htm|title=State Capitalism in Russia|first=Tony|last=Cliff|year=1974|publisher=Bookmarks|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the ISO was expelled from the [[International Socialist Tendency]] (IST) after a dispute with the British SWP. This dispute was framed by the SWP as a critique of the ISO's conservative approach to the anti-corporate/anti-capitalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Crawford, [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext19/Ted.html "Split in the IST"], ''What Next?'', No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO disputed this claim and criticized the SWP for maintaining what the ISO viewed as an exaggerated perspective for the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext19/Iso.html "The ISO (US) and the International Socialist Tendency"], ''What Next?'', No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2012-2-12)&lt;/ref&gt; which the SWP characterized as "the 1930s in slow motion".&lt;ref&gt;SWP Central committee, [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext19/Swp.html "Statement on Relations Between the SWP (GB) and the ISO (US)"], ''What Next?'', No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, nine members of the ISO, mostly in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Boston]], announced the formation of the ISO Renewal Faction,&lt;ref&gt;ISO Renewal Faction, [http://externalbulletin.wordpress.com/2013/11/26/announcement-of-the-iso-renewal-faction/ "Announcement of the ISO Renewal Faction"] (accessed 2014-02-02)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the organization's first national-level faction fight since the dispute with the British SWP. The faction claimed that the ISO was going through an organizational and political crisis&lt;ref&gt;ISO Renewal Faction, [http://externalbulletin.wordpress.com/2013/11/26/the-organizational-crisis/ "The organizational crisis and its political roots"] (accessed 2014-02-02)&lt;/ref&gt; and that members critical of the leadership had been "bureaucratically excluded".&lt;ref&gt;ISO Renewal Faction, [http://externalbulletin.wordpress.com/2013/11/26/in-defense-of-our-comrades/ "In defense of our comrades"] (accessed 2014-02-02)&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO leadership denied these claims, stating that "the ISO is more experienced and more engaged than ever".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Ruder and Alan Maass [http://socialistworker.org/2013/11/20/the-challenges-facing-socialists "The challenges facing socialists today"], SocialistWorker.org, 2013-11-20 (accessed 2014-02-02)&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, 2014, the ISO expelled the Renewal Faction.&lt;ref&gt;ISO Renewal Faction, [http://externalbulletin.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/we-are-expelled/ "We are Expelled"] (accessed 2014-02-22)&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, the organization's student branch at [[Brown University]] resigned, citing the expulsion of the faction as an indication that the organization had "shown itself to be undemocratic."&lt;ref&gt;http://risocialism.org/?p=435&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy and criticism ===
In a 2013 ''[[CounterPunch]]'''s article, the magazine's editor [[Jeffrey St. Clair]] wrote that ISO is becoming less socialist in membership and identification and opined that they are more concerned with "lash[ing] out at nearly every popular uprising of the last 50 years for being doctrinally impure, from the Cuban Revolution to the Zapatistas, from the street protests at the WTO to the Bolivaran Revolution".&lt;ref name=StClair&gt;[https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/05/31/the-shame-merchants/ ''The Merchants of Shame''], Counterpunch, 31 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
The ISO publishes a daily online and monthly print newspaper, ''[[Socialist Worker]]'',  with a bi-monthly Spanish language supplement, ''Obrero Socialista''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2008-1/663/663_05_NewEra.shtml "A new era for ''Socialist Worker''"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO also distributes the ''International Socialist Review'' and titles from the publishing house [[Haymarket Books]], both of which are run by the non-profit Center for Economic Research and Social Change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsd.com/pubdetail.aspx?id=330 Consortium Book Sales &amp; Distribution | Publisher Information]. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electoral actions ==
The ISO participates in several local and national progressive movements. These include the antiwar movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campusantiwar.net/news/counter-recruitment/sf_state_students_hold_rally_counter_marine_recruiters.html "SF State Students Hold Rally, Counter Marine Recruiters"], October 26, 2006, Campus Antiwar Network website.(accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt; efforts to end the death penalty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodeathpenalty.org/newab020/protest.html "Protesting Bush's Execution Machine"], ''The New Abolitionist'', Issue 20, July 2001. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt; support for gay marriage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews37_45/page5.cfm] "SGN Exclusive Interview: Sherry Wolf speaks on the National March"], ''Seattle Gay News'', Volume 37 Issue 45, 6 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2012/01/before_mayor_mikes_meeting_wit.php "Before Mayor Mike's Meeting With LGBT Leaders, A Rally Outside City Hall Last Night"], ''Dallas Observer'', 28 January 2012 (accessed 2012-2-12)&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion rights&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2009/02/09/activists-defend-madison-clinic "Activists defend Madison clinic"], ''Socialist Worker'', Issue 690, 9 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[2006 U.S. immigration reform protests|struggle for immigration rights]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/iso/history.html "Barnard/Columbia International Socialist Organization History"] Last update 19 March 2007, visited 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

The ISO does not support the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], both of which it views as political representatives of corporate power. However, the group has campaigned for the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] in various races and assisted [[Ralph Nader]]'s presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialism.com/drupal-6.8/?q=node/600 "The Green Party: offering a real challenge to business as usual, or just Capitalism Lite?"], ''Freedom Socialist'', Volume 27, Issue 6, December 2006 - January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In California, ISO member [[Todd Chretien]] challenged [[Dianne Feinstein]] for a seat in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on the Green Party ticket, receiving 139,425 votes (1.8 percent) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;California Secretary of State, [http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/ssov/us_sen_sum.pdf Supplement to Statement of Vote - United States Senator - Statewide Summary"], ''Statement of Vote, 2006 General Election'', at www.sos.ca.gov website. (accessed 2008-06-26), [http://www.smartvoter.org/2006/06/06/ca/state/race/usseng/ "United States Senator; Green Party Election Information June 6, 2006 Election"], at www.smartvoter.org website. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the ISO endorsed the candidacy of [[Socialist Alternative (United States)|Socialist Alternative]]'s [[Kshama Sawant]] in the [[Seattle City Council]] election.&lt;ref&gt;http://socialistworker.org/2013/10/31/socialist-seattle-city-council&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socialism conference ==
The ISO is the co-sponsor, along with the Center for Economic Research and Social Change, of an annual conference titled Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialismconference.org/ SocialismConference.org website].&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers at past Socialism conferences include filmmaker and author [[Tariq Ali]], actor [[Wallace Shawn]], ''[[The Nation]]'' sportswriter [[Dave Zirin]], writer [[Glenn Greenwald]], journalist [[Amy Goodman]], professor [[Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor]], environmental writer [[John Bellamy Foster]], ''The Nation'' contributor [[Jeremy Scahill]], Iraq Veterans Against the War member [[Camilo Mejía]], Palestinian rights activists [[Omar Barghouti]] and [[Ali Abunimah]] and actor [[John Cusack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2010/06/22/ideas-for-changing-the-world “Ideas for changing the world”], SocialistWorker.org, 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2008/06/24/socialism-offers-alternative “Socialism offers the alternative”], SocialistWorker.org, 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Gall''' (September 18, 1925 - December 15, 2014) was an American author and retired [[pediatrician]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandra L. Bloom, Brian Farragher (2010) ''Destroying Sanctuary: The Crisis in Human Service Delivery Systems''. p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Gall is known for his 1975 book ''[[Systemantics|General systemantics: an essay on how systems work, and especially how they fail...]]'', a critique of [[systems theory]]. One of the statements from this book has become known as [[John_Gall_(author)#Gall.27s_law|Gall's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John C. Gall Obituary|url=http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/annarbor/obituary.aspx?pid=173778701|publisher=Ann Arbor News|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Gall started his studies in [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis, Maryland. He received further medical training at [[George Washington University Medical School]] in Washington, and [[Yale College]]. Eventually early 1960s he took his pediatric training at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Rochester, Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Goodenough, Andrea Immel (2008) ''Under Fire: Childhood in the Shadow of War''. p.233&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s Gall started as a practicing pediatrician in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and became part of the faculty of the [[University of Michigan]]. In 2001 he retired after more than forty years of private practice. In the first decades of his practice he had also "conducted weekly seminars in Parenting Strategies for parents, prospective parents, medical students, nursing students, and other health care practitioners."&lt;ref name="JG 07"&gt;John Gall (2007) ''Higher Level Parenting, About the author'' on generalsystemantics.com. Retrieved November 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2001 he held the position of Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Michigan. Since 1958 he has been Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

After he retired, Gall and his wife Carol A. Gall moved to [[Walker, Minnesota]], where he continued writing and published seven more titles.
He died in December 2014.

== Work ==
Gall's main research interest was the behavioral and developmental problems of children, on which subject he published several scientific papers and some books. As a sideline he conducted more general research on the question, what makes systems work and fail.&lt;ref&gt;''Production and inventory management''. Vol 19–20 (1978). p.47&lt;/ref&gt; He collected and analyzed all kinds of examples of systems-failures, and generalized problems and pitfalls into a series of "Laws of Systems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draftymanor.com/bart/systems1.htm Systemantics: background] by Bart Stevens. Retrieved November 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Gall also published a historical novel on [[Hatshepsut]], queen of ancient Egypt in the Eighteenth Dynasty. This interest arose from a trip John Gall had made to Egypt in 1969.

=== Systemantics ===
{{main|Systemantics}}
In 1975 he published his systems research under the title ''General systemantics'', republished two years later as ''Systemantics: How Systems Work and Especially How They Fail'' by Quadrangle, The New York Times Book Company. This work has been translated into Spanish, German, Hebrew, and Japanese.

In 1986 the second edition was published with the title ''Systemantics: The Underground Text of Systems Lore.'', which was almost twice the size of the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://generalsystemantics.com/Systemantics.htm SYSTEMANTICS™ The Underground Text of Systems Lore] at generalsystemantics.com, 2001. Retrieved November 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he published a third edition under the title ''The Systems Bible''. This work inspired many authors in the systems movement, such as scientists as [[Mario Bunge]] ( 1979), [[Paul Watzlawick]] (1990), [[Russell L. Ackoff]] (1999) and systems designers as [[Ken Orr]] (1981) and [[Grady Booch]] (1991);&lt;ref&gt;The authors listed have mentioned the book as a reference in their work.&lt;/ref&gt; and many author beyond that scene.

=== Gall's law ===
Gall's Law is a [[rule of thumb]] for [[systems design]] from Gall's book ''Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail''. It states:

:''A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.'' – John Gall (1975, p.71)

This law is essentially an argument in favour of underspecification: it can be used to explain the success of systems like the [[World Wide Web]] and [[Blogosphere]], which grew from simple to complex systems incrementally, and the failure of systems like [[CORBA]], which began with complex specifications. Gall's Law has strong affinities to the practice of [[agile software development]].&lt;ref&gt;Russel Winder, Graham Roberts (2006) ''Developing Java software''. p.427&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dubbed ''Gall's Law'' by some, the phrase is not labeled as such in the original work. The work cites [[Murphy's Law]] and the [[Peter Principle]], and is filled with similar sayings.

Although the quote may seem to validate the merits of simple systems,{{cn|date=February 2016}} it is preceded by the qualifier "A simple system may or may not work." (p.&amp;nbsp;70). This philosophy can also be attributed to [[extreme programming]], which encourages doing the simplest thing first and adding features later.

One of the first systems designers to quote Gall's law was Ken Orr in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Orr (1981) ''Structured requirements definition''&lt;/ref&gt; Notable were the quotations of Gall's Law by [[Grady Booch]] since 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[[Grady Booch]] (1991) ''Object oriented design with applications'' p.11. and 1994, 1997, 2007, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which were mentioned in multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Graham (1995) ''Migrating to object technology''. p.144 mentions: "Booch (1994) quotes Gall on this subject: 'A complex system that works ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The C++ report'' (1999) Vol. 11, p. 57 states: "To emphasize this point, Booch ' quotes Gall2: A complex system that works..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Pezziardi (2006) ''Une politique pour le système d'information''. p.126 states in French: "John Gall en 2006 repris en 1994 par Grady Booch – un des pères de l'objet – indiquaient : « A complex system that works...&lt;/ref&gt;

Systemantics (a change in typography and underlining indicate that the title is better rendered as "SystemANTICS") is a commentary on systems theory and general semantics publications by such thinkers as [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] and [[Alfred Korzybski]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">'''The Lisle Papers''' are the correspondence received in Calais between 1533 and 1540 by [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]] (c.1480-1542), [[Lord Deputy of Calais]], an illegitimate son of [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] and an uncle of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], and by his wife, [[Honor Plantagenet, Viscountess Lisle]] (born Honor Grenville and formerly the wife of [[Sir John Bassett]] (d.1529) of [[Umberleigh]] in Devon), from several servants, [[courtier]]s, royal officials, friends, children and other relatives. They are an important source of information on domestic life in the Tudor age and of life at the court of Henry VIII.

Although long available as transcriptions in the [[Letters and Papers of Henry VIII]], they were first published as an annotated collection in 1981 as a six-volume edition, titled "The Lisle Letters", and an abridged selection in one volume was published in 1983, both edited by Muriel St Clare Byrne. 

==Description==
The entire collection, now housed within the State Papers of the United Kingdom at the [[National Archives]] at Kew, comprises about 3,000 documents, ranging in date from 1 January 1533 to 31 December 1540. During this time Lord Lisle was based at Calais whilst performing his office of [[Governor of Calais|Lord Deputy of Calais]]. The correspondence is between Lord and Lady Lisle and their  family, acquaintances at court, retainers, and servants. The main correspondent was [[John Husee]], Lord Lisle's London agent.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives catalogue entry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical location==
Following Lisle's arrest for alleged treason in 1540, as was usual in such cases, all his papers in the Staple Inn in Calais, his official residence, were confiscated and placed in the [[Tower of London]]. It is one of only three such collections to have survived, and it's the only one still largely intact and not amalgamated with similar documents, the others being the papers of [[Thomas Cromwell]] (State Papers, Henry VIII, SP 1) and the small collection of Lord Darcy's papers.&lt;ref&gt;Elton&lt;/ref&gt;  A few further documents from the correspondence of the Lisles survived outside the collection originally deposited in the Tower and are contained in the Cotton, Harleian and Royal Manuscripts in the [[British Library]]. Some also were transferred to the Thomas Cromwell collection. The papers deposited in the Tower were subsequently transferred to the [[Chapter House]] of [[Westminster Abbey]], in the category "Treasury of the Receipt of the Exchequer", and remained there until 1832 when the [[Home Office]] ordered their removal to the care of the State Paper Commission at the State Paper Office, amalgamated with the [[Public Record Office]] in 1852, which was recently re-founded as the [[National Archives]]. &lt;ref&gt;National Archives catalogue description[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=3&amp;CATID=12389&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;SearchType=6&amp;CATREF=SP+3]&lt;/ref&gt; They are held today at the National Archives in the category "State Papers Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, SP3, Lisle Papers"

==Editions==
Summaries of The Lisle Letters were published between 1862 and 1930 scattered within the 33 volumes of the "Calendar of Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of Henry VIII"&lt;ref&gt;Slavin&lt;/ref&gt; edited by J. S. Brewer, J. Gairdner and R H Brodie (London 1862-1930). In the early 1930s, [[Muriel St. Clare Byrne]], then a young student of Tudor England, started an exhaustive study of the approximately 3,000 original documents then at the [[Public Record Office]] comprising the Lisle Papers. Her work in transcribing, annotating and arranging the letters lasted several decades and was not published until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Elton&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions have been published as follows:
*Byrne, Muriel St. Clare (Ed.), The Lisle Letters, 6 Vols., University of Chicago Press, 1981, {{ISBN|9780226088013}}. (Transcripts of 1,677 documents).

== Plot ==

While making popcorn, Kenny is called by an unknown person, who flirts with him. The conversation turns disturbing, and ends when a man wearing a hood and face paint breaks into Kenny's house, and rapes him. The next day, Kenny's friends discuss what happened to him, revealing that he was so traumatized from being sexually assaulted that he has suffered a mental breakdown. Investigating the attack is Deputy Derek, who questions Kenny's friends, all of whom have reasonable alibis. Derek then has sex with Ricky, and afterward Ricky mentions that Kenny had recently dumped Stuart.

After Derek leaves, dismissing a nosy reporter on his way out, Sam chats with Tom, and brings up Chris, his boyfriend who had been raped and murdered almost a year ago, supposedly by a man named Steve Warner. Sam goes home, and after masturbating he is taunted over the phone by Kenny's rapist, who then attacks him. Sam fights off his assailant, and accuses Brian of being him, as he showed up right after the attack, cellular phone in hand. Brian is arrested by Derek, but is released the next day, due to a lack of evidence, and Sam getting another call from the rapist.

Despite all that has happened, everyone attends a party being held at Stuart's house. Tom goes to get beer and light bulbs out of the garage, where he is confronted by and has sex with the rapist, who drowns him in a [[hot tub]] afterward. Ricky goes to look for Tom, and is locked in the garage by the rapist, revealed to be Brian, who is working with Stuart. Brian murdered Chris and framed his boyfriend Steve for it because Chris and Steve were having an affair, and now he and Stuart are going to kill Sam, after forcing him to participate in a threesome, as "no porno is complete without a good threeway". When the trio ejaculates, Derek and the reporter enter, and arrest Brian and Stuart, the reporter having recorded the two bragging about their crimes from outside.

== Cast ==

* [[Chad Donovan]] as Stuart
* Tommy Lord as Kenny Beeker
* Ethan Marc as Brian
* [[Blake Harper]] as Sam
* Jason Branch as Tom
* Doug Jeffries as Ricky
* Tom Southern as Deputy Derek
* Paul Dawson as Gary

== Reception ==

Jeremy Spencer of ''[[AVN (magazine)|GayVN]]'' gave ''Moan'' a 3½ out of 5, criticizing the editing and direction, but still calling it "a fast-paced sexual romp that is both hysterical and creepy" with a cast composed of "powerhouse sexual performers and some decent actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gay.avn.com/movies/26496.html|title = ''Moan''|last = Spencer|first = Jeremy|publisher = ''GayVN''|date = 1 November 1999|website = gay.avn.com|accessdate = 26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A score of 3/4 was given to the film by the Gay Erotic Video Index, which wrote, "It's a funny, [[Camp (style)|campy]] spoof that is loaded with hot sex, over-the-top performances and a spattering of technical [[Military slang#SNAFU|snafus]]".&lt;ref name = "Index"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gayeroticvideoindex.com/V/1/13701.html|title = ''Moan'' 1|last = |first = |publisher = Gay Erotic Video Index|date = |website = gayeroticvideoindex.com|accessdate = 26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won Best Sex Comedy at the 2000 [[GayVN Awards]].&lt;ref name = "Index"/&gt;

'''Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing''' ('''NEO CANDO''') is an [[online database]] built and managed by the [http://povertycenter.case.edu Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development], under the direction of Co-director [http://www2.urban.org/nnip/desc_cle.html#cle_bio Claudia Coulton] at the [[Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  The database was started in 1988 as CANDO and now houses data for a 17-county region centering on the [[Greater Cleveland]], and the [[Cuyahoga County]] area in [[Northeast Ohio]]. This data is varied in its completeness for geographies, but contains crime data for the City of [[Cleveland]], [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamp]] and [[TANF]] usage counts, social indicators, [[economic indicators]], and a restricted-use section for properties in the [[foreclosure]], [[sheriff's sale]] and [[Real Estate Owned]] (REO) process. These data are used by [[neighborhood association]]s, [[Non-profit organization]]s, [[governmental agencies]] such as the [http://planning.co.cuyahoga.oh.us/index.html Cuyahoga County Planning Commission], and [[Community Development Corporation]]s such as [[Slavic Village Development]], to plan activities, or to improve neighborhoods, or to propose social programing, and to combat the advance of [[urban decay]] accelerated by the [[2010 United States foreclosure crisis]].

Its use to combat the negative effects of the foreclosure crisis, has been noted and supported as a national model at conferences, such as the national [http://reclaimingvacantproperties.org/  Reclaiming Vacant Properties] Conference and in several reports, such as [http://www.clevelandfed.org/forefront/2010/09/ff_2010_fall_04.cfm Forefront], a publication of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland]], and [http://www.clevelandfed.org/Community_Development/publications/REO/ REO &amp; Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization] which is a joint publication of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland and the Board of Governors. [http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/capapers/cuyahoga_county_foreclosures.pdf] [http://blog.case.edu/msass/2010/06/30/new_report_from_cwru_csu_the_federal_reserve_bank_of_cleveland_documents_foreclosure_crisis_and_community_responses_in_greater_cleveland.html][http://blog.case.edu/msass/2010/06/09/neocando_partner_pitts_interactive_database_of_neighborhood_conditions_and_stats_gaining_traction_in_revitalizing_pittsburgh.html][https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/housingpolicy-org-out-loud/id305912629]

The Center is a member of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107095236/http://www2.urban.org/nnip/ National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership] (NNIP), a nationwide partnership of [http://www2.urban.org/nnip/affiliates.html 34 similar organizations], an initiative of the [[Urban Institute]].  The mission of the partnership is to democratize social, economic, and other indicator data down to the neighborhoods level for use by local governments and other agencies operating locally.

The [http://povertycenter.case.edu Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development] (CUPCD) is based in a university context as part of the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. The Mandel School strongly emphasizes direct work with local citywide and community institutions to address the opportunities and problems of poor neighborhoods. The CUPCD mission is "to create, communicate, and apply knowledge of value to a broad range of audiences and constituents concerned with the ultimate goal of reducing urban poverty and its consequences. . . . The Center serves as a pathway between the university, and the community, linking social science to social change."

CUPCD Director Claudia Coulton began assembling [[neighborhood]]-level data soon after the Center was founded. In 1990, the Center issued a full report on trends in Cleveland's neighborhoods over the preceding two decades-a report used as the primary basis for the formation of the [ Arthur Naparstek | Cleveland Foundation Commission on Poverty] which was the foundation for "The Cleveland Community-Building Initiative" report (c.f. [[History of Cleveland]]). That study became the foundation for the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s Urban Revitalization Demonstration Act of 1993, known as [[HOPE VI]]. As this and other reports were more widely disseminated, the Center began to receive more requests for data assistance. In response to this demand, the staff developed the original CAN DO system.

In its current form, NEO CANDO contains neighborhood-level information from the 1990 census and from a variety of administrative data files (information, for the most part, for every year since 1980). Administrative data series go back to 1979 and are now updated annually. System data are made available through a user-friendly, menu-driven, online database network. The data can be accessed via the Internet through the Center's website at http://neocando.case.edu. It can also be mapped and downloaded for a user's additional analysis. Community groups can thus access and use the database directly. Center staff provide training and technical assistance to help them use it effectively in planning and program development.

'''One Art World''' is an online service provider for the international [[art]] market with headquarters in [[New York City]]. Prior to July 2009, One Art World was known as chelseaartgalleries.com.

==Business model==
One Art World is an information platform for the international [[fine art]] market.&lt;ref name=winkleman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwardwinkleman.blogspot.com/2006/10/site-of-record.html |title=The Site of Record |publisher=Edwardwinkleman.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwardwinkleman.blogspot.com/2009/07/new-new-york-or-digital-center.html |title=eThe New New York (Or, the Digital Center?) |publisher=Edwardwinkleman.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides services allowing its users to search and view artist, [[art gallery|gallery]] and [[art exhibition|exhibition]] profiles, and to attain auction price data, giving them an effective overview of the art market and enabling them to contact art galleries.

* information on contemporary art auction results

One Art World maintains its own proprietary databases of the information underlying the above services. The exhibition and inventory databases are maintained by the galleries using self-service interfaces (The Exhibition Manager and The Inventory Manager respectively).

Though this business lists artworks for sale, it does not engage in [[art dealer|art dealing]], but merely serves as a conduit between the art collector and the art dealer.

===2009===
In July 2009, chelseaartgalleries.com changed name to One Art World and expanded to include worldwide coverage of galleries and artists.

==Clients==
One Art World’s clients include private collectors, galleries, appraisers, museums, auctioneers, art educators, artists, and art students.

{{Family law|marriage}}

A '''prenuptial agreement''', '''antenuptial agreement''', or '''premarital agreement''', commonly abbreviated as '''prenup''', is a [[contract]] entered into prior to [[marriage]], [[civil union]], or any agreement prior to the main agreement by the people intending to marry or contract with each other.  The content of a prenuptial agreement can vary widely, but commonly includes provisions for [[division of property]] and [[alimony|spousal support]] in the event of [[divorce]] or breakup of marriage. They may also include terms for the forfeiture of assets as a result of divorce on the grounds of [[adultery]]; further conditions of guardianship may be included as well. It should not be confused with the historic [[marriage settlement]] which was concerned not primarily with the effects of divorce but with the establishment and maintenance of dynastic families.

In some countries, including [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], the prenuptial agreement not only provides for the event of a divorce, but also to protect some property during the marriage, for instance in case of a bankruptcy. Many countries, including [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Germany]], have [[matrimonial regime]]s, in addition to, or some cases, in lieu of prenuptial agreements.

[[Postnuptial agreement]]s are similar to prenuptial agreements, except that they are entered into after a couple is married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quit fighting -- get a postnuptial agreement|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/personal/04/02/postnuptial.agreement/index.html|work=CNN LifeWire|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=18 June 2012|author=Robert DiGiacomo|date=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically (and sometimes still today) prenuptial agreements were called '''marriage contracts'''. Marriage itself is often viewed as a contract.

==Legal recognition==
Laws vary between both states and countries in both how to draft them and in whether they will enforce such agreements.

===Africa===
====South Africa====
{{main|Marriage in South Africa#Financial consequences|l1=Marriage in South Africa: Financial consequences}}
In South Africa, a civil marriage or civil union is, by default, a marriage in '''[[community of property]]'''. In order to marry '''out of community of property''', the parties must sign an antenuptial contract in the presence of a [[notary public]] prior to their marriage and the contract must be registered in the Deeds Office within three months from the date of signature of the contract.

When marrying out of community, the parties have a choice to marry ''with application of the accrual system'' or '''without application of the accrual system'''.

In the event that the parties marry '''without accrual''', the spouses’ respective estates would always remain separate and neither party will have any proprietary claim against the other by virtue of the marriage.

If the parties marry '''with application of the accrual''', their respective estates would remain separate during the subsistence of the marriage. Upon dissolution of the marriage, whether by death or divorce, the spouse with the lesser accrual would have a claim against the spouse with the larger accrual for half the difference between their accrual values.

====Asia====
=====India=====
In [[India]], prenuptial agreements are very rare and do not have any governing laws. However, with rising divorce rates people are showing increasing interest in them. Some lawyers are of the opinion that prenups don't have legal sanctity in India. However, some form of contract is signed in some cases, usually among affluent citizens. But, the agreements need to be reasonable and not violate pre-existing laws like the [[Hindu Marriage Act]]. Indian courts allow a memorandum of settlement to be signed during divorces. But, no court has yet been asked to enforce a prenup.&lt;ref name=legallybound&gt;{{cite news|title=Legally bound: Pre-nuptial agreements have no legal sanctity in India yet a few rich and affluent insist on signing them|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/legally-bound-112072100025_1.html|accessdate=5 November 2013|newspaper=[[Business Standard]]|date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These agreements may come under the [[Indian Contract Act 1872]]. The Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act states that agreements are to be considered contracts if they are made by the free consent of the parties.&lt;ref name=ICA10&gt;{{cite act|title=Indian Contract Act|article=10|number=9|date=1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Section 23 of the same act states that a contract may be void if they are immoral or against public policy.&lt;ref name=ICA23&gt;{{cite act|title=Indian Contract Act|article=23|number=9|date=1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goa]] is the only Indian state where a prenuptial is legally enforceable, as it follows the [[Portuguese Civil Code]], 1867. A prenuptial agreement may be signed between the two parties at the time of marriage, stating the regime of ownership. If a prenuptial has not been signed, then the marital property is simply divided equally between the husband and wife.&lt;ref name=IDoWant&gt;{{cite news|title=I do — and I want|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1151125/jsp/opinion/story_54807.jsp#.VmaWcV5R2D4|accessdate=8 December 2015|work=[[The Telegraph (India)]]|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GoaMarriage&gt;{{cite news|title=Why marriages are made in Goa|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-why-marriages-are-made-in-goa-1154015|accessdate=8 December 2015|work=[[DNA India]]|date=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Thailand=====
The prenuptial agreement in Thailand sign on the basis of mutual consent of the man and woman, which want to get married. Under Thai law, a prenuptial agreement is recognized by the Commercial and Civil Code of Thailand. A valid and enforceable [http://www.isaanlawyers.com/prenuptial-agreement/ Thai prenuptial agreement] requires by Law where: 
* the content of the prenuptial made in Thailand cannot be against the law or good morals;
* both the prospective husband and wife must understand the content of the prenuptial;
* the prenuptial in Thailand must be made before the marriage, a contract between husband and wife concerning personal and jointly owned property made after the marriage registration (post-nuptial) is void;
* both the future husband and wife must sign the prenuptial in the presence of at least 2 witnesses and the agreement must be entered into the Marriage Register together with the marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thailandlawonline.com/article-older-archive/mariage-contract-prenuptial-in-thailand|title=Marriage Contract Prenuptial in Thailand {{!}} Article (older) Archive|website=www.thailandlawonline.com|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These conditions are found at clause 1466 of the Commercial and Civil Code of Thailand.&lt;br&gt;
In accordance with the laws on Thai marriage, the prenuptial agreement mainly relates to assets and financial implications of marriage and establishes conditions of ownership and management of personal and concrete joint property and potential division of marital assets, if the marriage will be dissolved. The prenuptial agreement also includes a list of each side's personal assets at the time of the marriage and guarantees, that debts and property before the marriage remain in possession of the initial owner or debtor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Personal property includes:
*property owned by spouses before the marriage;
*property for personal use — work instruments, clothes, etc.;
*gifts from third parties or property received through the testament (if it is not indicated in testament, that property should transfer to joint property of spouses);
*“khongman” — real estate transmitted to the bride as a dowry (during the engagement ceremony).
Joint property includes:
*property acquired at the time of the marriage;
*property received by one of the spouses at the time of the marriage as a gift, if in the document attached to a gift or in the document compiled by spouse this property was declared as joint (Martial Assets);
*income acquired from personal property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.siam-legal.com/thai-law/civil-and-commercial-code-marriage-section-1465-1493/|title=Civil and Commercial Code: Marriage (Section 1465-1493) {{!}} Thailand Law Library|publisher=library.siam-legal.com|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
[[File:Jan Josef Horemans (II) - The Marriage Contract - 1768.jpg|thumb|190px|''The Marriage Contract'' by Flemish artist [[Jan Josef Horemans the Younger]] c. 1768]]
Prenuptial agreements have long been recognized as valid in several European countries, such as [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]. While in some of these countries there are limits on what restrictions the courts will see as enforceable or valid (e.g. Germany after 2001, where appeals courts have indicated this), a written and properly initiated contract, freely agreed upon, cannot be challenged by, for instance, invoking the circumstances under which the marriage broke down or the conduct of either part. In France and Belgium (as in [[Quebec]], which has the same judicial tradition) prenuptial agreements must be set up in the presence of a [[notaries|notary]].

In many of the countries mentioned, prenuptials may also protect the non-shared property and money from being pulled into a bankruptcy and can serve to support lawsuits and settlements during the marriage (for instance if one part has sold or wrongfully mortgaged a piece of property that had been set aside by his/her partner).

=====Ukraine=====
In accordance with provisions of Section 10 of the Family Code of Ukraine, marriage relationships, rights and duties of spouses can be regulated by a Marriage contract as well if spouses wish to settle their property relations in other manner then it is provided by the Family Code of Ukraine.

Marriage (prenuptial) contract can be concluded by a woman and a man, who applied for registration of their marriage as well as by spouses. Underaged person, who wants to conclude a marriage contract before registration of the marriage, is to have a signed consent of his/her parent or custodian certified by a notary.

Numerous provisions of this section of the Family Code of Ukraine provide quite extensive requirements as regarding the form and contents of the marriage contract and the procedural issues of making the same are regulated by appropriate Instruction of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine as regarding the procedure of notarization of marriage contracts as well as far as notarization is required.

Imperative requirements as regarding content of the marriage contract are provided by clause 93 of the Family Code of Ukraine, which states that the marriage contract governs property relations between spouses, determines their property rights and duties. Marriage contract can also determine property rights and duties of spouses as parents, but with certain limitations. Personal relations of spouses cannot be regulated by the marriage contract, as well as personal relations between spouses and their children. This rule is also provided by clause 93 of the Family Code of Ukraine. Marriage contract, which reduce rights of children and put one of spouses on a poor material state, are not permitted by the above imperative regulation. Within the frameworks of the marriage contract none of spouses can acquire any immovable property or other property, which requires the state registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ukrconsulting.biz/Law-Firm-Ukraine-Kharkov-English/Marriage-prenuptial-contract-in-Ukraine-Kharkov-Kharkiv.html|title=Marriage (prenuptial) contract in Ukraine|last=LLC.|first=UKRCONSULTING LAW FIRM|website=ukrconsulting.biz|language=ru-ru|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United Kingdom=====
======England and Wales======
Prenuptial agreements historically had not been considered legally enforceable in England and Wales due to a reluctance on the part of the judiciary for public policy reasons. The 2010 Supreme Court test case of Radmacher v Granatino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/oct/20/prenuptial-agreement-enforced-uk-law | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Owen | last=Bowcott | title=Prenup agreement enforced under UK law | date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; overturned the previous legal framework on them to recognise changing societal and judicial views on the personal autonomy of married partners. Pre-nuptial agreements will now be enforced by the courts as part of their discretion in financial settlement cases under section 25 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] so long as the three stage Radmacher test is met and it is considered fair to do so, keeping in mind the interests of any child of the family. Radmacher states that the courts will give effect to a nuptial agreement that is freely entered into by each party with a full appreciation of its implications unless, in the circumstances prevailing, it would not be fair to hold the parties to their agreement. The case provided substantial amounts of guidance relevant to all nuptial agreement cases that have occurred since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11580907 | work=BBC News | title=Supreme Court rules in favour of pre-nuptial agreement | date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]]'s 2014 report on Matrimonial Property generally accepted the decision in Radmacher and recommended the creation of a 'qualifying nuptial agreement' regime by Parliament which would create a completely binding pre-nuptial agreement so long as certain requirements were met. The Commission's recommendations have yet to be implemented.

===North America===
====Canada====
Prenuptial agreements in Canada are governed by provincial legislation. Each province and territory in Canada recognizes prenuptial agreements. For instance, in Ontario prenuptial agreements are called marriage contracts and they are recognized by section 52 of the Family Law Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prenuptial Agreements by Province|url=http://www.prenup.ca/provinces/|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Currently, prenuptial agreements are recognized, although they may not always be enforced. Both parties should have lawyers represent them to ensure that the agreement is enforceable and can work with agreement between both parties. In some cases, the parties retain a private judge to be present during the signing, to be sure that neither party has been coerced into the agreement.  Some attorneys recommend videotaping the signing, although this is optional. Some states such as California require that the parties be represented by counsel if spousal support (alimony) is limited by the agreement.&lt;ref name="calfc"&gt;See subsection (c) of {{cite web|title=California Family Code, Sec. 612|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;division=4.&amp;title=&amp;part=5.&amp;chapter=2.&amp;article=2.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, prenuptial agreements may become void if there is evidence that they are signed under [[Coercion|duress]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web |title=''Kremer vs. Kremer'' (2018) |url=http://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Standard%20Opinions/OPA152006-053018.pdf |website=Minnesota Courts |publisher=State of Minnesota |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prenuptial agreements are, at best, a partial solution to obviating some of the risks of marital property disputes in times of divorce. They protect minimal assets and are not the final word. Nevertheless, they can be very powerful and limit parties' property rights and alimony.  It may be impossible to set aside a properly drafted and executed prenup. A prenup can dictate not only what happens if the parties divorce, but also what happens when they die.  They can act as a contract to make a will and/or eliminate all your rights to property, probate homestead, probate allowance, right to take as a predetermined heir, and the right to act as an executor and administrator of your spouse's estate.

A prenuptial agreement is only valid if it is completed prior to marriage. After a couple is married, they may draw up a post-nuptial agreement. There are several ways that a prenuptial agreement can be attacked in court. These include lack of voluntariness, unconscionability, and a failure to disclose assets.&lt;ref&gt;''See generally'', Krause, Elrod, Garrison &amp; Oldham, "Family Law: Cases, Comments, and Questions", Thomson West, St. Paul MN (2003) {{ISBN|0-314-26377-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, prenuptial agreements are recognized in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Likewise, in most jurisdictions, five elements are required for a valid prenuptial agreement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Debele|first1=Gary A.|last2=Rhode|first2=Susan C.|title=717363v1 1 Prenuptial Agreements in the United States|url=https://www.iafl.com/cms_media/files/prenuptial_agreements_in_the_us.pdf|website=International Academy of Family Lawyers|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# agreement must be in writing (oral prenups are generally unenforceable);
# must be executed voluntarily;
# full and/or fair disclosure at the time of execution;
# the agreement cannot be [[unconscionable]];
# it must be executed by both parties (not their attorneys) "in the manner required for a deed to be recorded", known as an [[acknowledgment (law)|acknowledgment]], before a notary public.

Prenuptial agreements in all U.S. states are not allowed to regulate issues relating to the children of the marriage, in particular, custody and access issues.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Mistakes to Avoid in Prenuptial Agreements|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/family-law-and-divorce/mistakes-avoid-prenuptial-agreements|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind this is that matters involving children must be decided in the children's best interests.&lt;ref name="fields"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=Jonathan E.|title=Forbidden  Provisions  in  Prenuptial Agreements:  Legal  and  Practical Considerations  for  the  Matrimonial Lawyer|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers|date=2008|volume=21|pages=413–438|url=http://sc.aaml.org/sites/default/files/MAT210.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is controversial: some people believe that as custody battles are often the worst part of a divorce, couples should be able to settle this in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preparing for a Broken Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/opinion/16miller.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=27 August 2017|author=James Andrew Miller|date=16 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts will not enforce requirements that one person will do the dishes or that the children will be raised in a certain religion.&lt;ref name="fields"/&gt; In recent years, some couples have included social media provisions in their prenuptial agreements, setting forth rules as to what is permissible to be posted on social media networks during the marriage, as well as in the event the marriage is dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Effron|first1=Laura|title=I Love You, You're Perfect, but Watch What You Facebook: Social Media Prenups|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/love-perfect-watch-facebook-social-media-prenups/story?id=23977608|accessdate=27 August 2017|agency=ABC News|date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sunset provision]] may be inserted into a prenuptial agreement, specifying that after a certain amount of time, the agreement will expire. In Maine, for prenuptial agreements executed before October 1, 1993, unless the parties renew the agreement, it automatically lapses after the birth of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, Sec. 606. Effect of children|url=http://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/19-A/title19-Asec606.html|website=Maine Revised Statutes|publisher=Maine Legislature|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, a certain number of years of marriage will cause a prenuptial agreement to lapse.  In states that have adopted the UPAA ([[Uniform Premarital Agreement Act]]), no sunset provision is provided by statute, but one could be privately contracted for.  Note that states have different versions of the UPAA.

Unlike all other contract law, [[consideration]] is not required, although a minority of courts point to the marriage itself as the consideration. Through a prenup, a spouse can completely waive rights to property, alimony or inheritance as well as the elective share and get nothing in return. [[Choice of law]] provisions are critical in prenups. Parties to the agreement can elect to have the law of the state they are married in govern both the interpretation of the agreement and how property is divided at the time of divorce.  In the absence of a choice of law clause it is the law of the place the parties divorce, not the law of the state they were married that decides property and support issues.

In drafting an agreement, it is important to recognize that there are two types of state laws that govern divorce{{spaced ndash}}[[equitable distribution]], practiced by 41 states, and [[community property]], practiced in some variation by 9 states.  An agreement written in a community property state may not be designed to govern what occurs in an equitable distribution state and vice versa.  It may be necessary to retain attorneys in both states to cover the possible eventuality that the parties may live in a state other than the state they were married.  Often people have more than one home in different states or they move a lot because of their work so it is important to take that into account in the drafting process.

With respect to financial issues ancillary to divorce, prenuptial agreements are routinely upheld and enforced by courts in virtually all states.  There are circumstances in which courts have refused to enforce certain portions/provisions of such agreements.  For example, in an April, 2007 decision by the Appellate Division in New Jersey, the court refused to enforce a provision of a prenuptial agreement relating to the wife's waiver of her interest in the husband's savings plan.  The New Jersey court held that when the parties executed their prenuptial agreement, it was not foreseeable that the husband would later increase his contributions toward the savings plan.

===== California =====
In California, one case (''Hall v. Hall'', 222 Cal. App. 3d 578 (1990))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall v. Hall, 271 Cal. Rptr. 773, 222 Cal.App.3d 578 (1990)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5523723356137506136|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; enforced an oral prenuptial agreement in the probate of the estate of one of the parties because the surviving spouse had substantially changed her position in reliance on the oral agreement.  Marriage of Benson (2005) 36Cal.4th 1096 distinguishes Hall. Parties can waive disclosure beyond that which is provided, and there is no requirement of notarization, but it is good practice.  There are special requirements if parties sign the agreement without attorney, and the parties must have independent counsel if they limit spousal support (also known as alimony or spousal maintenance in other states).  Parties must wait seven days after the premarital agreement is first presented for review before they sign it, but there is no requirement that this be done a certain number of days prior to the marriage.  Prenups often take months to negotiate so they should not be left until the last minute (as people often do).  If the prenup calls for the payment of a lump sum at the time of divorce, it may be deemed to promote divorce.  This concept has come under attack and a lawyer should be consulted to make sure the prenup does not violate this provision.

In California, through a prenuptial agreement a couple may waive their rights to share property (community property).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tour-Sarkissian|first1=Christine|title=When Does Separate Property Become Community Property (or Vice Versa)?|journal=Real Property Law Reporter, Continuing Education of the Bar|date=7 July 2016|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2912717|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement can limit spousal support (although a court at the divorce can set this aside if it deems that the limitation is unconscionable).  The agreement can act as a contract to make a will requiring one spouse to provide for the other at death.  It can also limit probate rights at death, such as the right to a probate allowance, the right to act an executor, the right to take as a predetermined heir, and so forth.&lt;ref name="calfc"/&gt; In California, Registered Domestic Partners may also enter into a prenup. Postmarital agreements are treated very differently in California law. Spouses have a fiduciary duty to one another so premarital agreements come under a special category of agreements. There is a presumption that the postmarital agreement was obtained by undue influence if one party gains an advantage.  Disclosure cannot be waived in the context of a postmarital agreement.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Prenuptial agreements are recognised in Australia by the Family Law Act 1975 (Commonwealth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAMILY LAW ACT 1975 - SECT 90C|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90c.html|work=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premarital mediation==
[[Premarital mediation]] is an alternative way of creating a prenuptial agreement.  In this process, a mediator facilitates an open discussion between the couple about all kinds of marital issues, like expectations about working after children are born and saving and spending styles as well as the traditional premarital discussions about property division and spousal support if the marriage is terminated.  The engaged couple makes all of the decisions about what would happen in the event of a separation or divorce with the assistance of the mediator.  They then draft either a deal memo or a premarital agreement and have it reviewed by their respective attorneys.  An agreement developed via [[mediation]] is typically less expensive because fewer hours are spent with attorneys because the couple has made all of the decisions together, rather than one side vs. the other.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

== Catholicism ==
Prenuptial agreements are a matter of civil law, so Catholic [[canon law]] does not rule them out in principle (for example, to determine how property would be divided among the children of a prior marriage upon the death of one spouse).

In practice, prenuptials may run afoul of Church law in a number of ways. For example, they cannot subject a marriage to a condition concerning the future (such as an agreement about the dividing of assets in case of divorce). The Code of Canon Law provides: "A marriage subject to a condition about the future cannot be contracted validly". (CIC 1102)

''The Canon Law: Letter and Spirit'', a commentary on canon law, explains that condition may be defined as "a stipulation by which an agreement is made contingent upon the verification or fulfillment of some circumstance or event that is not yet certain". It goes on to state that "any condition concerning the future attached to matrimonial consent renders marriage invalid". For example, a marriage would be invalid if the parties stipulated that they must have children or they have the right to divorce and remarry someone else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

== Judaism ==
{{Main|Jewish prenuptial agreement|Ketubah}}

In Judaism, the ''[[ketubah]]'', a prenuptial contract, has long been established as an integral part of the [[Jewish views of marriage|Jewish marriage]], and is signed and read aloud at the marriage ceremony. It contains the husband's requirement to support his wife by providing her with food, clothing and sex, as well as providing for the wife's support in the case of divorce or the husband's death.  However, under this passage, a woman is free to leave if her husband doesn't provide for her.

In 2004, the High Court of South Africa upheld a cherem against a Johannesburg businessman because he refused to pay his former wife alimony as ordered by [[The Johannesburg Beth Din]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bregmans.co.za/court-upholds-jewish-orthodox-right-of-excommunication/&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a movement supporting an additional prenuptial agreement has emerged in some [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] circles. This is in response to a growing number of cases in which the husband refuses to grant ''[[Get (divorce document)|gett]]'', a religious divorce. In such matters, the local authorities are unable to intervene, both out of concerns regarding [[separation of church and state]] and certain ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' problems that would arise. This situation leaves the wife in a state of ''[[agunah|aginut]]'', in which she is unable to remarry. To remedy this situation, the movement promotes a prenuptial agreement in which the couple agrees to conduct their divorce, should it occur, in a [[Beth din|rabbinical court]].

== Islam ==
{{main|Islamic marriage contract}}
In Islam, there is also marriage contract, known traditionally as Aqd qeran, aqd nekah or aqd zawaj, is found in most Arab and Islamic countries. However, in Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon (only those 5 countries) it is known to many people as [[Arab wedding#Katb el-Kitab/Marriage Contract|Katb el-Kitab]]. Most countries, however, do not call it Katb el-Kitab. It has long been established as an integral part of the Islamic marriage, and is signed at the marriage ceremony. Similar to Judaism, it outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom and bride or other parties involved in the marriage proceedings.But this is different than Prenuptial agreement as the spouses can inherit each other by only signing the marriage contract without needing any thing else.

== History ==
These publications were produced from 1868 to 1949 on an annual basis to enable people in Queensland to be contacted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were produced initially by the Queensland Post Office but later they were outsourced to a commercial publisher. They were discontinued because people preferred to use [[Telephone directory|telephone directories]] once telephones became widely used. Like telephone directories, the Queensland Post Office directories usually had two main sections, listings of names (like the [[White pages|White Pages]]) and listings of businesses organised by category allowing larger entries for advertising (like the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]). Listing in these directories was not free or compulsory,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the benefits of being able to be contacted meant most businesses and most heads of households (except the poorest) are listed.

A '''''rotulus''''' (plural: ''rotuli'') is a kind of roll consisting of a long and narrow strip of writing material, historically [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]], that is wound around a wooden axle or rod and is written on its interior face or side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Grout |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/scroll/scrollcodex.html |title=Scroll and Codex |website=Encyclopaedia Romana}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that it is unwound vertically so that the writing runs parallel to the rod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/whats-on/online/crossing-borders/codex |title=What's On?: From Roll to Codex |website=Bodleian Libraries |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the other kind of roll, namely the "[[scroll]]", whose writing runs perpendicular to the rod in multiple columns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7410">[[File:Stagecoach inn, Shelburne Museum.jpg|thumb]]
'''The Stagecoach Inn''' is an exhibit building located at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

==History==
Hezekiah Barnes built '''Stagecoach Inn''' in [[Charlotte, Vermont]] in 1783. A former captain in the [[United States Militia]], Barnes had moved with his family to Charlotte in 1780, and established the inn and a [[trading post]] on opposite sides of the main stage route from [[Montreal]] to southern [[New England]]. 

Built on a Georgian plan (see [[Georgian architecture]]), the Stagecoach Inn, which town residents referred to as the Tavern Stand, possesses regularly spaced windows and two central, side-lit doors that are distinctive elements of the vernacular [[Federal style]] popular in the eighteenth century.

===Relocation===
When the [[Shelburne Museum]] dismantled and reassembled '''Stagecoach Inn''' on the grounds in 1949, it needed restoration. Museum contractors removed the dividing walls in the second-story ballroom, returning it to its former dimensions; they rebuilt ten fireplaces, two brick ovens, and two ham-smoking chambers; applied paneling and plaster finishes that approximated those found in New England in the late 18th century; and fashioned replacement window casings and chair rails with antique carpenter’s planes. Finally, they reconstructed the broad porch that had originally wrapped around the building’s exterior to re-create the Inn’s early appearance.

==Collection==

===Trade and tavern signs===
[[Shelburne Museum]]’s collection of over 175 trade signs represent dozens of different trades using a variety of forms, such as oversized locksmith’s keys, optometrist’s eyeglasses and skate-maker’s skates, as well as an enormous cobbler’s boot, a haberdasher’s hat, a clockmaker’s watch, and an innkeeper’s pineapple. [[Samuel Anderson Robb]]'s firm produced several of the Museum’s finest figures including a caricature of Robb in his National Guard uniform. Inspired by the popular Civil War-era song “Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines,” Thomas White, Robb’s partner of many years, created the caricature as a tobacconist figure. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, trade signs advertised the variety of goods and services that craftspeople, merchants, and inn and tavern keepers offered. Many early craftspeople promoted their wares with over-sized, three-dimensional metal or wooden representations of the objects they made or repaired. A gunsmith, for example, might hang a large gun outside his shop while a dentist might exhibit a tooth. Inn and tavern keepers tended to favor flat, wooden signs that hung at a right angle to the building. These two-dimensional advertisements frequently combined a representational painting with the proprietor’s name and each side often displayed a different design. 

Although a few craftsmen made their own signs, many turned to professional carvers and sign painters. During the nineteenth century most major cities supported dozens of woodcarvers and sign painters. In 1881, Samuel Robb of New York advertised his firm’s services thus: “Manufacturing of show figures and lettered signs a specialty. Tobacconist signs in great variety, on hand and made to any design. Ship and steamboat carvings, eagles, scroll heads, block letters, shoe, dentist, and druggist signs, etc.” &lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weathervanes and whirligigs===
[[Shelburne Museum]]’s collection of 130 [[weathervane]]s includes finely crafted vanes as well as commercially produced examples. The tradition of surmounting buildings with weathervanes extends to antiquity when, as early as 100 BCE, a vane crowned the Athenian Tower of the Winds. Throughout the Medieval Period, European churches displayed roosters, symbols of vigilance, from their bell towers. By the seventeenth century, English settlers had brought the tradition to America. In the United States, weathervanes first decorated public buildings but soon appeared across the countryside. Farmers would mount a representation of a cow, pig, or rooster on top of their barns to symbolize their trade while horse breeders might cap their stables with a finely crafted racehorse. 

Early weathervanes were often handmade and the Museum’s wooden Mermaid, carved by Warren Gould Roby of [[Wayland, Massachusetts]] in about 1850, is the finest example of such hand-carved figures. Other handcrafted weathervanes include a Native American archer, a streamlined goose in flight, and a wooden rooster that originally stood on a barn in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]].

In the second half of the nineteenth century manufacturers began to sell commercially produced, copper weathervanes. Makers of these vanes would hammer copper sheeting into cast-iron molds copied from carved-wood patterns. Using a mold enabled manufacturers to reproduce each design many times. Shelburne’s collection includes finished copper vanes, cast-iron molds, and a unique wooden pattern for a Lady Liberty weathervane. Many of the commercial weathervanes depict common barnyard animals, including roosters, horses, pigs, and cows. Others represent less familiar forms such as a centaur, a pouter pigeon, and an anvil. One of the largest known commercial weathervanes is a highly detailed fire-pumper pulled by a pair of horses, which originally topped a firehouse in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].

[[Whirligig]]s, which are closely related to weathervanes, most commonly represent a standing figure with paddled arms that flail in the wind. Some clever craftspeople built more complex whirligigs powered by a wind-catching wheel. One of Shelburne’s finest represents a woman seated at a spinning wheel; doubling as a trade-sign, when the wind turned the spinning wheel, the woman’s foot would move up and down on the treadle as if she were spinning yarn.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==

===Stagecoaches===
A stagecoach is a type of four-wheeled coach used for both passengers and goods. They were strongly sprung and drawn by four horses. Stagecoaches were widely used before the introduction of railway transport and made regular trips between stages or stations, which were places of rest provided for stagecoach travelers.&lt;ref&gt;[[stagecoach]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Shelburne Museum has examples of stagecoaches in their coach and wagon collection. See [[Horseshoe Barn and Annex]] for more information on this collection.

===Stagecoach Inns===
[[Stagecoach Inn]]s that served the traveling coach passengers. They stabled the teams of stagecoach horses, provided overnight loding, and served food and drink for weary travelers.

'''Theodore Marvin DiBiase Sr.''' (born January 18, 1954)&lt;ref name="OWW"/&gt; is an American former [[professional wrestler]], [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], ordained minister and [[color commentator]]. He is signed with [[WWE]] working in their Legends program. DiBiase achieved championship success in a number of wrestling promotions, holding thirty titles during his professional wrestling career. He is best recalled by mainstream audiences for his time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he wrestled as '''"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase'''. He is regarded by many as the greatest villain in pro wrestling history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/mandatory/1042466-100-greatest-wrestlers-of-the-90s|title=100 Greatest Wrestlers of the '90s|last=Fee|first=Rob|date=February 6, 2013|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] called DiBiase "one of the most gifted technical wrestlers to ever grace the squared-circle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Robinson|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/456/456506p1.html|title=Ted DiBiase: Million Dollar Smackdown - PlayStation 2 Feature at IGN|publisher=Uk.sports.ign.com|date=|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other accolades in the WWF, DiBiase was the first [[WWF North American Heavyweight Championship|North American Heavyweight Champion]], a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|three-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Champion]] (with [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]]) and the [[King of the Ring 1988|1988]] [[King of the Ring]]. DiBiase also created his own championship, the [[Million Dollar Championship]]. He held the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] belt in 1988 after purchasing it from [[André the Giant]], but this period is not recognized  by WWE as an official title reign.&lt;ref name=wwebio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/themilliondollarman/|title=The Million Dollar Man's WWE Hall of Fame profile|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, DiBiase frequently headlined WWF cards, including [[WrestleMania IV]] and the first ever [[SummerSlam (1988)|SummerSlam in 1988]].

DiBiase headlined the 2010 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] ceremony, being inducted by his sons, [[Ted DiBiase Jr.|Ted Jr.]] and [[Brett DiBiase|Brett]].

== Early life ==
DiBiase was born in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]]. He is the biological son of wrestler [[Helen Hild|Helen Nevins]] and Ted Wills, an entertainer and singer.&lt;ref name="MillionDollar13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man|last=DiBiase|first=Ted|page=13|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Price23"&gt;{{cite book|title=Every Man Has His Price|last=DiBiase|first=Ted|page=23|publisher=Multnomah Publishers, Inc|year=1997|isbn=978-1-57673-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the adopted son of wrestler [[Michael DiBiase|"Iron" Mike DiBiase]], who was Italian-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Every Man Has His Price|last=DiBiase|first=Ted|page=39|publisher=Multnomah Publishers, Inc|year=1997|isbn=978-1-57673-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man|last=DiBiase|first=Ted|page=21|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiBiase is of mostly German and English ancestry. His adoptive father died of a heart attack in the ring when DiBiase was  15. Seven-time NWA World champion Harley Race rushed to the ring and performed CPR, but was unable to save Iron Mike's life. In response, his mother suffered from depression and alcoholism, so DiBiase was moved to [[Willcox, Arizona]] to live with his grandparents. He attended Creighton Preparatory high school and attended [[West Texas A&amp;M University|West Texas State University]] on a football [[scholarship]]. While there he became a member of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity. However, due to an injury in his senior year, he later dropped out of college to begin a career in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name=slambio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/dibiase.html|title=Ted DiBiase's bio at Slam Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Mid-South Wrestling (1974–1979) ===
Ted DiBiase was trained by [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] and [[Terry Funk]]. He made his professional wrestling debut as a referee in June 1974 in the Amarillo territory owned by the Funks. He then went to the Mid-South territory of [[Bill Watts]] being promoted as the son of Iron Mike in 1975 where he wrestled for four years. His first match was a loss against [[Danny Hodge]].&lt;ref name=god/&gt; By February 1978, DiBiase would unseat Dick Slater to become Missouri State champion only to lose to Dick Murdoch after a few weeks on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/2010/03/07/ted-dibiase-receives-2010-iron-mike/|title=Page not found - Cauliflower Alley Club|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924054538/http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/2010/03/07/ted-dibiase-receives-2010-iron-mike/|archivedate=2012-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation (1979) ===
DiBiase had a short stint with [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]]'s [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1979, that was in the transition from being called the World Wide Wrestling Federation. He was awarded the short-lived [[WWF North American Heavyweight Championship|North American Championship]], becoming the title's first champion.&lt;ref name="northamerican"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwf/wwf-na-h.html|title=W.W.F. North American Heavyweight Title |accessdate=2007-10-14 |publisher=Hisa's Puroresu Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tedtitles"/&gt; On June 19, 1979, he lost the North American Championship to [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], who unified the title with the fictional "South American Championship" to become the first ever [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]].&lt;ref name="intercontinental"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental|title=WWE Intercontinental Championship official title history |accessdate=2007-10-14 |publisher=WWE.Com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterson1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322358|title=Pat Patterson's first Intercontinental Championship reign |accessdate=2007-10-14 |publisher=WWE.Com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Hulk Hogan]]'s opponent in Hogan's first [[Madison Square Garden]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Every Man Has His Price|last=DiBiase|first=Ted|page=93|publisher=Multnomah Publishers, Inc|year=1997|isbn=978-1-57673-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Wrestling Alliance and return to MSW / Universal Wrestling Federation (1980–1987) ===
DiBiase also spent time in the Georgia area where he had an early [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] run.  One legendary angle had DiBiase enduring four piledrivers (one on the concrete floor and three in the ring) administered in the WTBS studio arena by [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] before his tag team partner, [[Tommy Rich|Tommy "Wildfire" Rich]], threw in the towel (the angle of DiBiase being badly injured was so real the TBS studio audience could be seen crying). Rich and DiBiase later feuded, leading to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|loser leaves town match]] which DiBiase won, but instead of Rich leaving the area, he donned a mask calling himself "Mister R." The feud culminated in a match between Mister R and DiBiase, Rich appeared from backstage and distracted DiBiase. Mister R then rolled up DiBiase to get the win and unmasked as [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]. Both DiBiase and Rich left the territory shortly thereafter.

In the early to mid-1980s, DiBiase participated in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]]s in various territories feuding with the likes of [[Ric Flair]]  best known from this point in his [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid South]] return  with the likes of Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, [[Dick Murdoch]], [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] and [[One Man Gang]]. DiBiase turned heel against the Junkyard Dog and formed a group called The Rat Pack with [[Jim Duggan]] and [[Matt Osborne|Matt Borne]], ran Mid-south for months. Aligning with [[Skandor Akbar]], Dibiase caused a riff with the group, namely Duggan. The two would feud until DiBiase lost a loser leave town match.&lt;ref name="OWW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/t/ted-dibiase.html|title=Ted DiBiase's OWW Profile|accessdate=2007-10-14 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also held various championships&lt;ref name="tedtitles"/&gt; and made frequent trips to [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] until his eventual departure from Mid-South Wrestling (which by this point was now the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|UWF]]). Typically, his matches ended with the use of a "loaded" black glove, which he pulled from his tights to "knock out" his opponent when the referee was not looking.

While locked in talks with the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1987 after the UWF was acquired by [[Jim Crockett, Jr.|Jim Crockett]], DiBiase received an offer from the WWF. DiBiase was eventually convinced by WWF to sign up despite the fact that he would not be told his gimmick until after he agreed, under the promise that it was something that would receive a serious [[push (professional wrestling)|push]]. WWF official Pat Patterson informed DiBiase that if owner Vince McMahon were to go out to wrestle, it would be the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that he would give himself.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1983–1987, 1993) ===
DiBiase entered [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) in 1983. He won the [[NWA United National Championship]] on October 14, 1983 in a tournament defeating [[Jerry Lawler]] by forfeit.&lt;ref name="wrestling-titles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/alljapan/un.html|title=NWA United National Heavyweight Title|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com|date=|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later on January 28, 1984, DiBiase lost the title to [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]].&lt;ref name="wrestling-titles.com"/&gt; DiBiase's mother Helen Hild died two months later in March 4, 1984.

In August 1985, DiBiase formed a tag team with fellow gaijin: [[Stan Hansen]] and the two became the [[PWF World Tag Team Championship|PWF Tag Team Champions]] when Hansen chose DiBiase to replace [[Bruiser Brody]] who left for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/alljapan/pwf-t.html|title=PWF World Tag Team Title|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com|date=|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, DiBiase and Hansen entered the 1985 [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League]] and would emerge victorious finishing in first place with 7 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purolove.com/ajpw/history/rwtl85.php|title=Purolove.Com|publisher=Purolove.Com|date=|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 1987, DiBiase and Hansen would lose the PWF Tag Team Championship to [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] and [[Mitsuharu Misawa|Tiger Mask]], ending their two-year reign as champions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Eight days later on July 11, DiBiase and Hansen regain the titles for a second time, but would be stripped of the titles shortly after due to DiBiase leaving AJPW for the WWF.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In September 1993, DiBiase returned to AJPW and reformed his team with Hansen. The two immediately saw success as they defeated [[The Holy Demon Army]] on September 3, 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/AJTitle-WorldTag.html|title=All Japan World Tag Team Championship|publisher=Puroresucentral.com|date=|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[World Tag Team Championship (AJPW)|World Tag Team Championship]]. Two months later on November 13, 1993, DiBiase and Hansen would be stripped of the titles so they could be put on the line for the 1993 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. DiBiase would enter the tournament, but would only wrestle one match on November 14 where he and Hansen defeated [[Tracy Smothers|Tracey Smothers]] and [[Richard Slinger]]&lt;ref name="purolove.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purolove.com/ajpw/history/rwtl93.php|title=Purolove.Com|publisher=Purolove.Com|date=|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he suffered neck and back injuries which forced him out of the tournament (Giant Baba ended up replacing him).&lt;ref name="purolove.com"/&gt;

=== Return to the WWF===

==== The Million Dollar Man (1987–1991) ====
DiBiase made his return to the WWF as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] on May 15, 1987 at a [[house show]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. He came out to the ring to announce to those in attendance that it was only fitting that he was now competing in the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Moments later The One Man Gang and Slick came to the ring for Gang's scheduled match. The referee had to force DiBiase to leave before there was a confrontation. At the next house show on June 7, DiBiase would have his first match and lose to The One Man Gang. He went on to lose two additional house show confrontations to The Gang. Dibiase would tag-team with [[Sam Houston (wrestler)|Sam Houston]] on June 26 against The One Man Gang and [[Ron Bass (wrestler)|Ron Bass]] (Houston had run in to assist Dibiase against The Gang at one of the earlier house show matches); towards the end of the match, DiBiase (kayfabe) turned on and attacked Houston after Houston missed a dropkick on Bass, leaving him to get double-teamed and pinned. His actions during the match served to effectively turn Dibiase heel, right before the onscreen debut of his new gimmick.

On a June 27 episode of ''WWF Superstars'', DiBiase had his first vignette. He would now be known as "The Million Dollar Man", a millionaire who wore a gold-studded, dollar-sign-covered suit and, in time, a custom-made, diamond-encrusted and self-awarded "[[Million Dollar Championship]]" belt. The Million Dollar Man character was based on the type of wrestler that Vince McMahon would want to be.&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.147, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was billed as having a spring residence in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], a summer residence in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], an autumn residence in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air, California]], and a winter residence in the [[Netherlands Antilles]].&lt;ref name=slamtoronto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania27/2011/03/11/17578856.html|title=SLAM! Wrestling - DiBiase's Mania memories centre on Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DiBiase had a bodyguard by the name of [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Virgil]], who was also by his side during his matches and vignettes. The idea for the name Virgil was based on then-NWA booker [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], whose real name is Virgil Runnels, though former writer and producer Bruce Prichard disputes this. The name of DiBiase's finishing move, the Million Dollar Dream (in which someone is put to sleep), was also supposedly meant to be an insult to Dusty Rhodes, who was named the American Dream.&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p. 156f., Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil was often seen performing humiliating tasks, such as rubbing DiBiase's feet. DiBiase claimed "Everybody has a price" demonstrating his "power" through a series of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#V|vignettes]] in which he did things such as bribe the manager of a local swimming pool to close for the day so he could have the pool to himself, or when the honeymoon suite in a hotel was already booked, he bribed the desk clerk to have the couple already in there thrown out. Other skits featured DiBiase traveling in limousines, giving $100 tips to waiters, and using $100 bills in convenience stores for small purchases like [[chewing gum]]. In reality, DiBiase's road travel was deliberately booked for first-class airplane flights and five-star hotel accommodations, and he was given a stipend of petty cash from the WWF Offices so that he could "throw money around" in public (i.e. pick up tabs and "overtip", buy drinks for entire bars, actually pay for small items with a $100 bill, etc.) in order to make the character seem more real. Other times, DiBiase invited fans (including a young [[Rob Van Dam]] and a then unknown [[Linda McMahon]]&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.155, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to perform humiliating acts (such as kissing his feet) for money. During one skit, he invited a young boy onto a stage and told him if he bounced a ball 15 times in succession, DiBiase would pay him $500. After the 14th bounce, DiBiase kicked the ball away, sending the boy home without pay; however, according to his autobiography, everybody who wasn't paid on-camera ''was'' paid off-camera. He frequently stuffed a $100 bill into the mouth of a wrestler on whom he had used the Million Dollar Dream move. Virgil, however, would more often than not retrieve the discarded bill from the wrestler's mouth.

His first big in-ring angle came in late 1987 on an episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', where he announced his plan to buy the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Hulk Hogan]], as Hogan refused and said that DiBiase would have to defeat him in the ring for the championship belt. Hogan got the upper hand in a series of matches, and a frustrated DiBiase approached [[André the Giant]] to win the title for him, which did happen on the February 5, 1988 edition of ''[[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event I|The Main Event]]'' (which aired live on [[NBC]]), where André defeated Hogan under questionable circumstances for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. This was the match of the great "who is the true Dave Hebner" debacle . Who the crowd and viewers at home thought was the "real" Dave Hebner (it was actually his real life twin brother Earl, whom many now mistake as being the original Hebner) counted the match finishing pin for André despite the fact that Hogan's shoulder was up at the count of one. Afterwards the real Dave Hebner came running into the ring to dispute the ruling his "evil twin" had made awarding the WWF world championship to Andre the Giant ;&lt;ref name="mainevent1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/tme.html#1|title=The Main Event results - February 5, 1988|accessdate=2007-10-14 |publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}&lt;/ref&gt; André then announced he was surrendering the championship belt and handed it to DiBiase.&lt;ref name="andre1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122|title=Andre the Giant's first WWE Championship reign|accessdate=2007-10-14|publisher=WWE.Com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, DiBiase was in fact billed as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion in three house shows, defending the title one time against Bam Bam Bigelow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DiBiase's short (and omitted) title reign|url=http://www.wrestlehistory.com/2011/08/dibiases-short-and-omitted-title-reign/|publisher=WrestleHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/33486-ted-dibiase-sr-on-his-son-coming-to-grips-with-why-his-father-didnt-want-him-to-be-a-wrestler|title=- WON/F4W - WWE news, Pro Wrestling News, WWE Results, UFC News, UFC results|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, WWF later refused to acknowledge DiBiase as the champion (since titles could not be handed to someone else) and declared the title vacant (as the title could not be given back to Hogan due to the match being official, and Andre's handing off the championship belt to DiBiase was considered a surrender of the title).&lt;ref name="wwechampionship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship|title=WWE Championship official title history|accessdate=2007-10-14|publisher=WWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; André's world title win was always recognized though, and is still considered the shortest world title reign in WWF history. This angle was an amplification of an angle in the old [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW), when [[Larry Zbyszko]] paid [[Killer Tim Brooks]] $25,000 for his [[NWA National Heavyweight Championship]] in 1983.

A tournament was announced to crown a new WWF World Heavyweight Champion at [[WrestleMania IV]], where DiBiase defeated [[Jim Duggan|Hacksaw Jim Duggan]] in the first round and [[Don Muraco]] in the quarterfinal before receiving a bye in the semi-finals to advance to the finals of the tournament. The reason for the bye was a double-elimination of Hulk Hogan and André the Giant when they both were disqualified in their match, with DiBiase meant to face the winner. In a backstage interview afterwards, André revealed that DiBiase paid him to make sure Hogan didn't advance in the tournament. DiBiase was defeated by [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]] in the finals, helped by Hulk Hogan negating André's repeated interference in the match.&lt;ref name="wwechampionship"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm4/mainevent|title=Randy Savage vs. Ted DiBiase for the WWF Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454124|title=Randy Savage's first WWF Championship reign}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiBiase continued to feud with Savage throughout the summer of 1988, culminating in a tag team match pitting DiBiase and André the Giant vs. Hogan and Savage at [[SummerSlam (1988)|the inaugural SummerSlam]] (in a match billed as "Where [[The Mega Powers]] Meet [[The Mega Bucks]]"). Although pro-heel commentator [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]] served as the guest referee, Hogan pinned DiBiase to win the match. DiBiase then defeated [[Brutus Beefcake]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Ron Bass (wrestler)|Ron Bass]], and Randy Savage to win the [[King of the Ring 1988|1988 King of the Ring tournament]], receiving his first WWF success.

[[Bobby Heenan]] sold [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]]' contract to Ted DiBiase for his services as his personal slave. DiBiase claimed that Hercules was his slave but started feuding with him after Hercules turned face. He eliminated Hercules from the main event at [[Survivor Series (1988)|Survivor Series]].

At the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|Royal Rumble]] in 1989, DiBiase purchased the #30 entrance spot from Akeem to become the final entrant in the match.&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.164, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big John Studd]] and DiBiase were the final two participants in the match. DiBiase offered Studd a bribe to eliminate himself, but Studd eliminated him to win the match. DiBiase continued to feud with Hercules; the two had a series of matches including a match that DiBiase won on the February 3 [[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event II|edition]] of ''The Main Event''. He defeated [[Owen Hart|The Blue Blazer]] on the March 11 [[Saturday Night's Main Event results|edition]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. After that match, he introduced the [[Million Dollar Championship|WWF Million Dollar Championship]], his own championship belt which was not recognized by the WWF. He created this belt because he was unable to buy or win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan.

DiBiase fought Brutus Beefcake to a double-countout at [[WrestleMania V]]. DiBiase's next big feud was with [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]]. A few weeks after WrestleMania, DiBiase attacked Roberts on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' after Roberts defeated Virgil in a match. DiBiase put Roberts out of action for several months with a neck injury. (The storyline was created so Roberts could get surgery on his back from the guitar attack from [[The Honky Tonk Man]] a year earlier.) While Roberts recuperated, DiBiase defeated [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy "The Superfly" Snuka]] at [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam]] by countout. On the October 14 [[Saturday Night's Main Event results|edition]] of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', DiBiase faced Hulk Hogan in a match for the WWF Championship where DiBiase had the monster [[Tom Lister, Jr.|Zeus]] by his side. DiBiase lost the match when he accidentally hit Zeus and was pinned by Hogan with a small package. At [[Survivor Series (1989)|Survivor Series]], DiBiase captained a team dubbed the "Million Dollar Team" consisting of himself, [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]] and [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]]), and Zeus against Hogan's "Hulkamaniacs" consisting of Hogan, Jake Roberts, and [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]). DiBiase eliminated Roberts after pinning him with help from Virgil before being pinned himself by Hogan.

[[File:Ted DiBiase laugh.jpg|thumb|left|DiBiase performing his trademark evil laugh.]]
In 1990, he was punished for buying #30 in the previous year's Royal Rumble. For his punishment, he was forced to enter as entrant #1.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}  He broke the record at the time by lasting 45 minutes in the [[Royal Rumble (1990)|Royal Rumble match]] after entering as the #1 entrant. He eliminated two opponents before he was eliminated by [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. This may have foreshadowed Dibiase seeking revenge on Warrior after Warrior became WWF Champion, by facing him several months later at a co-promotional All Japan and New Japan event in the Tokyo Dome. He then continued his feud with Jake Roberts, who stole the Million Dollar Belt, leading to a match at [[WrestleMania VI]] where Roberts was counted out. Shortly after WrestleMania, he had a brief feud with [[Ray Traylor|Big Bossman]] which dated back to when DiBiase tried to bribe Bossman into retrieving the Million Dollar Belt. Bossman refused DiBiase's bribe and returned the Million Dollar Belt to Roberts. At [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam]], DiBiase bought the services of [[Sapphire (wrestler)|Sapphire]], who was the manager of [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] at the time. This led to Rhodes and DiBiase feuding throughout the end of 1990 into the beginning of 1991. On the October 30 [[Saturday Night's Main Event results|edition]] of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', he attacked Dusty's son [[Dustin Rhodes]] during Dusty's match with Randy Savage. DiBiase and Dusty captained rival teams at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]], with DiBiase's mystery partner turning out to be the debuting [[The Undertaker|Undertaker]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.177, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiBiase wound up eliminating both members of [[The Hart Foundation#The Hart Foundation|The Hart Foundation]] and was the sole survivor of the match. He, however, was eliminated in the main event by Hogan. DiBiase said about Undertaker's debut "nobody knew him, at the time if you know how this works they were using my celebrity and me introducing The Undertaker was helping him get over. He wasn't 'The Phenom' then he was just a new kid on the card, this new character The Undertaker and of course he grew in to be one of the greatest attractions the WWE has ever had. At the time it wasn't a big deal to me, I was just doing my job."&lt;ref name="wrestlingnewssource.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingnewssource.com/news/31395/Ted-DiBiase-Sr-on-Introducing-Taker-Working-For-Bischoff/|title=Ted DiBiase Sr. on Introducing 'Taker, Working For Bischoff in WCW, Ted Jr., More|date=28 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dibiase then received a shot at the world champion: the Ultimate Warrior on a special Thanksgiving episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, which ended when Dibiase was disqualified after Virgil attacked Warrior, which was seemingly an interlude to Randy Savage further assaulting Warrior. During this time Dibiase started to develop real life disdain for the Warrior and would later become very vocal about it both in behind the scenes interviews and in his auto biography.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Title Match Wrestling|title=What Jake the Snake Said to Ultimate Warrior at WWE Hall of Fame|date=2014-08-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BkihZuD_5k|accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|Royal Rumble]], Ted DiBiase and Virgil defeated Dusty and Dustin Rhodes in a tag team match. After the match, DiBiase ordered Virgil to put the Million Dollar Championship belt around his waist. Virgil instead hit DiBiase with the belt, turning face. At [[WrestleMania VII]], DiBiase lost by countout to Virgil, who had help from [[Roddy Piper|'Rowdy' Roddy Piper]]. [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], who earlier in the night had turned on a losing Randy Savage, came down midway through the match to help DiBiase and became his full-time valet. On the April 27 [[Saturday Night's Main Event results|edition]] of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', DiBiase fought [[Bret Hart]] to a double countout.

DiBiase lost the Million Dollar Championship to Virgil at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]] when Virgil smashed his head into an exposed turnbuckle and pinned him to get the victory. DiBiase participated in the 1991 [[King of the Ring 1991|King of the Ring tournament]] drawing with [[Ricky Steamboat]] in the first round. DiBiase and Steamboat would battle to a time-limit draw with neither man advancing in the tournament. DiBiase regained the Million Dollar Championship from Virgil with help from [[Barry Darsow|Repo Man]] on the November 11 edition of ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'' which was dubbed "Survivor Series Showdown". At [[Survivor Series (1991)|Survivor Series]], he was one of the contestants eliminated from his match. At [[This Tuesday in Texas]], DiBiase and Repo Man defeated Virgil and [[Tito Santana]].

==== Money Inc. (1992–1993) ====
{{Main|Money Inc.}}
[[File:Ted DiBiase in 1995.jpg|thumb|DiBiase in 1995.]]
Ted DiBiase officially formed the tag team, Money Incorporated, with [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster (IRS)]]. The duo, mostly managed by [[Jimmy Hart]], won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] three times between February 1992 and June 1993. Their first reign came on February 7, 1992 when they defeated [[The Road Warriors|The Legion of Doom]] for the titles. Money Incorporated then feuded with [[The Natural Disasters]] ([[John Tenta|Earthquake]] and [[Fred Ottman|Typhoon]]). They defended the title against the Natural Disasters at [[WrestleMania VIII]] and lost the match by countout, thus retaining the title. On July 20, they lost the title to the Natural Disasters.

After losing a match to the Legion of Doom at [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam]], DiBiase and IRS regained the belts on the October 13 edition of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'' from the Natural Disasters. This title change led to a feud with [[The Nasty Boys]], who were originally scheduled for the title shot. On the November 14 [[Saturday Night's Main Event results|edition]] of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', they defended their titles against the Ultimate Maniacs (Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage). DiBiase and IRS lost the match by countout and thus retained the titles once more.

Ted DiBiase participated in the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|Royal Rumble]] match, entering at #4 before eventually being eliminated by [[The Undertaker]]. Shortly after, DiBiase and IRS became involved in a major angle with the returning Brutus Beefcake. DiBiase faced Beefcake on one of the first episodes of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. DiBiase and IRS attacked Beefcake after the match and slammed his face (which had been surgically repaired following a windsailing accident) with a briefcase. Money Inc. also attacked their manager Jimmy Hart, who was disgusted by their actions. Beefcake's best friend Hulk Hogan came to Beefcake's defense and challenged Money Inc. to a tag team title match at [[WrestleMania IX]]. DiBiase and IRS retained their titles by disqualification after Hogan used Beefcake's protective face mask as a weapon.

Money Inc. dominated the tag team division of the WWF. They feuded with [[the Steiner Brothers]] ([[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner|Scott]]) and had a series of title exchanges. DiBiase and IRS were defeated by the Steiners for the WWF Tag Team Championship on the June 14 edition of ''Monday Night Raw''. They would regain the titles on June 16 at a [[House show|live event]] but lost them back to the Steiners three days later on June 19 at another live event. DiBiase last wrestled for the WWF in August, bowing out following an angle which saw [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]] turn face and [[Sean Waltman|1-2-3 Kid]] debut. The Kid had scored an upset pinfall against a cocky Ramon, causing DiBiase to mock Ramon and tell him he would show him how it was done. He then went on to also lose to the Kid, giving Razor a newfound respect for the Kid thus turning Razor face. This included a match at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]] between DiBiase and Ramon which DiBiase lost. This was DiBiase's last TV appearance in the WWF during this run. He revealed in a shoot interview that his decision to leave the WWF at this point was motivated by a desire to resolve his marital problems.

After a few months back in AJPW, where he won the World Tag Team Championship with Hansen, he quietly announced his retirement due to sustaining an injury to two cervical discs in his neck and returned to the USA.&lt;ref name=god/&gt;

==== Million Dollar Corporation (1994–1996) ====
[[File:Ted DiBiase and Sycho Sid.jpg|thumb|left|DiBiase managed many wrestlers in his [[Million Dollar Corporation]] stable, including [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sycho Sid]].]]
{{Main|The Million Dollar Corporation}}
DiBiase returned to the WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]] as a guest commentator. DiBiase then began working as a commentator and manager for the WWF. Later in 1994, DiBiase purchased the contracts of many wrestlers for his Million Dollar Corporation stable in the WWF, which over time included I.R.S., [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Kama]], [[King Kong Bundy]], [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sycho Sid]], 1-2-3 Kid, and in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S|swerve]], [[Tatanka (wrestler)|Tatanka]]. DiBiase also renewed his connection with the Undertaker after the latter's six-month hiatus after the January [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]]. Saying that he had originally brought the Undertaker to the WWF, and he was going to bring him back, DiBiase debuted a new Undertaker under his control. This Undertaker however proved to be an impostor played by [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]], and was subsequently defeated by the real Undertaker at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]].

DiBiase also had a place in the main event of [[WrestleMania XI]] as the manager of Bam Bam Bigelow in his match versus [[Lawrence Taylor]]. Surrounding the ring were members of DiBiase's corporation to offset Taylor's entourage of NFL All-Pros on the opposite side. After Taylor defeated Bigelow, DiBiase publicly referred to Bigelow as an embarrassment. This culminated in Bigelow quitting The Corporation after DiBiase fired him following a loss to [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] in a WWF Championship match. Bigelow aligned himself with Diesel in a feud versus members of DiBiase's corporation.

As a manager, DiBiase also later introduced "The Ringmaster", who eventually became [[Steve Austin|Stone Cold Steve Austin]], to the WWF in January 1996. Austin became the Million Dollar Champion and began wearing DiBiase's gold belt that was introduced in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.193, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiBiase's last appearance with the company was at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog|In Your House: Beware of Dog 2]] in 1996, where he was kayfabe forced to leave the WWF after Steve Austin lost to [[Savio Vega]]. In reality, he left for rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).

=== World Championship Wrestling (1996–1999) ===
In WCW, DiBiase became the fourth member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order (nWo)]] (along with Scott Hall, Kevin Nash and former enemy Hollywood Hogan) on August 26, 1996, nearly a month and a half after their formation in July 1996. He claimed to be financing the group (thus playing on his "Million Dollar Man" gimmick that WCW could not legally use outright).&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.200, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was referred to, instead, as "Trillionaire Ted", a play on "Billionaire Ted", the nickname WWF gave to [[Ted Turner]]. DiBiase was the spokesperson for the NWO for 3 months until [[Eric Bischoff]] joined the NWO and replaced him in that role.

DiBiase quit the nWo shortly after [[Spring Stampede (1997)|Spring Stampede]]. Less than a few months later, on the August 4, 1997, episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'', he made a face turn, managing [[The Steiner Brothers]]. DiBiase managed The Steiners until Scott turned heel and joined the nWo. DiBiase also managed one-time WWF rival [[Ray Traylor]] for a while until he stopped managing altogether. DiBiase then became a road agent for the company and left entirely when his contract expired in late 1999.

In 2013, DiBiase said about his time in WCW: "Eric Bischoff doesn't know that much about wrestling", "Eric took credit for the NWO but that wasn't his idea, the NWO had already been done in Japan, so they had copied something that had already been done. It was a good idea, but originally I was supposed to be the mouth piece of the NWO and reality is I think Eric saw how it was getting over and he saw how he could put himself in the role that he had hired me for. As each week went by pretty soon Eric isn't the announcer anymore, he becomes part of the NWO and I just went to him one day and told him I'm not just going to walk out there and be Hulk Hogans' Virgil, you hired me to be the spokesperson for this, so if that's not what I'm going to do you can send me home. The reason I said that was because they had to pay me one way or the other, because I had a contract where they had to pay me for three years".&lt;ref name="wrestlingnewssource.com"/&gt;

=== Retirement from active wrestling ===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="I said, 'you know, that's not really me'. I'm not Clint Eastwood. I'm not good on both sides of the camera. I'm good in front of it.

In late 2004, WWE offered DiBiase a job as creative. He accepted the job and worked as part of the creative team a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0829/565245/ted-dibiase-sr-talks-working-in-wwe-creative/index.shtml|title=Ted Dibiase Sr. Talks Working In WWE Creative, How Ted Jr. Was Used In WWE, Religion, More - WrestlingInc.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, DiBiase was hired as a creative consultant and road agent for the [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]] brand of World Wrestling Entertainment. On October 3, 2005, at ''[[WWE Homecoming]]'', DiBiase appeared with other WWE legends in a ceremony. He eventually led the attack on [[Rob Conway]], who had come down to the ring to insult the legends.

[[File:TedDiBiaseRadio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DiBiase at a radio program on July 15, 2006 at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum.]]
DiBiase inducted his former manager [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]] into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006&lt;ref&gt;Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.171, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made an appearance at [[WrestleMania 22]], offering [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]] $1,000 to dribble a basketball 100 times backstage and kicked the ball away at the last second. DiBiase also appeared on ''Raw'' on April 17 behind a newspaper doing his famous evil laugh as the camera went off air. DiBiase made an appearance at an IPW show in [[Newton, Iowa]] on July 14, 2006, where he watched his sons' tag team match. The following day, he accepted the [[George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] induction for his father, Mike, at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum. He also appeared at the ''Raw Family Reunion'' on October 9, 2006 aiding [[Ric Flair]] in his match with the [[Spirit Squad]]. On October 26, 2006, Ted DiBiase was released from his WWE contract.

DiBiase made his first in ring appearance in over five years at the ''Raw 15th Anniversary Special'' on December 10, 2007, by winning a 15-man battle royal, in which he was not even an active participant. [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]], DiBiase's former tag team partner of Money Incorporated, had won the battle royal. DiBiase came down to ringside and offered Schyster a bribe to eliminate himself. Schyster accepted and hopped over the top rope, making DiBiase the victor. DiBiase then declared that even after fifteen years, everyone still had a price for the "Million Dollar Man."

On the May 19, 2008 edition of ''Raw'', he was seen alongside Mr. McMahon about to "discuss business", in [[William Regal]]'s office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05192008/|title=One night stood up|last=DiFino|first=Lennie|date=2008-08-24|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following ''Raw'', DiBiase introduced his son [[Ted DiBiase, Jr.]] to WWE as its newest member.

=== Christian ministry and wrestling ===
DiBiase is now a [[Christian]] minister.  In 1999, he founded ''Heart of David Ministry'' and travels the world ministering to churches, camps and conferences including [[Promise Keepers]] and [[Youth of the Nation Conference|Youth of the Nation]]. Ted is also the author of ''Every Man Has His Price'', a part-[[autobiography]] and part-Christian [[testimony]].

=== Part-time wrestling appearances in WWE and Hall of Fame (2009–present) ===
[[File:Dibiase2011.jpg|thumb|left|200px|DiBiase making an appearance at a local indy show on August 20, 2011.]]
On the June 29 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', [[Ted DiBiase, Jr.]] announced in a segment with [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[Randy Orton]] that DiBiase would appear on ''Raw'' the following week as the special guest host, and DiBiase appeared as scheduled on July 6. On the show, DiBiase booked his son to face Randy Orton. After DiBiase Jr. lost the match, he accused his father of setting him up and trying to steal his time, even slapping his father across the face. DiBiase would later come out at the end of the show and sanctioned a triple threat match for Randy Orton's [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWE Championship]] at [[Night of Champions (2010)|Night of Champions]] including [[John Cena]] and [[Triple H]] in his final act as the guest host.

== Personal life ==
All three of his sons—[[Mike DiBiase II|Mike]] (from his first marriage), and [[Ted DiBiase Jr.|Ted Jr.]] and [[Brett DiBiase|Brett]] (from his current marriage)—were professional wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milliondollarman.com/tedsbio.html|title=Ted DiBiase's Biography|accessdate=2007-10-14|publisher=Million Dollar Man.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013180441/http://milliondollarman.com/tedsbio.html|archivedate=2007-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to [[West Texas A&amp;M University|West Texas State University]], where he was a member of [[Alpha Tau Omega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duke.edu/web/ato/alumni.html|title=Alumni - Alpha Tau Omega - Xi Chapter at Duke University|publisher=Duke.edu|date=|accessdate=2011-11-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018053942/http://www.duke.edu/web/ato/alumni.html|archivedate=2012-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DiBiase appeared in ''Christian Living Magazine'' in the July/Aug 2008 edition where he stated: “God had allowed me to climb to the top — my life was made into action figures; I wrestled in front of 80,000 people. Yet, I was still not satisfied. I was trying to fill this void in my life, like so many others have done in the entertainment world. But the thing that’s almost unbelievable about God is His grace and mercy. We fail all the time, but there’s no shame in failing—only in not getting up and keeping on”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gofishproductions.net/title/study_notes_file/305/july-Aug-08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723135717/https://www.gofishproductions.net/title/study_notes_file/305/july-Aug-08.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2009, DiBiase appeared in ''MuscleSport Magazine'' where his ministerial booking agent and publicist, William J. Bruce III, commented, "I have had the privilege of getting to know Ted over the last couple of years as his booking agent and publicist though Willowcreek Marketing. I will never forget a comment that I once heard him relate about the difference of knowing God or knowing about God; “a lot of people remember my last match, they can remember what I wore, what moves I made and who won, they know everything about me, but they don’t know me. In many ways that is how we as Christians are, we know everything about God… but we don’t know Him”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musclesportmag.com/2009/05/14/the-million-dollar-dream/|title=Build Muscle at Musclesportmag.com with Weight Training and Bodybuilding Workouts|publisher=Musclesportmag.com|date=2009-05-14|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B overzicht-2.JPG|thumb|right|Eerste Schilderijenzaal]]
The '''Eerste Schilderijenzaal''', or '''Painting Gallery I''', is one of two art gallery rooms in [[Teylers Museum]] and is the oldest art gallery for contemporary Dutch art in the Netherlands. It was built onto the back of [[Teylers Oval Room]] in 1838. It was the young museum's first exhibition space for paintings and could be entered through the Oval Room, which was itself located behind the [[Fundatiehuis (Teyler)|Fundatiehuis]], the former home of [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]].

==History==

[[File:Greive, Teylers Painting Gallery I.jpg|thumb|Johan Conrad Greive, ''Interior of Paintings Gallery I'', drawing, 1862.]]
[[Teylers Foundation]] started collecting contemporary Dutch paintings in 1821. The paintings were either commissioned directly from the painters or acquired at exhibitions. The first room used to display paintings was the room that is today used as a print cabinet and was added to the Oval room in 1824 along with the library room upstairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/pdf/39_001.pdf article]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} M. Kersten,'Een schilderijenzaal of een gehoorzaal De polemiek tussen Directeuren en Genootschappen over de bestemming van de ruimte onder de leeszaal van Teylers Stichting (1824-1829', ''Teylers Magazijn'' 13, 1986, 9-12. (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of light quickly made viewing the paintings there unpopular and it was used mostly for lectures and experiments. 
According to the archives, the expansion was done by the foundation's own building crew that was on hand for day-to-day improvements. The gallery had large curved windows like the Oval room, which have since been closed. An impression of the original windows can be seen in a charcoal sketch by [[Johan Conrad Greive]] in 1862. The collection today is mostly based on that same group of paintings. The gallery also contains a table that was used to hold the portfolios of drawings and a similar portfolio with Rembrandt and Michelangelo reproductions can still be consulted (the actual drawings are held in special storage).

==Paintings==
The selection of paintings was done mostly according to the advice of the curator and concierge, who lived in the Fundatiehuis. For the early days this was [[Vincent Jansz van der Vinne]]. Van der Vinne was replaced by [[Wybrand Hendriks]], whose own works, those of his friends, and works by his successor [[Gerrit Jan Michaëlis]] hang in the gallery. No works by Van der Vinne are represented, who left Teylers after a disagreement with [[Martin van Marum]]. One of the first large canvases to be purchased (1825) was ''Storm at sea'', by the marine painter [[Johannes Christiaan Schotel]]. A few years later, its counterpart was ordered: ''Calm sea''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=55&amp;nvlng=en museum website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525173049/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio |date=2013-05-25 }} on Paintings Gallery I&lt;/ref&gt; It is striking that, in the early period, paintings were often bought in pairs.

'''Wordster''' is an online language resource, that offers through its website dictionary, thesaurus, and other services for anyone learning about the English language.  Much of the content in Wordster is automatically generated, and it applies a number of automated language processing and scalable data retrieval technologies in producing user output.

==History==
Wordster was founded by Anindya Datta, originally as a resource to help his daughter Diya learn the meanings of words in context. Anindya was subsequently joined by Jay Clark, his friend and former business partner. Wordster is a privately funded startup with offices and teams working in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; [[Singapore]]; and [[Kolkata]] (Calcutta), India. The company employs individuals with backgrounds in computer science, languages, education, and lexicography.

==Wordster features==
# User Contribution System: Users can create a profile and contribute content to the website. Their sentences, images, videos, and pronunciations are  displayed when other users search for words.
# Multimedia Dictionary Entries: When you search for a word at Wordster, it provides  definitions, sentences that demonstrate the word’s meaning in context, pronunciations, images, word usage patterns, word origins, videos, and related words. Usage patterns and related words are conveniently illustrated in graphs and charts in an interactive visual thesaurus.
# Concept Mapper: When a user enters a concept, Wordster provides a list of words and phrases related to that concept, organized by part of speech. This feature can be used as a Reverse Dictionary, Related Words Finder, Trivia System, and Research Tool.
# Write Assist: Users can enter in any type of text and discover a variety of writing tips, including word frequency counts, repeated words, alternate word suggestions, and a usage analysis.

==Technology==
Wordster is a testbed for a number of scientific advances, such as the Lexical Crawler. The Lexical Crawler program "crawls" through websites, blogs, and other channels to find sample sentences for all the entries on Wordster. Over 1 million words have been identified from over 200 million documents that have been "crawled". To address one of the most difficult problems in the science of Natural Language Processing, Wordster has developed a system that allows for online semantic processing and recognition of words in context. All of this processing occurs in real time.
