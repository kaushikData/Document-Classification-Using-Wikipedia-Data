The ability of a leader to be able to lead well in a wide range of circumstances especially new, changing and ambiguous situations.

==Introduction==
Agile Leadership is associated with mode four leaders ([[Modes of Leadership]]) who have the ability (and agility) to operate in any mode (system of thinking) and most importantly see from the perspectives of the other modes. It is this ability to think in a number of different ways that gives such leaders their agility. This is also introduced within the concepts of Agile Business Management&lt;ref&gt;Leybourn, E. (2013). Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management. London: IT Governance Publishing: 38–45.&lt;/ref&gt; as the primary management model for adaptive and agile organisations.

==Attributes==
The attributes associated with Agile Leadership are (from Iacocca &amp; Witney&lt;ref&gt;Iacocca, L. &amp; Witney, C. (2007) Where have all the leaders gone? Scribner Book Company&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilkinson&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson.D.J.(2006) The Ambiguity Advantage: what great leaders are great at. London: Palgrave Macmillain.&lt;/ref&gt;):

#[[Ambiguity tolerance]]
#Curiosity
#Creativity
#Courage
#Conviction
#Emotional Resilience
#Critical Thinking
#Vision
#Flexibility

==Agile Business Management==
Within Agile Business Management, the primary job of an Agile Leader is to encourage and empower cross-functional teams. This demands that team members are granted sufficient personal responsibility, accountability and authority to deliver the customers’ requirements. An Agile Leader can support this in three ways:
# Provide an environment where it is safe to fail.
# Provide all the information necessary to make appropriate decisions. 
# Uphold decisions made by the staff.

There are two primary anti-patterns for an Agile Leader; micromanagement and absenteeism. If a process is under control, and within allowed tolerances, staff should have the authority to deliver, without management intervention. This assumes a robust monitoring and reporting process, to identify when management intervention becomes required. This brings us to the other extreme, an absentee manager. A manager is ‘absentee’, even if they are physically in the office, if they do not monitor or engage with their staff to ensure delivery. Without a manager to eliminate impediments, it becomes nearly impossible to meet any schedules or budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Leybourn, E. (2013). Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management. London: IT Governance Publishing: 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The militant group has also stated its intentions to attack American targets in the Indian Subcontinent. This group is listed as a terrorist organization by the [[United Nations]], [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[India]].

== History ==

===Before Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent===
Before coming together under AQIS, there were various jihadist factions operating in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. One of these factions operated in [[Karachi, Pakistan]], and were responsible for numerous attacks in the city. On 11 December 2014, AQIS issued a report detailing these attacks. The attacks targeted local police, a professor, and a blogger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-reports-on-attacks-in-karachi-from-nov-2013-oct-2014-targets-police-a-blogger-and-a-professor.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Reports on Attacks in Karachi from Nov. 2013 - Oct. 2014, Targets Police, a Blogger, and a Professor|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent===
On 3 September 2014, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], leader of [[al-Qaeda]], announced the establishment of a new branch in the Indian subcontinent in a 55-minute video posted online.&lt;ref name="BARRY 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=BARRY|first=By ELLEN|title=4 Young Men Head for Iraq, Citing Fight for Islam, and India Wonders if More Will Follow|website=NYTimes.com|date=4 September 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/world/asia/al-qaeda-announces-new-branch-on-indian-subcontinent.html?nytmobile=0|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the announcement, Zawahiri stated that it had taken two years to gather various jihadist factions into the new group, and introduced [[Asim Umar]], a former commander in the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]], as its Emir.&lt;ref name="lwj05Sep"/&gt; The announcement also introduced the group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, who praised militant commanders like [[Amjad Farooqi]], [[Ilyas Kashmiri]] and [[Hassan Ghul]]. Farooqi was killed by Pakistani security forces. Kashmiri and Ghul were killed by [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|US drone strikes]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="lwj05Sep"/&gt;

In 2014, [[Pakistan Navy]] lieutenant Zeeshan Rafiq and former lieutenant Owais Jakhrani joined [[Asim Umar|Asim Umar's]] al-Qaeda's faction with plans to attack US Navy ships in the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan|last=Coll|first=Steve|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2018|isbn=9781594204586|location=New York|pages=653-660}}&lt;/ref&gt; They intended to hijack the [[F-22P Zulfiquar-class frigate|PNS ''Zulfiqar'']], a frigate carrying [[C-802]] cruise missiles and a [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear warhead]], and use the ship's armaments to fire on nearby US and NATO vessels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On September 6, 2014, the AQIS militants, including Rafiq and Jakhrani, failed in their attempt to seize the PNS ''Zulfiqar.'' Pakistani forces stationed at the Karachi docks saw through the militants' disguises as they tried to board the ship, leading to a firefight that left eleven attackers dead.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On 11 December 2014, Pakistani police arrested Shahid Usman, the head of the al-Qaeda wing in [[Karachi]], and four others in Karachi along with weapons and 10&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives.&lt;ref name="AA2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=Al Qaeda South Asia commander held in Karachi|publisher=The Asian Age|date=13 December 2014|url=http://www.asianage.com/international/al-qaeda-south-asia-commander-held-karachi-046|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ustad Ahmad Farooq, the deputy emir for AQIS, was killed on 15 January 2015 following a US drone strike in South Waziristan. Qari ‘Imran, a member of the group’s ruling Shura Council, was killed on 5 January 2015 in a drone strike in North Waziristan.&lt;ref name="lwj12apr"&gt;{{cite web|title=US killed AQIS deputy emir, shura member in January drone strikes

Despite Al Zawahiri announcement, [[Al Qaeda]] could not succeed in making any direct presence in [[India]]. Although some Kashmiris were arrested for assisting al Qaeda in the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, there is no evidence of any organized presence of the group in the region. Specifically, there has been no record of territorial claim, group activity or kidnapping of civilian or government officials by [[Al Qaeda]]. Some media reports suggested that al Qaeda is mainly being operated from [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] to target [[India]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Some experts also suggest that [[Al Qaeda]] have links with some local Kashmiri factionist groups to spread insurgency in the Indian state of [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] told [[CNN]] in an interview with [[Fareed Zakaria]] that Indian Muslims would not be allied with [[Al Qaeda]] because of their patriotism, modernity and literacy. &lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/19/world/asia/india-modi-extremists/index.html|work=CNN|title=Al Qaeda will fail to recruit India's Muslims, Prime Minister says|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other Jihadist factions==
In October, a Kashmiri militant group calling itself "Ansar ut-Tawhid wal Jihad in Kashmir" published a video expressing support for Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/ansar-ut-tawhid-wal-jihad-in-kashmir-expresses-support-for-aqis.html|work=SITE Institute|title="Ansar ut-Tawhid wal-Jihad in Kashmir" Expresses Support for AQIS|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group offered to provide shelter to foreign fighters within AQIS as well as fight alongside it.

AQIS spokesman Usama Mahmoud, in series of tweets, expressed support for militant groups in [[Chechnya]], [[Dagestan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="SITE Institute"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-spokesman-condemns-infidel-system-prays-for-fighters-in-chechnya-dagestan-and-yemen.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Spokesman Condemns "Infidel System," Prays for Fighters in Chechnya, Dagestan, and Yemen|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave a eulogy for [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] leader [[Ahmed Abdi Godane]], who was killed in a US drone strike.&lt;ref name="news.siteintelgroup.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-gives-eulogy-for-former-shabaab-leader-reminds-that-u-s-must-be-fought.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Gives Eulogy for Former Shabaab Leader, Reminds that US Must be Fought|date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
On 19 October 2014, a 117-page English-language magazine called ''Resurgence'' was released online. It was produced by the Subcontinent branch of Al Qaeda's [[As-Sahab]] media production house, and the articles focused on waging jihad in the Indian Subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/10/al_qaedas_resurgence-2.php|work=The Long War Journal|title=Analysis: Al Qaeda’s ‘Resurgence’ focuses on Indian Subcontinent|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements===
Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent has released multiple statements, mainly via the Twitter account of Usama Mahmoud, the group's spokesperson.

On 13 September 2014, Usama Mahmoud claimed responsibility for the attempted raid on a Pakistani frigate and the assassination of [[Pakistani]] Brigader Zahoor Ahmad Fazal in Punjab Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/09/al_qaeda_in_the_indi.php|work=The Long War Journal|title=Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent claims 2 attacks in Pakistan|date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September, Mahmoud released a statement which justified the attempted attack on the Pakistani frigate, stating that America was the primary enemy of AQIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-explains-motivations-for-targeting-u-s-navy-in-karachi-considers-america-its-primary-enemy.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Explains Motivation for Targeting US Navy in Karachi, Considers America its Primary Target|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, AQIS released another statement which said that the intended targets were the American and Indian navies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-clarifies-targets-of-karachi-naval-yard-attack-as-u-s-indian-navies.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Clarifies Targets of Karachi Naval Yard Attack as US, Indian Navies|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2014, Mahmoud confirmed that AQIS senior leader Imran Ali Siddiqi was killed in a US drone strike. He also spoke about the [[2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-spokesman-confirms-death-of-official-in-drone-strike-reiterates-call-to-target-america.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Spokesman Confirms Death of Official in Drone Strike, Reiterates Call to Target America|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siddiqi was a member of the group's Shura council.

On 4 November 2014, Mahmoud released a series of tweets that condemned what he said as the "Infidel System." He also prayed for god to support militants in [[Chechnya]], [[Dagestan]], and [[Yemen]], as well as [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="SITE Institute"/&gt; The following day, Mahmoud released a statement giving condolences to the killing of [[Somalia|Somali]] [[al-Qaeda]] leader Ahmed Abdi Godane. He directed a statement to Somali fighters which said that the US must be fought.&lt;ref name="news.siteintelgroup.com"/&gt;

AQIS released an audio message from its leader, [[Asim Umar]], on 10 November 2014. Umar eulogized AQIS Shura Council member Imran Ali Siddiqi, who was killed in a US drone strike in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-leader-eulogizes-shura-council-member-killed-in-u-s-drone-strike.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Leader Eulogizes Shura Council Member Killed in US Drone Strike|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, AQIS spokesman Usama Mahmoud released a statement confirming the death of two officials of the group in a US raid on the border between [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. One of the officials owned the house that [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] lived in when he was captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-spokesman-announces-death-of-two-officials-one-of-whom-owned-house-where-khalid-sheikh-muhammad-was-captured.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Spokesman Announces Death of Two Officials, One of Whom Owned House Where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was Captured|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Mahmoud gave a eulogy for the two officials, and urged Pakistani doctors and military officers to follow their example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-gives-eulogy-for-two-slain-officials-urges-doctors-and-pakistani-military-officers-to-follow-their-example.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Gives Eulogy for Two Slain Officials, Urges Doctors and Pakistan Military Officers to Follow Their Example|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 2014, AQIS published a photo showing the two officials who were killed in the US raid on the [[Durand Line|Afghan-Pakistani border]], as well as a photo of the deceased son of one of the officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/aqis-provides-picture-of-two-officials-killed-in-u-s-raid-in-november-2014.html|work=SITE Institute|title=AQIS Provides Picture of Two Officials Killed in US Raid in November 2014|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2014, Usama Mahmoud, spokesman for AQIS, condemned [[2014 Peshawar school attack|an attack on a school in Peshawar, Pakistan]], which was carried out by the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban]]. He said that the attack was un-Islamic and that "the massacre of innocent children makes our hearts burst."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/12/al_qaeda_condemns_at.php|work=The Long War Journal|title=Al Qaeda condemns Pakistani Taliban's attack on Peshawar school|date=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claimed, alleged and repudiated attacks ==
As of now, AQIS have carried out multiple terrorist attacks in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] -

'''''American Psycho'''''  is a novel by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], published in 1991. The story is told in the [[first person narrative|first person]] by [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[serial killer]] and [[Manhattan]] businessman. Alison Kelly of ''[[The Observer]]'' notes that while "some countries [deem it] so potentially disturbing that it can only be sold shrink-wrapped", "critics rave about it" and "academics revel in its [[transgressive fiction|transgressive]] and [[postmodern literature|postmodern]] qualities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/27/imperial-bedrooms-bret-easton-ellis-book-review |title=Imperial Bedrooms by Bret Easton Ellis |work=The Guardian |last=Kelly |first=Alison |date=27 June 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630110116/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/27/imperial-bedrooms-bret-easton-ellis-book-review| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Ellis researched murders at the [[New York Public Library]]. His first draft of ''American Psycho'' left all the grisly scenes until last, to be added in later. In 2010, in conversation with Jeff Baker, Ellis commented: {{quote|[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of [[yuppie]] culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a [[consumerism|consumerist]] kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself. That is where the tension of ''American Psycho'' came from. It wasn't that I was going to make up this serial killer on [[Wall Street]]. [[High concept]]. Fantastic. It came from a much more personal place, and that's something that I've only been admitting in the last year or so. I was so on the defensive because of the reaction to that book that I wasn't able to talk about it on that level.&lt;ref name=oregonlive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2010/07/qa_bret_easton_ellis_talks_abo.html|title=Q&amp;A: Bret Easton Ellis talks about writing novels, making movies|last=Baker|first=Jeff|work=OregonLive|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; |Bret Easton Ellis}}

==Plot==
Set in [[Manhattan]] during the [[Wall Street]] boom of the late 1980s, ''American Psycho'' follows the life of wealthy young [[investment banker]] Patrick Bateman. Bateman, in his mid-20s when the story begins, narrates his everyday activities, from his recreational life among the Wall Street elite of [[New York City|New York]] to his forays into murder by night. Through [[present tense]] [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative, Bateman describes his daily life, ranging from a series of Friday nights spent at nightclubs with his colleagues—where they snort [[cocaine]], critique fellow club-goers' clothing, trade fashion advice, and question one another on proper [[etiquette]]—to his loveless engagement to fellow yuppie Evelyn and his contentious relationship with his brother and senile mother. Bateman's stream of consciousness is occasionally broken up by chapters in which he directly addresses the reader in order to critique the work of 1980s [[pop music]] artists. The novel maintains a high level of ambiguity through mistaken identity and contradictions that introduce the possibility that Bateman is an [[unreliable narrator]]. Characters are consistently introduced as people other than themselves, and people argue over the identities of others they can see in restaurants or at parties. Deeply concerned with his [[vanity|personal appearance]], Bateman gives extensive descriptions of his daily beauty regimen. The question of whether any of the crimes depicted in the novel actually happened or whether they were simply the fantasies of a [[delusion]]al [[psychosis|psychotic]] is only perpetuated further by the cinematic adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|author=Kyle Buchanan|work=Movieline|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After killing Paul &lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE TO ALLEN; ALLEN IS MOVIE NAME, OWEN IS BOOK NAME! --&gt;Owen, one of his colleagues, Bateman appropriates his apartment as a place to host and kill more victims. Bateman's control over his violent urges deteriorates. His murders become increasingly [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] and complex, progressing from simple stabbings to drawn-out sequences of [[rape]], [[torture]], [[mutilation]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]], and his grasp on sanity begins to slip. He introduces stories about serial killers into casual conversations and on several occasions openly confesses his murderous activities to his coworkers, who never take him seriously, do not hear what he says, or misunderstand him completely—for example, hearing the words "murders and executions" as "mergers and acquisitions." These incidents culminate in a shooting spree during which he kills several random people in the street, resulting in a [[SWAT]] team being dispatched in a helicopter. This narrative episode sees the first-person perspective shift to third-person and the subsequent events are, although not for the first time in the novel, described in terms pertaining to cinematic portrayal. Bateman flees on foot and hides in his office, where he phones his attorney, Harold Carnes, and confesses all his crimes to the answering machine.

Later, Bateman revisits Paul Owen's apartment, where he had earlier killed and mutilated two prostitutes, carrying a surgical mask in anticipation of the decomposing bodies he expects to encounter. He enters the perfectly clean, refurbished apartment, however, filled with strong-smelling flowers meant, perhaps, to conceal a bad odor. The real estate agent, who sees his surgical mask, fools him into stating he was attending the apartment viewing because he saw an "ad in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]''" (when there was no such advertisement). She tells him to leave and never return.

Bateman's mental state continues to deteriorate, and he begins to experience bizarre hallucinations such as seeing a [[Cheerios|Cheerio]] interviewed on a talk show, being [[stalking|stalked]] by an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] park bench, and finding a bone in his [[Dove Bar]]. At the end of the story, Bateman confronts Carnes about the message he left on his machine, only to find the attorney amused at what he considers a hilarious joke. Mistaking Bateman for another colleague, Carnes claims that the Patrick Bateman he knows is too much of a coward to have committed such acts. In the dialogue-laden climax, Carnes stands up to a defiant Bateman and tells him his claim of having murdered Owen is impossible, because he had dinner with him twice in [[London]] just a few days prior.

The book ends as it began, with Bateman and his colleagues at a new club on a Friday night, engaging in banal conversation.  The sign seen at the end of the book simply reads "This is not an exit."

==Themes==
According to literary critic Jeffrey W. Hunter, ''American Psycho ''is largely a critique of the "shallow and vicious aspects of [[capitalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Jeffrey W. Hunter (ed.). ''Vol. 229''. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2007, pp. 228–294. From ''Literature Criticism Online.''&lt;/ref&gt; The characters are predominantly concerned with material gain and superficial appearances, traits indicative of a [[postmodern]] world in which the 'surface' reigns supreme. This leads Patrick Bateman to act as if "everything is a [[commodity]], including people",&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism''.&lt;/ref&gt; an attitude that is further evident in the rampant objectification and brutalization of women that occurs in the novel. This distancing allows Bateman to rationalize his actions;&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Leigh. "Distancing in Bret Easton Ellis' ''American Psycho''. ''Notes on Contemporary Literature'' 24, no. 1 (January 1994): 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; in one [[Cannibalism|anthropophagic]] scene, Bateman remarks "though it does sporadically penetrate how unacceptable some of what I'm doing actually is, I just remind myself that this thing, this girl, this meat, is nothing&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Bret Easton. ''American Psycho''. New York: Vintage Books, 1991. Page 345&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Bateman's consumption of what he views as nothing more than a piece of meat is an almost parodically literal interpretation of a monster created by consumer culture. This, combined with sex, violence, drugs, and other desires of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], is how Bateman enacts his sociopathic violence in a superficial world.&lt;ref&gt;Heyler, Ruth. "Parodied to Death: The Postmodern Gothic of ''American Psycho''". ''Modern Fiction Studies'' 46, no. 3 (fall 2000): 725–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The book was originally to have been published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in March 1991, but the company withdrew from the project because of "aesthetic differences". [[Vintage (publisher)|Vintage Books]] purchased the rights to the novel and published the book after the customary editing process. The book was not published in hardcover in the United States until 2012, when a limited hardcover edition was published by [[Centipede Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centipedepress.com/horror/americanpsycho.html|title=American Psycho|work=centipedepress.com|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a deluxe paperback was offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318714,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Giselle | last=Benatar | title=American Psychodrama – EW.com | date=1990-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis received numerous death threats and hate mail after the publication of ''American Psycho''.&lt;ref name="messier"&gt;{{cite journal

== Adaptations ==

===2000 film===
{{Main article|American Psycho (film)}}
In 2000, writer [[Guinevere Turner]] and writer/director [[Mary Harron]] adapted ''American Psycho'' into a dark, comic [[American Psycho (film)|film]] released by [[Lions Gate Films]]. This screenplay was selected over three others, including one by Ellis himself. Bateman is played by [[Christian Bale]] with [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] in supporting roles. As a promotion for the film, one could register to receive e-mails "from" Patrick Bateman, supposedly to his therapist.&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;{{cite news | last= Howell | first= Peter | url= | title=''American Psycho''s Web Promo Sickens Star | work=[[Toronto Star]] | date=March 8, 2000 | accessdate= | location=Toronto }}&lt;/ref&gt; The e-mails, written by a writer attached to the film and approved by Ellis, follow Bateman's life since the events of the film. ''American Psycho'' premiered at the 2000 [[Sundance Film Festival]] where it was touted as the next ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian3&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''American Psycho'' hits Sundance |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-01-26 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/26/sundancefilmfestival2000.festivals |accessdate=2010-07-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) gave the film an [[NC-17]] rating for a scene featuring Bateman having a [[threesome]] with two prostitutes. The producers excised approximately 18 seconds of footage to obtain an [[MPAA film rating system|R-rating]] for the film.&lt;ref name=guardian4&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''American Psycho'' cut to appease censors|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-02-29 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/29/news |accessdate=2010-07-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It polarized audiences and critics with some showering praise, others scorn.&lt;ref name="corliss2"&gt;{{cite news | last= Corliss | first= Richard | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995904,00.html | title=Sundance Sorority | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=January 24, 2000 | accessdate=2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its theatrical release, however, the film received positive reviews in crucial publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' which called it a "mean and lean horror comedy classic".&lt;ref name="holden"&gt;{{cite news | last= Holden | first= Stephen | url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/041400psycho-film-review.html | title=Murderer!

A [[direct-to-video]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[American Psycho 2]]'' was released and directed by [[Morgan J. Freeman]]. This spin-off was not based on the novel or the original film, as its only connection with the original is the death of Patrick Bateman (played by Michael Kremko wearing a face mask), briefly shown in a flashback.

===Other adaptations===
In 2009, [[Audible.com]] produced an audio version of ''American Psycho'', narrated by [[Pablo Schreiber]], as part of its ''Modern Vanguard'' line of audiobooks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710063219/http://markets.ibtimes.com/ibtimes/?Page=MediaViewer&amp;GUID=9742903&amp;Ticker=AMZN Audible Announces New ''Modern Vanguard'' Line of Audiobooks]. International Business Times&lt;/ref&gt; A Hungarian version of the novel was written by [[Attila Hazai]] (1967–2012) called ''Budapesti skizo'' ("Budapest Psycho", 1997); it was Hazai's best known work but as of his death never translated into English.&lt;ref name=cr&gt;[http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/201204a.htm#bf3 Hazai Attila (1967–2012)], ''[[complete review]]'', "The Literary Saloon", April 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a Kickstarter campaign was launched by Ellis and others to get a [[American Psycho (musical)|musical stage adaptation]] made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798121016/american-psycho|title=AMERICAN PSYCHO|work=Kickstarter|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere of the [[American Psycho (musical)|musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Duncan Sheik]] opened at the [[Almeida Theatre]], London in December 2013.

'''Catch share''' is a [[fishery management]] system that allocates a secure privilege to harvest a specific area or percentage of a fishery's total catch to individuals, communities, or associations.&lt;ref name=NOAA2009 /&gt; Examples of catch shares are individual transferable quota (ITQs), [[individual fishing quota]] (IFQs), territorial use rights for fishing (TURFs), limited access privileges (LAPs), sectors (also known as cooperatives), and dedicated access privileges (DAPs).

Catch shares provide long-term secure privileges to participants and, in theory, an incentive for efficient, sustainable use of fish stocks.&lt;ref name=Bed2007 /&gt; Actual outcomes in terms of efficiency and ecological sustainability are varied, based on design and implementation of the program.

Catch share programs generally fall into two categories. Quota-based programs, like ITQs, establish a fishery-wide catch limit, assign portions (or shares) of the catch to participants and hold participants directly accountable to stay within the catch limit.

Area-based programs, like TURFs, allocate a secure, exclusive area to participants and include appropriate controls on fishing mortality that ensure long-term sustainability of the stock. A combination of both quota- and area-based approaches has also been used.

==Background==
The term "catch share" has taken root recently, but similar management systems providing secure and exclusive access to fishery resources have been in use for many years. [[Community-based management]] in Japan's near-shore fisheries dates back to feudal times,&lt;ref name=Uchida2008 /&gt; and modern individually-allocated catch share programs were first implemented by the state of Wisconsin in the early 1970s for important fish stocks in the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref name=Anderson1993 /&gt; Also, [[Iceland]] and the [[Netherlands]] implemented catch shares for important stocks in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=Arnason2007 /&gt;

The use of catch share programs worldwide has been expanding since the earliest implementations in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Costello2008 /&gt; Some countries, such as Iceland, [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]], have made catch share programs the default management system.

The [[United States]] has implemented the vast majority of its catch share programs in the 21st century. In 2010, catch shares were implemented in the United States Northeast Multispecies fishery and in the United States Atlantic Sea Scallop fishery.&lt;ref name=NOAA2010 /&gt; In 2011, a catch share program was implemented in the Pacific Coast Groundfish Limited Entry Trawl fishery, which includes fishermen from the states of Washington, Oregon, and California.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Environmental Defense Fund (2008). Catch Share Fisheries and Resources: Searchable Database. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://apps.edf.org/page.cfm?tagID%3D57622 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519003940/http://apps.edf.org/page.cfm?tagID=57622 |archivedate=2013-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, there are nearly 200 catch share programs, used in 40 countries, to manage a wide variety of marine and freshwater species including finfish, sharks and crustaceans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Catch shares are used in developing and industrialized nations, artisanal and industrial fleets, and in high- and low-value fisheries.&lt;ref name= Bonzon2010 /&gt;

==Theory==
Fisheries have historically been treated as a common property resource. The dangers of managing fisheries as a common property resource were included in the development of modern theory of fishery economics, first introduced in 1954 by H. Scott Gordon. The theoretical framework showed that the common property nature of fisheries results in competition between individual operators to increase their share of the catch, which can ultimately lead to excessive capital, such as fishing vessels and gear, [[overfishing]] and resource wastage.&lt;ref name=Gordon54 /&gt; In common property fisheries, individual operators face an incentive to harvest as many fish as quickly as possible to pre-empt the activities by other operators.&lt;ref name=Gordon54 /&gt;

Catch shares have been proposed as a potential solution for the common property challenges found in many fisheries and have typically been implemented after a variety of other approaches have failed. Most commercial fisheries begin under open access conditions in which any fisherman is able to enter the fishery, put in effort, and catch fish. However, if fish biomass is no longer able to sustain the amount of fishing effort exerted in the fishery, populations begin to decline, and fishing becomes less profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Greboval, D. (Ed.) (1999). Managing fishing capacity: selected papers on underlying concepts and issues. FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 286. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional management systems tend to respond using input controls such as limiting the number of entrants to the fishery, restricting boat and gear capacity, limiting the number of days at sea, and applying catch allowances per trip. However, studies show that the approaches are sometimes ineffective in controlling overall harvest, and managers often implement additional effort-based regulations, output controls, to set strict fishery catch limits.&lt;ref name="Bed2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hilborn, J. M., Orensanz, J. M. (Lobo) and Parma. A. M. (2005). Institutions, incentives, and the future of fisheries. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Societies. (360): 47-57&lt;/ref&gt; Although catch limits have proven sufficient to sustain a fishery, the management approaches alone do not fundamentally eliminate the incentive for fishermen to compete and increase their share of the catch, which can lead to reduced fishery profitability&lt;ref name="Grafton2000" /&gt; and dangerous fishing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, G. (2006). Effects of IFQ management on fishing safety: survey responses of Alaska halibut fishermen. ComFish Alaska, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By providing secure shares of quota to fishermen, individuals or groups, it is argued that catch share programs have the potential for a fundamental shift of the behavior of fishery participants and incentives for long term stewardship.&lt;ref name="Costello2008" /&gt; For example, with quota-based catch shares, the value of the share is directly tied to the landings value of the fishery, which may increase if the health of the fishery improves.&lt;ref&gt;Newell, R. G., Sanchirico, J. N. and Kerr, S. (2002). Fishing Quota Markets. Discussion Paper 2-20. Resources for the Future. Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many catch share programs allow for voluntary trading, a process that allows operators to purchase shares, temporarily or permanently, from those willing to sell or lease shares.&lt;ref name= Grafton1996 /&gt; Transfers are considered an important component of catch shares because they can promote the most economically-efficient use of the resource.&lt;ref name="Sanchirico2005" /&gt;

==Outcomes==
Empirical research in the past two decades has shown that catch share management of fisheries has a variety of ecological, economic and social outcomes when it is compared with traditional management of fishery inputs. Studies examining the ecological impacts of catch share management show that they stabilize landings and catch limits.&lt;ref name="Essington2010" /&gt; Additional research has also shown reduced discards in catch share fisheries.&lt;ref name="Essington2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Branch2008" /&gt;

However, when they are compared to fisheries managed under conventional catch limits, recent studies have demonstrated that catch share offer no advantages to the long term sustainability of a fishery and may exacerbate localized fishery depletion.&lt;ref name="Essington2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Essington | first1 = T.

The economic impacts of catch shares are well-documented and vary on the program design and fishery goals. Catch share programs has been shown to stop the race for fish that is often experienced in traditionally-managed fisheries.&lt;ref name="Essington2010" /&gt; With improved certainty, catch shares have also extended season lengths by providing operators with a longer time period to harvest and the ability to coordinate fishing trips based on market conditions. Empirical evidence has shown that fisheries become more profitable, as the costs of fishing are reduced, and dockside prices for products increase.&lt;ref name="Grafton2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanchirico2005" /&gt;

Many catch share programs are designed to reduce overcapitalization and active fishing vessels, for a transition from many temporary fishing jobs to fewer but more stable full-time jobs.&lt;ref name="McCay1995" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Changes resulting from a transition to catch shares often improve the economics of the active participants in the fishery, but in some cases, they are considered undesirable from a community or welfare economics perspective.  In specific programs, critiques largely focus on tradeoffs, which commonly involve changes in [[fishing fleet|fleet]] capacity, employment, and aggregation of shares in the fishery.&lt;ref name = ice1 &gt;{{cite journal|last=Eythórsson|first=Einar|title=A decade of ITQ-management in Icelandic fisheries: consolidation without consensus|journal=Marine Policy|date=November 2000|volume=24|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual Transferable Quotas in Fishery Management|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/4515/fishery.pdf?sequence=1| last=Buck |first=Eugene H. |date=September 25, 1995 |work=[[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yandle|first=Tracy|author2=Christopher Dewees|title=Consolidation in Individual Transferable Quota Regime: Lessons from New Zealand 1986–1999|journal=Environmental Management|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s00267-008-9081-y|volume=41|pages=915–928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCay|first=Bonnie J.|authorlink= Bonnie McCay |title=Social and Ecological Implication of ITQ's: an Overview|journal=Ocean and Coastal Management|year=1995|volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduction in fleet capacity is frequently cited as a negative outcome of catch shares, but such a reduction may be listed as explicit fishery goal.&lt;ref name="abbot2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Joshua K.|title=Employment and Remuneration Effects of IFQs in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands Crab Fisheries|journal=Marine Resource Economics|year=2010|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catch share fisheries can result in greater capitalization of the fishing fleet when the capital required to purchase shares is included.&lt;ref name="cautionarytale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecotrust.ca/fisheries/cautionarytale |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230846/http://www.ecotrust.ca/fisheries/cautionarytale |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-02 |title=A cautionary tale about ITQ fisheries |date=2009 |publisher=Ecotrust Canada |accessdate=6 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, catch share programs may experience a change in the structure of employment, transforming from many part-time jobs, paid as a share of landings value, to fewer full-time positions paid by wages.&lt;ref name="McCay1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abbot2010" /&gt; As a result of capacity reduction and employment shifts, programs can result in a reduction in the number of fishery participants.&lt;ref name="abbot2010" /&gt;

For example, the Bering Sea crab catch share program in the United States experienced a significant reduction in the number of participants and part-time jobs and is currently operated by fewer full-time positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Leasing practices in North Pacific fisheries Bering Sea and Aleutian Island crab fisheries|journal=North Pacific Fishery Management Council|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fishing jobs are longer because of the lengthening of the fishing season, the percentage of total landings value that is paid to employees in this fishery has decreased substantially.&lt;ref name=abbot2010 /&gt; As a result, it is argued that the tradeoffs associated with certain catch share programs include increased unemployment, economic contraction of coastal communities, and economic losses to businesses and communities that rely on the fishing fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copes|first=Parzival|title=Social Impacts of Fisheries Management Regimes Based on Individual Quota}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinkerton2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinkerton|first=Evelyn|title=The Elephant in the Room: The Hidden Costs of ITQ Leasing|journal=Marine Policy|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Gregory|title=Private property and public interest in fisheries management: the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery|journal=Marine Policy|year=2002|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a number of catch share programs do include financing options for small businesses and new entrants, some fishing communities, academics, journalists, and nonprofit organizations have claimed that catch shares serve as a mechanism for the consolidation of fishing rights, often by corporations with better financing capacity than independent fishermen.&lt;ref name="ice1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cautionarytale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abdicating"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bromley|first=Daniel|title=Abdicating Responsibility: The Deceits of Fishery Policy|journal=Fisheries|year=2009|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System turns US fishing rights into commodity, squeezes small fishermen|url=http://cironline.org/reports/system-turns-us-fishing-rights-commodity-squeezes-small-fishermen-4250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catch shares help corporations more than fish populations|url=http://grist.org/news/catch-shares-help-corporations-more-than-fish-populations/}}&lt;/ref&gt; New institutions are being developed to improve communities' access to shares, allow new entrants into the fishery, and/or keep quota within the community. They include the development and use of permit banks, community license banks and Community Fishing Associations. Programs' design features, including concentration caps, owner-on-board regulations, and trading restrictions, can be used to help alleviate potential unwanted social outcomes. However, it is argued the measures have only mitigated, not prevented, the undesirable social and economic outcomes that accompany catch share programs.&lt;ref name="Abdicating"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ahab"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catch shares: Consolidation and the tipping point |url=http://www.savingseafood.org/management-regulation/catch-shares-consolidation-and-the-tipping-6.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927092859/http://www.savingseafood.org/management-regulation/catch-shares-consolidation-and-the-tipping-6.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have claimed that proliferation of catch share management is reflective of the increasingly strong link between the government and the private sector and that the programs are typically the result of special interest influence over legislation.&lt;ref name="Phillips2002" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7914">{{Politics of Ukraine}}

In [[Ukraine]], the title '''Head (Chief) of Local State Administration''' (''[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]:'' Голова місцевої державної адміністрації) refers to the [[chief executive]] of each of the [[administrative divisions of Ukraine]]: [[oblast]] (region/province), [[raion]] (district) or city, in case of Kiev and Sevastopol. 

Informally the position of the head of Regional State Administration or more commonly Oblast State Administration (for [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblasts]]) is referred to as governor. However, its function is very different from a traditional gubernatorial position.

==Origin and overview==
The position derived from the institute of presidential representatives that was introduced during the presidency of [[Leonid Kravchuk]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150128204846/http://www.ppu.gov.ua/history History of creation of the Presidential representatives]. Presidential Representative of Ukraine in Crimea website&lt;/ref&gt; After the resignation of [[Leonid Kravchuk]] as the [[President of Ukraine]], most of presidential representatives positions in regions were discontinued and their functions were performed by chairmen of executive committee in each regional council. In the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] the position is still called the Representative of President of Ukraine in Crimea. 

Earlier before [[fall of the Soviet Union]], regional leaders were the first secretaries of regional committees of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] which was a constituent part of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

Beside the local state administration all local (regional, district, city) councils have their own executive committees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taras Kuzio|Kuzio, T]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tedMMgz3RV8C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Sevastopol++appointed+by+the+President+of+Ukraine&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gBsOU-fcMuOL0AXknoDYDg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Sevastopol%20%20appointed%20by%20the%20President%20of%20Ukraine&amp;f=false Contemporary Ukraine: Dynamics of Post-Soviet Transformation]''. M.E.Sharpe, Inc., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two offices of a head of city state administration one for Kiev and another for Sevastopol. The head of Kiev City State Administration (governor) usually is served by the Kiev city mayor elected by the popular vote. The head of Sevastopol City State Administration (governor) is appointed by the president on petition of the prime minister. Sevastopol is the only city in Ukraine that does not have a mayoral position.

Due to the 2014 [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] the post of the head of Sevastopol City State Administration is currently suspended, while the Presidential representative in Crimea continues to function in the continental Ukraine along with other Crimean office of executive power.

==Appointment and termination==
The chiefs of local state administrations are appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]] with the recommendation from the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]]. The role and powers of the position are defined in the Chapter 2 (Articles 8 - 12) of the [http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/586-14 Law of Ukraine "On Local State Administration" (Law № 586-XIV, parliament, April 9, 1999)]. Candidates on the position of the chief of district state administration are recommended to the Prime Minister of Ukraine by the chiefs of the respected regional state administrations. 

The appointment is terminated in case of violation of the Constitution of Ukraine and laws of Ukraine, loss of citizenship or discovery of dual citizenship, recognition of incompetency by a court, emigration for a residence abroad, gaining a court conviction by a legal force, violation of compatibility requirements, declaring no confidence by the two-thirds of the relevant council composition, filing a request for dismissal from office at own will. The appointment may also be terminated by the President of Ukraine in case of accepting the resignation of the Chief of Regional State Administration, petition of Prime Minister of Ukraine on the grounds prescribed by the legislation about the State Service, declaring no confidence by the majority of the relevant council composition, other circumstances foreseen by this or other laws of Ukraine, on initiative of the President of Ukraine. The authority of the chiefs of local state administrations is terminated also upon their death. In case of election of the new President of Ukraine the chiefs of local state administrations continue to exercise their powers until appointment of the new chiefs of local state administrations in established order.

==Role and powers==
The chief thus heads the executive branch in each region, district, or city. The chief forms the composition of the local State Administration as well as its structure depending upon the budget allocations and requirements to [http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1160-15 the Article XVIII of the Law of Ukraine "On the Principles of Regulatory Policy in Economic Activity" (Law № 1160-IV, parliament, September 11, 2003)].

To execute the Constitution of Ukraine, laws of Ukraine, acts of the President of Ukraine, [[Cabinet of Ukraine]], other bodies of executive power as well as own and delegated powers the chief issues orders. The orders of the chief adopted within his/her competence are mandatory for execution on respective territory by all authorities, companies, institutions and organizations, officials and citizens.

'''Climate Audit''' is a [[blog]] which was founded on 31 January 2005&lt;ref name="Whois"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whois.net/whois/climateaudit.org|title=Whois|last=.net|first=Whois|date=31 Jan 2005|publisher=Whois|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/search?q=climateaudit.org&amp;p=&amp;r=|title=Alexa Ranking|publisher=Amazon|page=1|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Steve McIntyre]].

In November 2009 journalist [[Andrew Revkin]] described it in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a popular skeptics’ blog" run by McIntyre, a retired Canadian mining consultant.&lt;ref name="Andrew C. Revkin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/science/earth/28hack.html?_r=1|title=Hacked E-Mail Data Prompts Calls for Changes in Climate Research|last=Revkin|first=Andrew C.|date=Nov 27, 2009|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|page=1|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
In 2004 [[Stephen McIntyre]] blogged on his website climate2003.com about his efforts with [[Ross McKitrick]] to get an extended analysis of the [[hockey stick graph]] into the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], {{ISBN|978-0-85265-229-9}}, pp. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="climate2003 2sept04"&gt;{{Citation|last=McIntyre |first=Stephen |title=Welcome to Climate2003 |url=http://www.climate2003.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040902191048/http://www.climate2003.com/ |year=2004 |archivedate=2 September 2004 |accessdate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}, {{Citation|last=McIntyre |first=Stephen |last2=McKitrick |first2=Ross |title=M&amp;M03 Page |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/trc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040912085554/http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/trc.html |date=1 July 2004 |archivedate=12 September 2004 |accessdate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2004 McIntyre posted comments on climate2003.com about a piece by [[William Connolley]] circulated on various blogs, and on 26 October wrote, "Maybe I’ll start blogging some odds and ends that I’m working on. I’m going to post up some more observations on some of the blog criticisms."&lt;ref name="climate2003 5jan05"&gt;{{Citation  | last = McIntyre | first = Stephen | title = Welcome to Climate2003 | url = http://www.climate2003.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050124025310/http://climate2003.com/ |date= 5 January 2005 | archivedate = 24 January 2005 | accessdate = 10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December [[Michael E. Mann]] and nine other scientists launched the [[RealClimate]] website as "a resource where the public can go to see what actual scientists working in the field have to say about the latest issues."&lt;ref name="sciam behind hs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=behind-the-hockey-stick |title=Behind the Hockey Stick |author=David Appell |authorlink= |date=February 21, 2005 |publisher=Scientific American |quote= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On climate2003.com McIntyre noted this development in a blog post on 10 December, where he wrote "Mann and some of his colleagues have set up a blog at the above address. A couple of Mann's first postings have been arguments against our papers. I'll post up a two quick comments below."&lt;ref name="climate2003 5jan05" /&gt; On 2 February 2005 McIntyre set up his Climate Audit blog, having found difficulties with posting comments on the climate2003.com layout.&lt;ref name="ClimateAudit 2feb05"&gt;{{Citation | last = McIntyre | first = Stephen | title = Climate Audit | url = http://www.climateaudit.org/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050204094607/http://www.climateaudit.org/ | date = 2 February 2005 | archivedate = 4 February 2005 | accessdate = 10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr [[Judith Curry]] of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] has said "McIntyre started the blog climateaudit.org so that he could defend himself against claims being made at the blog Realclimate with regards to his critique of the “hockey stick” since he was unable to post his comments there". She has also referred to this site as one of several "Climate Auditor" websites.&lt;ref name="Judith Curry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2010/02/opinion-can-scientists-rebuild.html|title=Can scientists rebuild the public trust in climate science?|last=Curry|first=Judith|date= February 24, 2010|publisher=[[Physics Today]]|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climatic Research Unit information requests and email controversy==
{{See also|Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit|Climatic Research Unit email controversy}}
After the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|UK Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) came into effect in 2005, Climate Audit readers were asked to make FOI requests to the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA) for the raw data from [[weather station]]s used in developing [[instrumental temperature record]] [[dataset]]s, for copies of agreements under which the raw data was obtained from [[List of meteorology institutions|meteorology institutions]], and also for email correspondence relating to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]].&lt;ref name="Pearce 143"&gt;{{citation

On 12 August 2009, Olive Heffernan wrote in ''[[Nature (journal)|naturenews]]'' that  "Since 2002, Steve McIntyre, the editor of Climate Audit, a blog that investigates the statistical methods used in climate science, has repeatedly asked Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, UK, for access to monthly global surface temperature data held by the institute. But in recent weeks, Jones has been swamped by a sudden surge in demands for data". She described how CRU had received 58 FOIA requests between 24 and 29 July 2009 from McIntyre or others associated with the blog. The raw data was restricted to academics, and the unit's director [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] said that the data was subject to confidentiality agreements with various governments, but he was seeking agreement to get the raw data available online. He said that “Data release needs to be done in a systematic way.”&lt;ref name="Heffernan_2010-08-12_Nature" /&gt;

The site was one of the first to receive word of the e-mails which had been leaked&lt;ref name="AFP_2010-08-30_GN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spotts_2010-08-30_CSM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Helderman_2010-08-31_WP" /&gt; from the University of East Anglia with Jonathan Leake of ''[[The Times]]'' writing, "The storm began with just four cryptic words. 'A miracle has happened,' announced a contributor to Climate Audit, a website devoted to criticising the science of climate change."&lt;ref name="Jonathan Leake"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6936289.ece|title=The great climate change science scandal|last=Leake|first=Jonathan|date=November 29, 2009|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=4 May 2010|quote="IT was against this background that the emails were leaked last week"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Gray wrote in [[The Daily Telegraph]], "Climate Audit was one of the first to post up the stolen emails from the University of East Anglia that led to the 'climategate' scandal".&lt;ref name="Louise Gray"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7564065/Climate-change-Key-influencers-in-the-debate.html|title=Climate change: Key influencers in the debate|last=Gray|first=Louise |date=9 Apr 2010|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] said of the controversy, "Web sites and blogs including the Climate Audit Mirror Site have carried copies of e-mails, correspondence between climatologists and commentary. In one e-mail cited widely on blogs including Climate Audit, Phil Jones writes about completing “Mike’s nature trick of adding in the real temps” in order to hide the decline."&lt;ref name="Jim Efstathiou Jr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601124&amp;sid=an0YbipgqczQ|title=U.K. Climate Scientist Steps Down After E-Mail Flap (Update4|last=Efstathiou Jr|first=Jim|author2=Alex Morales|date=Dec 2, 2009|publisher=[[Bloomberg.com]]|page=1|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Antonio Regalado writing in ''Science Insider'', Jones wrote e-mails stating that he convinced the university's FOI managers to not release data to "greenhouse skeptics" because Jones believed that they planned to harm the UAE or setback climate science by drawing scientists into disputes, wasting research time.&lt;ref name="ScienceInsider_2009-11-23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/11/in-climate-hack.html|title=In Climate Hack Story, Could Talk of Cover-Up Be as Serious as Crime?|author=Antonio Regalado|date=2009-11-23|accessdate=2010-09-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310215043/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/11/in-climate-hack.html|archivedate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Think I've managed to persuade UEA to ignore all further FOIA requests if the people have anything to do with Climate Audit," Jones wrote in 2007.&lt;ref name="ScienceInsider_2009-11-23" /&gt; The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' Science and Technology Committee largely vindicated the scientists involved in the scandal, but left consideration of the quality of the science and the conduct of the research to committees chaired by [[Lord Oxburgh]] and [[Sir Muir Russell]]. [[Fox News]] said that McIntyre "who also worked at the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] and submitted notes to the Science and Technology Committee for its investigation, wrote a lengthy rebuttal of the decision on his blog", and disputed the committee's conclusion that the word ''trick'' "appears to be a colloquialism for a 'neat' method of handling data".&lt;ref name="FOXNews_2010-03-31"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/03/31/climate-gate-inquiry-largely-clears-scientists/|title=Scientists Cleared -- After One-Day Probe|date=2010-03-31|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further investigations by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the [[Inspector General]] of the [[United States Department of Commerce]] and the  [[Office of the Inspector General]] (OIG) of the [[National Science Foundation]] reaffirmed that the accusations against the scientists were unfounded.

==Reception==
[[James Hansen]], the former director of NASA's [[Goddard Institute]], has dismissed McIntyre as a "court jester".&lt;ref name=Jolis&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704335904574496850939846712?mod=googlenews_wsj&amp;mg=reno64-wsj Global warming's most dangerous apostate speaks out about the state of climate change science.] by Anne Jolis, [[Wall Street Journal]],  Nov. 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"If a single person can be credited with setting the stage for [[Climategate]], it's Stephen McIntyre, the retired mining consultant behind the popular skeptic blog Climate Audit," wrote Kate Sheppard at ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref name=MJo&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/04/history-of-climategate Climategate: What Really Happened?], [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]],  Apr. 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  "Emails from this period show the scientists lashing out against McIntyre. He is referred to as a "bozo " and "a playground bully ." McIntyre clearly gets a rise out of irking scientists, whom he frequently refers to as 'the Team'—another play on the hockey-stick metaphor. He likes to 'tease these guys and kind of make fun of them,' he says, and their evident aggravation at his inquiries only egged him on. 'I think it was a mistake for them to in effect adopt a fatwa against Climate Audit,' says McIntyre." &lt;ref name=MJo/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7749">'''Conflict [[economics]]''' is a branch of economics that puts the allocation of resources by means of violent fighting, i.e. conflict, into [[economic models]].

In traditional economics, appropriation is a non-violent process that is guaranteed by perfect property rights and their costless enforcement.&lt;ref name="besley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Besley |first=Timothy |last2=Ghatak |first2=Maitreesh |title=Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 5 |year=2009 |publisher=North Holland |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-444-52944-2 |pages=4252–4595 |editor1-last=Rodrick |editor1-first=Dani |editor2-last=Rosenzweig |editor2-first=Mark R. |chapter=Property Rights and Economic Development |url=http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/mghatak/handbook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conflict economics sheds a different light on appropriation. It is set in a model of contest between two players. Conflict economics introduces the idea that [[Agent (economics)|agents]] have to decide between production of [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and production of guns, i.e. tools that have the sole purposes of appropriating the resources produced by the other player. Different models are introduced to illustrate various situations that have similarities to real life conflicts.

==Resource conflict model==
Two parties contest a given resource Z. The player who wins the contest claims the entire resource, not leaving anything for the losing party. The [[Probability|probabilities]] of winning are determined by each party’s choice of guns.

==Guns vs. butter model==
In this model, agents face a [[trade-off]] between producing themselves and grabbing the [[Output (economics)|output]] of the other agent. Each party is endowed with a secure resource R. The resource cannot be [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]] directly but has to be allocated between producing guns (tools for conflict) or butter (consumption). Again, the probability of winning the contest and grabbing the other output depend on the relative numbers of guns produced.  This model allows testing of different [[power structure]]s between the players. One of the interesting outcomes is that if one agent has higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], i.e. if he uses one unit of the resource he will gain more butter than his opponent would, he will receive a relatively lower expected pay-off. This is due to the fact that each player will then exploit his or her [[comparative advantage]], with the more productive player producing more butter and the less productive player producing more guns, resulting in a higher chance of winning the conflict thus leading to a higher expected [[payoff matrix|pay-off]].&lt;ref name=hirshleifer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirshleifer |first=Jack |title=THE PARADOX OF POWER |journal=Economics and Politics |date=1 November 1991 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=177–200 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0343.1991.tb00046.x |url=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/people/papers/hirshleifer/hirshleifer190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement in the shadow of conflict==
Conflict is not the only way that parties can appropriate resources. Depending on the [[risk#Risk attitude.2C appetite and tolerance|risk preferences]] of the agents, a simple division of the contested resource according to a settlement can be envisioned. A two-stage [[Game theory|game]] serves to illustrate this. In the first stage, parties make their gun choices. In the second stage, negotiations take place. If the negotiations are successful, the players agree on a division and share the good.

If the negotiations are not successful, conflict ensues with the winning party again taking the whole resource. This two-stage model is especially interesting if one includes the possibility of destruction into the model, i.e. in case of conflict the winner is left with only a part of the contested resource. Parties might prefer settlement over conflict if they have an aversion to uncertainty (outcome of conflict dependent on probabilities) or destruction.

However, in the long term conflict might be the dominant strategy. Introducing a discount rate for payoffs in the future might induce players to start conflict in the present. Defeating your opponent in the present will secure the resource for you in the future (opponent is eliminated), thus not having to share it in a settlement.&lt;ref name="ssrn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garfinkel |first1=Michelle R. |last2=Skaperdas |first2=Stergios |title=Economics of conflict: an overview |journal= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.895307 |ssrn=895307 |date=1 January 2006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict, alliances and group structures==
Conflict might not occur between two agents only, but a number of agents can be involved in hostilities. Individuals and parties have been repeatedly proven to form [[Political alliance|alliances]] to achieve a common goal. There are cost advantages to be realized&lt;ref name="noh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noh |first=Suk Jae |title=Resource distribution and stable alliances with endogenous sharing rules |journal=[[European Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=129–151 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |doi=10.1016/S0176-2680(01)00072-6 |date=March 2002 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0176-2680(01)00072-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the sum of individual efforts creates [[synergy#Human synergy|synergies]] that cannot be realized by individuals on their own.&lt;ref name="skaperdas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skaperdas |first=Stergios |title=On the formation of alliances in conflict and contests |journal=[[Public Choice (journal)|Public Choice]] |volume=96 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–42 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |doi=10.1023/A:1004912124496 |jstor=30024376 |date=July 1998 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004912124496 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However one has to keep in mind that if individuals work together there are always [[incentive]]s for "free riding."&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Mancur |authorlink=Mancur Olson |title=The logic of collective action: public goods and the theory of groups |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1971 |origyear=1965 |edition=revised |isbn=978-0-674-53751-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In conflict economics, group conflict builds upon the resource conflict model. A two-stage game is constructed. In the first stage (inter-group conflict) groups and individuals compete for the resource. The probabilities of winning depend on the effort, i.e. number of guns, that individuals are contributing to the group. In the second stage (intra-group conflict) the successful group allocates the won resource among its members. This allocation can be according to the efforts that individuals spent, contracts or just an equal distribution according to the number of members.

However group structures have been found to be more unstable the higher the number of individuals there are in the group. Individuals have higher [[payoff matrix|expected payoff]] by switching to a group with less individuals or forming a stand-alone alliance. For alliances to be stable they have to be roughly the same sizes&lt;ref name="yi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yi |first=Sang-Seung |title=Stable coalition structures with externalities |journal= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2071 |ssrn=2071 |date=1 January 1996   |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[symmetric]].&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt;

The '''Arab Democratic Socialist Ba'ath Party''' ({{lang-ar|حزب البعث الديمقراطي العربي الاشتراكي}} ''Hizb Al-Ba'ath Al-Dimuqratiy Al-'Arabi al-Ishtiraki''; [[French language|French]]: ''Parti Baath arabe socialiste démocratique'') is a [[Ba'athism#Neo-Ba'athism|neo-Ba'athist]] [[political party]] founded in 1970 and led by [[Brahim Makhous]], a former Syrian foreign minister. It is a remnant of [[Salah Jadid]]'s [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region]]. The party is based in [[Paris]], [[France]] and joined the [[National Democratic Rally (Syria)|National Democratic Rally]] coalition in 1981.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/10/democratic-socialist-arab-baath-party/djfo|title=The Democratic Socialist Arab Baath Party |publisher=Carnegie Middle East Center|accessdate=2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Unlike historic [[Ba'athism]] which advocates Ba'athist [[Single-party state|political control of the state]], the Arab Democratic Socialist Ba'ath Party supports [[Democracy|democratic]] [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. The party advocates the implementation of the laws enshrining [[freedom of speech]], [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[Equal opportunity|equality of opportunities]] that, although included in the [[Constitution of Syria|constitution]], are not enforced. The party also supports the concept of [[Class conflict|class struggle]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie Center"/&gt;

==Syrian Civil War==
The Arab Democratic Socialist Ba'ath Party joined the [[National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change]] following the beginning of the [[Syrian Civil War]], and has advocated dialogue with the government to ensure a handover of power whilst rejecting both external military intervention and the arming of the opposition. The party also supported [[Kofi Annan]]'s [[Kofi Annan Syrian peace plan|peace plan]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie Center"/&gt; The party also has representation in the [[Syrian Democratic Council]] (the political wing of the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurdish-Arab coalition in Syria creates political wing|publisher=Ekurd Daily|url=http://ekurd.net/syria-kurd-arab-political-wing-2015-12-10|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Assembly for Democracy and the Left in Syria]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Dental assistants''' (also known as dental nurses) are members of the dental team.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt; They may support a dental operator (such as a [[dentist]] or other treating [[dental auxiliary]]) in providing more efficient [[dentistry|dental treatment]]. ''Dental assistants'' are distinguished from other groups of [[Dental auxiliary|dental auxiliaries]] (such as [[dental therapist]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s and [[dental technician]]s) by differing training, roles and patient scopes.&lt;ref name="ADA_Careers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt;

== History ==

=== The first dental assistant ===
[[File:Dr. James McCarl and dental assistant with young patient.jpg|thumb|Infection control was very different in historical dentistry when compared to dentistry nowadays in 2018. Dental assistants and dentists did not wear all or if any personal protection equipment when practicing. We can see that the dentist, in this case on the left, is not wearing a mask, gloves or eye protection (apart from his glasses). Additionally, the dental assistant on the right, is also not wearing any gloves, mask or eye protection.]]
The first dental assistant in modern history is believed to trace back to 1885. Dr Edmund Kells, a pioneering dentist operating from New Orleans, enlisted the help of his wife, Malvina Cueria to assist him during dental procedures.&lt;ref name="Langland_1972"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langland OE | title = C. Edmund Kells | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, and Oral Pathology | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 680–9 | date = October 1972 | pmid = 4560600 | doi = 10.1016/0030-4220(72)90353-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DCE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dentalcareersedu.org/2015/06/the-birth-of-the-dental-assistant-profession/|title=The Birth of the Dental Assistant Profession |date=2015 | website = Dental Careers Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dental field was initially dominated by males, but after this first addition of a female, it was then acceptable for women to seek dental treatment without their husbands. This led to dental assistants of that era also being known as "Ladies in Attendance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Tija | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011|title=Assisting; Past present, and future|url=https://www.dentistryiq.com/articles/2011/12/assisting--past-present.html|journal=Dentistry IQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the addition of [[Women in dentistry|women to dentistry]], the profession flourished with more and more women seeking treatment and more patients overall receiving care.&lt;ref name="DCE" /&gt;

=== The first association ===
It was not until almost four decades later that in 1923 the first dental assistant association was founded by [[Juliette southard|Juliette Southard]], named the American Dental Assistant Association and it is still in practise now.&lt;ref name="ADAA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adaausa.org/About-ADAA/History-of-ADAA|title=History of ADAA|last=|first=|date=2018| website = American Dental Assistants Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began with just five members, now reaching more than 10,000.&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt;

== Roles ==

The dental assistant's role is often thought to be to support the dental operator by typically passing [[Dental instruments|instruments]] during clinical procedures. However, in fact, their role extends much further to include: providing patients help with their oral hygiene skills, preparing the patient for treatment, sterilising instruments, assisting during general anaesthetic dental procedures, positioning suction devices, exposing dental [[Radiography|radiographs]], taking [[dental impression]]s, recording patient notes and administration roles such as scheduling appointments.&lt;ref name="ADA_Careers"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.adansw.com.au/Careers/Dental-Assistant | website = Australian Dental Association |date=16 May 2018| title = Dental Assistant }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ATOMO_Dental_premium_quality_barrier_film_for_dental_clinics.jpg|thumb|Plastic barriers that are typically used to cover dental equipment for infection control purposes.]]

=== Infection control ===
It was customary for oral health care workers and dental assistants in the 1980s to practice oral health care without wearing gloves, masks or eye protection.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oosthuysen J, Potgieter E, Fossey A | title = Compliance with infection prevention and control in oral health-care facilities: a global perspective | journal = International Dental Journal | volume = 64 | issue = 6 | pages = 297–311 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25244364 | doi = 10.1111/idj.12134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was at a crucial time due to the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) spreading rapidly at a global rate.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt; However, in 2018 gloves, masks and eye protection have become part of the standard [[infection control]] guidelines which has been implemented in all oral health care settings as a means of preventing the spread of [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease]].&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.org.au/Dental-Professionals/Publications/Infection-Control/Guidelines-for-Infection-Control/1ADA_GuidelinesforInfectionControl_3|title=Guidelines for Infection Control| website = Australia Dental Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infection control]] in oral health care not only protects the patient but it also protects the oral health care workers.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt; This includes: [[dentist]]s, dental specialists, oral health therapists, dental hygienists and dental assistants.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt;

Dental assistants play a crucial role in maintaining high levels of [[infection control]] in the oral health care setting.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt; The dental assistant is the major link between oral health care workers and the patient.&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manasi R|date= December 2016 | title=Awareness about Occupational Exposure for Blood Borne Infections among Medical and Dental Students |journal=Journal of Medical Science and Clinical Research|volume=04|issue=12|pages=14898–14902|doi=10.18535/jmscr/v4i12.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To perform infection control responsibilities well, the dental assistant must have the appropriate education, training and work experience. Examples of infection control protocols that the dental assistant needs to follow in an oral health setting include:

=== Hand hygiene  ===

[[Hand washing|Hand hygiene]] aims to reduce the number of [[microorganism]]s on hands. [[Antimicrobial agents]] such as alcohol-based hand rub or [[antimicrobial]] soap and water are effective agents to remove most [[antimicrobial agents|antimicrobial]] [[bacteria]] on hands in dental settings.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016" /&gt;

=== Personal protective equipment (PPE)  ===

Gloves, gown and eye protection are essential barrier protection items that enable the dental assistant to reduce the transmission of [[infectious diseases]] to themselves, other dental co-workers and patients.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016" /&gt; Gloves and masks need to be disposed after each patient, eyewear can be disposable or reusable and gowns need to be replaced if visibly soiled.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016" /&gt; Lastly, footwear must include leather closed toe shoes; this minimises the risk of sharps injury.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Surgical procedures and aseptic technique  ===

It is crucial to wear sterile gloves when the dental assistant is assisting in surgery with the oral health care clinician.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Hand hygiene using [[antimicrobial]] soap and water is imperial to maintaining adequate [[infection control]] in this setting, as this minimises the risk of [[infection]].&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Management of sharps injury  ===

It is crucial that sharp instruments which include: needles, scalers, scalpels, burs, orthodontics bands and endodontic files need to be handled with care and appropriate techniques to minimise any potential sharps injury.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Sharps also need to be disposed accordingly into the sharps containers, separate from other disposable bins.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; The dental assistant needs to be aware of what is required to go into the sharps containers and what is not.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; This minimises the chance of spreading [[infectious diseases]].&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;
[[File:Container_for_medical_sharp_and_infectious_waste.jpg|thumb|Container for medical sharps and infectious waste - typically found in dental surgeries.]]

=== Management of clinical waste  ===

It is imperative that when performing change over, that the dental assistant is able to distinguish the difference between medical related waste compared to contaminated waste.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Contaminated waste needs to be placed in a leak proof thick yellow bag with a [[biohazard symbol]] label.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Environment  ===

The dental assistant should put on new gloves when cleaning working surfaces during the changeover between patients.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; They must also be able to distinguish between clean and dirty zones as this minimises the spread of [[infectious diseases]] between co-workers and patients.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Additionally, plastic barriers are placed on: instruments such as; hand pieces connected to the chair, overhead lights, amalgamators, [[x-ray machine]]s, mixing materials and other miscellaneous [[dental instruments]], materials or appliances.&lt;ref name="Prathima_2017"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Prathima V, Vellore KP, Kotha A, Malathi S, Kumar VS, Koneru M | date = May 2017 | title = Knowledge, attitude and practices towards eco-friendly dentistry among dental practitioners | url = http://portaldeperiodicos.unisul.br/index.php/JR_Dentistry/article/view/4816 | journal = Journal of Research in Dentistry | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 123–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the roles that the dental assistant participates in is changing these plastic barriers after each patient has left that surgery.&lt;ref name="Prathima_2017" /&gt; This ensures that the surgery is set up ready for the next patient.&lt;ref name="Prathima_2017" /&gt;

* These infection control procedures and protocols not only apply to the dental assistant, but to all co-workers in the oral health care setting.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; However, the dental assistant is the major connection between the patient and the oral health care clinician.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Therefore, it is imperative that they follow these guidelines to minimise the risk of spreading possible [[infectious diseases]] to co-workers, patients and themselves.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Sterilisation, disinfectant and antiseptic ===
Dental assistants play a large role in ensuring that the reusable [[dental instruments]] used daily in dental practices are sterilised adequately after each use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ball | first1 = Samantha | name-list-format = vanc | title = Duty of care | journal = Dental Nursing | date = September 2011 | volume = 7 | issue = Sup1 | pages = S4–S5 | doi = 10.12968/denn.2011.7.Sup1.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilisation]] is an essential part of the [[infection control]] protocol. This can be defined as free of all life forms where the elimination of considerable number of the most heat resistant spores (bacterial and mycotic) is the basic criteria sterilisation. Sterilisation process consists of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bev|first=Wasp | name-list-format = vanc |date=October 2013|title=A Review of Pre-Sterilisation Cleaning Methods | doi = 10.12968/denn.2013.9.Sup2.20 |journal=Dental Nursing|volume=9|pages=20–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Autoclaving]] where moist heat kills bacteria by denaturation of high protein- containing bacteria at 250F (121&amp;nbsp;°C) for 15 to 20 minutes or 270 F for 3 minutes. Biological monitors and Process indicators are 2 methods used to ensure the effectiveness of sterilization process.   
## Biological monitor (spore test) where bacterial spores are placed in strips or envelops along with the instruments. This method shows that the microorganisms have been eradicated and must be conducted weekly.   
## Process indicators; where the load has reached a certain temperature, the indicators change their colour.   
# [[Dry heat sterilization]] which requires a higher temperature and longer time (1–2 hours) than steam autoclave, therefore, only glass or metal objects can be steamed by dry heat.  
# Chemiclave by using Ethylene oxide at relatively low temperature for 2–3 hours.  
# Cold/ chemical test which can be done by soaking instruments (heat- sensitive) in a specific chemical solution such as 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 hours in order to kill bacterial spores. However, this method does not destroy hepatitis viruses and spores.

[[Disinfectant]] is also one of the major roles of dental assistant where chemicals applied to inanimate surfaces such as lab tops, counter tops, headrests, light handles, etc. This is to make sure that germicide and/or microbiostatic are achieved.&lt;ref name = "US"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sydney.edu.au/whs/guidelines/biosafety/decontamination_guidelines.shtml |title=Decontamination of Decontamination of Clinical/Biological Waste and Spill Management  | publisher = The University of Sydney }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery|Antiseptic]] chemical agents similar to disinfectants but they may be applied safely to living tissue, is another task for dental assistant where Alcohol is the most commonly used.&lt;ref name = "US" /&gt;

=== Health promotion ===
Dental assistants make a difference in the community by participating in [[health promotion]] activities and programs. These programs may take place at schools, preschools, [[immunisation]] events or at [[maternal health]] clinics. Dental operators may also be supported by dental assistants during pre-school or school screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall M, Christian B | title = A health-promoting community dental service in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: protocol for the North Richmond model of oral health care | journal = Australian Journal of Primary Health | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 407–414 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28823310 | doi = 10.1071/PY17007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dental assistants can extend their scope to provide oral health promotion to patients in Australia by completing the Certificate IV in Dental Assisting (Oral Health Promotion).&lt;ref name="Dyer_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dyer TA, Brocklehurst P, Glenny AM, Davies L, Tickle M, Issac A, Robinson PG | title = Dental auxiliaries for dental care traditionally provided by dentists | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 8 | pages = CD010076 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25140869 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010076.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dental assistant will have the ability to implement an individualised oral health promotion program and oral hygiene program. After the appropriate training the dental assistant may; 
[[File:Group session oral health promotion Nepal.JPG|thumb|Health promotion for good oral health.]]
[[File:Altenheim 05.jpg|thumb|Residential aged care and dental assistants engaging in recreational activities - its not always about teeth.]]

# Promote the dental team concept in achieving good oral health and promoting good oral hygiene habits                                          
# Assist in making dental treatment accessible and affordable to the community
# Perform health promotion activities by promoting good oral health to the community
# Support and educate on oral health promotion to allied health professionals

Dental assistants help other dental and allied health professionals in health promotion. These dental assistants implement oral health programs by providing resources and presentation promoting oral health messages to several target groups and community settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petersen PE, Torres AM | title = Preventive oral health care and health promotion provided for children and adolescents by the Municipal Dental Health Service in Denmark | journal = International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–91 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10530216 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-263x.1999.00111.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settings include:

* [[Assisted living|Residential Aged Care]] Facilities                                                                                                                                                    
* [[Special needs dentistry|Special Needs]]                                                                                                                                                                              
* Schools
* Early childhood services                                                                                                                                                             
* Culturally diverse communities
* Community sport clubs

Dental assistant can educate the community and schools by advising on:

* Oral diseases
* Diet analysis and counselling
* Oral hygiene strategies
* Preventive strategies
* Care of fixed &amp; removable prosthesis and fixed appliances 
* [[Smoking cessation]]
* Preventing sports injuries

=== Radiography ===
Currently in [[Australia]], dental assistants are not required to be registered under the Dental Board of Australia.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; However, dental assistants who have attained their certificate IV in dental assisting – [[Dental radiography|Dental Radiography]] must hold a current license with the relative state or territory radiation authority.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; Dental assistants that decide to take on further study into their certificate IV in dental assisting - dental radiography, have an advantage of exposing patients to radiation also known as an x-ray, with regards to oral health care.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; The dental assistant will take training to further their practical and theoretical skills relevant to the role of the dental radiographer.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; 
[[File:Dental Radiography.JPG|thumb|Dental Radiography - pictures of intra oral radiographs of the whole mouth.]]Upon successful completion of the training program dependent on the course structure, the dental assistant may:

Expose [[Intraoral|intra-oral]] radiographs that ensures an optimum radiographic image.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dentalnursingaustralia.com/SHORT%20COURSE%20DENTAL%20RADIOGRAPHY%202015.pdf|title = Short Course Dental Radiology| website = Dental Nursing Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;nowiki/&gt;Process, mount and file [[Intraoral|intra-ora]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l radiographs.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* Able to identify technical faults&lt;nowiki/&gt; and their causes.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* Be able to demonstrate an understanding of potential hazards of exposure to [[radiation]] and to practice high standards of [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* To recognise normal [[anatomy]].&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* Maintain [[infection control]] throughout all practical procedures.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;

== Potential future roles ==

=== Aging population ===
[[File:Basic_dental_screening_150218-N-QK202-017.jpg|thumb|School screening where children are screened for dental decay or gum disease or other abnormalities of the mouth.]]Looking to the future of dentistry and oral health, the roles for dental assistants are ever-changing and expanding. With the increase in an ageing population, it will become more and more commonplace for dental assistants to be employed to support dental operators with providing oral health promotion and treatment within [[Residential care facility|residential care]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Better oral health in residential care: staff portfolio | date = 2009 | publisher = South Australian Dental Service, Government of South Australia | location = Adelaide | isbn = 978-0-7308-9791-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing demand to match new dental graduates ===

The number of newly graduated dentists and dental auxiliaries is increasing and with that the need for dental assistants.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kracher C, Breen C, McMahon K, Gagliardi L, Miyasaki C, Landsberg K, Reed C | title = The Evolution of the Dental Assisting Profession | journal = Journal of Dental Education | volume = 81 | issue = 9 | pages = eS30–eS37 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28864801 | doi = 10.21815/JDE.017.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics of America the rate of employed dental assistants will likely increase by 18% in the ten years between 2014 and 2024.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt; With an increase in dental assistants comes the possibility of extension in the dental assistant roles and scope. As seen in some states of the United States of America, dental assistants are able to perform some simple [[Dental filling|fillings]] with the supervision of a practising dentist.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt; By allowing dental assistants to extend their scope alongside the appropriate training, the workload of the other members of the dental team is lessened and increases efficiency of the dental clinic management. This may have the potential to reach other countries in the future as the need for dental and oral health treatments increase.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt;

== Variations around the world ==
Dental assistant roles can vary depending on different country qualifications and regulations. Below are examples of dental assisting roles which the dental assistant is able to perform, respective to that country.

=== Australia ===
[[File:Australian_Flag_Flying_animated.gif|thumb|Australian Flag - animated.]]
According to the Australian Government, Department of Health, in 2006 there were 15,381 registered dental assistants supporting dental operators. Of those, 171 were Indigenous.

In Australia Dental Assistants should have the following skills:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ada.org.au/Careers/Dental-Team/Assistant | title = Careers in Dentistry - Australian Dental Association| website =  Australian Dental Association |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paschall L | title = The professional dental assistant | journal = Dental Assistant | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 4, 47 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24741898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* have excellent communication skills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Breen C | title = Tips to enhance effective communication skills for the dental assistant | journal = Dental Assistant | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 4, 6 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23513388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* enjoy interacting with other people
* be organised and an efficient manager of their time
* be meticulous and pays great attention to detail
* possess good manual dexterity
* enjoy responsibility
* have the ability to comprehend and follow instructions
* be skilled at multitasking

Dental Assistants work as part of a wider dental team, primarily with Dentists, but also with Dental Specialists, Oral Health Therapists, Dental Therapists, Dental Technitions, Dental Hygienists and Dental Prosthetists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| date = May 2012 | editor-last = Limeback | editor-first = Hardy | name-list-format = vanc | title = Comprehensive Preventive Dentistry | doi = 10.1002/9781118703762 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Ames, Iowa | isbn = 978-1-118-70376-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Segal L, Marsh C, Heyes R | title = The real cost of training health professionals in Australia: it costs as much to build a dietician workforce as a dental workforce | journal = Journal of Health Services Research &amp; Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–98 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28429975 | doi = 10.1177/1355819616668202 | pmc = 5347354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Dental assistants perform limited and restricted duties and are not permitted to perform any of the following:&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapa.asn.au/home/working-in-australia|title= Working in Australia | website = The Dental Assistants Professional Association |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser HJ | title = The training and examination of dental nurses in New Zealand and Australia | journal = British Dental Nurses' Journal | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 12 | date = 1995 | pmid = 9790009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* any irreversible procedure on the human teeth or jaw or associated structures&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;
* correcting malpositions of the human teeth or jaw or associated structures;&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;
* fitting or intra-orally adjusting artificial teeth or corrective or restorative dental appliances for a person&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;
* performing any irreversible procedure on, or the giving of any treatment or advice to, a person that is preparatory to or for the purpose of fitting, inserting, adjusting, fixing, constructing, repairing or renewing artificial dentures or a restorative dental appliance&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;

Dental Assisting is not a registered profession in Australia and as such training courses are not mandatory, although those with nationally recognised qualifications will enjoy the benefits of higher wages and better employment opportunities.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;

There is no formal training required of entry level dental assistants in order to commence or undertake work in private practice in Australia.&lt;ref name="Chrisopoulos_2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/768469756|title=Oral health and dental care in Australia : key facts and figures 2011 | first1 = Sergio | last1 = Chrisopoulos | first2 = Katie | last2 = Beckwith | first3 = Jane | last3 = Harford | name-list-format = vanc  | date = 2011 | publisher = Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|isbn=978-1-74249-266-7|location=Canberra|oclc=768469756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dental assistants gain practical experience at a place of employment although there are vocational qualifications which are nationally recognised and highly recommended for increasing a person's job prospects, remuneration, and professional development.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;

The National Vocational Qualification  HLT35015 Certificate III in Dental Assisting is the entry level of vocational training for dental assisting while  HLT45015 Certificate IV in Dental Assisting are suitable for those who seek to further their skills and duties and elect units from particular streams such as dental radiography, oral health promotion, practice administration, general anaesthesia and conscious sedation.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrisopoulos_2011" /&gt; These formal qualifications can be offered only by registered training organisations such as TAFE and professional associations while Certificate III in Dental Assisting may also be offered as a traineeship in most States of Australia and as a School-based Traineeship for years 11 and 12 in some States.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrisopoulos_2011" /&gt;

Currently dental assistants are not required to be registered under the Dental Board of Australia or with any State and Territory Boards since dental assisting is not a registered profession. Dental Assistants who have attained a Certificate IV in Dental Assisting – Dental Radiography and are required to operate dental radiography apparatus as part of their job role, must hold a current license with the relevant state or territory Radiation Authority.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;

Dental assistants are strongly encouraged to have current vaccinations for Hepatitis B, and Tetanus along with the normal childhood vaccination recommendations (Measles, mumps, varicella, polio) and influenza. Many state and territory public health care facilities and training providers will require students and workers to present evidence of Hepatitis B immunity and the results of a criminal history check prior to commencing clinical placement. Most private dental clinics will also require employees to have current vaccination records and may also require workers to undertake annual influenza vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapa.asn.au/home/dental-assistants|title=Becoming a Dental Assistant | website = The Dental Assistants Professional Association |access-date=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adavb.net/ForthePublic/DentalProfessions/DentalAssistant/tabid/230/language/en-AU/Default.aspx#ADAVB-the-voice-of-dentistry-in-Victoria-0101011101000011 |title=ADAVB &gt; For the Public &gt; Dental Professions &gt; Dental Assistant | author = ADAVB| website = Australian Dental Association Victorian Branch Inc. | access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education and licensing ====
In some U.S. states, dental assistants can work in the field without a college degree, while in other states, dental assistants must be licensed or registered/&lt;ref name = "Bird_2015" /&gt;

Dental assistants can receive formal education through academic programs at community colleges, vocational schools, career colleges, technical institutes, universities and dental schools with most programs needing only 8 to 11 months to complete.&lt;ref name = "Bird_2015" /&gt;

The Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association accredits dental assisting school programs, of which there are over 200 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ada.org/en/coda | title = Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) | website = Commission on Dental Accreditation | access-date = 2018-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a Certified Dental Assistant, or CDA, dental assistants must take the DANB (Dental Assisting National Board) CDA examination after they have completed an accredited dental assisting program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.danb.org/Home/Become-Certified/Exams-and-Certifications.aspx|title=Exams &amp; Certifications| website = Dental Assisting National Board, Inc |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those who have been trained on the job or have graduated from non-accredited programs are eligible to take the national certification examination after they have completed two years of full-time work experience as dental assistants.&lt;ref name="ADA_Education"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/careers-in-dentistry/dental-team-careers/dental-assistant/education-training-requirements-dental-assistant|title=Dental Assistant Education and Training Requirements| website = American Dental Association |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michigan Dental Association | title = The MDA's new policy on non-accredited dental assistant training programs | journal = The Journal of the Michigan Dental Association | volume = 89 | issue = 8 | pages = 50, 52–3 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17844678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dentists are willing to pay a dental assistant-in-training that has a good attitude and work ethic.&lt;ref name="ADA_Education" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hernandez A, Montellano V | title = Integrity, service and excellence: the experiences of USAF dental assistant instructors | journal = Dental Assistant | volume = 80 | issue = 6 | pages = 40–1 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22359820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA the Dental Assisting National Board offers three nationally recognised certifications, namely:&lt;ref name = "Bird_2015" /&gt;

# Certified Dental Assistant (CDA)
# Certified Orthodontic Assistant (COA)
# Certified Preventative Functions Dental Assistant (CPFDA)

Entry level working as a trainee dental nurse does not require any qualification, but progression to qualified dental nurse requires completion of a formal course of study, either part or full-time, approved by the General Dental Council. A minimum 2 GCSEs (C grade or above) in English language and maths or a science subject are usually required for part-time courses while full-time courses may require evidence of A-level or AS-level study. A level 3 apprenticeship in dental nursing is an alternative pathway to gaining the required qualifications in dental nursing.&lt;ref name = "NHS_dental_nurse" /&gt;

* communication and organisation skills
* the ability to use initiative
* good manual dexterity
* and be prepared to work closely providing support &amp; assistance during the provision of dental treatment

In the Republic of Ireland, it is often dental nurses (and teeth whitening technicians) who carry out teeth whitening procedures rather than dentists.&lt;ref name="Sheridan_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Carmen | name-list-format = vanc |date= January 2011|title=Dental nursing abroad: rules, regulations and requirements 6|journal=Dental Nursing|volume=7|issue=1|pages=36–40|doi=10.12968/denn.2011.7.1.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice mainly occurs in clinics focusing solely on laser teeth whitening. In Ireland, registration as a dental nurse with The Irish Dental Council is voluntary; however, nurses who are registered and who carry out teeth whitening may face disciplinary action if caught.&lt;ref name = "IDA_Dental_nurse"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dental Nurses | url = https://www.dentist.ie/careers-in-dentistry/dental-nurse.144.html | website = Irish Dental Association (IDA) | date = 16 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheridan_2011" /&gt;

{{Campaignbox French Wars of Religion}}

The '''Edict of Nantes''' ([[French language|French]]: ''édit de Nantes''), signed in April 1598 by [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV of France]], granted the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestants]] of [[France]] (also known as [[Huguenot]]s) substantial rights in the nation, which was still considered essentially [[Catholicism|Catholic]] at the time. In the [[edict]], Henry aimed primarily to promote civil unity.{{efn|In 1898, the tricentennial celebrated the edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the title, ''Coexister dans l'intolérance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998).}} The edict separated civil from [[religious]] unity, treated some Protestants for the first time as more than mere [[Schism (religion)|schismatics]] and [[Heresy|heretics]], and opened a path for [[secularism]] and tolerance. In offering general [[freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their [[civil rights]], including the right to work in any field or for the state and to bring grievances directly to the [[King of France|king]]. It marked the end of the [[French Wars of Religion|religious wars]] that had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.

The [[Edict of St. Germain]], promulgated 36 years before by [[Catherine de Médici]], had granted limited tolerance to Huguenots but was overtaken by events, as it was not formally registered until after the [[Massacre of Vassy]] on 1 March 1562, which triggered the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]].

The later [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which revoked the Edict of Nantes in October 1685, was promulgated by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV. It drove an exodus of Protestants and increased the hostility of Protestant nations bordering France.

==Background==
The Edict aimed primarily to end the long-running [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].{{efn|A detailed chronological account of the negotiations that led to the Edict's promulgation has been offered by Janine Garrisson, ''L'Édit de Nantes: Chronique d'une paix attendue'' (Paris: Fayard) 1998.}} Henry IV also had personal reasons for supporting the Edict. Prior to assuming the throne in 1589 he had espoused Protestantism, and he remained sympathetic to the Protestant cause: he had converted to Catholicism in 1593 only in  order to secure his position as king, supposedly saying "Paris is well worth a Mass". The Edict succeeded in restoring peace and internal  unity to France, though it pleased neither party: Catholics rejected the apparent recognition of Protestantism as a permanent element in French society and still hoped to enforce religious uniformity, while Protestants aspired to parity with Catholics. "Toleration in France was a royal notion, and the religious settlement was dependent upon the continued support of the crown."&lt;ref name="Rothrock17"&gt;George A. Rothrock, Jr., "Some Aspects of Early Bourbon Policy toward the Huguenots" ''Church History'' '''29'''.1 (March 1960:17–24) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-establishing royal authority in France required internal peace, based on limited toleration enforced by the crown. Since royal troops could not be everywhere, Huguenots needed to be granted strictly circumscribed possibilities of self-defense.&lt;ref name="Rothrock17" /&gt;

==The Edict==
[[Image:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry IV of France]] by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]].]]
The Edict of Nantes that Henry IV signed comprised four basic texts, including a principal text made up of 92 articles and largely based on unsuccessful peace treaties signed during the recent wars. The Edict also included 56 "particular" (secret) articles dealing with Protestant rights and obligations. For example, the French state guaranteed protection of French Protestants travelling abroad from the [[Inquisition]]. "This crucifies me," protested [[Pope Clement VIII]], upon hearing of the Edict. The final two parts consisted of ''brevets'' ([[letters patent]]) which contained the military clauses and pastoral clauses. These two brevets were withdrawn in 1629 by [[Louis XIII]], following a final religious civil war.

The two [[letters patent]]&lt;ref&gt;Texts published in [[Élie Benoist|Benoist]] 1693 I:62–98 (noted by Rothrock).&lt;/ref&gt; supplementing the Edict granted the Protestants&lt;!--fifty or one hundred?--&gt; safe havens (''places de sûreté''), which were military strongholds such as [[La Rochelle]], in support of which the king paid 180,000 [[écu]]s a year, along with a further 150 emergency forts (''places de refuge''), to be maintained at the Huguenots' own expense. Such an act of toleration was unusual in Western Europe,{{efn|For Eastern Europe, see [[Mehmed II#Mehmed II.27s Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans|Mehmed II's Firman on the Freedom of the Bosnian Franciscans]] or the [[Warsaw Confederation]].}} where standard practice forced subjects to follow the religion of their ruler — the application of the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''.

While it granted certain privileges to Huguenots, the edict upheld Catholicism's position as the established religion of France. Protestants gained no exemption from paying the [[tithe]]{{efn|The King engaged to support the Protestant ministers in part recompense.}} and had to respect [[feast day|Catholic holiday]]s and restrictions regarding marriage. The authorities limited Protestant freedom of worship to specified geographic areas. The Edict dealt only with Protestant and Catholic coexistence; it made no mention of [[Jew]]s, or of [[Muslim]]s, who were offered temporary asylum in France when the [[Moriscos]] were being expelled from Spain.{{efn|The ''ordonnance'' of 22 February 1610 stipulated that the emigrés settle north of the [[Dordogne]] (safely away from the manipulations of Spanish agents) and that they embrace the Catholic faith; those who did not wish to do so were granted right of passage to French ports on the Mediterranean, to take ship for [[Barbary]].&lt;ref&gt;L. P. Harvey, ''Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1614'', 2005:318&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the ''ordonnance'' was published Henri IV had been assassinated.}}

The original Act which promulgated the Edict has disappeared. The ''[[Archives Nationales]]'' in Paris preserves only the text of a shorter document modified by concessions extracted from the King by the clergy and the [[Parlement of Paris]], which delayed ten months before finally signing and setting seals to the document in 1599. A copy of the first edict, sent for safekeeping to Protestant [[Geneva]], survives. The provincial [[parlement]]s resisted in their turn; the most recalcitrant, the parlement of Rouen, did not unreservedly register the Edict until 1609.&lt;ref&gt;Rothrock 1960:23 note 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the signing is mooted. The Edict itself states merely that it is "given at [[Nantes]], in the month of April, in the year of Our Lord one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight". By the late 19th century the Catholic tradition&lt;ref&gt;Reported in Baedeker, ''Northern France'', 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; cited the signing in the "Maison des Tourelles", home of prosperous Spanish trader André Ruiz; it was destroyed by bombing in World War II.

==Revocation==
{{main|Edict of Fontainebleau}}
[[Image:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|Louis XIV, by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]]]
The Edict remained unaltered in effect, registered by the parliaments as "fundamental and irrevocable law," with the exception of the ''brevets,'' which had been granted for a period of eight years, and were renewed by Henry in 1606 and in 1611 by [[Marie de' Medici|Marie de Médecis]], who confirmed the Edict within a week of the assassination of Henry, stilling Protestant fears of another [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. The subsidies had been reduced by degrees, as Henry gained more control of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;A point made in Rothrock 1960:19.&lt;/ref&gt; By the peace of Montpellier in 1622, concluding a Huguenot revolt in Languedoc, the fortified Protestant towns were reduced to two, [[La Rochelle]] and [[Montauban]]. The ''brevets'' were entirely withdrawn in 1629, by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], following the [[Siege of La Rochelle]], in which [[Cardinal Richelieu]] blockaded the city for fourteen months.

During the remainder of Louis XIII's reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year, voiced in declarations and orders, and in case decisions in the Council, fluctuating according to the tides of domestic politics and the relations of France with powers abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Kleinman, "Changing Interpretations of the Edict of Nantes: The Administrative Aspect, 1643–1661" ''French Historical Studies'' '''10'''.4 (Autumn 1978:541–571.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1685, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the grandson of Henry IV, renounced the Edict and declared Protestantism illegal with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]. This act, commonly called the '''revocation of the Edict of Nantes'',' had very damaging results for France. While the wars of religion did not re-ignite, intense persecution of Protestants took place.  All Protestant ministers were given two weeks to leave the country unless they converted to Catholicism and all other Protestants were prohibited from leaving the country.  In spite of the prohibition, the persecution including many examples of torture caused as many as 400,000 to flee France at risk of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1685revocation.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=www.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =220 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most moved to [[Great Britain]], [[Prussia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Huguenots in South Africa|South Africa]] and the [[New France|new French colonies]] and the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America.&lt;ref&gt;See [[History of the French in Louisville]].&lt;/ref&gt; This exodus deprived France of many of its most skilled and industrious individuals, some of whom thenceforward aided France's rivals in the Netherlands and in England. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes also further damaged the perception of Louis XIV abroad, making the Protestant nations bordering France even more hostile to his regime. Upon the revocation of the edict, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] issued the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which encouraged Protestants to come to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].

Freedom to worship and civil rights for non-Catholics in France were not restored until the signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]], also known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]], by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] 102 years later, on 7 November 1787. This edict was enacted by [[parlement]] two months later, less than two years before the end of the [[Ancien Régime]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]] would fully eliminate religious discrimination in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=2012-07-14 }}, downloaded 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal and most salient provisions of Henry IV’s Edict of Nantes, as promulgated at Nantes in Brittany probably on 30 April 1598, include:&lt;ref&gt;History Guide, [http://historyguide.org/earlymod/nantes.html The Edict of Nantes (1598)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Henri, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre, to all to whom these presents come, greeting:

Among the infinite benefits which it has pleased God to heap upon us, the most signal and precious is his granting us the strength and ability to withstand the fearful disorders and troubles which prevailed on our advent in this kingdom.  The realm was so torn by innumerable factions and sects that the most legitimate of all the parties was fewest in numbers.  God has given us strength to stand out against this storm; we have finally surmounted the waves and made our port of safety,—peace for our state.  For which his be the glory all in all, and ours a free recognition of his grace in making use of our instrumentality in the good work....  We implore and await from the Divine Goodness the same protection and favor which he has ever granted to this kingdom from the beginning....

We have, by this perpetual and irrevocable edict, established and proclaimed and do establish and proclaim:

I.  First, that the recollection of everything done by one party or the other between March, 1585, and our accession to the crown, and during all the preceding period of troubles, remain obliterated and forgotten, as if no such things had ever happened....

III.  We ordain that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and reëstablished in all places and localities of this our kingdom and countries subject to our sway, where the exercise of the same has been interrupted, in order that it may be peaceably and freely exercised, without any trouble or hindrance; forbidding very expressly all persons, of whatsoever estate, quality, or condition, from troubling, molesting, or disturbing ecclesiastics in the celebration of divine service, in the enjoyment or collection of tithes, fruits, or revenues of their benefices, and all other rights and dues belonging to them; and that all those who during the troubles have taken possession of churches, houses, goods or revenues, belonging to the said ecclesiastics, shall surrender to them entire possession and peaceable enjoyment of such rights, liberties, and sureties as they had before they were deprived of them....

VI.  And in order to leave no occasion for troubles or differences between our subjects, we have permitted, and herewith permit, those of the said religion called Reformed to live and abide in all the cities and places of this our kingdom and countries of our sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences, ...  upon condition that they comport themselves in other respects according to that which is contained in this our present edict.

VII.  It is permitted to all lords, gentlemen, and other persons making profession of the said religion called Reformed, holding the right of high justice [or a certain feudal tenure], to exercise the said religion in their houses....

IX.  We also permit those of the said religion to make and continue the exercise of the same in all villages and places of our dominion where it was established by them and publicly enjoyed several and divers times in the year 1597, up to the end of the month of August, notwithstanding all decrees and judgments to the contrary....

XIII.  We very expressly forbid to all those of the said religion its exercise, either in respect to ministry, regulation, discipline, or the public instruction of children, or otherwise, in this our kingdom and lands of our dominion, otherwise than in the places permitted and granted by the present edict.

XIV.  It is forbidden as well to perform any function of the said religion in our court or retinue, or in our lands and territories beyond the mountains, or in our city of Paris, or within five leagues of the said city....

XVIII.  We also forbid all our subjects, of whatever quality and condition, from carrying off by force or persuasion, against the will of their parents, the children of the said religion, in order to cause them to be baptized or confirmed in the Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church; and the same is forbidden to those of the said religion called Reformed, upon penalty of being punished with especial severity....

XXI.  Books concerning the said religion called Reformed may not be printed and publicly sold, except in cities and places where the public exercise of the said religion is permitted.

XXII.  We ordain that there shall be no difference or distinction made in respect to the said religion, in receiving pupils to be instructed in universities, colleges, and schools; nor in receiving the sick and poor into hospitals, retreats, and public charities.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The primary purpose of '''EuroSim''' is to provide a framework for a partial [[simulation]] of a major [[European Union]] issue. 

More than two hundred students, drawn from universities in North America and Europe, participate in the simulation. All students are assigned roles, including Members of the [[European Parliament]], members of the European Commission, heads of government, and national ministers. Students prepare for the simulation at their own universities, with the help of faculty advisers and guidance that is provided through a course management website. Researching the simulation topic and the assigned roles constitutes an important part of all students' preparatory work. The simulations themselves are held over a period of four days, with the venue alternating between the U.S. and Europe annually.

Recent issues simulated include energy policy, asylum policy, food safety, enlargement, the Constitutional Convention, the [[Intergovernmental Conference]], EU neighborhood policy, Kosovo, EU-Russia relations, EU Budget, migration policy, and data retention. 

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Jan16006.JPG|thumb|right|Students "in character" during a daily meeting at EuroSim 2004.]] --&gt;== History ==
The idea for a model European Union came in the fall of 1987 when students at [[SUNY]] (State University of New York) College at Brockport asked the political science department to sponsor a [[model United Nations]]. After thorough consideration by faculty, students at [[SUNY Brockport]] agreed to be involved in a project regarding what was formerly called the European Community.

The first simulation was held on the Brockport campus, April 8–10, 1988. Involving SUNY and private New York schools, the simulation held the title SUNYMEC (State University of New York Model European Community). It wasn’t until 1992 the simulation established the label EuroSim and became a trans-Atlantic exchange with its first overseas meeting in Luxemburg. The 2003 simulation event was the first time EuroSim was a trans-Atlantic endeavor - a sure sign of the simulation’s maturity. The term “trans-Atlantic” indicates the simulation is organized and planned by faculty and students from both Europe and the United States. In fact, EuroSim 2003 was the first time the simulation was planned by U.S. and European student directors equally.
A simulation was held at the Europaisch Akademie in Otzenhausen, Germany in 2008. The 2009 EuroSim was hosted by Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, followed by a simulation at the University of Antwerp in 2010. In 2011, EuroSim moved out of New York state for the first time, with Widener University in Chester, Pennsylvania. In 2012, The University of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw, Poland held the simulation. The most recent simulation was held at East Stroudsburg University, Pennsylvania, April 4-7 2013. The next edition will be hosted by the University of Twente, the Netherlands, January 4-7 2014 on the theme of "Economic and Social Policy: Minimum Income Directive".

==Sponsorship==

EuroSim is funded and supported through sponsorship by the following organizations:
*TACEUSS, the Trans-Atlantic Consortium for European Union Studies and Simulations, a not-for-profit corporation whose members are dues-paying colleges and universities both in Europe and North America. Its mission is to conduct annual simulations of the European Union and provide study and research opportunities for students enrolled at colleges and universities within its consortium.

The '''Guards Ribbon''', {{lang-ru|(Гвардейская лента)}}, is a military decoration awarded in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1942 for the elite soviet [[Guards unit]], during the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]. The ''Guards Ribbon'' is also seen on various soviet war medals, and should not be confused with the [[Imperial Russian Army|Imperial Russian Army's]] military decoration, the [[Ribbon of Saint George]].

==History==
Sometime after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, the Soviet Government banned the [[Ribbon of Saint George]] and discouraged any usage of Russian imperial military awards after the revolution, based of the decree made by the [[Council of People's Commissars]] "On the Equalization of Rights of All Military Servicemen".&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Russia website: http://constitution.garant.ru/history/act1600-1918/5316/ (archived version: https://web.archive.org/web/20141010183043/http://constitution.garant.ru:80/history/act1600-1918/5316/)&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 1942, the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] introduced Guards ranks and Guards badges to be worn of the right side of the chest. Also included the banned [[Ribbon of Saint George]] pattern on medals and the Guards Red Banner Naval flag. In June 1943, they introduced the Guards Red Banners for the land forces and in February 1944 – for the naval forces. The patter of the [[Ribbon of Saint George]] adorned the banners exactly as in the 19th century, but the title remained de jure as the "Guards Ribbon", unlike the defunct George's ribbon. The Ribbon had barely any significance during the Soviet Union, but did serve it's usage on famous medals awarded to Red Army soldiers after the second world war, such as the [[Medal "For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945"]]. And was also worn on top of [[Soviet Navy]] caps during the Second World War. The reintroduction of the [[Ribbon of Saint George]] under a different title was part of the revival of Russian patriotism under the Soviet Union during the war. It helped boost the morale of the Red Army, alongside propaganda posters that featured [[Bogatyrs]] and famous Imperial Russian generals, such as [[Mikhail Kutuzov]]. The revival of Russian patriotism and Tsarist symbolism contradicted the Soviet Union's internationalist ideology, but was only a temporary change in behavior due to the invasion by Nazi Germany.

===Medals and insignia===
The pattern that was used for the Guards Ribbon was also used in various Soviet medals with different colors.

'''Haleh Afshar, Baroness Afshar''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|OBE|FAcSS}} ({{lang-fa|هاله افشار}}; born 21 May 1944) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[professor]] and a [[life peer]] in the [[House of Lords]]. She is a prominent [[Muslim feminism|Muslim feminist]], and characterises herself as a [[Socialist]] and a [[Shi'a Muslim]].  Her background is in [[equal opportunities]] in Britain, and before that, [[land reform]] and [[land development|development]] in [[Iran]], where she grew up, and [[journalism]] in both countries.

== Life ==
She grew up in a privileged family in Iran, part of the establishment, with a father involved in academe and politics.  The family moved to [[Paris]] in the late 1940s, where her father represented the government. Until she was fourteen, she had a [[nanny]] who bathed and dressed her; at that point she read ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and began to realise her privilege and how dependent on others she was. She persuaded her parents to allow her to go to England, where she attended a [[boarding school]] in [[Solihull]], initially speaking no English.

Whilst at college in Brighton Haleh won tickets to see The Beatles in a game of poker and even rode pillion on the motorcycle of [[Ranulph Fiennes]].

As an undergraduate at York she learned to cook (crediting "the sainted [[Delia Smith|Delia]]"). She had an agreement with her father that she would not have to marry while she was still studying, so she applied herself to her studies, completing a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from the [[New Hall, Cambridge]]. She worked as a journalist before and after her first degree. She returned to Iran in her late 20s, where she worked as a civil servant in the field of [[land reform]], and also as a journalist and [[gossip column]]ist.

In the end she married a New Zealander (the academic, Maurice Dodson) who would accept what she anticipated to be an international career. She initially thought [[childfree|motherhood was not for her]], considering it to be "de-skilling" and incredibly difficult in Britain, where the system did not allow a woman to be both a mother and a worker. She was seven months pregnant before she realised her condition, but now considers her two children to be "the best things I ever did in my life". She is a grandmother.

Afshar is the third generation of women not to veil; her maternal grandmother rejected the [[hijab]]. Her family wanted to [[Women's rights movement in Iran|extend possibilities for women]], and Haleh Afshar was one of the first cohort of Iranian women to vote, feeling she was fulfilling her mother's wishes. Many of the people she grew up with were killed in the [[Iranian Revolution]]. She thinks it would be unwise to return to her homeland, having criticised [[Ayatollah Khomeni]]'s [[Women's rights in Iran|stance on women]], saying it was unIslamic, and has been threatened because of this.

==Appointments==
Haleh Afshar is a professor in politics and [[women's studies]] at the [[University of York]], [[England]] and a visiting professor of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] at the Faculté Internationale de Droit Comparé (International Faculty of Comparative Law) at [[Robert Schuman University]] in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. Afshar serves on several bodies, notably the [[British Council]] and the [[United Nations Association]], of which she is Honorary President of International Services. She was appointed to the board of the [[Women's National Commission]] in September 2008. She has served as the Chair for the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies ([[BRISMES]]). Afshar is a founding member of the [[Muslims Women's Network]]. She has served on the [[Home Office]]'s [[working group]]s, on "engaging with women" and "preventing extremism together".

She was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2005 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57665 |date=11 June 2005 |page=9 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=196741&amp;sectioncode=26 | title = Queen's Birthday Honours List | accessdate = 10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for services to [[equal opportunities]]. On 18 October 2007 it was announced that she would be made a [[baron]]ess and join the [[House of Lords]] as a [[crossbencher|cross-bench]]  [[life peer]]. She was formally introduced into the House of Lords on 11 December 2007, as '''Baroness Afshar''', of [[Heslington]] in the County of [[North Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=58543 |date=17 December 2007 |page=18246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, she was named as one of the twenty most successful Muslim women in the UK on the Muslim Women Power List 2009. The list was a collaboration between the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]], [[Emel Magazine]] and [[The Times]], to celebrate the achievements of Muslim women in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelist2009.com/en/the-list/ The Muslim Women Power List 2009]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2009/mar/25/muslim-women-power-list?picture=345016457 Muslim Women Power List.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, she was appointed an Academician of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/poli/news/stories/academician.htm Afshar named Academician of the Academy of Social Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426223339/http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/poli/news/stories/academician.htm |date=26 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Essex Calendar|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/academic/docs/cal/former.shtm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007233550/http://www.essex.ac.uk/academic/docs/cal/former.shtm|archivedate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Afshar was nominated for the Services to Education award at the [[British Muslim Awards]].&lt;ref name="asianimage"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/10197507.Winners_honoured_at_British_Muslim_Awards/|title=Winners honoured at British Muslim Awards|work= |location= |publisher=''Asian Image''|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' or ''Prolegomena'' ("Introduction"). The book influenced 17th-century Ottoman historians like [[Kâtip Çelebi]], [[Ahmed Cevdet Pasha]] and [[Mustafa Naima]], who used the theories in the book to analyze the growth and decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-965-264-014-7| editor-last = Ayalon| editor-first = David| editor2-first = Moshe| editor2-last= Sharon| title = Studies in Islamic history and civilization: in honour of Professor David Ayalon| year = 1986| first=Bernard| last=Lewis | pages=527–530| contribution=Ibn Khaldūn in Turkey| ref = harv| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Ibn Khaldun's life is relatively well-documented, as he wrote an [[autobiography]] ({{lang|ar|التعريف بابن خلدون ورحلته غربا وشرقا}}, ''{{transl|ar|at-Taʻrīf bi-ibn Khaldūn wa-Riḥlatih Gharban wa-Sharqan}}''&lt;ref&gt;Published by Muḥammad ibn Tāwīt aṭ-Ṭanjī, Cairo 1951&lt;/ref&gt;) ("''Presenting Ibn Khaldun and his Journey West and East''") in which numerous documents regarding his life are quoted word-for-word.

Abdurahman bin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Al-Hasan bin Jabir bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abdurahman bin Ibn Khaldun, generally known as "Ibn Khaldūn" after a remote ancestor, was born in [[Tunis]] in AD 1332 (732 [[Anno hegirae|AH]]) into an upper-class [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] family of Arab descent,&lt;ref name="WP:BOMBARD" /&gt; the family's ancestor was, according to him, a [[Yemeni people|Yemeni]] Arab who shared kinship with [[Hujr ibn 'Adi|Waíl ibn Hujr]], a companion of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. His family, which held many high offices in [[Andalusia]], had emigrated to [[Tunisia]] after the fall of [[Seville]] to the [[Reconquista]] in AD 1248. Under the Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]], some of his family held political office; his father and grandfather, however, withdrew from political life and joined a mystical order. His brother, Yahya Khaldun, was also a [[historian]] who wrote a book on the [[Abdalwadid]] dynasty and
was assassinated by a rival for being the official [[historiographer]] of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=blQpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA484&amp;dq=Zakariya+Yahya+Ibn+Khaldoun&amp;hl=fr#PPA491,M1 « Lettre à Monsieur Garcin de Tassy », ''Journal asiatique'', troisième série, tome XII, éd. Société asiatique, Paris, 1841, p. 491]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Khaldun traces his descent back to the time of Muhammad through an Arab tribe from [[Yemen]], specifically the [[Hadhramaut]], which came to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 8th century, at the beginning of the Islamic conquest: "And our ancestry is from Hadhramaut, from the Arabs of Yemen, via Wa'il ibn Hujr also known as [[Hujr ibn 'Adi]], from the best of the Arabs, well-known and respected." (p.&amp;nbsp;2429, Al-Waraq's edition). However, the biographer Mohammad Enan questions his claim and suggests that his family may have been [[Muladi]]s who pretended to be of Arab origin to gain social status.&lt;ref&gt;A., Khaldun: His life and Works for Mohammad Enan&lt;/ref&gt; Enan also mentions a well-documented past tradition that certain [[Berbers|Berber]] groups delusively "aggrandize" themselves with some Arab ancestry. The motive of such inventions was always the desire for political and societal ascendancy. Some speculate that of the Khaldun family and elaborate that Ibn Khaldun himself was the product of the same Berber ancestry as the native majority of his birthplace. A point supporting that posits that his unusual focus on and admiration Maharlika Berbers reveals a deference towards them that is born of a vested interest in preserving them in the realm of conscious history. Islamic scholar Muhammad Hozien contends, "The false [Berber] identity would be valid however at the time that Ibn Khaldun's ancestors left Andulsia and moved to Tunisia they did not change their claim to Arab ancestry. Even in the times when Berbers were ruling, the reigns of Al-Marabats and al-Mowahids, et. al. The Ibn Khalduns did not reclaim their Berber heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/knts.htm#n1|title=Notes on Ibn Khaludn's Life|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaldun's tracing of his own genealogy and surname are thought to be the strongest indication of Arab Yemenite ancestry.&lt;ref name="WP:BOMBARD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Muqqadimah.

== Education ==
His family's high rank enabled Ibn Khaldun to study with the best teachers in [[Maghreb]]. He received a classical [[Madrasah|Islamic education]], studying the [[Qur'an]], which he [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorized by heart]], [[Arabic language|Arabic linguistics]]; the basis for understanding the Qur'an, [[hadith]], [[sharia]] (law) and [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence). He received certification ([[ijazah]]) for all of those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Muhammad Hozien|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Work|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm|publisher=Islamic Philosophy Online|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] Al-Abili of [[Tlemcen]] introduced him to [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], and he studied especially the works of [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]], [[Fakhr al-Din Razi|Razi]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]]. At the age of 17, Ibn Khaldūn lost both his parents to the [[Black Death]], an intercontinental [[epidemic]] of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] that hit Tunis in 1348–1349.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200605/ibn.khaldun.and.the.rise.and.fall.of.empires.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World: Ibn Khaldun and the Rise and Fall of Empires|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.aramcoworld.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following family tradition, he strove for a political career. In the face of a tumultuous political situation in North Africa, that required a high degree of skill in developing and dropping alliances prudently to avoid falling with the short-lived regimes of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm|title=IBN KHALDUN – His Life and Work|website=www.muslimphilosophy.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Ibn Khaldūn's autobiography is the story of an adventure, in which he spends time in prison, reaches the highest offices and falls again into exile.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

At the age of 20, he began his political career at the Chancellery of the Tunisian ruler Ibn Tafrakin with the position of ''Kātib al-'Alāmah'' (seal-bearer),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muslimheritage.com/article/ibn-khaldun-his-life-and-works|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works {{!}} Muslim Heritage|website=muslimheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of writing in fine [[calligraphy]] the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, Abū Ziad, the [[sultan]] of Constantine, marched on Tunis and defeated it. Ibn Khaldūn, in any case unhappy with his respected but politically meaningless position, followed his teacher Abili to [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. There, the [[Marinid]] sultan, Abū Inan Fares I, appointed him as a writer of royal proclamations, but Ibn Khaldūn still schemed against his employer, which, in 1357, got the 25-year-old a 22-month prison sentence. Upon the death of Abū Inan in 1358, Vizier al-Hasān ibn-Umar granted him freedom and reinstated him to his rank and offices. Ibn Khaldūn then schemed against Abū Inan's successor, Abū Salem Ibrahim III, with Abū Salem's exiled uncle, Abū Salem. When Abū Salem came to power, he gave Ibn Khaldūn a ministerial position, the first position to correspond with Ibn Khaldūn's ambitions.

The treatment that Ibn Khaldun received after the fall of Abū Salem through Ibn-Amar ʻAbdullah, a friend of Ibn Khaldūn's, was not to his liking, as he received no significant official position. At the same time, Amar successfully prevented Ibn Khaldūn, whose political skills he knew well, from allying with the Abd al-Wadids in Tlemcen. Ibn Khaldūn, therefore, decided to move to [[Granada]]. He could be sure of a positive welcome there since at Fez, he had helped the Sultan of Granada, the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] Muhammad V, regain power from his temporary exile. In 1364, Muhammad entrusted him with a diplomatic mission to the king of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Pedro of Castile|Pedro the Cruel]], to endorse a peace treaty. Ibn Khaldūn successfully carried out this mission and politely declined Pedro's offer to remain at his court and have his family's Spanish possessions returned to him.

In Granada, Ibn Khaldūn quickly came into competition with Muhammad's vizier, Ibn al-Khatib, who viewed the close relationship between Muhammad and Ibn Khaldūn with increasing mistrust. Ibn Khaldūn tried to shape the young Muhammad into his ideal of a wise ruler, an enterprise that Ibn al-Khatib thought foolish and a danger to peace in the country. History proved al-Khatib right, and at his instigation, Ibn Khaldūn was eventually sent back to North Africa. Al-Khatib himself was later accused by Muhammad of having unorthodox philosophical views and murdered despite an attempt by Ibn Khaldūn to intercede on behalf of his old rival.

In his autobiography, Ibn Khaldūn tells little about his conflict with Ibn al-Khatib and the reasons for his departure. Orientalist [[Muhsin Mahdi]] interprets that as showing that Ibn Khaldūn later realised that he had completely misjudged Muhammad V.

Back in Africa, the [[Hafsid]] sultan of [[Béjaïa|Bougie]], Abū ʻAbdallāh, who had been his companion in prison, received him with great enthusiasm and made Ibn Khaldūn his prime minister. Ibn Khaldūn carried out a daring mission to collect taxes among the local Berber tribes. After the death of Abū ʻAbdallāh in 1366, Ibn Khaldūn changed sides once again and allied himself with the [[Sultan of Tlemcen]], Abū l-Abbas. A few years later, he was taken prisoner by [[Abu Faris Abdul Aziz]], who had defeated the sultan of Tlemcen and seized the throne. He then entered a monastic establishment and occupied himself with scholastic duties until 1370. In that year, he was sent for to Tlemcen by the new sultan. After the death of ʻAbdu l-Azīz, he resided at Fez, enjoying the patronage and confidence of the regent.

Ibn Khaldūn's political skills and, above all, his good relationship with the wild Berber tribes were in high demand among the North African rulers, but he had begun to tire of politics and constantly switching allegiances. In 1375, he was sent by Abū Hammu, the ʻAbdu l Wadid Sultan of Tlemcen, on a mission to the Dawadida Arabs tribes of Biskra. After his return to the West, Ibn Khaldūn sought refuge with one of the Berber tribes in the west of [[Algeria]], in the town of [[Qalat Ibn Salama]]. He lived there for over three years under their protection, taking advantage of his seclusion to write the ''Muqaddimah'' "Prolegomena", the introduction to his planned history of the world. In Ibn Salama, however, he lacked the necessary texts to complete the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://alhassanain.org/english/?com=book&amp;id=1008|title=IBN KHALDUN'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REALISM|date=2016-03-26|publisher=google.com/+AlhassanainOrgNetwork|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in 1378, he returned to his native Tunis, which had meanwhile been conquered by Abū l-Abbas, who took Ibn Khaldūn back into his service. There, he devoted himself almost exclusively to his studies and completed his history of the world. His relationship with Abū l-Abbas remained strained, as the latter questioned his loyalty. That was brought into sharp contrast after Ibn Khaldūn presented him with a copy of the completed history that omitted the usual [[panegyric]] to the ruler. Under pretence of going on the [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]], something a Muslim ruler could not simply refuse permission for Ibn Khaldūn was able to leave Tunis and to sail to [[Alexandria]].

== Later life ==
[[File:Ibn Khaldoun Statue and Square, Mohandesin, Cairo.jpg|thumbnail|Ibn Khaldoun Statue and Square, [[Mohandessin]], Cairo]]
Ibn Khaldun said of Egypt, "He who has not seen it does not know the power of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-Khaldun#ref3458&lt;/ref&gt; While other Islamic regions had to cope with border wars and inner strife, the [[Mamluk]]s let Egypt experience a period of economic prosperity and high culture. However, even in Egypt, where Ibn Khaldūn lived out his days, he could not stay out of politics completely. In 1384, the Egyptian Sultan, al-Malik udh-Dhahir [[Barquq]], made him professor of the Qamhiyyah Madrasah and the grand [[qadi]] of the [[Maliki]] school of fiqh (one of four schools, the Maliki school was widespread primarily in [[Western Africa]]). His efforts at reform encountered resistance, however, and within a year, he had to resign his judgeship. A contributory factor to his decision to resign may have been the heavy personal blow that struck him in 1384, when a ship carrying his wife and children sank off the coast of Alexandria. Ibn Khaldun now decided to complete the pilgrimage to Mecca, after all.

After his return in May 1388, Ibn Khaldūn concentrated more strongly on a purely-educational function at various Cairo madrasas. At court, he fell out of favor for a time, as during revolts against Barquq, he had, apparently under duress, with other Cairo jurists, issued a [[fatwa]] against Barquq. Later relations with Barquq returned to normal, and he was once again named the Maliki ''qadi''. Altogether, he was called six times to that high office, which, for various reasons, he never held long.

In 1401, under Barquq's successor, his son Faraj, Ibn Khaldūn took part in a military campaign against the [[Mongol]] conqueror, [[Timur]], who besieged [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|Damascus]] in 1400. Ibn Khaldūn cast doubt upon the viability of the venture and really wanted to stay in Egypt. His doubts were vindicated, as the young and inexperienced Faraj, concerned about a revolt in Egypt, left his army to its own devices in [[Syria]] and hurried home. Ibn Khaldūn remained at the besieged city for seven weeks, being lowered over the city wall by ropes to negotiate with Timur, in a historic series of meetings that he reported extensively in his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bent|first=Josephine van den|date=2016-05-03|title="None of the Kings on Earth is Their Equal in ʿaṣabiyya:" The Mongols in Ibn Khaldūn's Works|journal=Al-Masāq|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–186|doi=10.1080/09503110.2016.1198535|issn=0950-3110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timur questioned him in detail about conditions in the lands of the Maghreb. At his request, Ibn Khaldūn even wrote a long report about it. As he recognized Timur's intentions, he did not hesitate, on his return to Egypt, to compose an equally-extensive report on the history of the [[Tatars]], together with a character study of Timur, sending them to the Merinid rulers in Fez (Maghreb).

Ibn Khaldūn spent the next five years in Cairo completing his autobiography and his history of the world and acting as teacher and judge. Meanwhile, he was alleged to have joined an underground party, Rijal Hawa Rijal, whose reform-oriented ideals attracted the attention of local political authorities. The elderly Ibn Khaldun was placed under arrest. He died on 17 March 1406, one month after his sixth selection for the office of the Maliki ''qadi'' (Judge).

== Works ==

=== Kitāb al-ʻIbar ===
Ibn Khaldūn main work is the '''''Kitāb al-ʻIbar''''' or "Book of Lessons" (full title: ''Kitāb al-ʻIbar wa-Dīwān al-Mubtadaʼ wa-l-Khabar fī Taʼrīkh al-ʻArab wa-l-Barbar wa-Man ʻĀṣarahum min Dhawī ash-Shaʼn al-Akbār'' "Book of Lessons, Record of Beginnings and Events in the History of the Arabs and the Berbers and Their Powerful Contemporaries"),  originally conceived as a history of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] but later expanded in focus to a [[universal history]].

The ''Kitāb al-ʻIbār''  divides into seven books.  Al-''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (Introduction),&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun the Muqaddimah. An Introduction to History.Translated from the Arabic by Franz Rosenthal. In Three Volumes. First Volume. 606 pages. Bollingen Foundation Series xliii. Princeton University Press. 1958. Prof. Dr. Darcy Carvalho. Feausp. Sao Paulo. Brazil. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/THEMUQADDIMAHVOLUME1/THE MUQADDIMAH VOLUME 1&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the first book. Books Two to Five cover [[World History]] of Humanity up to the authors own time. Books Six and Seven give the history of the [[Berber people]]s and the Maghreb.  Despite errors originating in the 14th century Fez work, [[Rawd al-Qirtas|Rawḍ al-Qirṭās]], (probably by [[Ibn Abi Zar]]), from which Khaldun drew upon, al-'Ibar remains an important source for [[Berber history]]. The historiographical work has been further criticised for its synthesis of multiple (sometimes contradictory) sources in the absence of original citations, and here Khaldun departs from the classical style of Arab historians such as [[Ibrahim ibn ar-Raqiq|Ibrahim ibn ar-Raqīq]] (~d.1028) or [[al-Mālikī]].&lt;ref&gt;See articles by Modéran and Benabbès in ''Identités et Cultures dans l'Algérie Antique'', University of Rouen, 2005 ({{ISBN|2-87775-391-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the discipline of [[sociology]], he described the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the inevitable loss of power that occurs when warriors conquer a city. According to the Arab scholar [[Sati' al-Husri]], the ''Muqaddimah'' may be read as a sociological work. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of ''[['aṣabiyyah]]'', which has been translated as "[[social cohesion]]", "group solidarity", or "[[tribalism]]". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds – psychological, sociological, economic, political – of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion. Some of Ibn Khaldun's views, particularly those concerning the ''[[Zanj]]'' people of sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Negative Images of Blacks in Some Medieval Iranian Writings |last1=Southgate|first1=Minoo|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=17|issue=1|page=15|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4310424}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been cited as a [[Racism|racist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Racism: A Global Reader|editor=Kevin Reilly, Stephen Kaufman, Angela Bodino|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2003|page=123|isbn=9780765610591}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were not uncommon for their time. According to the scholar Abdelmajid Hannoum, Ibn Khaldun's description of the distinctions between [[Berbers]] and Arabs were misinterpreted by the translator [[William McGuckin de Slane]], who wrongly inserted a "racial ideology that sets Arabs and Berbers apart and in opposition" into his translation of the ''Muqaddimah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannoum|first=Abdelmajid|date=2003|title=Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldûn Orientalist|journal=History and Theory|volume=42|issue=1|pages=77–80|jstor=3590803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most frequently cited observation drawn from Ibn Khaldūn's work is the notion that when a society becomes a great civilization (and, presumably, the dominant culture in its region), its high point is followed by a period of decay. This means that the next cohesive group that conquers the diminished civilization is, by comparison, a group of [[barbarians]]. Once the barbarians solidify their control over the conquered society, however, they become attracted to its more refined aspects, such as literacy and arts, and either assimilate into or appropriate such cultural practices. Then, eventually, the former barbarians will be conquered by a new set of barbarians, who will repeat the process.  One contemporary reader of Khaldun has read this as an early [[business cycle]] theory, though set in the historical circumstances of the mature Islamic empire.{{who|date=July 2016}}{{doubtful|date=June 2017}}{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Ibn Khaldun outlines an early example of [[political economy]]{{doubtful|date=July 2016}}. He describes the economy as being composed of [[theory of value (economics)|value-adding processes]]; that is, labour and skill is added to techniques and crafts and the product is sold at a higher value {{doubtful|date=June 2017}}.  He also made the distinction between "profit" and "sustenance", in modern political economy terms, surplus and that required for the reproduction of classes respectively.  He also calls for the creation of a science to explain society and goes on to outline these ideas in his major work, the ''Muqaddimah''. Ibn Khaldun diverged from norms that Muslim historians followed and rejected their focus on the credibility of the transmitter and focused instead on the validity of the stories and encouraged critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://evonomics.com/amazing-north-african-scholar-beat-adam-smith-half-millennium/|title=The Amazing Arab Scholar Who Beat Adam Smith by Half a Millennium – Evonomics|date=2017-06-09|work=Evonomics|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Khaldun also believed that the currency of an Islamic monetary system should have [[wikt:intrinsic|intrinsic]] value and therefore be made of [[gold]] and [[silver]] (such as the [[dirham]]). He emphasized that the weight and purity of these coins should be strictly followed: the weight of one dinar should be one ''mithqal'' (the weight of 72 grains of [[barley]], roughly 4.25 grams) and the weight of 7 dinar should be equal to weight of 10 dirhams (7/10 of a ''mithqal'' or 2.96 grams).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_34-35.htm Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', ch. 3 pt.34–35]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social thought ===
Ibn Khaldun's epistemology attempted to reconcile mysticism with theology by dividing science into two different categories, the religious science that regards the sciences of the Qur'an and the non-religious science. He further classified the non-religious sciences into intellectual sciences such as logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, etc. and auxiliary sciences such as language, literature, poetry, etc. He also suggested that possibly more divisions will appear in the future with different societies. He tried to adapt to all possible societies’ cultural behavior and influence in education, economics and politics. Nonetheless, he didn't think that laws were chosen by just one leader or a small group of individual but mostly by the majority of the individuals of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The epistemology of Ibn Khaldun|last=Ahmad|first=Zaid|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-61275-3|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Ibn Khaldun, the state was a necessity of human society to restrain injustice within the society, but the state means is force, thus itself an injustice. All societies must have a state governing them in order to establish a society. He attempted to standardize the history of societies by identifying ubiquitous phenomena present in all societies. To him, civilization was a phenomena that will be present as long as humans exist. He characterized the fulfillment of basic needs as the beginning of civilization. At the beginning, people will look for different ways of increasing productivity of basic needs and expansion will occur. Later the society starts becoming more sedentary and focuses more on crafting, arts and the more refined characteristics. By the end of a society, it will weaken, allowing another small group of individuals to come into control. The conquering group is described as an unsatisfied group within the society itself or a group of desert bandits that constantly attack other weaker or weakened societies.

In the Muqaddimah, his most important work, he thoughtfully and scrupulously discusses an introduction of philosophy to history in a general manner, based on observable patterns within a theoretical framework of known historical events of his time. He described the beginnings, development, cultural trends and the fall of all societies, leading to the rise of a new society which would then follow the same trends in a continuous cycle. Ibn Khaldun did not create a perfect model for a society during his life, but he did think there was a need for a new model to manage society to ensure its continuous economic growth. Also, he recommended the best political approaches to develop a society according to his knowledge of history. He heavily emphasized that a good society would be one in which a tradition of education is deeply rooted in its culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Ibn Khaldun (1987) introduced word asabiya (solidarity, group feeling, or group consciousness), to explain tribalism. The concept of asabiya has been translated as "social cohesion," "group solidarity," or "tribalism." This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups (Rashed,2017).

Ibn Khaldun believed that too much bureaucracy, such as taxes and legislations, would lead to the decline of a society, since it would constrain the development of more specialized labor (increase in scholars and development of different services). He believed that bureaucrats cannot understand the world of commerce and do not possess the same motivation as a businessman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his work the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun emphasizes human beings' faculty to think (''fikr'') as what determines human behavior and ubiquitous patterns. This faculty is also what inspires human beings to form into a social structure to co-operate in division of labor and organization.  According to Zaid Ahmand in ''Epistemology and the Human Dimension in Urban Studies'', the ''fikr'' faculty is the supporting pillar for all philosophical aspects of Ibn Khaldun's theory related to human beings’ spiritual, intellectual, physical, social and political tendencies.

Another important concept he emphasizes in his work is the mastery of crafts, habits and skills. These takes place after a society is established and according to Ibn Khaldun the level of achievement of a society can be determined by just analyzing these three concepts. A society in its earliest stages is nomadic and primarily concerned with survival, while a society at a later stage is sedentary, with greater achievement in crafts. A society with a sedentary culture and stable politics would be expected to have greater achievements in crafts and technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ibn Khaldun also emphasized in his epistemology theory the important aspect that educational tradition plays to ensure the new generations of a civilization continuously improve in the sciences and develop culture. Ibn Khaldun argued that without the strong establishment of an educational tradition, it would be very difficult for the new generations to maintain the achievements of the earlier generations, let alone improve them.

Another way to distinguish the achievement of a society would be the language factor of a society, since for him the most important element of a society would not be land, but the language spoken by them. He was surprised that many non-Arabs were really successful in the Arabic society, had good jobs and were well received by the community. "These people were non-Arab by descent, but they grew up among the Arabs who possessed the habit of Arabic," Ibn Khaldun once recalled, "[b]ecause of this, they were able to master Arabic so well that they cannot be surpassed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/UmarIbnAlKhattab2Volumes|title=Umar Ibn Al Khattab (2 Volumes)|last=Umar Ibn Al Khattab (2 Volumes)|first=Umar Ibn Al Khattab|date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the reason why non-Arabs were accepted as part of Arab society was due to their mastery of the Arabic language.

Advancements in literary works such as poems and prose where another way to distinguish the achievement of a civilization, but Ibn Khaldun believed that whenever the literary facet of a society reaches its highest levels it ceases to indicate societal achievements anymore, but is an embellishment of life. For logical sciences he established knowledge at its highest level as an increase of scholars and the quality of knowledge. For him the highest level of literary productions would be the manifestation of prose, poems and the artistic enrichment of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/IbnKhaldunsHistoryalMuqaddimah/Ibn%20khaldun's%20History%20(al-muqaddimah)_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Ibn Khaldun's Historiography"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minor works ===
From other sources we know of several other works, primarily composed during the time he spent in North Africa and [[Al-Andalus]]. His first book, ''[[Lubābu l-Muhassal]]'', a commentary on the [[Islamic theology]] of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], was written at the age of 19 under the supervision of his teacher al-Ābilī in Tunis. A work on [[Sufism]], ''Shifā'u l-Sā'il'', was composed around 1373 in [[Fes, Morocco]]. Whilst at the court of [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada]], Ibn Khaldūn composed a [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|work on logic]], ''ʻallaqa li-s-Sulṭān''.

The Laffer Curve Revisited"] by Mathias Trabandt and Harald Uhlig, NBER Working Paper No. 15343, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Laffer cites Ibn Khaldun's observation that "at the beginning of the dynasty, taxation yields a large revenue from small assessments. At the end of the dynasty, taxation yields a small revenue from large assessments." as a predecessor.&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;{{cite web |last=Laffer |first=Arthur |title=The Laffer Curve: Past, Present, and Future |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/06/the-laffer-curve-past-present-and-future |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=4 July 2012 |authorlink=Arthur Laffer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brederode&gt;{{cite book|last=Brederode|first=Robert F. van|title=Systems of general sales taxation : theory, policy and practice|year=2009|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|location=Austin [Tex.]|isbn=978-9041128324|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

=== Egypt ===
Ibn Khaldun's historical method had very few precedents or followers in his time. While Ibn Khaldun is known to have been a successful lecturer on jurisprudence within religious sciences, only very few of his students were aware of, and influenced by, his Muqaddimah.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Robert|title=Ibn Khaldun: History as Science and the Patrimonial Empire|date=2002|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|location=Budapest|isbn=978-963-05-7934-6|pages=18–20, 22–24|ref=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such student, [[Al-Maqrizi]], praised the Muqaddimah, although some scholars have found his praise, and that of others, to be generally empty and lacking understanding of Ibn Khaldun's methods.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt;

Ibn Khaldun also faced primarily criticism from his contemporaries, particularly [[Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalani]]. These criticisms included accusations of inadequate historical knowledge, an inaccurate title, disorganization, and a style resembling that of the prolific Arab literature writer, [[Al-Jahiz]]. Al-Asqalani also noted that Ibn Khaldun was not well-liked in Egypt because he opposed many respected traditions, including the traditional judicial dress, and suggested that this may have contributed to the reception of Ibn Khaldun's historical works.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt; The notable exception to this consensus was [[Ibn al-Azraq]], a jurist who lived shortly after Ibn Khaldun and quoted heavily from the first and fourth books of the Kitab al-‘Ibar, in developing a work of mirrors for princes.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt;

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Ibn Khaldun's work found some recognition with Ottoman intellectuals in the 17th century. The first references to Ibn Khaldun in Ottoman writings appeared in the middle of the 17th century, with historians such as [[Kâtip Çelebi]] naming him as a great influence, while another Turkish Ottoman historian, [[Mustafa Naima]], attempted to use Ibn Khaldun's cyclical theory of the rise and fall of empires to describe the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt; Increasing perceptions of the decline of the Ottoman Empire also caused similar ideas to appear independently of Ibn Khaldun in the 16th century, and may explain some of the influence of his works.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, Ibn Khaldun was first brought to the attention of the [[Western world]] in 1697, when a biography of him appeared in [[Barthélemy d'Herbelot de Molainville]]'s ''Bibliothèque Orientale''. However, some scholars believe that Ibn Khaldun's work may have first been introduced to Europe via Ibn Arabshah's biography of Tamerlane, translated to Latin, which covers a meeting between Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane.&lt;ref name="Alatas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alatas|first1=Syed Farid|title=Ibn Khaldun|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-19-809045-8|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ibn Arabshah, during this meeting, Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane discussed the Maghrib in depth, as well as Tamerlane's genealogy and place in history.&lt;ref name="Fischel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischel|first1=Walter|title=Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane: Their Historic Meeting in Damascus, A.D. 1401 (A.H. 803)|date=1952|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun began gaining more attention from 1806, when [[Silvestre de Sacy]]'s ''Chrestomathie Arabe'' included his biography together with a translation of parts of the ''Muqaddimah'' as the ''Prolegomena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|page=118|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, de Sacy again published a biography with a more detailed description on the ''Prolegomena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|pages=118–9|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; More details on and partial translations of the ''Prolegomena'' emerged over the years until the complete Arabic edition was published in 1858. Since then, the work of Ibn Khaldun has been extensively studied in the Western world with special interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|pages=119–20|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early European works on Ibn Khaldun suffered heavily from colonial influences and orientalism, as many sociologists considered North Africa to be unworthy of studying in the19th century.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt; Additionally, many sociologists viewed Ibn Khaldun as the only North African sociologist worth studying. [[Reynold A. Nicholson]] praised Ibn Khaldun as a uniquely brilliant Muslim sociologist, but discounted Khaldun's influence.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt; Spanish Philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] viewed the conflicts of North Africa as a problem that stemmed from a lack of African thought, and praised Ibn Khaldun for making sense of the conflict by simplifying it to the relationship between the nomadic and sedentary modes of life.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt;

Ibn Khaldun's contributions to economics were ignored by historians like [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who wrote that "we may safely leap over 500 years to the epoch of St [[Thomas Aquinas]]" as late as 1954.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt; While Ibn Khaldun lived after St Thomas Aquinas, Schumpeter makes only passing references to Khaldun, and excludes Khaldun's predecessors.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt; However, modern historians have recognized the contributions of Ibn Khaldun and many of his predecessors.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ameer Ali|author2=Herb Thompson|title=The Schumpeterian Gap and Muslim Economic Thought|journal=The Journal of Interdisciplinary Economics|date=1999|volume=10|pages=31–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern historians ===
Modern historians have also been complimentary in their analysis of Ibn Khaldun's works, and acknowledgement of his contemporaries or standing compared to European scholars is increasingly common. Influential British historian and international affairs specialist [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] has called Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah "the greatest work of its kind."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 15th ed., vol. 9, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Gellner]], once a professor of philosophy and logic at the [[London School of Economics]], considered Khaldun's definition of government the best in the history of political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gellner, ''Plough, Sword and Book'' (1988), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

More moderate views on the scope of Ibn Khaldun's contributions have emerged. [[Arthur Laffer]], for whom the [[Laffer curve]] is named, acknowledged that Ibn Khaldun's ideas, as well as others, precede his own work on that curve.&lt;ref name="Laffter at Heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm |author=[[Arthur Laffer]] |date=June 1, 2004 |title=The Laffer Curve, Past, Present and Future |publisher=Heritage Foundation |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201225944/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm |archivedate=December 1, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on understanding the nuances of Ibn Khaldun's contributions is present, with scholars commenting on the specifics of Khaldun's work, such as "Ibn Khaldun chose to ignore all those crafts which are neither necessary . . . nor honorable" and that Ibn Khaldun "depicts what really happens. . . . he does not discuss whether the state ought, or ought not, to interfere".&lt;ref name="Baali"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baali|first1=Fuad|title=The Science of Human Social Organization: Conflicting Views on Ibn Khaldun's (1332–1406) Ilm Al-Umran|date=2005|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lampeter|isbn=978-0-7734-6279-3|pages=77–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historian and sociologist, Ibn Khaldun was recognized by the British philosopher [[Robert Flint]], who wrote: "as a [[theorist]] of history he had no equal in any age or country until [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] appeared, more than three hundred years later. [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Augustine]] were not his peers, and all others were unworthy of being even mentioned along with him". Ibn Khaldun's work on evolution of societies also influenced [[Egon Orowan]], who termed the concept of ''socionomy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/eorowan.pdf |title=Egon Orowan. 1901–1989. A Biographical Memoir |author1=F.R.N. Nabarro |author2=A. S. Argon |date=1996 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ibn Khaldun's record-keeping is usually passed over in favor of recognizing his contributions to the science of history, Abderrahmane Lakhsassi wrote "No historian of the Maghreb since and particularly of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] can do without his historical contribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Lakhsassi |date=1996 |editor1=S. H. Nasr |editor2=O. Leaman |title=History of Islamic Philosophy|location=London |publisher=Routledge |chapter=25 – Ibn Khaldun|pages=350–364 |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H024.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public recognition ===
Public recognition of Ibn Khaldun has increased in recent years. In 2004, the [[Tunisian Community Center]] launched the first Ibn Khaldun Award to recognize a Tunisian/American high achiever whose work reflects Ibn Khaldun's ideas of kinship and solidarity. The Award was named after Ibn Khaldun for him being universally acknowledged as the Father of Sociology and also for the convergence of his ideas with the organization's objectives and programs. In 2006, the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]] launched an annual essay contest&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Ibn-Khaldun Essay Contest|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912062823/http://www.atlasusa.org/V2/main/page.php?page_id=741|website=AtlasUSA|publisher=Atlas Economic Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for students named in Ibn Khaldun's honor. The theme of the contest is "how individuals, think tanks, universities and entrepreneurs can influence government policies to allow the free market to flourish and improve the lives of its citizens based on Islamic teachings and traditions."&lt;ref name=Atlas /&gt; In 2006, Spain commemorated the 600th anniversary of the death of Ibn Khaldun, by orchestrating an exhibit titled "Encounter of Civilizations:  Ibn Khaldun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encounter of Civilizations: Ibn Khaldun Exhibit Opens at Headquarters|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/note6056.doc.htm|website=un.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Ibn Khaldun's birthday was recognized by a Google Doodle, which was publicized in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Doodle: Birthday of Ibn Khaldun|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/birthday-of-ibn-khaldun|website=google.com/doodle|publisher=Google|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "He is considered by some as a father of modern economics, or at least a major forerunner. The Western world recognizes Khaldun as the father of sociology but hesitates in recognizing him as a great economist who laid its very foundations. He was the first to systematically analyze the functioning of an economy, the importance of technology, specialization and foreign trade in economic surplus and the role of government and its stabilization policies to increase output and employment. Moreover, he dealt with the problem of optimum taxation, minimum government services, incentives, institutional framework, law and order, expectations, production, and the theory of value".[http://www.ovidius-stec.ro/html/anale/ENG/cuprins%20rezumate/2009%20vol2.pdf Cosma, Sorinel (2009).

'''Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi''' ({{IPA-hi|ˈɪnːdɪrə ˈɡaːndʱi|lang|Hi-IndiraGandhi.ogg}}; née Nehru; November 19, 1917 – October 31, 1984), was an [[India]]n politician, stateswoman and a central figure of the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bloody-mary/19th-november-2017-100-years-of-indira-gandhi-she-was-the-mother-of-every-indian-supremo/|title=19th November 2017: 100 years of Indira Gandhi.She was the mother of every Indian supremo|date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first and, to date, the only female [[Prime Minister of India]]. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first prime minister of India. Despite her surname ''Gandhi'', she is not related to the family of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]; Gandhi is a [[Gandhi (surname)|common surname]] in Gujarat. She served as Prime Minister from January 1966 to March 1977 and again from January 1980 until [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|her assassination]] in October 1984, making her the second [[List of Prime Ministers of India by longevity|longest-serving Indian Prime Minister]] after her father.&lt;ref name="tandon"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tandon |first1=P.D. |title=The truth about Indira |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-truth-about-indira/211665 |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Outlook India |date=21 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as Prime Minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected [[President of the Indian National Congress]] in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964 she was appointed as a member of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house) and became a member of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri ministry|Lal Bahadur Shastri's cabinet]] as [[Minister of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Minister of Information and Broadcasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/indira-gandhi-9305913|title=Indira Gandhi|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966 (upon the death of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|Shastri]]), she defeated her rival [[Morarji Desai]], to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India.

As Prime Minister, Gandhi was known for her political intransigency and unprecedented [[Centralized government|centralisation of power]]. She went to [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war with Pakistan]] in support of the [[Six point movement|independence movement]] and [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war of independence]] in [[East Pakistan]], which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of [[Bangladesh]], as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the regional [[Hegemony|hegemon]] of [[South Asia]]. Citing fissiparous tendencies and in response to a call for revolution, Gandhi instituted a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] from 1975 to 1977 where basic civil liberties were suspended and the press was censored. Widespread atrocities were carried out during the emergency. In 1980, she [[Indian general election, 1980|returned to power]] after free and fair elections. After Operation Blue Star, she was assassinated by her own bodyguards and Sikh nationalists on 31 October 1984. The assassins, [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]] and [[Satwant Singh]], were both shot by other security guards. Satwant Singh recovered from his injuries and was executed after being convicted of murder.

In 1999, Indira Gandhi was named "Woman of the Millennium" in an online poll organised by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/543743.stm|title=BBC Indira Gandhi 'greatest woman'|publisher=BBC News|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Indira Gandhi was born as Indira Nehru in a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family on 19 November 1917 in [[Allahabad]].{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=13}} Her father, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was a leading figure in India's political [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] from [[British Raj|British rule]], and became the first Prime Minister of the [[Dominion of India|Dominion]] (and later [[India|Republic]]) of India.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=3}} She was the only child (a younger brother was born, but died young),{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=31}} and grew up with her mother, [[Kamala Nehru]], at the [[Anand Bhavan]]; a large family estate in Allahabad.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=16}} She had a lonely and unhappy childhood.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=25}} Her father was often away, directing political activities or incarcerated, while her mother was frequently bed-ridden with illness, and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=32}} She had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=55}}

Indira was mostly taught at home by tutors, and intermittently attended school until matriculation in 1934. She was a student at the [[Modern School (New Delhi)|Modern School]] in [[Delhi]], St Cecilia's and St Mary's Christian convent schools in [[Allahabad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupte|first1=Pranay|title=Mother India : a political biography of Indira Gandhi / Pranay Gupte.|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143068266|pages=151–152|edition=Rev.|url={{Google books|OOmK1lPWq80C|page=PA151|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International School of Geneva]], the Ecole Nouvelle in [[Bex]], and the Pupils' Own School in [[Pune|Poona]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]], which is affiliated to [[University of Mumbai]]. {{sfn|Frank|2010|pp=29,75,83}} She and her mother [[Kamala Nehru]] moved to [[Belur Math]] headquarters of [[Ramakrishna Mission]] where [[Swami Ranganathananda]] was her guardian{{sfn|Indira Gandhi: Daughter of India|2002|pp=42,43,45}}  later she went on to study at the [[Visva-Bharati University]] in [[Santiniketan]]. It was during her interview that [[Rabindranath Tagore]] named her Priyadarshini, and she came to be known as Indira Priyadarshini Nehru.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=90}} A year later, however, she had to leave university to attend to her ailing mother in [[Europe]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=170}} While there, it was decided that Indira would continue her education at the [[University of Oxford]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=181}} After her mother died, she briefly attended the [[Badminton School]] before enrolling at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] in 1937 to study history.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=116}} Indira had to take the entrance examination twice, having failed at her first attempt with a poor performance in Latin.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=116}} At Oxford, she did well in history, political science and economics, but her grades in Latin—a compulsory subject—remained poor.{{sfn|Somervill|2007|p=36}}{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=184}}  She did, however, have an active part within the student life of the university, such as the Oxford Majlis Asian Society.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordmajlis.wix.com/majlis&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 26 September 1981, Mrs Indira Gandhi, was conferred with the Honorory Degree of Doctor at the Laucala Graduation at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji.

[[File:Young Indira Gandhi.jpg|thumb|upright|Indira Nehru c. early 1930s]]

During her time in Europe, Indira was plagued with ill-health and was constantly attended to by doctors. She had to make repeated trips to Switzerland to recover, disrupting her studies. She was being treated there in 1940, when the German armies rapidly conquered Europe. Gandhi tried to return to England through Portugal but was left stranded for nearly two months. She managed to enter England in early 1941, and from there returned to India without completing her studies at Oxford. The university later awarded her an honorary degree. In 2010, Oxford further honoured her by selecting her as one of the ten Oxasians, illustrious Asian graduates from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |title=Exhibit celebrates 120 years of South Asians at Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102074542/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |archivedate=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During her stay in Great Britain, Indira frequently met her future husband [[Feroze Gandhi]] (no relation to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), whom she knew from Allahabad, and who was studying at the [[London School of Economics]]. The marriage took place in [[Allahabad]] according to [[Adi Dharm]] rituals though Feroze belonged to a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Parsi]] family of Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/oldStory/82389/|title=Sonia assures help for father-in-law's grave|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.indianexpress.com|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two sons, [[Rajiv Gandhi]] (born 1944) and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] (born 1946).

In the 1950s, Indira, now Mrs Indira Gandhi after her marriage, served her father unofficially as a personal assistant during his tenure as the first [[Prime Minister of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steinberg|first1=Blema S.|title=Women in power : the personalities and leadership styles of Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, and Margaret Thatcher|date=2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0-7735-3356-1|page=20|url={{Google books|EZIBxpeRXxsC|page=PR7|keywords=indira%20nehru%20hostess|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 1950s, Indira Gandhi served as the President of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]].

==First term as Prime Minister between 1966 and 1977==
The first eleven years of Indira's position as prime minister saw her evolving from the perception of Congress party leaders as their puppet to a strong leader with the  iron resolve to split the party for her policy positions or to go to war with Pakistan to liberate Bangladesh. At the end of this term in 1977, she was such a dominating figure in Indian politics that a Congress party president had coined the phrase "India is Indira and Indira is India."&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, P.S., 1999. Whither Indian Polity?. Economic and Political Weekly, pp.3340-3342.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First year===
Indira formed her government with Morarji Desai as deputy prime minister and finance minister. At the beginning of her first term as prime minister, Indira was widely criticized by the media and the opposition as a "Goongi goodiya" (Hindi word for a dumb doll or puppet) of the Congress party bosses who had got her elected and tried to constrain her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derichs|first1=Claudia (editor)|last2=Thompson|first2=Mark R.|title=Dynasties and female political leaders in Asia : gender, power and pedigree|date=2013|publisher=s.n.|location=S.l.|isbn=978-3-643-90320-4|pages=32, 50|url={{Google books|UKBcLhCxSvQC|page=PA27|keywords=%22goongi%20gudiya%22%20indira|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shankar|first1=Kalyani|title=Pandora's daughters|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Pub.

===1967–1971===
The first electoral test for Indira was the [[Indian general election, 1967|1967 general elections]] for the Lok sabha and state assemblies. The Congress Party won a reduced majority for the Lok sabha in these elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis. Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a [[devaluation]] of the [[Indian rupee|rupee]], which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.&lt;ref name="Kapila1"/&gt;

The party also for the first time lost power or lost majority in a number of states across the country. Following the 1967 elections, Indira Gandhi gradually started moving towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders on a number of issues. Chief among them was the decision by Indira to support [[V. V. Giri]], the independent candidate rather than the official Congress party candidate [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]] for the vacant position of [[President of India]]. The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalization without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in Party president [[S. Nijalingappa]] expelling her from the party for indiscipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/march-to-socialism-under-prime-minister-indira-gandhi-offers-an-interesting-parallel/articleshow/9715049.cms|title=March to socialism under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi offers an interesting parallel|date=24 August 2011|work=The Economic Times|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1969-congress-splits/1/155566.html|title=1969: S.

===1971–1977===
[[Garibi Hatao]] (Eradicate Poverty) was the theme for Gandhi's 1971 political bid. On the other hand, the combined opposition alliance had a two word manifesto of "Indira Hatao" (Remove Indira).&lt;ref name="1971.iz iz result"&gt;{{cite web|title=General Elections, India, 1971: Statistical report |url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/statisticalreports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf |website=eci.nic.in |publisher=Commission of India |accessdate=25 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718175452/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masani,|first1=Zareer|title=The Indira Wave|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/article2950165.ece|accessdate=8 January 2015|issue=3 March 2012|publisher=The Hindu|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garibi Hatao slogan and the proposed [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty programs]] that came with it were designed to give Gandhi an independent national support, based on rural and urban poor. This would allow her to bypass the dominant rural castes both in and of state and local governments; likewise the urban commercial class. And, for their part, the previously voiceless poor would at last gain both political worth and political weight{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=March 2017}}. The programs created through [[Garibi Hatao]], though carried out locally, were funded and developed by the Central Government in New Delhi. The program was supervised and staffed by the [[Indian National Congress]] party.

The biggest achievement of Indira Gandhi after the 1971 election came in December 1971 with India's decisive victory over [[Pakistan]] in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation war]], that led to the formation of independent [[Bangladesh]].

Despite the victory against Pakistan, the Congress government faced numerous problems during this term. Some of these were due to high inflation which was in turn caused by war time expenses, drought in some parts of the country and more importantly, the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The opposition to Gandhi in 1973–75 period, after the Indira wave had receded, was strongest in the states of [[Bihar]] and [[Gujarat]]. In Bihar, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], the veteran leader came out of retirement to lead the protest movement there.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Shri Raj Narain and Anr. on, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered her stripped of her parliamentary seat and banned from running for any office for six years. According to [[Constitution of India|constitution]], the Prime Minister must be a [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|member]] of either the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house in the [[Parliament of India]]) or a [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|member]] of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house). Thus, this decision effectively removed her from office. Gandhi had asked one of her colleagues in government, Mr. [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]] to defend her in court.

But Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. The verdict was delivered by Mr Justice [[Jagmohanlal Sinha]] at Allahabad High Court. It came almost four years after the case was brought by Raj Narain, the premier's defeated opponent in the 1971 parliamentary election. Gandhi, who gave evidence in her defence during the trial, was found guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandra|first1=Bipan|title=In the name of democracy : JP movement and the emergency, Chapter 4, Emergency imposed|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0143029670|url={{Google books|3K7dCQAAQBAJ|page=PT4|keywords=yashpal|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge, however, rejected more serious charges of bribery against her.

Gandhi insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: "There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," he said. "I believe the prime minister of India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".

====State of Emergency (1975–1977)====
{{Main|The Emergency (India)}}
Gandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. Her Cabinet and government then recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[state of emergency]] because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975.

====Rule by decree====

Within a few months, [[President's rule]] was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanek, Stanely, ''Mrs. Gandhi's Pyramid: The New Congress'', (Westview Press, Boulder, CO 1976) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Police were granted powers to impose curfews and indefinitely detain citizens and all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were indefinitely postponed, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on recommendation of the state's governor.

Indira Gandhi used the emergency provisions to change conflicting party members.

President Ahmed issued [[decree|ordinances]] that did not require debate in the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], allowing Gandhi to [[rule by decree]].

====Rise of Sanjay====
The Emergency saw the entry of Gandhi's younger son, [[Sanjay Gandhi]], into Indian Politics. Sanjay wielded tremendous power during the emergency without holding any Government office.  According to [[Mark Tully]], "His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tully ''Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle'', p. 55, {{ISBN|81-291-0917-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was said that during the Emergency he virtually ran India along with his friends, especially [[Bansi Lal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Subodh Ghildiyal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-29/india/28661327_1_slum-clearance-sanjay-gandhi-sterilization|title=Cong blames Sanjay Gandhi for Emergency 'excesses'|publisher=Times Of India|date=29 December 2010|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also quipped that Sanjay Gandhi had total control over his mother and that the government was run by the [[7, Lok Kalyan Marg|PMH (Prime Minister House)]] rather than the [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|PMO (Prime Minister Office)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/26022710/Mystery-Called-Sanjay-Gandhi |title=Mystery Called Sanjay Gandhi|publisher=Scribd|date=21 November 2007|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Express News Service|title=Emergency 'propagandist' who banned Kishore Kumar songs|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/emergency-propagandist-who-banned-kishore-kumar-songs/1127804/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Indian Express|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Life of Indira Gandhi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dasgupta|first=Swapan|journal=Third World Quarterly|title=Sanjay Gandhi|date=July 1985|volume=7|issue=3|doi=10.1080/01436598508419863|pages=731–778}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 January 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==1977 election and opposition years==
In 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, Indira Gandhi called [[Indian general election, 1977|elections]] to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule. Gandhi may have grossly misjudged her popularity  by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derfler|first1=Leslie|title=The fall and rise of political leaders Olof Palme, Olusegun Obasanjo, and Indira Gandhi|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9780230117242|pages=186–187|edition=1st|url={{Google books|7VjJAAAAQBAJ|page=PR2|keywords=sterilization|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, she was opposed by the [[Janata alliance]] of Opposition parties. The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between "democracy and dictatorship." The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]. The other leaders of the Janata Party were [[Charan Singh]], [[Raj Narain]], [[George Fernandes]] and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Lloyd I.| authorlink = Lloyd Rudolph|first2=Susanne|last2= Hoeber|authorlink2=Susanne Hoeber Rudolph|title=In pursuit of Lakshmi: The political economy of the Indian state|date=1989|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Pr.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226731391|pages=159–178|edition=[Nachdr.]|url={{Google books|amtV90ig9-8C|page=PR16|keywords=1977%20janata%20|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opposition and return to power===
[[File:1984 CPA 5588.jpg|thumb|upright|1984 [[USSR]] commemorative stamp]]

Since Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] as their parliamentary party leader. Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress faction. She won a by-election from the [[Chikmagalur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chikmagalur Constituency]] to the [[Lok Sabha]] in November 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maramkal|first1=M-B|title=Chikmagalur remembers Indira Gandhi|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/Chikmagalur-remembers-Indira-Gandhi/articleshow/26064352.cms|issue=20 November|publisher=Times of India|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mrs. Gandhi is Jeered|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19781121&amp;id=nEpOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=De4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4709,2645853|website=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=21 November 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Janata government's Home Minister, Choudhary [[Charan Singh]], ordered the arrest of her and Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament. These allegations included that she "had planned or thought of killing all opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency".&lt;ref&gt;[[Malhotra, Inder]]. ''Indira Gandhi''. New York: Coronet Books, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to her arrest, Indira Gandhi's [[Bholanath and Devendra Pandey|supporters hijacked]] an Indian Airlines jet and demanded her immediate release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Tale-of-two-hijackers-One-is-Congress-candidate-other-most-wanted/articleshow/33156540.cms]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this strategy backfired disastrously. Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or "that woman" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979. Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, by President Reddy, after Indira and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress would support his government from outside on certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Supporting Charan Singh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Mesquita|first1=Bruce Bueno|title=The Predictioneer's Game: Using the Logic of Brazen Self-Interest to See and shapte the future|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7977-0|page=xxiii|url={{Google books|8BafGvdAYYEC|page=PA10|keywords=%22charan%20singh%22|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charan Singh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanghvi|first1=Vijay|title=The Congress, Indira to Sonia Gandhi  By|date=2006|publisher=Kalpaz|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7835-340-7|pages=114–122|url={{Google books|npdqD_TXucQC|page=PA7|keywords=charan|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay. Since Charan Singh refused to drop the charges, Congress withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979.

Before the [[Indian general election, 1980|1980 elections]] Gandhi approached the then [[Shahi Imam]] of [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]], [[Syed Abdullah Bukhari]] and entered into an agreement with him on the basis of 10-point programme to secure the support of the Muslim votes.&lt;ref name="AgnihotriRay2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

Gandhi by the time of Sanjay's death only trusted family members, and therefore persuaded her reluctant son, Rajiv, to enter politics.

In the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the [[Sikh]]-majority [[Shiromani Akali Dal|Akali Dal]] came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab. In an effort to split the Akali Dal and gain popular support among the Sikhs, Indira Gandhi's Congress helped bring the orthodox religious leader [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] to prominence in Punjab politics.&lt;ref name="Gus2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gus Martin|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism, Second Edition|url={{Google books|I_jh4VBi_HYC|page=PA543|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=11 October 2012|date=15 June 2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-8016-6|pages=543–545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christine2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

After several futile negotiations, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian army in June 1984 to enter the Golden Temple in order to remove Bhindranwale and his supporters from the complex. The army used heavy artillery, including tanks, in the action code-named [[Operation Blue Star]]. The operation badly damaged or destroyed parts of the Temple complex, including the [[Akal Takht]] shrine and the Sikh library.

Dr Dogra stated that as many as 30 bullet wounds were sustained by Indira Gandhi, from two sources, a [[Sterling submachine gun]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926929-2,00.html Indira Gandhi: Death in the Garden] – ''TIME''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8QufTc6fAocC&amp;pg=RA1-PA135&amp;lpg=RA1-PA135 Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues With Sikh Militants] – Cynthia Keppley Mahmood – Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; and a pistol. The assailants had fired 31 bullets at her, of which 30 had hit; 23 had passed through her body while 7 were trapped inside her. Dr Dogra extracted bullets to establish the identity of the weapons and to match each weapon with the bullets recovered by ballistic examination. The bullets were matched with respective weapons at CFSL Delhi. Subsequently, Dr Dogra appeared in the court of Shri Mahesh Chandra as an expert witness (PW-5), and his testimony lasted several sessions.

Gandhi's approach to dealing with Sri Lanka's [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic problems]] was initially accommodating. She enjoyed cordial relations with Prime Minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]].

India's relationship with Pakistan remained strained following the [[Simla Agreement|Shimla Accord]] in 1972. Gandhi's [[Smiling Buddha|authorization of the detonation of a nuclear device]] at Pokhran in 1974 was viewed by Pakistani leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] as an attempt to intimidate Pakistan into accepting India's hegemony in the subcontinent. However, in May 1976, Gandhi and Bhutto both agreed to reopen diplomatic establishments and normalize relations.&lt;ref name="Grover"&gt;{{cite book|first=

===Middle East===
Gandhi remained a staunch supporter of Palestinians in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and was critical of the Middle East diplomacy sponsored by the United States.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=5}} [[Israel]] was viewed as a religious state and thus [[Two-nation theory|an analogue]] to India's archrival Pakistan. Indian diplomats also hoped to win Arab support in countering Pakistan in [[Kashmir]]. Nevertheless, Gandhi authorized the development of a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s. Her lieutenant, [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]], later became Prime Minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992.&lt;ref name="AKapur"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ashok|last=Kapur|title=India: From Regional to World Power |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |page=215 |isbn=978-0415328043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India's pro-Arab policy had mixed success. Establishment of close ties with the socialist and secular [[Ba'athism|Baathist]] regimes to some extent neutralized Pakistani propaganda against India.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anjali|last=Ghosh|title=India's Foreign Policy |publisher=Pearson|year=2009|pages=306–307|isbn=978-8131710258}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] put the Arab and Muslim states of the Middle East in a dilemma as the war was fought by two states both friendly to the Arabs.&lt;ref name="Kaur"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ranjit|last=Kaur|title=Islamic Co-Operation and Unity|location=|publisher=Deep and Deep Publications |year=1993 |pages=168–170|isbn=978-8171005642}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progressive Arab regimes in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Algeria]] chose to remain neutral, while the conservative pro-American Arab monarchies in [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and [[United Arab Emirates]] openly supported Pakistan. Egypt's stance was met with dismay by the Indians, who had come to expect close co-operation with the Baathist regimes.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; But, the death of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] in 1970 and [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s growing friendship with [[Riyadh]], and his mounting differences with Moscow, constrained Egypt to a policy of neutrality.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Gandhi's overtures to [[Muammar Gaddafi]] were rebuffed.&lt;ref name="Kaur"/&gt; [[Libya]] agreed with the Arab monarchies in believing that Gandhi's intervention in East Pakistan was an attack against [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Kaur"/&gt;

The 1971 war temporarily became a stumbling block in growing [[India–Iran relations|Indo-Iranian ties]].&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Although Iran had earlier characterized the Indo-Pakistani war in 1965 as Indian aggression, the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] had launched an effort at rapprochement with India in 1969 as part of his effort to secure support for a larger Iranian role in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Gandhi's tilt towards Moscow and her dismemberment of Pakistan was perceived by the Shah as part of a larger anti-Iran conspiracy involving India, [[Iraq]], and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Nevertheless, Iran had resisted Pakistani pressure to activate the [[Baghdad Pact]] and draw in the [[Baghdad Pact|Central Treaty Organisation]] (CENTO) into the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Gradually, Indian and Iranian disillusionment with their respective regional allies led to a renewed partnership between the nations.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Shireen|title=Iran's Foreign Policy in the Post-Soviet Era: Resisting the New International Order|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0804755504|date=2010|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi was unhappy with the lack of support from India's Arab allies during the war with Pakistan, while the Shah was apprehensive at the growing friendship between Pakistan and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], specially Saudi Arabia, and the growing influence of Islam in Pakistani society.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; There was an increase in Indian economic and military co-operation with [[Iran]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; The 1974 India-Iranian agreement led to Iran supplying nearly 75 percent of India's crude oil demands.&lt;ref name=pande&gt;{{cite book|last=Pande|first=Aparna|title=Explaining Pakistan's Foreign Policy|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, 2011|isbn=978-1136818943|year=2011|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi appreciated the Shah's disregard of [[Pan-Islamism]] in diplomacy.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;

===Asia-Pacific===
One of the major developments in [[Southeast Asia]] during Gandhi's premiership was the formation of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in 1967. Relations between ASEAN and India was mutually antagonistic. ASEAN in the Indian perception was linked to the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO), and it was therefore, seen as a pro-American organisation. On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the [[Viet Cong]] and India's strong links with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's future plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971. India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Nanda&gt;{{cite book|last=Nanda|first=Prakash|title=Rediscovering Asia: Evolution of India's Look-East Policy|publisher=Lancer Publishers|isbn=978-8170622970|year=2003|pages=220–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations only began to improve following Gandhi's endorsement of the [[Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality|ZOPFAN declaration]] and the disintegration of the SEATO alliance in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in the region. Nevertheless, Gandhi's close relations with reunified [[Vietnam]] and her decision to recognize the Vietnam installed Government of [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Cambodia]] in 1980 meant that India and ASEAN were not able to develop a viable partnership.&lt;ref name=Nanda/&gt;

===Africa===

Although independent India was initially viewed as a champion of anti-colonialism, its cordial relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and liberal views of British colonial policies in [[East Africa]] had harmed its image as a staunch supporter of the anti-colonial movements.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anjali|last=Ghosh|title=India's Foreign Policy|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2009|pages=422–424|isbn=978-8131710258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian condemnation of militant struggles in [[Mau Mau Uprising|Kenya]] and [[Algerian War|Algeria]] was in sharp contrast to China, who had supported armed struggle to win African independence.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; After reaching a high diplomatic point in the aftermath of Nehru's role in the [[Suez Crisis]], India's isolation from Africa was complete when only four nations; [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Libya]] supported her during the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; After Gandhi became Prime Minister, diplomatic and economic relations with the states which had sided with India during the Sino-Indian War were expanded.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; Gandhi began negotiations with the Kenyan government to establish the Africa-India Development Cooperation. The Indian government also started considering the possibility of bringing Indians settled in Africa within the framework of its policy goals to help recover its declining geo-strategic influence. Gandhi declared the people of Indian origin settled in Africa as "Ambassadors of India."&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; Efforts to rope in the Asian community to join Indian diplomacy, however, came to naught, partly because of the unwillingness of Indians to remain in politically insecure surroundings and partly due to the exodus of African Indians to Britain with the passing of the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; In [[Uganda]], the African Indian community even [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|suffered persecution and eventually expulsion]] under the government of [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name="Oonk"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gijsbert|last=Oonk|title=Global Indian Diasporas: Exploring Trajectories of Migration and Theory|location=|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2007|page=189|isbn=978-9053560358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign and domestic policy successes in the 1970s enabled Gandhi to rebuild India's image in the eyes of African states.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; Victory over Pakistan and India's possession of nuclear weapons showed the degree of India's progress.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; Furthermore, the conclusion of the Indo-Soviet treaty in 1971 and threatening gestures by the major western power, the United States, to send its nuclear armed [[Task Force 74]] into the [[Bay of Bengal]] at the height of the East Pakistan crisis had enabled India to regain its anti-imperialist image.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2"/&gt; Gandhi firmly tied Indian anti-imperialist interests in Africa to those of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Mawdsley"&gt;{{Cite book

===The Commonwealth===

The [[Commonwealth]] is voluntary association of mainly former British colonies. India maintained cordial relations with most of the members during Indira Gandhi's  time in power. In the 1980s, Indira Gandhi along with Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], Zambia's President [[Kenneth Kaunda]], Australian prime minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] and Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was regarded as one of the pillars of the commonwealth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Low|first1=D.A.|title=The contraction of England : an inaugural lecture delivered before the University of Cambridge on 22 October 1984|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|isbn=9780521314244|page=28|url={{Google books|U8o7AAAAIAAJ|page=PA42|keywords=gandhi|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; India under Indira also hosted the 1983 Commonwealth heads of Government summit in New Delhi in 1983.

===The Non-aligned Movement===

In the early 1980s under Gandhi, India attempted to reassert its prominent role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] by focusing on the relationship between disarmament and economic development. By appealing to the economic grievances of [[Developing country|developing countries]], Gandhi and her successors exercised a moderating influence on the Non-aligned movement, diverting it from some of the [[Cold War]] issues that marred the controversial 1979 Havana meeting where Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] attempted to steer the movement towards the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupte|first1=Pranay|title=Mother India : a political biography of Indira Gandhi|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143068266|pages=499–500|edition=Rev.|url={{Google books|OOmK1lPWq80C|page=PR9|keywords=%22non%20aligned%20movement%22%20india%20indira|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hosting the 1983 summit at Delhi boosted Indian prestige within the movement, its close relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and its pro-Soviet positions on [[Afghanistan]] and [[Cambodia]] limited its influence

===Western Europe===
Indira spent a number of years in Europe during her youth and formed many friendships during her stay there. During her premiership she formed friendship with many socialist leaders such as German chancellor, [[Willy Brandt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Willy|last2=Bell|first2=Anthea (translator)|title=Arms and hunger|date=1987|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262521277|pages=43–44|edition=1st MIT Press English language pbk.|url={{Google books|hBhr8W16XWMC|page=PP11|keywords=indira|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Austrian chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kreisky|first1=Bruno|last2=Lewis|first2=Jill|last3=Rathkolb|first3=Oliver|title=The struggle for a democratic Austria : Bruno Kreisky on peace and social justice|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=1571811559|pages=413–414|url={{Google books|lb6uBAAAQBAJ|page=PR11|keywords=%20gandhi|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also enjoyed closed working relationship with many British leaders including conservative premiers, [[Edward Heath]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupte|first1=Pranay|title=Mother India : a political biography of Indira Gandhi|date=1992|publisher=Scribner's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-684-19296-3|pages=516–517|url={{Google books|OOmK1lPWq80C|page=PR9|keywords=%20thatcher|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
The relationship between India and the Soviet Union deepened during Gandhi's rule. The main reason was the perceived bias of United States and China, the rivals of USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of USSR with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the USSR. The USSR was not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing cold war with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. USSR became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the USSR became the largest trading partner of India.&lt;ref name="British Academic Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

===United States===
When Indira came to power in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US President. At that time, India was reliant on USA for food aid. Indira resented the US policy of food aid as a tool in forcing India to adopt policies favored by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|NPT]] (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). Relations with US strained badly under President [[Richard Nixon]] and his favoring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war. Nixon despised Indira politically and personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dijk|first1=Ruud|last2=Glenn Gray|first2=William|last3=Savranskaya|first3=Svetlana|last4=Suri|first4=Jeremi|last5=Zhai|first5=Qiang (editors)|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War.|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780203880210|pages=340–341|url={{Google books|QgX0bQ3Enj4C|page=PR3|keywords=%22indira%20gandhi%22%20johnson|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indira met President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981 for the first time at the [[North–South Summit]] held to discuss global poverty.

==Economic policy==
Gandhi presided over three [[Five-Year Plans of India|Five-Year Plans]] as Prime Minister, two of which succeeded in meeting the targeted growth.&lt;ref name="Growth statistics"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rRWDxpHcBHoC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;q=sixth%20five%20year%20plan%20of%20india%20growth%20actual%205.6|title=World bank and economic development of India|publisher=APH Publishing|year=2000|isbn=81-7648-121-1|page=375|author=L.

There is considerable debate regarding whether Gandhi was a socialist on principle or out of political expediency.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt; [[Sunanda K. Datta-Ray]] described her as "a master of rhetoric...often more posture than policy", while ''[[The Times]]'' journalist, Peter Hazelhurst, famously quipped that Gandhi's socialism was "slightly left of self-interest."&lt;ref name="Indira"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166151&amp;sectioncode=22 |title=Indira – terror personified or goddess? |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=7 December 2001 |accessdate=31 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722143044/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166151&amp;sectioncode=22 |archivedate=22 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have focused on the contradictions in the evolution of her stance towards [[communism]]; Gandhi being known for her anti-communist stance in the 1950s with [[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai|Meghnad Desai]] even describing her as "the scourge of [India's] Communist Party."&lt;ref name="Desai"&gt;{{cite book|first=Meghnad|last=Desai|title=The Rediscovery Of India|location=|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2011|page=346|ISBN=978-0143417354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, she later forged close relations with Indian communists even while using the army to break the [[Naxalite]]s. In this context, Gandhi was accused of formulating populist policies to suit her political needs; being seemingly against the rich and big business while preserving the status quo in order to manipulate the support of the left at times of political insecurity, such as the late 1960s.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gandhi came to be viewed in time as the scourge of the right-wing and reactionary political elements of India, leftist opposition to her policies emerged. As early as 1969, critics had begun accusing her of insincerity and [[machiavellianism]]. ''The Indian Libertarian'' wrote that: "it would be difficult to find a more machiavellian leftist than Mrs Indira Gandhi...for here is [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] at its best in the person of a suave, charming and astute politician."&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Libertarian, Volume 15–17. 1969. University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser Jr.|Rosser]] wrote that "some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress [leftist] dissent against Gandhi's policy shift to the right."&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt; In the 1980s, Gandhi was accused of "betraying socialism" after the beginning of ''Operation Forward'', an attempt at economic reform.&lt;ref name="Datta-Ray"&gt;Sunanda K. Datta-Ray; ''Indira Gandhi: Enigma, Mother-Goddess and Terror Incernate''. 3 November 1994. The Straits Times (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, others were more convinced of Gandhi's sincerity and devotion to socialism. Pankaj Vohra noted that "even the late prime minister's critics would concede that the maximum number of legislations of social significance was brought about during her tenure...[and that] she lives in the hearts of millions of Indians who shared her concern for the poor and weaker sections and who supported her politics."&lt;ref name="aam aadmi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsPankajVohra/The-original-aam-aadmi-leader/Article1-471695.aspx |title=The original aam aadmi leader |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513074215/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsPankajVohra/The-original-aam-aadmi-leader/Article1-471695.aspx |archivedate=13 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summarizing the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;{{cite book|first= Blema|last=Steinberg|title=Women in Power: The Personalities and Leadership Styles of Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, and Margaret Thatcher|location=|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2008|pages=79–95|isbn=9780-773533561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 7.4% (24) of the total 330 biographical extractions posit ideology as a reason for her policy choices.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"/&gt; Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"/&gt; Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [socialism] because it came closest to what we wanted to do here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all."&lt;ref name="Steinberg"/&gt; Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as  "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century."&lt;ref name="aam aadmi"/&gt; Her campaign slogan, [[Garibi Hatao]] (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=January 2017}}.

===Green Revolution and the Fourth Five-Year Plan===

Gandhi inherited a weak and troubled economy. Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapila1"&gt;{{Cite book

At the same time, Indo-US relations were straining due to Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam. While it was thought, at the time, and for decades after, that President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]]'s policy of withholding [[Food for Peace|food grain shipments]] was to coerce Indian support for the war, in fact, it was to offer India rainmaking technology that he wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.georgetown.edu/khb3/Osiris/papers/Doel-Harper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Oliver|title=George Woods and the World Bank|year=1995|page=144|ISBN=978-1555875039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the circumstances, liberalization became politically suspect and was soon abandoned.&lt;ref name="Kapila1"/&gt; Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India. After the bitter experience with Johnson, Gandhi decided not to request food aid in the future. Moreover, Gandhi's government resolved never again to become "so vulnerably dependent" on aid, and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves.&lt;ref name="Kirk"&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Indira Gandhi and LBJ meeting in the Oval Office (1).tif|thumb|left|Indira Gandhi meeting President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the Oval Office on 28 March 1966]]

The period of 1967–75 was characterized by socialist ascendency in India which culminated in 1976 with the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|official declaration of state socialism]]. Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, "growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance."{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind the overall plan was Gandhi's ''Ten Point Programme'' of 1967. This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasized greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalization process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as "protectionist as ever."&lt;ref name="Kirk"/&gt;

To deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt; The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s and transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains and prone to famine to being largely able to feed itself, and become successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic period of 1967–75 became significant for its major wave of nationalisations amidst the increased regulation of the private sector.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt;

Some of the other objectives of the economic plan for the period was to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 program were accomplished by 1974–75. Nevertheless, the success of the overall economic plan was tempered by the fact that annual growth at 3.3–3.4% over 1969–74 fell short of the targeted figure.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}

===State of Emergency and the Fifth Five-Year Plan===

The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974–79) was enacted in the backdrop of the state of emergency and the ''Twenty Point Program'' of 1975.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} The latter was the economic rationale of the emergency, a political act which has often been justified on economic grounds.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} In contrast to the reception of Gandhi's earlier economic plan, this one was criticized for being a "hastily thrown together wish list."{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Gandhi promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor and enact wide-ranging social and economic reforms. The government additionally targeted an annual growth of 4.4% over the period of the plan.&lt;ref name="Growth statistics"/&gt;

The measures of the emergency regime was able to halt the economic trouble of the early to mid-1970s, which had been marred by harvest failures, fiscal contraction, and the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed exchanged rate; the resulting turbulence in the foreign exchange markets being further accentuated by the oil shock of 1973.&lt;ref name="Nayak"/&gt; The government was even able to exceed the targeted growth figure with an annual growth rate of 5.0–5.2% over the five-year period of the plan (1974–79).&lt;ref name="Growth statistics"/&gt;{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} The economy grew at the rate of 9% in 1975–76 alone, and the Fifth Plan, became the first plan during which the per capita income of the economy grew by over 5%.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{Cite book

The government was successful in bringing down inflation during the emergency; achieving negative figures of −1.1% by the end of 1975–76.&lt;ref name="Harley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inflation"/&gt;

Gandhi inherited a tattered economy in her second term; harvest failures and a [[1979 energy crisis|second oil shock]] in the late 1970s had again caused inflation to rise.&lt;ref name="Harley"/&gt; During [[Charan Singh]]'s short reign in office in the second half of 1979, inflation averaged 18.2%, compared to 6.5% during Gandhi's last year in office (1984).&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inflation"/&gt; General economic recovery under Gandhi led to an average inflation at 6.5% from 1981–82 to 1985–86; the lowest since the beginning of India's inflation problems in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Kapila"/&gt;

The nationalization drive not only helped to increase household savings, but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India's industrial and agricultural base.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kavaljit|last=Singh|title=Questioning Globalization

Having been re-elected in 1971 on a nationalisation platform, Gandhi proceeded to nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance industries.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt; Most of these nationalisations were made to protect employment and the interest of the organised labour.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt; The remaining private sector industries were placed under strict regulatory control.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt;

During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], foreign-owned private oil companies had refused to supply fuel to the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force.

===Administration===
[[File:Territorial evolution of India 1961–1975.png|thumb|upright=2.2|Administrative divisions of India 1961–1975. Gandhi established six states, [[Haryana]] (1966), [[Himachal Pradesh]] (1971), [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]] (all 1972), and finally [[Sikkim]] (1975), bringing up the total of states to 22. She also established [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Mizoram]] (1972) as Union Territories]]

In 1966, Gandhi [[Punjabi Suba movement|accepted the demands]] of the [[Shiromani Akali Dal|Akalis]] to reorganize [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] on linguistic lines. The [[Hindi]]-speaking southern half of Punjab became a separate state, [[Haryana]], while the [[Pahari languages|Pahari]] speaking hilly areas in the north east were joined to [[Himachal Pradesh]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=302}} In doing so, she had hoped to ward off [[Punjabi Suba movement|the growing political conflict]] between [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] groups in the region.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=302}} However, a contentious issue that was considered unresolved by the Akalis was the status of [[Chandigarh]], a prosperous city on the Punjab-Haryana border, which Gandhi declared a union territory to be shared as a capital by both the states.&lt;ref name="Pletcher"&gt;{{cite book|first= Kenneth|last=Pletcher|title=The History of India|location=|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2010|page=315|isbn=978-1615302017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated Indian power in Kashmir. Gandhi indicated that she would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], had to recognize India's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalized in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1975 Indira–Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The transition to statehood for these territories was successfully overseen by her administration.&lt;ref name="Chandra 2007b"/&gt; This was followed by the annexation of [[Sikkim]] in 1975.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=120-121}}

===Social reform===

Gandhi questioned the continued existence of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]] for former rulers of [[princely state]]s. She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.

Gandhi claimed that only "clear vision, iron will and the strictest discipline" can remove poverty.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; She justified the imposition of the state of emergency in 1975 in the name of the socialist mission of the Congress.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; Armed with the power to rule by decree and without constitutional constraints, Gandhi embarked on a massive redistribution program.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; The provisions included rapid enforcement of land ceilings, housing for landless labourers, the abolition of bonded labour and a moratorium on the debts of the poor.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; North India was at the centre of the reforms; millions of acres of land were acquired and redistributed.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; The government was also successful in procuring houses for landless labourers; according to [[Francine Frankel|Frankel]], three-fourths of the targeted four million houses was achieved in 1975 alone.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; Nevertheless, others have disputed the success of the program and criticized Gandhi for not doing enough to reform land ownership. The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned "...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?"&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to "talk left and act right", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser Jr.|Rosser]] wrote that "some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress dissent against Gandhi's policy shift to the right."&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt; Regardless of the controversy over the nature of the reforms, the long-term effects of the social changes gave rise to prominence of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes in North India.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt; The rise of these newly empowered social classes challenged the political establishment of the [[Hindi Belt]] in the years to come.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"/&gt;

===Language policy===
Under the [[Constitution of India]] of 1950, Hindi was to have become the official national language by 1965. This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government. In 1967, Gandhi made a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages. This established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi speaking Indian states.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"/&gt; Gandhi thus put herself forward as a leader with a pan-Indian vision.&lt;ref name="Chandra 2007"&gt;{{Cite book

===Nuclear Program of India===
{{Main|India and weapons of mass destruction|Smiling Buddha}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Gandhi contributed and further carried out the vision of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], former Premier of India to develop the program. Gandhi authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to the ''[[Test No. 6]]'' by People's Republic of China. Gandhi saw this test as Chinese nuclear intimidation, therefore, Gandhi promoted the views of Nehru to establish India's stability and security interests as independent from those of the nuclear superpowers.

The program became fully mature in 1974, when Dr. [[Raja Ramanna]] reported to Gandhi that India had the ability to test its first nuclear weapon. Gandhi gave verbal authorisation of this [[nuclear testing|test]], and preparations were made in a long-constructed army base, the [[Indian Army]] [[Pokhran#Pokhran Test Range|Pokhran Test Range]]. In 1974, India successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, unofficially code named as "''[[Smiling Buddha]]''", near the desert village of [[Pokhran]] in Rajasthan. As the world was quiet by this test, a vehement protest came forward from Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan and its Prime Minister, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], described this test as "''Indian hegemony''" to intimidate Pakistan. In response to this [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] launched a massive campaign all over the Pakistan to make Pakistan a nuclear power. In these campaigns [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] asked the nation to get united and great slogans were raised such as ''hum ghaas aur pattay kha lay gay magar nuclear power ban k rhe gay (We will eat grass or leaves even go hungry but will get nuclear power)''. Gandhi directed a letter to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] and, later to the world, describing the test for [[Peaceful nuclear explosion|peaceful purposes]] and India's commitment to develop its programme for industrial and scientific use.

She married [[Feroze Gandhi]] at the age of 25, in 1942. Their marriage lasted 18 years, until Feroze died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1960. They had two sons – [[Rajiv Gandhi|Rajiv]] (b. 1944) and [[Sanjay Gandhi|Sanjay]] (b. 1946). Her younger son Sanjay had initially been her chosen heir; but after his death in a flying accident in June 1980, Gandhi  persuaded her reluctant elder son Rajiv to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981. Rajiv took office as [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] following his mother's [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassination]] in 1984; he served until December 1989. Rajiv Gandhi himself was assassinated by a suicide bomber working on behalf of [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] on 21 May 1991.

Gandhi's yoga guru, [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]], helped her in making certain decisions and also executed certain top level political tasks on her behalf, especially from 1975 to 1977 when Gandhi "declared a state of emergency and suspended civil liberties."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/obituaries/dhirendra-brahmachari-yoga-master-70.html Dhirendra Brahmachari, Yoga Master, 7], ''The New York Times'', 10 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?211174 Mrs G's String of Beaus], Outlook India, 26 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, a woman called Priya Singh Paul claimed to be Indira's granddaughter as Sanjay Gandhi's biological daughter. She claims that she was given away for adoption because Indira Gandhi hid her as a child and her mother as a wife of Sanjay Gandhi for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Priya Singh Paul claimed to be Daughter of Sanjay Gandhi|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/ludhiana/priya-singh-paul-claimed-to-be-daughter-of-sanjay-gandhi-1484774/|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on women==
In 1952 in a letter to her American friend Dorothy Norman, Gandhi wrote: "I am in no sense a feminist, but I believe in women being able to do everything...Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects Gandhi's complex feelings toward her gender and feminism.&lt;ref name="Norman, Dorothy 1985"&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense of natural equality. "Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with her boy cousins, Indira said she hardly knew the difference between a boy and a girl until the age of twelve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jayakar|first1=Pupul|title=Indira Gandhi, a biography|date=1995|publisher=Penguin|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-0140114621|page=265|edition=Rev.|url={{Google books|gm5JGkb2rhkC|page=PR9|keywords=feminist|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar, Pupul.

Indira Gandhi did not often discuss her gender, but she did involve herself in women's issues before becoming the prime minister. Before her election as the Prime Minister, she became active in the organizational wing of the Congress party, working in part in the Women's Department.&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Gandhi had an active role in setting up the Congress Party's Women's Section.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, a lot of her involvement stemmed from her father. As an only child, Gandhi naturally stepped into the political light. And, as a woman, Gandhi naturally helped head the Women's section of the Congress Party. She often tried to organize women to involve themselves in politics{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}. Although rhetorically Gandhi may have attempted to separate her political success from her gender, Gandhi did involve herself in women's organizations. The political parties in India paid substantial attention to Gandhi's gender before she became prime minister, hoping to use her for political gain{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}. 
Even though men surrounded Gandhi during her upbringing, she still had a female role model as a child. Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in Joan of Arc. In her own accounts through her letters she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: "At about eight or nine I was taken to France; Jeanne d'Arc became a great heroine of mine. She was one of the first people I read about with enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian recounts Indira's comparison of herself to Joan of Arc: "Indira developed a fascination for Joan of Arc, telling her aunt, 'Someday I am going to lead my people to freedom just as Joan of Arc did!{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's linking of herself to Joan of Arc presents a nice model for historians to assess Gandhi. As one writer said: "The Indian people were her children; members of her family were the only people capable of leading them."&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi had been swept up in the call for Indian independence since she was born in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;"Indira Gandhi." About Indira Gandhi. Web. 20 November 2012.
&lt;http://www.indiragandhi.com/aboutindiragandhi.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by 1947 she was already well immersed in politics, and by 1966, when she first assumed the position of prime minister, she had held several cabinet positions in her father's office{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}.

Gandhi's advocacy for women's rights began with her help in establishing the Congress Party's Women's Section{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}. In 1956, she wrote in a letter: "It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I have to do a great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Gandhi spent a great deal of time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: "The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field."&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Once appointed president in 1959, she "travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region"&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar, Pupul. Indira Gandhi: An Intimate Biography. New York: Pantheon, 1992. Print. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that "Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once."&lt;ref name="Norman, Dorothy 1985"/&gt;

Gandhi felt guilty about her inability to fully devote her time to her children. She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and "stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life."&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; At another point, she went into more detail: "To a woman, motherhood is the highest fulfilment...To bring a new being into this world, to see its perfection and to dream of its future greatness is the most moving of all experiences and fills one with wonder and exaltation."&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, Inder. Indira Gandhi: A Personal and Political Biography. Boston: Northeastern UP, 1989. Print. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her domestic initiatives did not necessarily reflect favourably on Indian women. Gandhi did not make a special effort to appoint women to cabinet positions. She did not appoint any women to full cabinet rank during her terms in office.&lt;ref name="Genovese, Michael A. 1993"/&gt; Yet despite this, many women saw Gandhi as a symbol for feminism and an image of women's power.&lt;ref name="Genovese, Michael A. 1993"/&gt;

Being at the forefront of Indian politics for decades, Gandhi left a powerful but controversial legacy on Indian politics.

{{History of war}}
'''Industrial warfare'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nLM1Kolw_vMC&amp;pg=PA410&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;dq=Industrial+warfare&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GIj3EJYEPR&amp;sig=GgDJjZlo0-96NLFWnHzP7Y2i1Us&amp;hl=en#PPA409,M1 p.410, Christon I. Archer, World History of Warfare]&lt;/ref&gt; is a period in the [[history of warfare]] ranging roughly from the early 19th century and the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]], which saw the rise of [[nation-state]]s, capable of creating and equipping large [[armies]], [[navies]], and [[air forces]], through the process of [[industrialization]].

The era featured [[Levée en masse|mass-conscripted]] armies, rapid transportation (first on [[Rail transport|railroads]], then by [[sealift|sea]] and [[airlift|air]]), [[telegraph]] and [[wireless communication]]s, and the concept of [[total war]]. In terms of technology, this era saw the rise of [[rifled]] [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] infantry weapons capable of [[Repeating rifle|high rates of fire]], high-velocity breech-loading [[artillery]], [[chemical weapons]], [[armoured warfare]], [[Ironclad warship|metal warships]], [[submarine]]s, and [[aircraft]].

==Total war==
{{main|Total war}}
One of the main features of industrial warfare is the concept of "total war". The term was coined during [[World War I]] by [[Erich Ludendorff]] (and again in his 1935 book ''Total War''), which called for the complete mobilization and subordination of all resources, including policy and social systems, to the German [[war effort]]. It has also come to mean waging warfare with absolute ruthlessness, and its most identifiable legacy today has been the reintroduction of [[civilian]]s and civilian infrastructure as targets in destroying the enemy's ability to engage in war.

There are several reasons for the rise of total warfare in the 19th century. The main one is industrialization. As countries' capital and natural resources grew, it became clear that some forms of warfare demanded more resources than others. Consequently, the greater cost of warfare became evident. An industrialized nation could distinguish and then choose the intensity of warfare that it wished to engage in.

Additionally, warfare was becoming more [[Mechanization|mechanized]] and required greater [[infrastructure]]. [[Combatants]] could no longer live off the land, but required an extensive support network of people behind the lines to keep them fed and armed. This required the mobilization of the [[home front]]. Modern concepts like [[propaganda]] were first used to boost production and maintain [[morale]], while [[rationing]] took place to provide more war materiel.

The earliest modern example of total war was the [[American Civil War]]. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] were convinced that, if the North was to be victorious, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]'s strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage war had to be definitively crushed. They believed that to break the backbone of the South, the North had to employ [[scorched earth]] tactics, or as Sherman called it, "Hard War". Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Thomas and David Kennedy: ''The American Pageant'', page 434. 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to later conflicts, the damage done by Sherman was almost entirely limited to property destruction. In Georgia alone, Sherman claimed he and his men had caused $100,000,000 in damages.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Conscription==
[[Image:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|right|thumb| Soldiers engaged in trench warfare during the American Civil War.]]
{{main|Conscription}}

Conscription is the compulsory enrollment of civilians into military service. Conscription allowed the [[French Republic]] to form ''[[La Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called "the nation in arms", which successfully battled European professional armies.

Conscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.  For instance, during [[World War I]], bitter political disputes broke out in [[Canada]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]), [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]],  [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (See [[Compulsory Military Training (in New Zealand)|Compulsory Military Training]]) over conscription. Canada also had a political dispute over conscription during [[World War II]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]). Both South Africa and Australia put limits on where conscripts could fight in WWII. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.

In developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.

[[Russia]], as well as many smaller nations such as [[Switzerland]], retain mainly conscript armies.

==Transportation==
[[Image:Railroad Cannon.jpg|right|thumb|The advent of railroads (such as this one during the American Civil War) allowed armies to cover larger distances in shorter times while suffering minimal fatigue.]]

===Land===
{{main|Motorised infantry}}
Prior to the invention of the motorized transport, combatants were transported from by wagons, horses and by marching.  With the advent of locomotives, large groups of combatants, supplies, and equipment were able to be transported faster and in larger numbers. To counter this, an opposing force would destroy rail lines to hinder their [[Enemy (military)|enemies]]' movements. [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]'s men during the [[American Civil War]], would destroy tracks, heat the rails, and [[Sherman's neckties|wrap them around trees]].

The mass transportation of combatants was further revolutionized with the advent of the [[internal combustion engine]] and the [[automobile]]. Combined with the widespread use of the machine gun, the horse, after millennia of use, was finally supplanted in its war time role. During both WWI and WWII, trucks were used to carry combatants and materiel, while cars and jeeps were used to scout enemy positions.

{{main|Mechanized infantry}}
The mechanization of infantry occurred during WWII.  The [[tank]], a product of [[World War I]] invented by the British to break through trenches while withstanding machine gun fire, while discounted by many, came into its own.  Tanks evolved from thin-skinned, lumbering vehicles into fast, powerful war machines of [[Tank classification|various types]] that dominated the battlefield and allowed the [[Nazi Germany|German]]s to conquer most of Europe.  As a result of the tank's evolution, a number of armored transport vehicles appeared, such as [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and [[amphibious vehicles]].

After the war ended, armored transports continued to evolve. The armored car and train declined in use, largely becoming relegated to military and civilian use as transportation for [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]]s. [[Infantry fighting vehicle]]s rose to prominence with the creation of the [[Red Army|Soviet]] [[BMP-1]].  IFVs are a more combat capable version of the APC, with heavier armaments (such as [[autocannon]]s), while still retaining the ability to transport combatants into and out of battles.

===Sea===
{{main|Sealift}}
Sealift is a [[military logistics]] term referring to the use of [[cargo ship]]s for the [[Military deployment|deployment]] of military assets, such as [[weapon]]ry, [[military personnel]], and [[materiel]] supplies. It complements other means of transport, such as [[strategic airlift]]ers, in order to enhance a [[Sovereign state|state]]'s ability to [[power projection|project power]]. A state's sealift capabilities may include civilian-operated ships that normally operate by contract, but which can be chartered or commandeered during times of military necessity to supplement government-owned [[naval fleet]]s.

During WWI, the [[United States]] bought, borrowed or commandeered vessels of various types, ranging from pleasure craft to ocean liners to transport the [[American Expeditionary Force]] to Europe.  Many of these ships were scrapped, sold or returned to their owners after the war.

===Air===
{{main|Airlift}}

There are two different kinds of airlifts in warfare, a strategic airlift and a [[tactical airlift]].  A strategic airlift is the use transporting of weapons, supplies and personnel over long distances (from a base in one country to a base in another country for example) using large [[cargo aircraft]]. This contrasts with tactical airlifts, which involves transporting the same above items within a [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]].  This usually involves cargo planes with shorter ranges and slower speeds, but higher maneuverability.

{{Main|Land warfare}}

Land warfare, as the name implies, takes place on land. The most common type of warfare, it can encompass several modes and locales, including [[Urban warfare|urban]], [[Arctic warfare|arctic]] and [[Mountain warfare|mountain]] warfare.

The early part of the 19th century from 1815 to 1848 saw a long period of peace in Europe, accompanied by extraordinary industrial expansion. The industrial age brought about various technological advancements, each with their own implication. Land warfare moved from visual-range and semi person-to-person combat of the previous era, to indiscriminate and impersonal, "beyond visual range" warfare. The [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856) saw the introduction of trench warfare, long-range artillery, railroads, the telegraph and the rifle. The mechanized mass-destruction of enemy combatants grew ever more deadly. In WWI (1914–1918) machine-guns, barbed wire, chemical weapons and land-mines entered the battlefield. The deadly stalemated [[trench warfare|trench-warfare]] stage was finally passed with the advent of the modern armored tank late in WWI.

One major trend involved the transition away massed infantry fire and [[human waves]] to more refined tactics. This became possible with the superseding of earlier weapons like the highly inaccurate [[musket]].

===Technological advances===

{{See also|Field artillery in the American Civil War}}

''Rifling'' refers to the act of adding spiral grooves to the inside the barrel of a firearm. The grooves would cause a projectile to spin as it traveled down the barrel, improving range and accuracy.  Once rifling became easier and practical, a new type of firearm was introduced, the [[rifle]]. It gave combatants the ability to specifically target an enemy combatant, rather than have large numbers of combatants fire in a general direction. It effectively broke up groups of combatants into smaller more maneuverable units.

''Artillery'' are large guns designed to fire large projectiles a great distance. Early artillery pieces were large and cumbersome with slow rates of fire. This reduced their use to sieges, by both defenders and attackers. With the advent of the industrial age and various technological advancements, lighter, yet powerful and accurate artillery pieces were produced. This gave rise to [[field artillery]] which were used on a tactical level to support troops.

''Machine guns'' are fully automatic guns. In this era of warfare they only existed as mounted support weapons, as automatic firearms were not yet developed. Early machine guns as invented by Gatling, were hand cranked but evolved into truly automatic machine guns by Maxim at the end of the era. Machine guns were valued for their ability to smash infantry formations, especially attacking enemy formations when they were dense. This, along with effective field artillery, changed tactics drastically.

===Static defense===
Static defenses evolved from the use of permanent fortifications that were direct descendants of medieval castles. As artillery improved in destructive power and penetrative ability, more modern fortifications were developed, using first thicker layers of stone, then concrete and steel. After naval artillery developed the turret – a moving cannon platform – land fortifications started to use this method as well. Between the World Wars, France built an "impregnable" underground steel and concrete fortification that ran the length of the German-French border. This [[Maginot Line]]  failed to stop German tanks in 1940: they bypassed the fortifications by invading through neighboring Belgium.

Temporary fortifications. {{details|Trench warfare}} As artillery and rifles allowed the killing of enemy personnel at a longer effective range, soldiers started to dig into temporary fortifications. These included massive trenches as used in WWI, and individual soldier-sized "fox holes" which became more common in WWII.

===Maneuver warfare===
[[File:UH-1D helicopters in Vietnam 1966.jpg|right|thumb| Starting in 1965, commanders could insert large forces behind enemy lines, first by plane and later by helicopter.]]
{{Main|Maneuver warfare}}

Maneuver had existed throughout military history – from soldiers marching on the field to using horses in cavalry formations. It was not until the advent of mechanized transport over unprepared terrain, such as fields and deserts, using tanks and armored vehicles, that "maneuver warfare" became feasible. First used by the German army in Poland and France in WWII, [[Blitzkrieg]] or "lightning war" saw whole armies moved rapidly on tracked and armored fighting vehicles. During the war airborne movement was used, with soldiers dropped to the battlefield by parachute by both the Germans and the Allies. After WWII, developments in helicopters brought a more practical way to transport troops by air.

==Naval warfare==
{{main|Naval warfare}}
[[Image:Cumberland rammed by Merrimac.png|right|thumb|The sinking of the ''[[USS Cumberland (1842)|Cumberland]]'' by the Confederate [[ironclad]] ''[[CSS Virginia|Virginia]]'' in 1862 marked the beginning of the end for wooden warships.]]

===Ironclads and Dreadnoughts===
The period after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] was one of intensive experimentation with new technology; [[steam power]] for ships appeared in the 1810s, improved [[metallurgy]] and machining technique produced larger and deadlier guns, and the development of explosive shells, capable of demolishing a wooden ship at a single blow, in turn required the addition of iron armor, which led to [[ironclads]].

The famous [[Battle of Hampton Roads|battle of the ''CSS Virginia'' and ''USS Monitor'']] in the [[American Civil War]] was the duel of ironclads that symbolized the changing times.  Although the battle was inconclusive, nations around the world subsequently raced to convert their fleets to iron, as ironclads had shown themselves to be clearly superior to wooden ships in their ability to withstand enemy fire.

In the late 19th century, naval warfare was revolutionized by [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]'s book ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]''.  Mahan argued that in the Anglo-French wars of the 18th and 19th centuries, domination of the sea was the deciding factor in the outcome, and therefore control of seaborne commerce was critical to military victory.  Mahan argued that the best way to achieve naval domination was through large fleets of concentrated [[capital ships]], as opposed to [[commerce raiders]].  His books were closely studied in all the Great Powers, influencing their naval [[arms race]] in the years prior to WWI.

[[Image:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H63596.jpg|thumb|right|In 1906 the British warship ''[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS Dreadnought]]'' became the first warship to have both a uniform main battery and steam turbine engines, creating a standard for warships that lasted until the 1940s.]]

As the century came to a close, the familiar modern battleship began to emerge; a [[steel]]-armored ship, entirely dependent on steam, and sporting a number of large shell guns mounted in turrets arranged along the centerline of the main deck. The ultimate design was reached in 1906 with ''[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS Dreadnought]]'' which entirely dispensed with smaller guns, her main guns being sufficient to sink any existing ship of the time.

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] and particularly the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905 was the first test of the new concepts, resulting in a stunning Japanese victory and the destruction of dozens of Russian ships.  [[World War I]] pitted the old Royal Navy against the new navy of [[Imperial Germany]], culminating in the 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]].  Following the war, many nations agreed to limit the size of their fleets in the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and scrapped many of their battleships and cruisers.

Growing tensions of the 1930s restarted the building programs, with even larger ships than before: the Japanese battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Yamato|Yamato]]'', launched in 1941, displaced 72,000 tons and mounted {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} guns.  This marked the climax of "big gun" warfare, as aircraft would gradually play a larger role in warfare.  By the 1960s, battleships had all-but vanished from the fleets of the world.

===Aircraft carriers===
[[Image:VT-6TBDs.jpg|right|thumb|In the 1940s aircraft carriers supplanted battleships as the centerpiece of the fleet.  Here, American [[torpedo bombers]] prepare to take off during the [[Battle of Midway]] in 1942.]]

Between the world wars, the first [[aircraft carrier]]s appeared, initially as a way to circumvent the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty (many of the first carriers were converted battlecruisers).  Though several ships had previously been designed to launch and in some cases, the first true "flat-top" carrier was ''[[HMS Argus (I49)|HMS Argus]]'', launched in December 1917.

By the start of WWII, aircraft carriers typically carried three types of aircraft: [[torpedo bombers]], which could also be used for conventional horizontal bombing and reconnaissance; [[dive bombers]], also used for reconnaissance; and fighters for fleet defence and bomber escort duties.  Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, these aircraft were almost always small, single-engined warplanes.  The first true demonstration of naval air power was the victory of the [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Battle of Taranto]] in 1940, which set the stage for Japan's much larger and more famous [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] the following year.

Two days after Pearl Harbor, the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''HMS Prince of Wales'' and ''HMS Repulse'']], marked the beginning of the end for the battleship era.  Following WWII, aircraft carriers continued to remain key to navies throughout the latter 20th century, moving in the 1950s to jets launched from [[Supercarrier]]s, behemoths which could displace as much as 100,000 tons.

===Submarines===
Just as important was the development of [[submarines]] to travel underneath the sea, at first for short dives, then later to be able to spend weeks or months underwater powered by a [[nuclear reactor]].  The first successful submarine attack in wartime was in 1864 by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] submarine ''[[H.L. Hunley]]'' which sank the [[frigate]] ''[[USS Housatonic (1861)|USS Housatonic]]''.

In both World Wars, submarines primarily exerted their power by sinking [[merchant ships]] using [[torpedoes]], in addition to attacks on warships.  All nations practiced [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in which submarines sank merchant ships without warning, but the only successful campaign during this period was America's submarine war against Japan during the [[Pacific War]].  In the 1950s the [[Cold War]] inspired the development of ballistic missile submarines, each one loaded with dozens of nuclear-armed missiles and with orders to launch them from sea should the other nation attack.

==Aerial warfare==
{{main|Aerial warfare}}
[[File:B-17Gs 381st BG en route to target c1944.jpg|right|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers flying in a large attack formation]]
The first use of airplanes in war was the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911, when the Italians carried out several [[reconnaissance]] and [[bombing]] missions.  During WWI both sides made use of [[balloons]] and airplanes for reconnaissance and directing artillery fire.  To prevent enemy reconnaissance, some airplane pilots began attacking other airplanes and balloons, first with small arms carried in the cockpit, and later with machine guns mounted on the aircraft.  Both sides also made use of aircraft for bombing, strafing and dropping of propaganda leaflets.

The German air force carried out the first [[terror bombing]] raids, using [[Zeppelins]] to drop bombs on Britain.  By the end of the war airplanes had become specialised into [[bombers]], [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], and [[surveillance aircraft]].  Most of these airplanes were [[biplanes]] with wooden frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and [[air-cooled]] engines.

Between 1918 and 1939, aircraft technology developed very rapidly.  By 1939 military biplanes were in the process of being replaced with metal framed [[monoplanes]], often with stressed skins and liquid cooled engines. Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled (and [[oxygen masks]] become commonplace); ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously.

Some theorists, most famously [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]] and [[Giulio Douhet]], believed that aircraft would become the dominant military arm in the future, and argued that future wars would be won entirely by the destruction of the enemy's military and industrial capability from the air.  This concept was called [[strategic bombing]]. Douhet also argued in ''[[The Command of the Air]]'' (1921) that future military leaders could avoid falling into bloody World War I-style trench stalemates by using aviation to strike past the enemy's forces directly at their vulnerable civilian population, which Douhet believed would cause these populations to rise up in revolt to stop the bombing.

Others, such as [[Billy Mitchell]], saw the potential of air power to neutralize the striking power of naval surface fleets.  Mitchell himself proved the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft was finally in 1921 when he commanded a squadron of bombers that sank the ex-German battleship [[SMS Ostfriesland|SMS ''Ostfriesland'']] with aerial bombs. (See [[Industrial warfare#Naval warfare]])

During WWII, there was a debate between [[strategic bombing]] and [[tactical bombing]]. Strategic bombing focused on targets such as [[factories]], [[railroads]], [[oil refineries]], and heavily populated areas such as [[cities]] and [[town]]s, and required [[Strategic bomber|heavy four-engine bombers]] carrying large payloads of [[aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] (or a single heavy four-engine bomber carrying a [[nuclear weapon]]) flying deep into enemy territory. Tactical bombing focused on concentration of combatants, [[command and control|command and control centers]], [[airfields]], and [[ammunition dump]]s, and required [[attack aircraft]], [[dive bombers]], and [[fighter bombers]] that could fly low over the battlefield.

In the early years of WWII, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' focused on [[tactical bombing]], using large numbers of [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 Stukas]] as "flying artillery" for land offensives. Artillery was slow and required time to set up a firing position, whereas aircraft were better able keep up with the fast advances of the German panzer columns.  Close air support greatly assisted in the successes of the German Army in the [[Battle of France]]. It was also important in [[amphibious warfare]], where aircraft carriers could provide support for soldiers landing on the beaches.

[[File:Boeing-Whichata B-29 Assembly Line - 1944.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers under construction on an assembly line]]
[[Strategic bombing]], by contrast, was unlike anything the world has seen before or since. In 1940, the Germans attempted to force Britain to surrender through attacks on its airfields and factories, and then on its cities in [[The Blitz]] in what became the [[Battle of Britain]], the first major battle whose outcome was determined primarily in the air. The campaigns conducted in Europe and Asia could involve thousands of aircraft dropping tens of thousands of tons of munitions over a single city.

Military aviation in the post-war years was dominated by the needs of the [[Cold War]]. The postwar years saw a rapid conversion to [[Jet engine|jet]] power, which resulted in enormous increases in speeds and altitudes of aircraft. Until the advent of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]], major powers relied on high-altitude bombers to deliver their newly developed nuclear deterrent. Each country strove to develop the technology of bombers and the high-altitude fighters that could intercept them. The concept of air superiority began to play a heavy role in aircraft designs for both the United States and the Soviet Union.

==The end of industrial warfare==
{{main|Modern warfare}}

===Nuclear warfare===
{{main|Nuclear warfare}}
[[Image:Bumper8 launch-GPN-2000-000613.jpg|thumb|right|US test launch of a German [[V-2]] [[ballistic missile]].]]

The use of nuclear weapons first came into being during the last months of WWII, with the dropping of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].  This was the only use of nuclear weapons in combat.  For a decade after [[World War II]], the [[United States]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] (and to a lesser extent the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]) developed and maintained a strategic force of bombers that would be able to attack any potential aggressor from bases inside their countries.

Before the development of a capable strategic missile force in the Soviet Union, much of the war-fighting doctrine held by western nations revolved around the use of a large number of smaller nuclear weapons used in a tactical role. It is arguable if such use could be considered "limited" however, because it was believed that the US would use their own strategic weapons (mainly bombers at the time) should the USSR deploy any kind of nuclear weapon against civilian targets.

A revolution in thinking occurred with the introduction of the [[ICBM|intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM), which the Soviet Union first successfully tested in the late 1950s. To deliver a warhead to a target, a missile was far less expensive than a bomber that could do the same job. Moreover, at the time it was impossible to intercept ICBMs due to their high altitude and speed.

In the 1960s, another major shift in nuclear doctrine occurred with the development of the [[SLBM|submarine-based nuclear missile]] (SLBM). It was hailed by military theorists as a weapon that would assure a surprise attack would not destroy the capability to retaliate, and therefore would make nuclear war less likely.

===The Cold War===
{{main|The Cold War}}
Since the end of WWII, no industrial nations have fought such a large, decisive war, due to the availability of weapons that are so destructive that their use would [[Pyrrhic victory|offset the advantages of victory]]. The fighting of a total war where nuclear weapons are used is something that instead of taking years and the full mobilisation of a country's resources such as in WWII, would take tens of minutes. Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peace time defence budgets.

By the end of the 1950s, the [[ideology|ideological]] stand-off of the Cold War between the [[Western World]] and the [[Soviet Union]] involved thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed at each side by the other. Strategically, the equal balance of destructive power possessed by each side situation came to be known as [[Mutually assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD), the idea that a nuclear attack by one superpower would result in nuclear counter-strike by the other. This would result in hundreds of millions of deaths in a world where, in words widely attributed to [[Nikita Khrushchev]], "The living will envy the dead".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/1257.html Attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, speaking of nuclear war] [http://www.bartleby.com/ www.bartleby.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the [[superpower]]s sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons. Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in [[proxy wars]], military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs.

In the case of proxy wars, each superpower supported its respective allies in conflicts with forces aligned with the other superpower, such as in the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].

The '''International Water Management Institute''' ('''IWMI''') is a non-profit research organisation with headquarters in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]], and offices across Africa and Asia. Research at the Institute focuses on improving how [[water resources|water]] and [[land resources]] are managed, with the aim of underpinning [[food security]] and reducing poverty while safeguarding vital environmental processes.

As [[water scarcity|water becomes scarcer]], there is a growing need to find ways to produce sufficient food to feed the [[human population growth|world’s expanding population]], while using less water, safeguarding fragile [[environmental services]] and without having much opportunity to open up [[agricultural expansion|new agricultural lands]]. The Institute undertakes research projects with this aim in mind.

Its research focuses on: [[Water resources|water availability]] and access, including adaptation to [[climate change]]; how water is used and how it can be used more productively; [[water quality]] and its relationship to [[public health|health]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]]; and how societies govern their water resources. In 2012, IWMI was awarded the prestigious [[Stockholm Water Prize]] Laureate by [[Stockholm International Water Institute]] for its pioneering research, which has helped to improve [[farm water|agricultural water]] management, enhance [[food security]], protect [[environmental health]] and alleviate poverty in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2012/03/26/news20.asp SL-based IWMI wins world's most prestigious Water Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330010601/http://www.dailynews.lk/2012/03/26/news20.asp |date=2012-03-30 }}, Daily News, 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

IWMI is a member of [[CGIAR]], a global research partnership that unites organizations engaged in research for sustainable development, and leads the CGIAR Research Program on [[Water, Land and Ecosystems]]. IWMI is also a partner in the [[CGIAR]] Research Programs on: Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS); Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Dryland Systems; and Integrated Systems for the Humid Tropics.

===Early focus on irrigation===
The Institute was founded under the name '''International [[Irrigation]] Management Institute''' (IIMI) in 1985 by the [[Ford Foundation]] and the Government of Sri Lanka, supported by the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] and the [[World Bank]]. During the [[Green Revolution]] of the 1940s to 1970s, billions of dollars had been spent building large-scale [[irrigation system]]s. These contributed, along with new [[fertilizer]]s, pesticides and high-yielding varieties of seeds, to helping many countries produce greater quantities of [[food crops]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukherji, A.

IIMI's researchers discovered that problems affecting irrigation were often more institutional than technical. It advocated ‘Participatory Irrigation Management’ (PIM) as the solution, an approach that sought to involve farmers in water management decisions. In 1992, the [[Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit]] gave credence to this approach by recommending that water management be [[decentralized]], with farmers and other stakeholders playing a more important role in managing natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, 1992. [https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/resources/res_docukeyconf_eartsumm.shtml Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, 3–14 June 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially met with resistance, PIM went on to become the status quo for governments and major lending agencies. IIMI became a member of the CGIAR system in 1991.

===Wider perspective===

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Man watering crops in Volta Basin.jpg|thumb|alt=Watering crops|With increasing demands on water, IWMI expanded its research remit]] --&gt;
By the mid 1990s, competition for water resources was rising, thanks to a larger global population, expanding cities and increasing industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. (2010). ''Out of Water: From abundance to scarcity and how to solve the world’s water problems''. FT Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing irrigation in isolation was no longer relevant to the global situation. A new approach was needed that would consider it within a river basin context, encompassing competing users and the environment. IIMI began developing new fields of research, on topics such as open and closed [[Drainage basin|basin]]s, water [[accounting]], multiple-use systems, basin institutions, [[remote sensing]] analysis and [[environmental flows]].&lt;ref&gt;Turral, H. [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/About_IWMI/Strategic_Documents/Annual_Reports/2004_2005/c32.htm More crop per drop – Moving from dry to wet water savings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718024418/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/About_IWMI/Strategic_Documents/Annual_Reports/2004_2005/c32.htm |date=2011-07-18 }} IWMI Annual Report 2004/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, its name changed to the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), reflecting this new wider approach.

Although it was becoming evident that water could no longer be considered an "[[infinite resource]]", as had been the case in the 1950s when there were fewer people on the planet, no one knew just how scarce the resource was. This prompted IWMI to try to find out. Its research culminated in publication of ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture]]''. A map within the report showed that a third of the world’s population already suffered from ‘water scarcity’. The report defined [[physical water scarcity]], as being where there are insufficient water resources to meet the demands of the population, and [[economic water scarcity]] as where water requirements are not satisfied because of a lack of investment in water or human capacity.

===Averting a global water crisis===
IWMI’s approach towards defining water scarcity provided a new context within which the scientific debate on water availability subsequently became centred. For example, the theme of the UN [[World Water Day]] in 2007 was Coping with Water Scarcity;&lt;ref&gt;UN World Water Day, 2007. [http://www.unwater.org/wwd07/flashindex.html Coping with water scarcity.] 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The USA's Worldwatch Institute featured a chapter on water management in its assessment ''State of the World 2008'';&lt;ref&gt;Bergkamp, G. and Sadoff, C. Chapter 8: Water in a sustainable economy, [http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5551 State of the World 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401232108/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5551 |date=2009-04-01 }}. Worldwatch Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; and reports published in 2009 by the World Economic Forum and UNESCO concluded that water scarcity is now a bigger threat than the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Lean, Geoffrey [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/water-scarcity-now-bigger-threat-than-financial-crisis-1645358.html Water scarcity now bigger threat than financial crisis.] ''The Independent'', Sunday 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, also highlighted water scarcity at the 2009 Nobel Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/environment/global-warming/water-scarcity-will-create-global-security-concerns-pachauri/articleshow/5097048.cms Water scarcity will create global security concerns: Pachauri.] ''The Economic Times'', 7 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

If current trends continue, global annual water usage is set to increase by more than two trillion cubic metres by 2030, rising to 6.9 trillion cubic metres. That equates to 40 per cent more than can be provided by available water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, N. [http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101004/full/news.2010.490.html How to avert a global water crisis.] ''Nature News'', 4 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; At Stockholm [[World Water Week]] 2010, IWMI highlighted a six-point plan for averting a water crisis. According to the Institute, the following actions are required: 1) gather high-quality data about water resources; 2) take better care of the environment; 3) reform how water resources are governed; 4) revitalize how water is used for farming; 5) better manage urban and municipal demands for water; and 6) involve marginalized people in water management.&lt;ref&gt;Eichenseher, Tasha. [http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2010/09/six-steps-for-avoiding-a-globa.html Six steps for avoiding a global water crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910010725/http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2010/09/six-steps-for-avoiding-a-globa.html |date=2010-09-10 }} ''Nat Geo News Watch'', September 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, IWMI celebrated its 25th anniversary by commissioning a series of essays on agricultural and development.

==Using water management to reduce poverty==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Farmer in Gujarat-landscape.jpg|thumb|alt=Farmer in India|Rationing farm power helped to improve livelihoods in Gujarat, India]] --&gt;

IWM's work in [[Gujarat]], India, exemplifies how improving water management can have an influence on peoples' livelihoods. The state faced the dual problem of bankrupt electricity utilities and [[groundwater depletion|depleted groundwater]] storage following the introduction of electricity subsidies to farmers from around 1970. The situation arose because the subsidies enabled farmers to easily pump groundwater from ever-increasing depths. The [[Asian Development Bank]] and [[World Bank]] both indicated that governments should cut the electricity subsidies and charge farmers based on metered consumption of power. However, when some state governments tried to do so, the farmers formed such powerful lobbies that several chief ministers lost their seats. A different solution was clearly required.

IWMI scientists who studied the problem suggested governments should introduce ‘intelligent rationing’ of farm [[power supply]] by separating the [[power cable]]s carrying electricity to farmers from those supplying other rural users, such as domestic households and industries. They should then provide farmers with a high-quality power supply for a set number of hours each day at a price they could afford. Eventually Gujarat decided to include these recommendations in a larger programme to reform the electricity utility. A study conducted afterwards found its impacts to be much greater than anticipated. Prior to the change, tube-well owners had been holding rural communities to ransom by ‘stealing’ power for irrigation. After the cables were separated, rural households, schools and industries had a much higher-quality power supply, which in turn boosted individuals’ well-being.

Dunaway]] on a horse-drawn [[limbers and caissons]] during a military [[funeral procession]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], 2008.]]

A '''military funeral''' is a memorial or burial rite given by a country's [[military]] for a [[soldier]], [[sailor]], [[marine (military)|marine]] or [[airman]] who died in battle, a [[veteran]], or other prominent military figures or [[Head of state|heads of state]]. A military [[funeral]] may feature [[Guard of honour|guards of honor]], the firing of [[3-volley salute|volley shots]] as a salute, drumming and other military elements, with a [[flag]] draping over the [[coffin]].

==Canada==
Canadian military funerals involve many rituals seen in other parts of the world. The [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]] use a [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounder]] gun and [[limbers and caissons|limber]] as the funeral vehicle. Muffled drums accompany the graveside processional. The deceased's headdress, insignia and medals are borne on a [[velvet]] cushion into the funeral service. Volleys are fired over the grave when the body is interred. Countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] duplicate the British military drill and ceremony. The Canadian funeral described above typifies the funerary service. The [[bugle]] tune ''[[Last Post]]'' is played as the body is interred.

==Chile==
[[File:Feretro Pinochet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chilean Army]] cadets carrying the coffin of general [[Augusto Pinochet]].]]
In [[Military of Chile|Chilean military]] funerals, due to its [[Prussian Army|Prussian military]] tradition, the German song "[[Ich hatt' einen Kameraden]]" is sung in its Spanish version ("''Yo tenía un camarada''"). The casket may or may not be horse-drawn on a caisson. A bugler sounds the final honors during interment.

When the coffin enters the tomb, a [[fireteam]] executes a [[salvo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armada.cl/armada/tradicion-e-historia/tradiciones-navales/2014-05-15/111832.html Tradiciones Navales]. [[Chilean Navy]], n/d (in Spanish). Retrieved 25 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; If for a general or flag officer, the 1st Artillery Regiment "Tacna" fires a three-volley gun salute.

==Germany==
[[File:WDK 6198 17.JPG|Funeral of [[Helmut Schmidt]], former German Chancellor and Minister of Defence|thumb|right]]
In [[Germany]], [[Ludwig Uhland]]'s song "[[Ich hatt' einen Kameraden]]" is an integral part of a military funeral. It is played when the coffin is lowered into the grave,
military personnel will perform a [[salute]].

==Indonesia==
In [[Indonesia]], military funerals are generally given only military members or former guerrillas, Konfrontasi and Trikora Operation Soldiers, especially those holding the '''Bintang Gerilya''' (Star of the Guerrilla). Exceptional politicians and Ministers have the option for such a funeral, but most opt for a more intimate religious one. Music is not performed as it is not part of Indonesian military tradition, save only during the final honors. A 21-gun volley salute is the norm by seven soldiers- occasionally a mixture of armed forces personnel dependent on their career,&lt;ref&gt;(example- a Minister of Transportation may have been a career Army soldier, became a bureaucrat and assisted the national aviation or maritime industry- thus the corresponding Force would send soldiers as gratitude)&lt;/ref&gt; Honour drill team is [[platoon]]-size formation and the larger the platoon or half company, the more illustrious the departed. A good example of an Indonesian military burial is that of the late president [[Suharto]]- (although obvious major differences exist). Prayers are led by representatives of the person's religious faith. Similar traditions also exist in the [[Indonesian National Police]].

==Italy==

{{Further|State funeral#Italy}}

In [[Italy]] the members of the [[Italian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] who died in the line of duty are granted a [[state funeral]] by decree of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name=ItaSF&gt;{{cite web|title=Protocol for State Funerals and National Mourning|url=http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/ufficio_cerimoniale/cerimoniale/esequie.html|publisher=Official website of the Italian Government - Department of State Ceremonies}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the funeral follows the protocol of a [[state funeral]], and in particular the six officers in high uniform who carry the coffin are members of the same [[Armed forces of Italy|Armed Force]] of the departed.

==Poland==
In [[Poland]], the last fragment of [[Władysław Tarnowski]]'s song ''Śpij, kolego'' ("Sleep, friend"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|authorlink=|title=Śpij, kolego (score)|url=http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/download/tmp/2009-12-11/fd20e7a68a696a973ecff32cd6791a0a06%20-%20śpij%20kolego.pdf|date=|work=|publisher=[http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl Polish Army WEB]|accessdate=14 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607020548/http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/download/tmp/2009-12-11/fd20e7a68a696a973ecff32cd6791a0a06%20-%20%C5%9Bpij%20kolego.pdf|archive-date=7 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|authorlink=|title=Śpij, kolego (mp3)|url=http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/mobjects/view/46752,13f+%C5%9Bpij+kolego.mp3.html|date=|work=|publisher=[http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl Polish Army WEB]|accessdate=14 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124091845/http://www.wojsko-polskie.pl/mobjects/view/46752,13f+%C5%9Bpij+kolego.mp3.html|archive-date=24 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polish text {{cite web |author= |authorlink= |title= Jak to na wojence ładnie |url= http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Jak_to_na_wojence_%C5%82adnie|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a portion of the larger composition ''Jak to na wojence ładnie'' (the title has no precise English translation, but it is roughly "how nice it is in war", with a diminutive form conveying a sense of ironic solidarity)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|authorlink=|title=Jak to na wojence ładnie mp3|url=http://odsiebie.com/pokaz/2124148---618f.html|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an integral part of a military funeral, played by a trumpeter. It is also played during state ceremonies. Also part of it is a three volley salute (''salwa honorowa'') with the firing party consisting of an armed platoon or company.

==Spain==
In Spain, the  formed troops sing "''[[La muerte no es el final]]''": ''Death is not the End'' during funeral ceremonies and in all military ceremonies, when the fallen are being honored. The [[Spanish Legion]] has an exception: the regimental hymn ''Novio de la Muerte'' (''Bridegroom of Death'') is played in full instead during occasions that the Legion attends.

==United Kingdom==
The British Army carries reversed arms at military funerals. The Last Post and Rouse or Reveille are sounded at the right moment during the rite.

==United States of America==
{{Main|Military funerals in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Army Military District of Washington]] (MDW) is responsible for providing military funerals. "Honoring Those Who Served" is the title of the program for instituting a dignified military funeral with full honors to the nation's veterans.

As of January 1, 2000, Section 578 of Public Law 106-65 of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] mandates that the [[United States Armed Forces]] shall provide the rendering of honors in a military funeral for any eligible veteran if requested by his or her family. As mandated by federal law, an [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] detail for the burial of an eligible veteran shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Armed Forces. One member of the detail shall be a representative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor guard detail will, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and presenting of the [[flag of the United States]] to the [[next of kin]] and the playing of ''[[Taps]]'' which will be played by a [[bugle (instrument)|lone bugler]], if available, or by [[audio recording]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascensionfuneralgroup.com/services/veteran-services|title= Veterans Funeral Services|date= |accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, there are so few buglers available that the United States Armed Forces often cannot provide one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfuneralhonors.osd.mil/faqpage.html|title=What is Military Funeral Honors?|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, federal law allows [[Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States|Reserve]] and [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units to assist with funeral honors duty when necessary. On the day of the burial or interment, the U.S. Flag is lowered to half-staff.

==Other==
* After the [[2006 Lebanon war]], [[Hezbollah]] draped coffins containing their dead in Hezbollah flags with flowers on top. They were given a funeral according to [[Shiite]] Muslim traditions, then buried in their hometowns.
* [[Irish Republican Army]] members have been accorded military funerals.
* On occasion, deceased soldiers have been accorded military funerals by their enemies (for example, see [[Manfred von Richthofen#Burial|Manfred von Richthofen]]).

The '''National Committee on American Foreign Policy''' ('''NCAFP''') is an American nonprofit, nonpartisan activist organization dedicated to the resolution of conflicts that threaten United States interests.

Founded in 1974 by [[Hans Morgenthau]], the organization works to identify, articulate, and advance [[foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign-policy]] interests within the framework of political realism.

==Mission==
The U.S. foreign-policy interests of the NCAFP include:
* Preserving and strengthening [[national security]]
* Supporting countries committed to the values and practice of political, religious, and cultural [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]
* Improving U.S. relations with the developed and developing worlds
* Advancing [[human rights]]
* Encouraging realist [[arms control|arms-control]] agreements
* Curbing the proliferation of [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]] and other [[unconventional warfare|unconventional weapons]]
* Promoting an open and global economy

The organization believes that an informed public is vital to a democratic society. To promote this, it offers educational programs to its members and general audiences that address security challenges facing the U.S. and publishes a variety of publications, including the bimonthly journal, ''American Foreign Policy Interests''.

==History==
The National Committee was founded in 1974 by Hans J. Morgenthau and others dedicated to the resolution of conflicts that threaten U.S. interests.

The National Committee grew quickly in size and influence. It held public seminars regularly, assembled task forces in order to analyze areas of critical concern to the United States, and published journals and pamphlets containing summaries and policy recommendations derived from high-level conferences and briefings featuring American and foreign policymakers. In 1981, the first Hans J. Morgenthau Award was presented to NCAFP president [[Angier Biddle Duke]]. Subsequent recipients have included [[Henry Kissinger]], [[George Shultz]], [[James Baker III]], the [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Colin Powell]]. A second award, the George F. Kennan Award for Distinguished Public Service, was established in 1994. Recipients include [[George F. Kennan]], the [[Cyrus R. Vance]], the [[Paul A. Volcker]], [[Richard C. Holbrooke]], [[John D. Negroponte]], and General [[David H. Petraeus]].

In 1993 William J. Flynn, chairman and chief executive officer of [[Mutual of America]], became the chairman of the National Committee. When the British and Irish governments issued the [[Downing Street Declaration]] at the end of that year, the National Committee under his leadership placed a full-page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'' challenging every party involved in the conflict to attend an NCAFP-sponsored conference to air the arguments of all sides. The National Committee was instrumental in convincing President [[Bill Clinton]] to issue a visa to [[Gerry Adams]], the leader of [[Sinn Féin]]. Adams's first appearance in the United States enabled him to begin to develop ties with key leaders in New York and Washington that gave him and his party the assurance necessary to enter into peace negotiations, sign the [[Belfast Agreement]], and contend for and win political office in the North. In recognition of William Flynn's achievements, the National Committee established the William J. Flynn Initiative for Peace Award in 1997. Among the recipients are [[George J. Mitchell]], [[Marjorie Mowlam]], [[Viola Drath]], [[Hugh Carey]], and Gerry Adams, M.P.

Shortly after establishing its Northern Ireland project, the NCAFP launched its [[Track II diplomacy|track I-½ and track II project]] on [[U.S.-China relations]] and the question of [[Taiwan]]. The project gradually grew into the Forum on Asia-Pacific Security. The NCAFP, under this thematic umbrella, sponsored security talks with North Korea on nuclear issues and, more recently, security issues affecting [[Japan–United States relations|U.S.-Japan]] and [[South Korea–United States relations|U.S.-South Korea]] relations. The entire Forum on Asia-Pacific Security is largely conducted at track I-½ and track II levels.

Since its founding, the National Committee has focused its attention on significant geopolitical regions such as the [[Middle East]] and strategic partnerships such as [[Transatlantic relations|Transatlantic Relations]]. More recently, as an outgrowth of those studies, the NCAFP established projects on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian Sea Basin]] and [[United States and the United Nations|U.S.-UN relations]], as well as on [[Africa]]. While the Committee's scope has broadened, it remains anchored to its values: the preservation and strengthening of national security; supporting political, religious, and cultural pluralism; improving U.S. relations with its allies; advancing [[human rights]]; curbing nuclear proliferation and encouraging realistic arms-control agreements; and promoting an open global economy.

==Task forces==
Its long-term task forces bring together U.S. and foreign scholars, foreign-policy practitioners, and others to off-the-record and sometimes closed-door forums where adversaries can, over a period of years, air their views unencumbered by official rhetoric.

Shorter-term task forces deal with immediate foreign policy challenges facing the U.S.

===Meetings===
The organization's Meetings Program offers members and guests the opportunity to share their thoughts on U.S. foreign policy with influential policymakers, diplomats, renowned scholars, and foreign policy specialists. Each year, the organization convenes a series of programs, including single speaker events, panels and round tables addressing immediate and long-term issues of national security.

===Special initiatives===
In May 2004, it launched its Forum on Northeast Asian Security. Projects chaired by [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Paul Volcker]] include exploring the potential for a nuclear-free [[Korean Peninsula]]; a Northeast Asian Security Forum, composed of the U.S., [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]]; and breaking the impasse between [[China]] and [[Taiwan]].

==Publications==
A distinguishing activity of the organization is the publication and dissemination of firm, reasoned positions designed to help formulate American foreign policy. When, after study and discussion, the organization or one of its task forces reaches a consensus on an aspect of foreign policy that affects American national interests, it makes that judgment known to the Administration, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], the media and the general public.

===''American Foreign Policy Interests''===
A long-time component of the organization's publication series was its bimonthly journal, ''American Foreign Policy Interests''. The journal presented authoritative and provocative articles on critical questions of foreign policy written by leading scholars and policy experts.  It was discontinued in 2015.

===Books and booklets===
The organization publishes short booklets of policy reports and recommendations. Additionally, the organization publishes speeches and summaries of discussions that have been the hallmarks of its foreign policy briefings, lecture series, and award ceremonies.

==Awards==
The organization presents five awards:

===Hans J. Morgenthau Award===
The award was established in 1981 to commemorate Morgenthau's seminal contributions to the theory and the practice of American foreign policy.

'''Noah Musingku''', under the name "King David Peii II", is head of the twin "kingdoms" of [[Papaala]] and [[Me’ekamui]] on [[Bougainville Island]] in the [[North Solomon Islands]]. Musingku is the creator of [[U-Vistract]] which was banned as a [[pyramid scheme]] outside of the kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1507281.htm "Mercenaries return to PNG"], ''The World Today/ABC Radio'', 15 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=7084/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl "Musingku urged to surrender"], ''Post-Courier'', 30 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=81131 "Fijians look forward to re-uniting with families"] ''Fiji Times Online'', 12 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20060913/bville.htm "SI border raids prompt talks"], ''Papua New Guinea Post-Courier'', 13 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smh&gt;Ilya Gridneff, [http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/uvistract-conman-offers-jesus-money-20090708-dcuu.html "U-Vistract conman offers 'Jesus money'"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 8 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Tonu village in southeast Siwai, Bougainville, 1977.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Tonu, Noah Musingku's native village in southeast Siwai, Bougainville.]]Bougainville Island is geographically and ethnically a part of the [[Solomon Island]] archipelago.  It was an autonomous region of [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG).  In 1988 a civil war began with workers and landowners from [[Panguna mine]] (See also [[Panguna]]). This mine, owned by the PNG government and [[Bougainville Copper]], a subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group]], was established under Australian aegis.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 4 September 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

A Unilateral Declaration of Independence was made on 17 May 1990, but Australian and New Zealand-brokered peace talks tended to ignore this fact.  [[Francis Ona]] controlled over half of the island, and proclaimed himself king of Me’ekamui (“holy land”) in May 2004.  Musingku assumed the throne of Paapala Kingdom, as well as his 500-man "Me'ekamui Defense Force"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYsDWautKpc&lt;/ref&gt;  in the same year, and upon Ona’s death from malaria in July 2005, Musingku consolidated control of the “Twin Kingdoms” on Bougainville Island.

==U-Vistract==
{{main|U-Vistract}}

In 1997, seven years after the unilateral declaration of independence, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army was in control of the island, but its leadership split into factions. Ona was in control of the army, and sought full independence. His co-president in the [[Bougainville Interim Government]], [[Joseph Kabui]], sought rapprochement with PNG and formation of an [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]].  Musingku met with each of them as a mediator, and by 19 December 1997
had signed agreements with each. They jointly realized that it would be impossible to achieve political independence without financial sovereignty.&lt;ref name="issue7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%207.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151616/http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%207.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Papala Chronicles Issue 7 p 10&lt;/ref&gt; As Musingku’s wrote,

:''In other words, Bougainville needed to create her own independent and sovereign system in order to be free from the control of the other international financial and governing structure. Also, it was very clear that the funds we needed to work with in uprooting, pulling down, destroying and overthrowing the existing foreign control system could not be earned through the conventional system. A new international system needed to be established whose control and coordination would not be based overseas but right here on our own soil.'' &lt;ref name="issue7"/&gt;

At first, the “U-Vistract Mission” was established as a Christian mission program in Australia.  [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC) found it to be an unlicensed securities and investment program.

:''Within a few years, some 70,000 Papua New Guineans had deposited K350 million into U-Vistract alone. U-Vistract also attracted followers in Australia, Solomon Islands and Fiji. In Australia, a small number of Queensland investors contributed some AUD500,000 between July and October 1999.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/docs/SSGM_09_05_bainton_cox.pdf] http://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/docs/SSGM_09_05_bainton_cox.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On October&amp;nbsp;19th 1999 in one of my trips to Australia the ASIC placed me under house-arrest…. After a heavy interrogatory session they demanded me to shut down all my operations in the country. The ASIC publicized the matter in the media to let the world of Australia know about the so-called illegal operations. However, U-Vistract grew even stronger, gaining momentum almost overnight. The number of my agencies grew in Kempsey, Sydney, Brisbane, Gold coast, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%205.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151721/http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%205.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Papala Chronicles Issue 5 p 9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From Australia, he went to Pt Moresby, Papua New Guinea. While in Pt Moresby, he tried to set up a bank in the old Hawaiian Bank building, but he was shut down by the PNG government and forced to leave to the Solomon Islands. He began again to set up his system, but the Australian police in the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI) forced him out. In 2003 he travelled to Ona’s headquarters in Guava, Panguna, Bougainville, and established a bank there. Two years later he was able to travel to his ancestral village of Tonu, where he established his bank headquarters in an old cattle farm owned by the paramount chief.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Beliefs==
A [[Pentecostal]] Christian, most of his talks and writings are generously sprinkled with biblical references. U-Vistract was initially created as a Christian Mission, and this has continued to be its focus.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Musingku has compared his life and mission to that of Biblical saviors Noah, Moses or Jesus Christ. On the new currency that he intends to issue, pictures of Jesus will join the likenesses of Musingku and other Bougainvillean leaders.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

==Fijian Soldiers Incident==
{{Main|Fijian_mercenaries_in_Bougainville}}
Musingku exercised his powers as Head of State of Bougainville. In 2005 he announced that he was hiring a security force from [[Fiji]] to train his guards and other governmental personnel, as well as establish security and satellite and other telecommunications for his bank in Tonu.&lt;ref name="issue18"&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%2018.pdf] Papala Chronicles Issue 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="issue19"&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%2019.pdf] Papala Chronicles Issue 19&lt;/ref&gt; He said that this Fijian security force had been hand selected "mostly [[born again (Christianity)|Born-Again Christians]] with overseas experience in Iraq and other areas".

The '''Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service''' ({{lang-no|Samordna opptak}}) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[etat|government agency]] responsible for application and admission to all public [[university|universities]] and [[university college]]s in Norway for entry level degrees, either [[Bachelor degree]]s for liberal studies and some professional studies, as well as certain [[Master degree|Master]] level programs in professional studies. The agency is subordinate to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dep/Underliggende-etater/Samordna-opptak.html?id=426565 |title=Samordna opptak |author=[[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is managed by the [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usit.uio.no/suaf/so/Historie/suaf_historie.html |title=Gruppe for Samordna opptak (SUAF-SO) |author=[[University of Oslo]] |accessdate=2008-04-30 |language=Norwegian}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditionally Norwegian universities and colleges had a system of local admission control. This system was tedious since each person had to apply to each institution and it was difficult to manage declines from students who were accepted to other institutions. Particularly in 1990 there was a massive increase in the application to higher educations and this resulted in an immense workload on the local administrators.

To solve this problem, the Government initiated a program to effectivise the application and admission system. Until 1994 the system merely collected information from the institutions, but from 1995 for the colleges and 1997 for the universities the admission rankings were centralized through the system so each applicant only got one admission place. From 1999 application via the Internet was possible, and from 2008 only online application is possible. After 2000 the grades from the upper secondary schools are automatically transferred to the system.

==How it works==
The system opens on February 1 each year, with application deadline April 15. Some special groups have application deadline March 1. On the application up to ten prioritized programs can be specified. The order of their programs can be altered up to July 1, but no new program can be added after April 15. On July 20 the main admission is run and made known to the applicants, and no one is given more than one admission; on the highest ranked program that the candidate is qualified for and has enough points for after a specialized [[stable marriage]] algorithm. Programs with more applicants get [[Wait list|waiting list]]s. Later in the summer and during the fall more people are admitted from the lists if enough people from the main admission decline the places. Studies with insufficient applicants to fill up become part of the ''Remains Market'' (Restetorget), which offers first-to-grab principle after the main application. Only entry-level programs are run through the system. Admission from bachelor to master level programs is still handled locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.samordnaopptak.no/english |title=English |author=Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service |accessdate=2008-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421165617/http://info.samordnaopptak.no/english |archive-date=2008-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicants is ranked on a point scheme, where the qualified candidates with the most points are given admission. The qualifications vary from program to program, but almost all require general university admissions certification. Some programs, like engineering or medicine require extra upper secondary level courses in [[mathematics]] and [[sciences]], which can be attained through a foundation course in engineering. The points are based first on the average grade from upper secondary school, multiplied by ten. Additional points are awarded for sciences, age, specialization and completed 60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits or [[military service]]. Quota points for gender are applicable for some programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/kd/kd-20051010-1191.html |title=Forskrift om opptak til universiteter og høyskoler. |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research |date=2006-01-01 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution who owns the top prioritized program on each application is defined as the case handler for that application. The case handler sets the correct points values and (dis)qualification codes. Often helped by the national database for upper secondary school diplomas, also run by Samordna opptak. Each applicant has in average 1.1 case handlers compared to one per institution before 1995.

==Numbers==
In 2007 92,750 people applied for studying through the system, of which 76,936 sent in necessary documentation and 69,529 were qualified. Two of three people who were offered a place through the main admission, were granted their first choice. There are about 1,200 possible programs at seven universities and about 40 colleges.

'''OR Books''' is a New York-based independent publishing house founded by John Oakes and Colin Robinson in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090712/SMALLBIZ/307129981.html: Crain's New York Business on the founding of OR Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The company sells digital and [[Print on demand|print-on-demand]] books directly to the customer and focuses on creative promotion through traditional media and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2011/03/02/pages/6852/ "Oakes ’83 connects readers directly to a publisher"], ''Princeton Alumni Weekly'', March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On its site, OR Books states that it "embraces progressive change in politics, culture and the way we do business."

Not long after its founding in 2009, OR Books became known for publishing ''[[Going Rouge: Sarah Palin, An American Nightmare]]'', a parody of the [[Sarah Palin]] biography, which went on to become a ''[[New York Times]]'' Best Seller. Since then the company has published books by [[Julian Assange]], [[Moustafa Bayoumi]], [[Medea Benjamin]], [[Patrick Cockburn]], [[Sue Coe]], [[Simon Critchley]], Lisa Dierbeck, [[Ariel Dorfman]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Laura Flanders]], Chris Lehmann, [[Gordon Lish]], [[Bill McKibben]], [[Eileen Myles]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Barney Rosset]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[Elissa Shevinsky]], [[Burhan Sönmez]], [[Jeanne Thornton]], and others.

==Founders==
According to OR's website, John Oakes co-founded the publishing company [[Four Walls Eight Windows]] and was subsequently publisher of [[Thunder's Mouth Press]] and co-publisher of [[Nation Books]]. He is publisher of the [[Evergreen Review]]. Colin Robinson, a former senior editor at [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], was previously managing director of [[Verso Books]] and publisher of [[The New Press]].

==Joint ventures==
In September 2010, OR Books announced a partnership with a writers' collective known as Mischief &amp; Mayhem, whose members include [[Dale Peck]], Lisa Dierbeck, [[Joshua Furst]], [[DW Gibson]], and [[Choire Sicha]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh, [http://observer.com/2010/09/dale-peck-choire-sicha-and-friends-start-a-book-publishing-collective-first-title-out-next-month/ "Dale Peck, Choire Sicha and Friends Start a Book Publishing Collective; First Title Out Next Month"], ''[[New York Observer]]'', September 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In what the industry newsblog [[Shelf Awareness]] termed a "very significant...move," [[St. Mark’s Bookshop]] and OR Books announced a joint venture to enable the store’s customers to buy select books on OR’s list from the bookstore’s website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=1345.html "St. Mark's/OR Alliance"], Shelf Awareness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teicher| first=Craig Morgan| title=OR Books Partners with St. Mark's Bookshop for E-Book Distribution |date =December 7, 2010| work=Publishers Weekly |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/retailing/article/45428-or-books-partners-with-st-mark-s-bookshop-for-e-book-distribution.html | accessdate = July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, OR Books acquired UK publishing company [[Serif (publisher)|Serif]], following the death in 2015 of its founder Stephen Hayward, a former associate of Robinson's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookbusinessmag.com/article/press-release-new-york-based-or-books-acquires-serif-books/ "Press Release: New York-Based OR Books Acquires Serif Books"], ''BookBusiness'', April 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbooks.com/ "Welcome to OR Books".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Reid, [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/69958-or-books-acquires-u-k-s-serif-books.html "OR Books Acquires U.K.'s Serif Books"], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', April 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2733#m32128 "OR Books Acquires Serif Books"], ''Shelf Awareness'', April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, OR Books and [[Counterpoint Press]] announced a partnership whereby Counterpoint would put a number of OR's titles into stores. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/70200-counterpoint-press-partners-with-or-books.html "Counterpoint, OR Books Partner on New Fall List"], Publishers Weekly, May 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Liberalism sidebar |Variants}}

'''Ordoliberalism''' is the [[Germany|German]] variant of [[social liberalism]] that emphasizes the need for the state to ensure that the [[free market]] produces results close to its theoretical potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ralf |last=Ptak |chapter=Neoliberalism in Germany: Revisiting the Ordoliberal Foundations of the Social Market Economy |editor1-first=Philip |editor1-last=Mirowski |editor2-first=Dieter |editor2-last=Plehwe |title=The Road From Mont Pèlerin: The Making of The Neoliberal Thought Collective |location=Cambridge, MA. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-674-03318-4 |pages=124–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordoliberal ideals became the foundation of the creation of the post-[[World War II]] German [[social market economy]] and its attendant {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}.

The term "ordoliberalism" ({{lang-de|Ordoliberalismus}}) was coined in 1950 by {{lang|de|[[Hero Moeller]]|italic=no}}, and refers to the academic journal ''[[ORDO (journal)|ORDO]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ralf |last=Ptak |title=Vom Ordoliberalismus zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft: Stationen des Neoliberalismus in Deutschland |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |isbn=978-3-8100-4111-1 |page=23 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic differentiation==

Ordoliberals separate themselves from [[classical liberals]]. Notably {{lang|de|[[Walter Eucken]]|italic=no}}, with {{lang|de|[[Franz Böhm]]|italic=no}}, founder of ordoliberalism and the [[Freiburg School]],&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nils Goldschmidt |title=Wirtschaft, Politik und Freiheit: Freiburger Wirtschaftswissenschaftler und der Widerstand |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvNEWSk_HFQC |accessdate=21 July 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |isbn=978-3-16-148520-6 |page=315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rejected [[neoliberalism]].&lt;ref name="Gerken2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lüder Gerken |title=Walter Eucken und sein Werk: Rückblick auf den Vordenker der sozialen Marktwirtschaft |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xx8lxh7PZKMC |accessdate=21 July 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |isbn=978-3-16-147503-0 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordoliberals promoted the concept of the social market economy, and this concept promotes a strong role for the state with respect to the market, which is in many ways different from the ideas connected to the term neoliberalism. Oddly the term neoliberalism was originally coined in 1938, at the {{lang|fr|[[Colloque Walter Lippmann]]}}, by {{lang|de|[[Alexander Rüstow]]|italic=no}}, who is regarded an ordoliberal today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Taylor C. |last1=Boas |first2=Jordan |last2=Gans-Morse |title=Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan |journal=Studies in Comparative International Development |volume=44 |issue=2 |year=2009 |issn=0039-3606 |pages=137–61 |doi=10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the connected history ordoliberalism is also sometimes referred to as "German neoliberalism". This led to frequent confusion and "mix ups" of terms and ideas in the discourse, debate and criticism of both economic schools of liberalism until in 1991 the political economists {{lang|fr|[[Michel Albert]]|italic=no}} with {{lang|fr|[[Capitalisme Contre Capitalisme]]|italic=yes}} and in 2001 Peter A. Hall and [[David Soskice]] with ''[[Varieties of Capitalism]]'' aimed to separate the concepts and develop the new terms [[liberal market economy]] and [[coordinated market economy]] to distinguish neoliberalism and ordoliberalism.

==Development==
The theory was developed from about 1930 to 1950 by [[Germany|German]] [[economists]] and legal scholars from the [[Freiburg School]], such as {{lang|de|Walter Eucken|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Franz Böhm]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Hans Grossmann-Doerth]]|italic=no}}, and {{lang|de|[[Leonhard Miksch]]|italic=no}}.

Ordoliberal ideals (with modifications) drove the creation of the post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] German social market economy. They were especially influential on forming a firm [[competition law]] in Germany. However the social market economy was implemented in economies where [[corporatism]] was already well established, so ordoliberal ideals were not as far reaching as the theory's economic founders had intended.&lt;ref name="Abelshauser2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abelshauser |first1=Werner |title=The Dynamics of German Industry: Germany's Path toward the New Economy and the American Challenge |date=2005 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=9781782387992 |pages=146-148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkbkBgAAQBAJ |accessdate=9 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, ordoliberal influence on economics and jurisprudence has significantly diminished&lt;ref&gt;[[Springer Gabler|Gabler Verlag]] (ed.), Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon, Stichwort: Freiburger Schule ([http://wirtschaftslexikon.gabler.de/Archiv/7246/freiburger-schule-v8.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; however many German economists define themselves as Ordoliberals through the present day, the ''[[ORDO (journal)|ORDO]]'' is still published, and the Faculty of Economics at the [[University of Freiburg]] is still teaching ordoliberalism. Additionally, some institutes and foundations such as the {{lang|de|[[Walter Eucken Institut]]|italic=no}} and the {{lang|de|[[Stiftung Ordnungspolitik]]|italic=no}} are engaged in the ordoliberal tradition.

==Implementation==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004214-0033, Konrad Adenauer und Ludwig Erhard.jpg|thumbnail|{{lang|de|[[Ludwig Erhard]]|italic=no}} with {{lang|de|[[Konrad Adenauer]]|italic=no}} in 1956, while Erhard was Minister of Economics.]]
Ordoliberalism was a major influence on the economic model developed in post-war [[West Germany]]. Ordoliberalism in [[Germany]] became known as the social market economy. 

The Ordoliberal model implemented in Germany was started under the government administration of {{lang|de|[[Konrad Adenauer]]|italic=no}}. His government's [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|Minister of Economics]], {{lang|de|[[Ludwig Erhard]]|italic=no}}, was a known Ordoliberal and adherent of the [[Freiburg School]]. Under {{lang|de|Adenauer|italic=no}}, some, but not all, price controls were lifted, and taxes on small businesses and corporations were lowered. Furthermore, social security and pensions were increased to provide a social base income. Ordoliberals have stated that these policies led to the {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}, or economic miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordoliberals |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/ess_ordoliberals.html |website=Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy |publisher=[[PBS]] |date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Ordoliberal theory holds that the [[state (polity)|state]] must create a proper legal environment for the economy and maintain a healthy level of [[competition policy|competition]] (rather than just "exchange") through measures that adhere to [[market (economics)|market principles]]. This is the foundation of its [[rational-legal authority|legitimacy]].&lt;ref name="Megay"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Megay |first=Edward N. |year=1970 |title=Anti-Pluralist Liberalism: The German Neoliberals |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=422–42 |doi=10.2307/2147878 |jstor=2147878 }}&lt;!--page 424: "Briefly, neoliberalism wants the government to establish and maintain the economic order, namely an open, free, and competitive market economy—but to leave the economic process to free private decisions within that economic order"--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The concern is that, if the state does not take active measures to foster competition, [[corporation|firms]] with [[monopoly]] (or [[oligopoly]]) power will emerge, which will not only subvert the advantages offered by the [[market economy]], but also possibly undermine good government, since strong economic power can be transformed into political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vatiero |last=Massimiliano |year=2010 |title=The Ordoliberal notion of market power: an institutionalist reassessment |journal=European Competition Journal |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=689–707 |doi=10.5235/ecj.v6n3.689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen Padgett]] "A central tenet of ordo-liberalism is a clearly defined division of [[labour (economics)|labor]] in economic management, with specific responsibilities assigned to particular institutions. [[Monetary policy]] should be the responsibility of a [[central bank]] committed to monetary stability and low [[inflation]], and insulated from political pressure by independent status.  [[Fiscal policy]]—balancing [[tax revenue]] against [[government expenditure]]—is the domain of the government, whilst [[macroeconomics|macro-economic]] policy is the preserve of [[employment#Employer|employers]] and [[trade unions]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bo-C2uExHw8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=A+central+tenet+of+ordo-liberalism+is+a+clearly+defined+division+of+labor+in+economic+management#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20central%20tenet%20of%20ordo-liberalism%20is%20a%20clearly%20defined%20division%20of%20labor%20in%20economic%20management&amp;f=false |first=Stephen |last=Padgett |chapter=Political Economy: The German Model under Stress |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Padgett |editor2-first=William E. |editor2-last=Paterson |editor3-first=Gordon |editor3-last=Smith |title=Developments in German Politics 3 |pages=126–27 |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0822332664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state should form an economic order instead of directing economic processes, and three negative examples ordoliberals used to back their theories were [[Nazism]], [[Keynesianism]], and [[USSR|Russian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |title=The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978–9) |translator-first=Graham |translator-last=Burchell |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Senellart |edition=1st Picador Paperback |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2010 |pages=107–10 |title-link=The Birth of Biopolitics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordoliberal idea of a social market economy is often seen as a [[progressivism|progressive]] alternative beyond [[left-wing politics|left]] and [[right-wing politics|right]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my.../391448ec-84a9-42a5-bb79-4be1e721524a ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a [[third way (centrism)|third way]] between [[collectivism]] and [[classical liberalism|laissez-faire liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:r39x55yOrK4J:www.bisa.ac.uk/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_bisa%26task%3Ddownload_paper%26no_html%3D1%26passed_paper_id%3D137+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShgu-KV-_z-Rd5F456Ye-SfRrehkgqTkt-sFcUWZtjtyowxWCEWOR83ae6Fa9XMXs3MrQjAoGEy6VbvjVSkw0hTxlhLtb7K7nSDezGPZqIoek6T09XH3y_488LnbVWxAiltEqt9&amp;sig=AHIEtbSc3XM5GM5Ff1ZRPz7zT_w2StGrZA |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ordoliberal idea of a social market is similar to that of the [[third way (centrism)|third-way social democracy]] advocated by the likes of the [[New Labour]] government (especially during the [[premiership of Tony Blair]]), there are a few key differences. Whilst they both adhere to the idea of providing a moderate stance between [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]], the ordoliberal social market model often combines [[private enterprise]] with government [[regulation]] to establish fair [[competition (economics)|competition]] (although German network industries are known to have been deregulated),&lt;ref name="ifw-kiel.de"&gt;{{citation |contribution=Germany’s Social Market Economy: How Sustainable is the Welfare State? |contribution-url=http://www.ifw-kiel.de/das-ifw/organisation/siebert/siebert-pdf/Washington2003.pdf |first=Horst |last=Siebert |authorlink=Horst Siebert |title=Paper presented at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, Johns Hopkins University |date=28 May 2003 |chapter-format=PDF |title-link=Johns Hopkins University }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas advocates of the third-way social democracy model have been known to oversee multiple economic [[deregulation]]s. The third way social democracy model has also foreseen a clash of ideas regarding the establishment of the [[welfare state]], in comparison to the ordoliberal's idea of a social market model being open to the [[economics|benefits]] of [[social welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wirtschaftslexikon.gabler.de/Definition/soziale-marktwirtschaft.html |title=Soziale Marktwirtschaft |website=Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon |language=de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordoliberals are also known for pursuing a minimum [[configuration management|configuration of vital resources]] and [[progressive tax]]ation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toulouse-justice-2011.fr/fullpapers/b4woersdorfer.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004642/http://toulouse-justice-2011.fr/fullpapers/b4woersdorfer.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordoliberal emphasis on the [[privatization]] of [[public services]] and other public firms such as [[telecommunication]] services;&lt;ref name="ifw-kiel.de"/&gt; [[redistribution of wealth|wealth redistribution]] and [[minimum wage]] laws as regulative principles makes clear the links between this economic model and the social market economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e2UIjKCfRosC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Greening EU Competition Law and Policy |first=Suzanne |last=Kingston |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |isbn=9781139502788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|de|[[Wilhelm Röpke]]|italic=no}} considered ordoliberalism to be "liberal conservatism", against [[capitalism]] in his work {{lang|la|Civitas Humana}} ("A Humane Order of Society", 1944). {{lang|de|[[Alexander Rüstow]]|italics=no}} also criticized [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]] in his work {{lang|de|Das Versagen des Wirtschaftsliberalismus|italic=yes}} ("The Failure of Economic Liberalism", 1950).

==Criticism==
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
According to {{lang|de|Sebastian Dullien|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|[[Ulrike Guérot]]|italic=no}}, ordoliberalism is central to the German approach to the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], which has often led to conflicts with other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sebastian |last1=Dullien |first2=Ulrike |last2=Guérot |author-link2=Ulrike Guérot |title=The Long Shadow of Ordoliberalism: Germany's Approach to the Euro Crisis |url=http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR49_GERMANY_BRIEF_AW.pdf |isbn=978-1-906538-49-1 |location=London |publisher=European Council on Foreign Relations |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nobel laureate [[Friedrich Hayek]] commented on the Ordoliberals in his 1951 article, "The Transmission of the Ideals of Freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayek |first1=Friedrich A. |title=The Transmission of the Ideals of Freedom |journal=Econ Journal Watch |date=2012 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=163–69 |url=https://econjwatch.org/articles/the-transmission-of-the-ideals-of-economic-freedom?ref=articles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pametno'''  ({{lang-en|Intelligently}}) is a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[List of political parties in Croatia|political party]] in [[Croatia]]. The party was formed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in 2015 out of the citizens' initiative ''Za pametne ljude i pametan grad'' ("For smart people and a smart city").&lt;ref name="radio split"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.hrt.hr/radio-split/clanak/osnovana-stranka-pametno/94302/ |title=Osnovana stranka Pametno :: Radio Split |publisher=Radio.hrt.hr |date=14 June 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental values endorsed by the party are the promotion of democracy, accountable and transparent management of public resources, civil proactive protection of fundamental human rights, economic development and environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By admin |url=https://www.pametno.org/tko-smo-mi/o-nama/ |title=O nama |publisher=Pametno |date=21 September 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party's priorities are structural reforms, education and science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[HINA|Hina]] |url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/novoosnovana-stranka-pametno-predstavila-svoj-program/845782.aspx |title=Marijana Puljak predstavila stranku "Pametno": Treba ograničiti mandat političarima - Vijesti |publisher=[[Index.hr]] |date=3 October 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it adheres to the values of "modern Western European countries".&lt;ref name="jutarnji1"/&gt;

==History==
Pametno was founded in 2013 as citizens' initiative ''Za pametne ljude i pametan grad'' ("For smart people and a smart city") in the second most populous city in Croatia, [[Split, Croatia|Split]], by computer scientist Marijana Puljak. In 2010, Puljak served as President of the Split City District of Žnjan which had around 6000 citizens. During her tenure, she achieved success by reviving social life in the district, launching the construction of a children's playground and obtaining a building permit for a new district school. In 2013, she founded the citizens' initiative, competed in the [[Croatian local elections, 2013|2013 local elections]] and eventually, surprisingly, ended up winning 4 seats in the Split City Council. In 2015, the citizens' initiative was transformed into a political party whose work was based on the principles of 'New people for a new policy', 'Science and education as the foundation of society' and 'Policies based on evidence'.&lt;ref name="radio split" /&gt; 

Pametno participated in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 parliamentary election]] in the 10th [[Croatian Parliament electoral districts|electoral district]] but did not win any seats in the Parliament.&lt;ref name="dnevnik.hr" /&gt; In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 extraordinary parliamentary election]], the Party went national as part of the two-party "Turn Croatia Around" coalition, eventually coming in 7th in term of votes won, but winning no seats in the Parliament. 

At the [[Croatian local elections, 2017|2017 local elections]], the Party nominated Marijana Puljak as its candidate for the position of the [[Mayor of Split]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hina |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/marijana-puljak-kandidatkinja-stranke-pametno-za-splitsku-gradonacelnicu/5519611/ |title=Marijana Puljak kandidatkinja stranke Pametno za splitsku gradonačelnicu |publisher=Jutarnji list |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually came in third and did not qualify for the second round. However, Pametno won 7 seats in the Split City Council; three more than the party had won at the previous election.

On 1 December 2017 the party was admitted into the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] as an affiliate member.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aldeparty.eu/news/alde-welcomes-new-member-parties&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peace journalism''' has been developed from research that indicates that often news about conflict has a value bias toward violence.  It also includes practical methods for correcting this bias by producing journalism in both the mainstream and alternative media, and working with journalists, media professionals, audiences, and organizations in conflict.

{{TOC right|limit=2}}
This concept was proposed by [[Johan Galtung]]&lt;ref&gt;For example see the policy recommendations in the conclusion of: Galtung, J. &amp; Ruge, M. (1965).  The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers.  Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms for this broad definition of peace journalism include conflict solution journalism, conflict sensitive journalism,&lt;ref name="journalismethics.ca"&gt;Howard, R. (n.d.). [http://www.journalismethics.ca/global_journalism_ethics/conflict_sensitivity_in_practice.htm Conflict Sensitive Journalism in Practice.]  Center for Journalism Ethics: School of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Retrieved October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; constructive conflict coverage, and reporting the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reportingtheworld.net/Homepage.html Reporting the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War journalism''' is journalism about conflict that has a value bias towards violence and violent groups.  This usually leads audiences to overvalue violent responses to conflict and ignore non-violent alternatives.  This is understood to be the result of well documented news reporting conventions.  These conventions focus only on physical effects of conflict (for example ignoring psychological impacts) and elite positions (which may or may not represent the actual parties and their goals). It is also biased toward reporting only the differences between parties, (rather than similarities, previous agreements, and progress on common issues) the here and now (ignoring causes and outcomes), and zero sums (assuming that one side's needs can only be met by the other side's compromise or defeat).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan, “On the role of the media in worldwide security and peace,” In Tapio Varis (ed.),'' Peace and Communication,'' pp. 249–266, San Jose, Costa Rica: Universidad para La Paz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace journalism aims to correct for these biases. Its operational definition is "to allow opportunities for society at large to consider and value non-violent responses to conflict".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p.147"&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves picking up calls for, and articulations of, non-violence policies from whatever quarter, and allowing them into the public sphere.

==Origins==
[[File:Philippines PJ group.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Used with permission of Assoc Prof. Jake Lynch|Peace journalism workshop in Mindanao, the Philippines]] 
Peace journalism follows a long history of news publication, originating in non-sectarian Christian peace movements and societies of the early 19th century, which published periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Nancy L., "Peace Journalism,"'' The International Encyclopedia of Communication,'' Wolfgang Donsbach (ed), Blackwell Publishing, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sectarian organizations also created publications focused on peace as part of their proselytizing in the 19th century, as did utopian communities of the period. From the 20th century, a prominent example of sectarian journalism focused on peace was [[Dorothy Day]]'s'' [[Catholic Worker]].''&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Nancy L.,'' American peace writers, editors, and periodicals: A dictionary,'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being an element in the histories of [[pacifism]] and the [[social movement]] press, peace journalism is a set of [[journalism]] practices that emerged in the 1970s. Norwegian sociologist, peace researcher and practitioner [[Johan Galtung]] proposed the idea of peace journalism for journalists to follow to show how a value bias towards violence can be avoided when covering war and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Seow Ting Lee &amp; Crispin C. Maslog, "War or Peace Journalism? Asian Newspaper Coverage of Conflicts,"'' Journal of Communication 55'' (June 2005): p.&amp;nbsp;311.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian organizations such as The [[World Council of Churches]] and The [[World Association for Christian Communication]] also practice peace journalism.

'''Peace journalism''' aims to shed light on [[social structure|structural]] and [[cultural]] causes of [[violence]], as they impact upon the lives of people in a conflict arena as part of the explanation for violence. It aims to frame conflicts as consisting of many parties and pursuing many goals rather than a simple [[dichotomy]]. An explicit aim of ''peace journalism'' is to promote peace initiatives from whatever quarter and to allow the reader to distinguish between stated positions and real goals.

==Necessity==
Peace journalism came about through research arguing there's something wrong with typical conflict reporting.  Research and practice in peace journalism outlines a number of reasons for the existence and dominance of war journalism in conflict news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peacebuilding in the Age of New Media |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/issue/view/37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interests===
Firstly, the notion that media elites always act to preserve their favored status quo, and their own commercial and political interests, is given relatively little weight.  Shared characteristics of the socio-economic class, which heavily influences the production of journalism, are important.  For example, their shared ideological pressures, perceptions, attitudes, and values form the basis of a "dominant reading" of facts that are selected to appear in news.  These can then act to fix and naturalize meaning and hide the actual creation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2005).  Peace Journalism.  Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press, p.197 &amp; p.211; also see McGoldrick, 2008, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even in the presence of powerful elite media interests against war, war journalism often dominates conflict discourse.  Lynch and McGoldrick show examples from Britain, Ireland, Georgia, and Iraq, where ''war journalism'' dominated coverage despite key influential media interests against war.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, pp.198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalistic objectivity===
[[File:Jake cameraman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Used with permission of Assoc Prof. Jake Lynch|Peace journalist Jake Lynch covering protests against joint US-Australia military exercises in Australia.]] 
Therefore, not only political and economic, but also social and cultural factors have contributed to the dominance of war journalism in conflict reporting.  With the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue.

Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue.  This led to "Journalistic objectivity as an industry standard…a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people".&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;  And in modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24 hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories.  It is not possible for reporters to decide "from first principals" every time how they will report each and every story that presents itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch,J. (2008).  Debates in Peace Journalism. Sydney: Sydney University Press, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that convention governs much of journalism.

The rise of journalistic objectivity was part of a larger movement within western academia to a more empirical "just report the facts” epistemology and research paradigm.  By the 1890s it was focused on the ideal of “objectivity”.&lt;ref&gt;Mindich, 2000, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  And although it came into fashion around the same period, Journalistic Objectivity must be distinguished from the [[Scientific Objectivity]].  For example the experimental sciences uses as "best practice":
# Inter-laboratory replication;
# Random assignment of subjects to conditions;

While it is arguable whether these experimental science safe guards provide “true objectivity”, in the absence of these safeguards, journalism around conflict relies on three conventions to maintain its own form of "objectivity" ( also see [[journalistic objectivity]]), and is therefore distinct from [[Scientific Objectivity]].

====Conventions====
Firstly, to sell audiences to advertisers, reporting must appeal to as broad an audience as possible and therefore focuses on “facts” that  are the least controversial.  Conflict processes are often controversial, so coverage of them risks alienating potential consumers, who may be sensitive to the exposure of structural or cultural predisposing factors.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210"&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, a bias in favor of official sources means that, while it may appear uncontroversial, as there is only one official representative for the government on any given issue&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2009).  Day four, Sunday August 30.  Lecture presented in the Conflict Resolving Media course, the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, the University of Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; and since only the official government is usually allowed to wield legal, sanctioned force within its territory&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, Essays in Sociology, ed./trans./intro. H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1946, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; 
coverage will tend to privilege violent responses to conflict over non-violent, social-psychological, context-informed responses.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists Annabel McGoldrick and Jake Lynch argue that non-critical reporting of official sources is often rewarded by those sources. Through "information transactions", these same official sources allow uncritical journalists privileged access to information in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and McGoldrick, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly and lastly, 'dualism' biasses journalistic objectivity towards violence: "A decision to tell a story in that [bipolar] way can slip past, unnoticed, without drawing attention to itself because of its close resemblance, in shape and structure, to so much of the story-telling we already take for granted".&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp;  McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gatekeeping===
These conventions also form “gates” by which “gatekeepers” in journalism include or exclude various aspects of reality in final publication.&lt;ref&gt;Barzilai-Nahon, K. (2008).  Toward a Theory of Network Gatekeeping: A Framework for Exploring Information Control.  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59, 1493–1512;  White, D. (1950). The “gate keeper:” A case study in the selection of
news. Journalism Quarterly, 27, 383–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, proponents of ''peace journalism'' argue that in the media meaning occurs according to: “a set of rules and relations established before the reality or the experience under discussion actually occurred”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''war journalism'' the objectivity conventions serve this purpose, but are shadowy and unacknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; “Gatekeeping” is therefore likely to be secretive and haphazard.  This means they distort, and also fix, meaning in conflict coverage and obfuscate the production of meaning{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1997).

A recent example demonstrates how peace journalism evaluative criteria might be applied to show how much conventional conflict reporting is biased in favor of violence and violent groups. The example is the coverage leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]], and US President [[Barack Obama]].

Reporting was highly reactive and focused on the visible effects of the conflict, such as announcements and public disagreements between official spokespeople that appeared to disrupt peace efforts.&lt;ref&gt;For example see: Benhorin, Y. (2009, July, 22).  [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3750262,00.html Mitchell, Gates, Jones to visit Jerusalem next week.], Ynetnews.com.  Retrieved October 3, 2009; Hardy, R.

Coverage was oriented to elites with little mention of non-official peace efforts by individuals and groups such as the [http://www.handinhand12.org/ Hand in Hand network of schools], the Israeli/Palestinian [http://www.theparentscircle.org/Home.aspx The Parents Circle Families Forum], [https://web.archive.org/web/20040725071613/http://www.peacenow.org.il/Site/en/homepage.asp Peace Now], [http://www.shovrimshtika.org/index_e.asp Breaking the Silence], [http://www.physiciansforhumanrights.org/ Physicians for Human Rights], [http://www.machsomwatch.org/en Machsom Watch], and [http://www.canadazone.com/icw/ Checkpoint Watch], [[Hanan Ashrawi]] ([[non-violent]] activist for [[human rights]], founder of the [http://www.miftah.org/ Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy], and member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/world/middleeast/27swim.html We Will Not Obey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.en.justjlm.org/ Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also ignored were programmes that promote cultural exchange, for example (the Israeli-Palestinian Aussie Rules football team [http://www.peaceteam.com.au/ The Peace Team]), [http://www.afl.com.au/Development/InternationalCup/Teams/PeaceTeam/tabid/12099/Default.aspx see here for official 2011 team details]) which played in the 2008 and 2011 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] International Cups.

Events demonstrating non-violent responses to the conflict were also ignored, a new example being the March 12, 2011, [http://www.wluml.org/node/7031 Conference on Civil Disobedience in the West Bank] marking the centenary of [[International Women's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;For an outline of some of these groups' activities see Lynch, 2008; and Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2005).  Peace Journalism.  Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis]] lists further organizations working for peace in the region, whose activities are generally excluded from news on the Conflict.

Reporting leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Netanyahu, Abbas and Obama focused almost solely on highly divisive issues, such as Israeli illegal settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the diplomatic/official status of Jerusalem. Coverage was also oriented towards differences, with a focus on the here and now.  Potential benefits in physical, economic, and social security of peaceful relations were ignored, and “progress” towards peace was portrayed as having to come with one or more parties compromising and surrendering their positions on key issues, which is of course a [[Zero-sum|zero sum]] orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. (2009, June 15).  [http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2599059.htm Israeli PM endorses Palestinian independence.]  ABC (Australia): Lateline.

Retrieved October 1, 2009; Kousoutkis, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Coverage generally ignored the background or context of positions. Positions were presented as unchangeable on any peaceful settlement, rather than the public "face" of unmet needs that often drive violent conflicts. Because of distrust between parties these needs are often not honestly expressed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus a pattern of ''war journalism'' emerges, largely stemming from the objectivity conventions applied to conflict reporting.  Peace journalism argues that this is likely to have important and consistent effects on the way audiences understand a conflict.

In ''war journalism'', violence is typically presented as only its own cause, ignoring the possibility of structural or psychological causes. Since violence is assumed to have no cause or explanation (such as the deprived needs of parties), conventional conflict reporting may leave viewers to conclude that the only “natural” or reasonable response to violence is more violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. (2008).'' Debates in Peace Journalism,'' Sydney: Sydney University Press, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  That “more violence—‘the only language they understand'—is an appropriate remedy”, and that non-violent responses are irrelevant or 'unrealistic'.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210"/&gt;

This focus on only physical violent behavior is an example of what leading Conflict Analyst and Peace Researcher, Johan Galtung identifies as a major flaw in responses to inter-communal conflict: the “Conservative Fallacy”.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (2000).  Conflict transformation by peaceful means (the Transcend method): Pariticpants’ manual, trainers’ manual, Geneva: The United Nations,Module III, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

This bias towards prioritizing violent actors with coverage is then expected by violent groups, through what is called a [[Feedback loop|Feedback Loop]].&lt;ref&gt;First outlined by Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Parties to a conflict often try to use the media to advance their position, rather than being passive subjects, unaware of being observed, as assumed in sciences where humans are not the subjects. Journalist, and journalism Associate Professor, Jake Lynch notes that "it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p. 61"&gt;Lynch, 2008, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way ''war journalism'' is an example of the role of power in representation and of the media trying to ''fix meaning'', in this case about violence and its causes, for “it to become naturalized so that is the only meaning it can possibly carry…where you cannot see that anybody ever produced it."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1997).  [http://www.mediaed.org/handouts/pdfs/HALL-REPMEDIA.pdf Representation and the media. (Transcript). Media Education Foundation, pp. 19, 21–22].  Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, war journalism is understood as reporting on conflict in a way which imposes an artificially confined closed space, and closed time, with causes and exits existing only in the conflict arena.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. (2008).'' Debates in Peace Journalism,'' Sydney: Sydney University Press, pp. 147, 162&lt;/ref&gt;  Peace journalism can then be understood as journalism that avoids this outside imposition, which more objectively assesses the possibility of conflicts taking place in ''open space'', and ''open time'' with any number of causes and exits.

==Effects==
The [[Salvadoran Civil War]], largely a peasant revolution, took place 1980–92. The USA supported the right-wing government. During the war 75,000 people were killed, 8,000 more went missing and another million exiled. On 17 March 1980, the village of Ingenio Colima was attacked by paramilitaries who murdered all its occupants. At the time, the country’s media gave a biased account of what took place. The intention today – in the face of open hostility from today’s political leaders is to investigate and clarify what happened and to contribute to a national process of truth and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;See www.waccglobal.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effects of ''war journalism'' also make it more difficult for audiences to be aware of this biased presentation of conflict.  ''War journalism'' takes advantage of the emotional “high” humans can get from fear through evolutionary psychological mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp. 291–297; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar way, war journalism appeals to "lower order" needs for security and belonging.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1970).  Motivation and Personality.  New York: Harper &amp; Row, pp. 18–21; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  
The pre-frontal cortex, governing working memory, rational attentive functioning, and complex thought is inhibited by activation of the brain’s fear centre, the [[limbic system]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, B. (2003).  [http://calendar.eastbayworks.com/upload/files/000176-000048-Emotional_IntelligencecopyEIbyDanielGoleman.ppt Working with Emotional Intelligence.  Based on a Book by Daniel Goleman]  (Powerpoint slides).  Unpublished manuscript, Rutgers University. New Brunswick, United States.  Retrieved July 7, 2011, slides 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiences are thus deprived of cognitive resources with which to recognize the role of fear in encouraging ''war journalism'' consumption.  This cognitive deprivation also further fixes meaning and increases the role of “automatically activated attitudes” which according to cognitive psychology: "guide attention toward attitude-consistent information, provide a template with which to interpret ambiguous information, and…guide behaviour in a relatively spontaneous fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Olson, M. and Fazio, O.  (2006).  Reducing automatically activated racial prejudice through implicit evaluative conditioning.  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32, 421–433, see p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Therefore viewers are primed to pay more attention to future information, which is consistent with the automatically activated attitudes formed by ''war journalism''.  Research into the ever present framing{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} in the media supports this conclusion: “Certainly people can recall their own facts, forge linkages not made explicitly in the text, or retrieve from memory a causal explanation or cure that is completely absent from the text. In essence, this is just what professors encourage their students to do habitually.  But Zaller (1992), Kahneman and Tversky (1984), and Iyengar (1991), among others, suggest that on most matters of social or political interest, people are not generally so well-informed and cognitively active, and that framing therefore heavily influences their responses to communications”.&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R, (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm’, Journal of Communication, 43, 51–58, see p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that ''war journalism'' can have negative emotional impacts on audience members. These include feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness, compounded by increased anxiety, mood disturbance, sadness and a sense of disconnection with physical and social environments.  Research by Galtung and Ruge (1965) finds negativity bias in foreign news. This has also been confirmed more recently by Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. &amp; Ruge, M. (1965).  The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers.  Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91; Nohrstedt, S. &amp; Ottosen, R. (2008).  War journalism and the Threat Society.  Conflict and Communication Online, 7, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  
This can affect reactions towards the conflict itself, and an audience’s general psychological wellbeing, which biasses their view of the world as excessively chaotic and may cause serious anxiety and emotional difficulties, and a sense of disempowerment and disconnection.&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, G. (2004).  [http://www.aspr.ac.at/epu/research/Frohlich.pdf Emotional intelligence in Peace Journalism.],  Master of Arts Thesis.  European University Center for Peace Studies, pp.17, 47.  Retrieved October 12, 2009; McGoldrick, A. (2008).  Psychological effects of War Journalism and Peace Journalism.  Peace &amp; Policy, 13, 86–98, see p. 91; Nohrstedt &amp; Ottosen,  2008, pp. 4–6; Szabo, A. &amp; Hopkinson, K. (2007).  Negative Psychological Effects of Watching the News in the Television: Relaxation or Another Intervention May Be Needed to Buffer Them!  International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 14, 57–62, see p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Vicarious trauma can increase these negative effects, where "even ‘normal’, intelligent, educated individuals can become highly suggestible towards violent acts in formerly unexpected contexts".&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, 2004, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

These negative emotional states may discourage audience members from criticism and challenge of the biassed information presented through war journalism.  These public concerns may appear to be "someone else’s problem" and best left to "experts", who alone have the necessary knowledge, time, and emotional endurance. These negative emotional responses may also discourage creative engagement with the conflict and conflict parties.  This is especially troubling considering the critical role of creativity in conflict resolution and peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R. J. (1997).  Interactive Conflict Resolution.

==Feedback loop==
Peace journalism analysis suggests that  typical news on conflict, with its value bias towards violence and violent groups, has important effects on the parties to conflict.  Firstly, peace journalism proponents argue that the bias in favour of publicity for violence and violent actors, "plays into" the interests of violent actors to intimidate and disrupt  the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, 2004, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an important example of the Feedback Loop effect: "it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p. 61"/&gt;  This bias also weakens and punishes, with less publicity, non-violent groups affected by a conflict, for their lack of violence.  Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2002) note:
"if traditional media themselves are unable to transmit alternative perspectives and voice the danger is that those […] that feel marginalised will turn to terror in order to make a difference in the media agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Nohrstedt &amp; Ottosen 2002, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most visible actions of a group, of which one is not a member, are often considered representative of that group’s behaviour (an effect called the “availability heuristic”).&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, A. J. &amp; Hardin, C. D. (1997).  Differential use of the availability heuristic in social judgement.  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore war journalism's over-selection of violent, as opposed to non-violent, responses to conflict may actually foster a misperception of excessive threat between parties.  This is then generally exaggerated by other inter-group social-cognitive biases within war journalism.  These include biases towards: seeing an outgroup as more homogeneous (with less internal variety) than it really is, ignoring the variety of attitudes towards the conflict;&lt;ref&gt;Boldry, J.

Indeed Dr. Louis Kriesberg, a sociologist at Syracuse University, and expert on conflict resolution points out that: "conventional thinking among partisans in a fight generally attributes destructive persistence in a conflict to the enemy's character, asserting that the enemy is aggressive by nature, has evil leaders, or adheres to a hostile ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Kriesberg, Louis, ‘Waging conflicts constructively’ in Handbook of Conflict Analysis and Resolution (London: Routledge, 2009), p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; And Professor of World Religions, Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution, Marc Gopin, agrees with the importance of psychological factors in escalating conflict: "being hated normally generates deep injury and corresponding anger in most recipients is what I call a "conflict dance" of action/reaction".&lt;ref&gt;Gopin, Marc, ‘Conflict Resolution as a Religious Experience: Contemporary Mennonite Peacemaking’ in Between Eden and Armageddon: The Future of World Religions, Violence and Peacemaking (Oxford: Oxford U.P., 2000), p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''peace journalism'' perspective also highlights another effect of typical conflict journalism on  the groups engaged in a conflict: ''war journalism's'' common focus on the human drama and tragedy of violence. Hamber and Lewis (1997) note war journalism "often involves painting doomsday scenarios of victims who are irreparably damaged and for whom there appears to be no solution and no future".&lt;ref&gt;Hamber, B &amp; Lewis, S. (1997).

And the positive experiences of those who have embarked upon a process of recovery is often ignored in war journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hamber &amp; Lewis, 1997, see section:Is Post-Traumatic Stress…&lt;/ref&gt;  For example in Israel/Palestine, victims of suicide bombing, house demolition, land and house theft, are often portrayed as defenceless, disempowered victims with no prospect of healing or positive response to their predicament.&lt;ref&gt;Kershner, 2009; Koutsoukis, 2009; [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3750255,00.html US: Too soon to discuss Israel sanctions.] (2009, July 22).

Effective non-violent bridge building between communities such as the Hand in Hand Arab/Jewish school network in Israel, are routinely ignored in ''war journalism'' coverage.  Non-violent initiatives illustrate what can be possible through peaceful responses to conflict but this information is artificially "filtered out" through the coverage biases of ''war journalism''.&lt;ref&gt;For example see:Alpher, Y.

Parties are led to believe that that violence is the only way their needs can be met, thereby reinforcing and escalating cycles of dangerous retaliation between groups.  ''Peace journalism'' would also charge that this pattern of conventional conflict reporting submerges the emotional cost of violent conflict and therefore makes the psychological aspects of cycles of revenge subtle, and so more difficult to prevent.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. &amp; Maslog, C, &amp; Kim, H.

All of this missed information could represent a crucial movement away from violence, as the only option for threatened groups towards peace. But only if they are not hidden by journalistic assumptions that they are irrelevant, and should not be reported. This is of special concern, given that the [[collective trauma]] suffered by a population, and the fear that this generates, can lead to a reduced capacity for decision making and action.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, J.

==Response==
In response to war journalism’s value bias in favour of violence, peace journalism promises two key benefits: for those concerned with objectivity in journalism, it aims to avoid and counteract the persistent bias of valuing violence and violent parties. Secondly, as all journalism must in some way appeal to the values of their audiences, for those who value the promotion of peace and social justice over violence, it provides a practical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodny-Gumede |first1=Ylva |title=Awareness towards Peace Journalism among Foreign Correspondents in Africa |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i1.365 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'fixation of meaning'{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} in war journalism is often hidden by the “scattered opposition facts” that often occur in its coverage. However these do not actually allow for “challenging a dominant frame” of pro-violence: 'Framing' researcher Entman recommends:
"If educated to understand the difference between including scattered oppositional facts, and challenging a dominant frame, journalists might be better equipped to construct news that makes equally salient—equally accessible to the average, inattentive, and marginally informed audience—two or more interpretations of problems."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R. (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm, Journal of Communication, 43, 51-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decisions===
Hence, ''peace journalism'' is anchored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research “to map out solid ground beneath our feet; to declare, in advance, that we intend to use it, to assign meanings and draw distinctions.”&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decisions, on which of the almost infinite stories and facts to report, can be made openly and systematically. Lynch (2008) shows how these two disciplines are important anchors for ''conflict journalism'' in that they employ the academic rigor of the social sciences including: "openness about – and prepared to justify – starting assumptions for both observation and interpretation; and peer review.  Built into social science, moreover, is an allowance for the [[participant-observer effect]] – as soon as you start to observe something, you cannot avoid changing it."&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

As such ''peace journalism'' considers the effect it has on audiences and parties with regard to it own “objectivity”.  Lynch and Galtung (2010) elaborate on how this operates in ''conflict journalism'': "'It is an important distinction in this context because journalism itself may be part of the extended pattern of conflictual relationships, in which parties and their shared relations find themselves embedded – if only by bringing an audience to the ringside. Tillett comments: 'In some situations, individuals (or groups) will ‘fight to the death’ (even when obviously losing all that they claim to be seeking) to avoid being seen to ‘back down’ or ‘lose face' ' (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;29). In a conflict, he continues, "the presence of an audience generally makes it more likely that the protagonists will want to be seen to win, and that they will be less prepared to resolve than to fight'. Schattschneider goes as far as to argue that spectators are 'an integral part of the situation for, as likely as not, the audience determines the outcome of the fight'(1960, p.2)."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Lynch, J. &amp; Galtung, J. (2010).  Reporting conflict: New  directions in peace journalism.  St. Lucia: University of Queensland Press, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-group violence===
Conflict Analysis also provides guidance on mapping the hopes, needs, and fears of all parties to a conflict, including outwardly “impartial” third parties; and acknowledges the potential role of creativity, rather than assuming as ''war journalism'' does, that the positions of elites, power gradients and the struggle for power are the most important determinants of a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D. (2002).  People, peace and power: Conflict transformation in action.  London: Pluto Press, p.128; Lederach, J. P. (1997) Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies.  Washington, DC: US Institute of Peace Press, p.94; Lynch, 2008, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

These can then be assessed empirically in the conflict, and its potential resolution, rather than being ignored from the outset by journalists, as often is the case in ''war journalism''.  Therefore the importance in ''peace journalism'' of being willing to consider conflict as “open in space and time, with causes and exits anywhere”.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6"&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;   Lynch and Galtung (2010) present an important example of this in the case of North and South Korea, indicating that journalists should not ignore the grassroots people that endure this conflict, and that comparisons and input from the reunified Germany may be helpful, as could consideration and dialogue with East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and Galtung, 2010, pp.77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim here is not to impose definite “answers”. Conflict Analysis and Peace Research often elicit useful perspectives from those involved in the conflict. Empirical questions can then be put forward, and tested by investigative journalism.

These processes demonstrate that conflict is not static and intractable.  These insights challenge the psychological tendencies of ''war journalism'' noted above to present negative outgroup behaviour as the result of stable group characteristics.  Indeed the non-linear cycle of violence outlined by Elworthy and Rogers (2002), proposes that the key stage to prevent a cycle of revenge, is before the anger becomes bitterness.&lt;ref name="oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk"&gt;Elworthy, S. &amp; Rogers, P. (2002).  [http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/waronterrorism.pdf The ‘War on Terrorism’: 12-month audit and future strategy options], Oxford: Oxford Research Group, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  And peace journalism can allow for the consideration that “bitterness can be thought of as anger + memory[…]storing away trauma in a ‘trauma bank’ and, eventually, withdrawing it as ‘glory’ through further violence”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

Through reporting, which does not routinely ignore causes and non-linear cycles of violence, ''peace journalism'' can help expand the cognitive and emotional space for peace initiatives that contribute peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Elworthy and Rogers, 2002, pp.18-24; Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.87; Perez, M. (n.d.).  [http://www.transcend.org/tri/downloads/Peace%20Journalism%20Case%20Study-%20US%20Media%20Coverage%20of%20the%20War%20in%20Iraq.pdf Peace Journalism case study: US media coverage of the war in Iraq.]  Transcend Research Institute.  Retrieved 10 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feedback Loop of cause and effect in the media could then support the creation and continuation of peaceful process-structures .&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1999, pp.33-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would involve demonstrating a pattern of coverage that leads present and potential peace actors to predict that their efforts will be reported by journalists to “create opportunities for society at large to consider and value non-violent responses to conflict”.&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p.147"/&gt;  This in turn could reduce negative inter-group social-psychological tendencies.  This may be particularly important for projects such as the examples in Israel/Palestine of the 'Hand in Hand' network of schools, 'Peace Now', 'Breaking the Silence', 'Physicians for Human Rights', 'Machsom Watch' and 'Checkpoint Watch', which as mainly grassroots initiatives, are generally more fragile than mid level or upper level peace activities.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As a pedagogical practice, peace journalism training often uses pairs of ''war journalism'' and ''peace journalism'' reports to illustrate how the same story can be reported in either style, and that there is the potential to produce peace journalism within the time and travel constraints of mainstream journalism.

For a peace journalism/war journalism pair on conflict in the Philippines see [http://www2.arts.usyd.edu.au/podcast/podcastepisode_pac.cfm Peace Journalism in the Philippines.] The transcripts of this report pair, along with an outline of a course in peace journalism can be viewed at [http://www.cco.regener-online.de/2007_1/pdf/lynch.pdf A course in peace journalism.]

For a pair of reports covering Israel/Palestine plus a link to practical tips for avoiding journalism that is biased towards violence and violent actors, see [http://www.mediachannel.org/originals/warandpeace.shtml The Middle East—War Journalism and Peace Journalism]  The documentary [http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article2979.shtml News from the Holy Land] also contains another pair of reports on the Israel/Palestine conflict.

bridges of understanding between the Arab and Western world through analysis of the
news from these regions. [http://www.iemed.org/publicacions/quaderns/8/q8_081.pdf To Be an Effective Advocate for Peace, Media Distortions Must Be Addressed] analyses situations where conflict reporting has contributed to the actual worsening of conflict.

''Peace journalism'' can also take the form of the public dissemination of research on the successful conditions for non-violent conflict resolution and negotiation such as: [http://newmatilda.com/2011/10/05/unequal-partners-cant-negotiate Unequal Partners Can't Negotiate] by Paul Duffill, writing for New Matilda.

The piece does not assume there are only two parties, and doesn't assume parties' goals exactly match reported positions, and explores contradictory goals within a single official party.  It also reports on peaceful responses to conflict.  This report however is generally closed in space and time: with little exploration of the reasons behind the conflict between waring groups (including  considering the conduct of the weak national government), or whether parties other than Al Queda/Al Shabab have used violence, and assumes that causes and sources of solutions are restricted to within Somalia itself.  The report also does not explore non-elite efforts at peace, even though [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/somalis-rally-against-al-qaeda-allies/story-e6frf7jx-1226272294958 Somalis rally against al-Qaeda allies] suggests that there is local support for peace efforts.

The [[feedback loop]] of cause and effect&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and McGoldrick, 2005, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; is a useful reference point here for conceptualising the various “entry points” for peace journalism in the wider phenomenology of news.  ''Peace journalism'' has been applied in training and dialogue with journalists in a variety of settings.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Lynch, 2008, pp.35-36, p.81, p.84, p.85 &amp; p.87; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.135-136&lt;/ref&gt;  However peace journalism has also been applied in a number of other sectors.

These interventions are extremely varied and, in addition to the examples noted above, include international NGO work with local partners and networks in areas of conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; the promotion of communication rights, participatory processes, community-based communication approaches for development, and social change and peacebuilding (for example see [http://www.communicationforsocialchange.org/current-projects Current Projects-Communication for Social Change] &amp;  [http://www.waccglobal.org/en/programmes.html World Association for Christian Communication programmes] and further reading sections below) and work with organisations who may themselves become sources for peace journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick,2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Government and inter-governmental approaches have also facilitated ''peace journalism'' in preventing [[media manipulation]] and promoting people centred media in post-conflict societies and through the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Thompson, M. &amp; Price, M. (2003).   Intervention, media and human rights, Survival, 45, pp.183-202; Krug, P. &amp; Price, M. (2002).

==Criticism==
Peace journalism has aroused a number of debates and criticisms from scholars and journalists.

===Objectivity===
Some opponents characterise ''peace journalism'' as "activist" new writing that, while being socially engaged to promote peace, is unlike mainstream objective, or balanced, news coverage that seeks to remain impartial or above the fray.&lt;ref&gt;for example see Hanitzsch, 2007, pp.367–385.&lt;/ref&gt;

This raises the important question: how objective and impartial is peace journalism?  From a peace journalism perspective the claim “we just report the facts” must include the facts of how and according to what principals these “facts” came to meet the reporter, and how the finished coverage came to meet the facts.  The Press Institute of India’s conflict reporting guidelines point out: "Factual accuracy in a single story is no substitute for the total truth.  A single story, which is factually accurate can nonetheless be misleading".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd &amp; Toit, 1999, cited in Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

As such ''peace journalism'' is generally more objective, with its inclusion of implications for international law, positive developments in both elite peacemaking and capacity building, and non-elite perspectives and peacebuilding initiatives.  This objectivity, unconstrained by Objectivity Conventions, highlights the truth-orientation of peace journalism: to “expose untruths on all sides”.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6"/&gt;

In doing so ''peace journalism'' aims to de-naturalise{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} meaning by highlighting the creation of ''war journalism'' dominated meaning in conflict.  Indeed Hall (1997) recommends that the unfixing of meaning: “is often a struggle to increase the diversity of things which subjects can be of the possibility of identities which people have not seen represented before[…]you have to intervene in exactly that powerful exchange between image and its psychic meaning[…]with which we invest images [and] expose and deconstruct the work of representation which the stereotype is doing”.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1997, pp.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

And many international negotiation experts and peace practitioners note the importance of non-violent confrontation and the equalisation of power, before effective negotiation and dialogue between parties can take place.&lt;ref&gt;Docherty, J. (2005).  The little book of strategic negotiation: Negotiating during turbulent times.  Intercourse: Good Books, p.22; Francis, 2002, pp.56-57; Keashly, L. &amp; Fisher, R. J.

Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, p.32;  Cortright, D. (2008).  Peace: A history of Movements and Ideas.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.227.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through reporting on grassroots and local voices for peace, the power of these voices is increased, as they become "reality checkers" for often contradictory statements from elite representatives involved in violence.  Through this non-violent “ideational confrontation”, audiences and parties to conflict may be more able to negotiate their own meaning, outside of fixed elite narratives.  Thus “mounting anomalies may expose contradictions, and herald a paradigm shift” as local pro-peace perspectives previously consigned to a zone of “deviance” become “legitimate controversy”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

And indeed researchers also note the importance of relationship building for 'vertical and horizontal integration' in peacebuilding&lt;ref&gt;Gopin, M. (2002).

'''Peace journalism''' aims to retain the role of ''observer'' in reporting conflict, rather than functioning like ''war journalism'', which intervenes in conflict to increase the influence of violent actors and violent actions.  Peace journalism, by presenting “anomalous” local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group’s attempts to fix and naturalise{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2005, pp.204-205&lt;/ref&gt;  
Indeed, exploration of new types of relationships between Afghan locals and the international community, contradicts assertions made at the time, with the support of war journalism, by insurgents and the US government, that the negative effects of foreign occupation could only be ended with their violent expulsion, or that 40,000 more combat troops were the most critical component for sustainable peace in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of this war journalism see: Dombey, D.

===Explaining violence is justifying it===
This criticism can be represented by [[neo-conservative]] proponent [[Richard Perle]], that one must “decontextualise terror[…]any attempt to discuss the roots of terrorism is an attempt to justify it.  It simply needs to be fought and destroyed”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;  While this may be a common response to journalism which advocates context, it is also an example of many of the social-cognitive inter-group biases noted above, and exemplifies what social psychologist [[Phillip Zimbardo]] (of the Stanford Prison Experiments) calls a ''Fundamental Attribution Error'': “the tendency to explain observed behaviour by reference to dispositions, while ignoring or minimizing the impact of situational variables”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of human needs driving violence and being significantly effected by violence (borrowed from Conflict Analysis and Peace Research)&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.44-47&lt;/ref&gt; and insight into the stratified nature of reality (borrowed from Critical Realism),&lt;ref name="Dandermark pp.59-66"&gt;Dandermark et al. (2002) Explaining society – Critical Realism in the Social Sciences, London: Routledge, see particularly pp.59-66&lt;/ref&gt; highlights why an ''explanation'' of violence is not the same thing as a justification for it.

Critical Realism understands reality as existing in a number of levels or [[Stratified sampling|strata]]. Each strata deals with larger and more complex phenomena than that ones below it.  These strata might begin from physical mechanisms at the most basic level, followed by chemical mechanisms, then biological, followed by psychological and finally social.  Activity at each lower strata contributes to, but can never fully explain, the new mechanisms that develop in higher strata, in a process called “emergence” from the upper strata.  For example, competing theories of sub-atomic structure (perhaps at the physical level) influence but cannot fully explain the outcome of the reaction 2Na+2HCl = 2NaCl + H2 (at the chemical level).  Likewise the individual psychologies of a landlord and tenant cannot fully explain their relationship in the social strata, which is also influenced by other  things that operate at the social stratum, including laws and culture.&lt;ref name="Dandermark pp.59-66"/&gt;

Structural and cultural explanations for violence generally deal with the social strata: that is relationships between people and groups. An explanation of this violence is not the same as ignoring the role of individual choice and psychology: the violence that “emerges” at the social level is the result of a complex interaction of influences from lower strata (individual choices and psychology) and structures which exist primarily at the social strata (such as laws and culture).  So to give cultural or structural ''explanations'' of violence is not the same as saying that these social influences override the role the individual choice (which is located in a lower stratum and therefore occurs under different conditions).

Take the case where an individual’s anger (brought on from previous trauma) becomes bitterness, which is followed by their own violent acts, following Elworthy and Rogers (2002) cycle of violence noted above.&lt;ref name="oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk"/&gt; An individual has still made a choice to deprive the victim of their violence of their human needs (probably safety and security) even though their own human needs have also been violated earlier.  The point is not that they must be seen as  either a innocent victim or an evil perpetrator.  The practical point is the prevention of violence, and the healing of all those whose needs have been violated.

This approach does not assume that the best solution for stopping individual violence necessarily exists at the level where an individual makes a choice to act violently (which happens at the psychological level).  In some cases punishment or imprisonment may be necessary.  However Conflict Analysis and Peace Research suggest that, given the failure of the psychological, medical and social sciences (including education) to eliminate the persistent rates of psychotic tendencies in human groups (psychologists estimate that on average 3 percent of any population have psychotic tendencies),&lt;ref&gt;Collier, P.  (2007). 
The bottom billion: Why the poorest countries are falling apart and what can be done about it.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; a more promising approach may to look at what social, economic, cultural conditions and what inter-group relations enable individuals such as Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, Stalin and Pol Pot, to realise their desire for mass violence.

Conflict Analysis and Peace Research does not primarily focus on understanding the individual psychology of these individuals (at the psychological stratum), but on how these individuals may be prevented from taking up a position in society where they are able to direct inter-communal violence (at the social stratum).

Indeed in ''peace journalism'' the role of individual agency is given a lot of importance.  For example journalists are encouraged, in peace journalism workshops, to work peace journalism into the existing media structures.  And peace journalism urges journalists to investigate the possibility that, even in violent situations, there are always voices for peace, and to search these voices out, when reporting what the Objectivity Conventions might ignore from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp.6-31; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.51-63&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise the role of individual choice is not ignored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research, and leading scholar-practitioner, John Paul Lederach notes that:
“I have not experienced any situation in conflict, no matter how protracted or severe, from Central America to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, where there have not been people who had a vision for peace, emerging often from their own experience of pain.  Far too often, however, these same people people are overlooked and disempowered either because they do not represent ‘official’ power, whether on the side of government [or] of the various militias, or because they are written off as biased and too personally affected by the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure versus agency===
Hanitzsche (2007) argues that “the failures of corporate journalism cannot be overcome by an individualistic and voluntaristic conceptualization of news making. To have any impact on the ways news is being made, and the critical discussion thereof, the advocates of peace journalism must address the structural constraints of news production[…]a peaceful culture is the precondition of peace journalism."&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsche, 2007, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
Structure is a key concern in peace journalism, along with the influence of structure on ''content pluralism'' in news.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;  And a number of projects that apply ''peace journalism'' (some of which are outlined above) demonstrate that ''peace journalism activism'' is not limited to journalists themselves. Indeed, conflict media content analyses are important educational resources for audiences, NGOs and journalists, to show how deficiencies in content can be used to campaign for more structural pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.28 ; For examples of content analyses see: Galtung &amp; Lynch, 2010; Lee &amp; Masalog, 2005; Lee, Masalog &amp; Kim, 2006; Baltodano, B.,  Jared Bishop, J., Hmielowski, J., Kang-Graham, J., Morozov, A., White, B., et al. (2007).  Discourses of Blame and Responsibility: U.S./Canadian Media Representations of Palestinian-Israeli Relations.  Conflict and Communication Online, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

These varied approaches demonstrate that inroads have been, and are still being made, in ''peace journalism activism'' in the areas Hackett (2006) identifies as necessary to address challenges of structure and to "make peace journalism possible”: reforming journalism from within, and also creating alternative media organisations, and intervening in the broader fields in which journalism find itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audiences===
Hanitszche (2007) criticises peace journalism, noting that media users are often “fragmented and active audiences instead of a passive mass[…]leading to a selective use of supplied products”.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007).  Situating peace journalism in journalism studies: a critical appraisal, Conflict and Communication Online 6, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise Devereux (2003) notes that media audiences “may have different expectations of media genres”&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, E. (2003).  Understanding the media.  London: Sage Publications, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and Turnbull (2002) argues that in media research a serious problem is just to limit and define audiences and therefore relevant media practices.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, S. (2002).  Audiences. In Stuart Cunningham &amp; Graeme Turner (Eds.), The media &amp; communications in Australia (pp. 65-77). Crows Nest: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed Hall (1997) notes that the meaning of media messages changes “as you move from one person to another, one group to another, one part of society to another.”&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1997, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  And Lynch (2008) points out, drawing from Hall (1980) that “the meanings of media messages are made, at least partly, at the point of reception, in a process influenced chiefly by the socio-economic position of the reader or viewer.”&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such Hall (1980) notes that in a negotiated or oppositional manner, ''meaning'' often:
"contains a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements: it acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations (abstract), while, at a more restricted, situational (situated) level, it makes its own ground rules - it operates with exceptions to the rule. It accords the privileged position to the dominant definitions of events while reserving the right to make a more negotiated application to 'local conditions'".And indeed for many peace journalists it is the visibility of 'local conditions' that allows for oppositional and negotiated meaning. Lynch (2008)argues that “for audiences to produce oppositional or negotiated readings of media messages assumes they have enough directly relevant personal and social experience against which to measure them”,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often not the case with international conflict. Indeed Hall’s(1980) own example of the negotiation of meaning is the case of an industrial factory worker, willing to challenge official justifications in the media for an Industrial Relations Bill limiting his or her right to strike.{{Citation needed|reason=ref was given as (ref name=Hall, 1980, p.516 /), no full ref provided|date=November 2018}}

''Peace journalism'' analysis shows that the facts absent in audiences’ understanding of conflict, can closely mirror those neglected in ''war journalism''. A notable example is Philo and colleagues’ research into media coverage of the Israel/Palestine conflict in the UK media.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, G. (2004, July 14). What you get in 20 seconds. Guardian; Philo, G. (2009).  News, audiences and the construction of public knowledge.  In S. Allan (Ed.), The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (pp.407-506). Abingdon:   Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  With mainstream media neglecting the Palestinian narrative that Palestinian refugees lost their land and homes when Israel was established, audiences exhibited consistent ignorance about the basic facts of the conflict (for example where the bulk of refugees came from) and tended to perceive Palestinians as “starting the violence” and therefore Israeli authorities as forced to “respond” violently to prevent or contain this action, which has no possible rationale and therefore no potential non-violent resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, 2009, p.502&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed five years earlier, when reporting results of the study, Philo (2004) noted that: "This pattern of reporting clearly influenced how some viewers understood the conflict[…]The gaps in public knowledge closely parallel those in the news. The Palestinian perspective, that they have lost their land and are living under occupation, was effectively absent. It is perhaps not surprising that some viewers believed that they were simply being aggressive and trying to take land from the Israelis".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This omission of the Palestinian perspective was so serious that Helen Boaden, Head of News at the BBC, concluded in an internal email: “we fail to give enough context and history to this highly charged story and that we neglect the Palestinian narrative[…]In our response, we’ve tried to come up with practical ways to remedy our weaknesses”.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Lynch, 2008, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has also been the focus of research by Yifat Mor and colleagues, who examined how social media (namely [[Facebook]]) can be a tool to promote dialogue between both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mor |first1=Yifat |last2=Ron |first2=Yiftach |last3=Maoz |first3=Ifat |title=“Likes” for Peace: Can Facebook Promote Dialogue in the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i1.298 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an important illustration of the consistent effect of war journalism across general audiences: “the pattern of misunderstanding almost exactly matching[…]missing elements from the story habitually presented in the mainstream media”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;  General media audiences as a group are conceptualised within the Feedback Loop of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;First outlined in Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches===
Two peace practitioner scholars, John Paul Lederach and Johan Galtung present two quite different models for conflict resolution and peace building. Lederach (1995) presents an “Elictive Model” which is aims “primarily at discovery, creation, and solidification of models that emerge from the resources present in a particular setting and respond to needs in that context” and to not impose third party knowledge from trainer to participant.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1995, p.55 &amp; p.62&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach, was applied in a dialogue in 2003 entitled “Reporting the[sic?] Iraq: what went right?  What went wrong?”. Included were Heads of News from the BBC and CNN, the editor of the Guardian, and several senior reporters who had also been reporting the war from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.201; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on “the resources in the room” recommendations for the coverage of conflict included: 
#Do not report a ‘line’ from an official source without obtaining and citing independent evidence as to its reliability.
#Acknowledge that the important job of testing arguments is best done if they are juxtaposed with, and weighed against, alternative, countervailing arguments.
#All newsrooms genuinely interested in offering a service to the public must think long and hard about ‘conduit’ journalism and, in particular, whether their political correspondents are being used in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp.204-206.&lt;/ref&gt;
#

Galtung’s TRANSCEND approach in contrast, focuses on the role a third party to “unstick” violent conflicts and stimulate creativity. This is done by  probing deeply into the nature of parties’ goals, expanding the spectrum of acceptable solutions, and opening up cognitive space for fresh potentialities not conceived of by conflict parties.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. &amp; Tschudi, F. (2001). Crafting Peace: On the Psychology of the TRANSCEND Approach.  In D. J. Christie, R. V. Wagner, &amp; D. D. Winter (Eds), Peace, Conflict, and Violence. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, see pp.210-212&lt;/ref&gt;  "In one-on-one conversation-style dialogues, the task is to stimulate creativity, develop new perspectives, and make the conflict parties 'ready for the table'".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch (2008) recounts a notable example of this approach during a ''peace journalism'' forum of Middle Eastern journalists, in Amman, in 1999.  Discussions often devolved into national groups blaming the journalists of the other countries for not confronting their governments’ lack of movement towards peace. Galtung himself challenged the participants to: “imagine a future Middle East they wanted to see, and start to think aloud, in cross-national groups, about how they might play a part in bringing it about”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

A Galtungian perspective, as a foundation for much of ''peace journalism'', insists that “the journalist focus on root causes of conflict such as poverty or prior abuse, and not merely focus on events associated with violent political encounters”.&lt;ref&gt;.Falk, R. (2008).  Foreword.  In J. Lynch (Author), Debates in Peace Journalism (pp.v-x).  Sydney: University of Sydney Press, see p.vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this approach peace journalism could act to “disembed” seemingly immutable official positions from the greater context of a conflict by exploring background to a conflict, challenging propaganda, and making visible official and local initiatives for peaceful conflict resolution.

These two approaches differ not only in the "how" of [[Conflict Resolution]] but the "who".  Lederach generally outlines a "middling out" approach where "the level with the greatest potential for establishing an infrastructure that can sustain the peacebuilding process over the long term appears to be the middle range".&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that grassroots approaches are generally the more fragile since their participants are often concerned with day to day issues of survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, pp.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Upper level approaches assume a high level of integration between elites and grassroots: that peace agreements reached there "are relevant to and capable of practical implementation at the local level"&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;  Galtung on the other hand argues that upper level leaders often actually feel excluded from facilitated peace processes, with the modern focus on grassroots and civil society initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (2010, July 7).  Self-Determination: 50 years on.  Workshop presented at the 2010 biennial conference of the International Peace Research Association, Customs House, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;  The root of conflict is ''incompatible goals'', pursued by parties which result in violent attitudes and behavior. It follows that "people are more able to discuss a root problem when they sense a solution somewhere.  A glimmer of light at the end of a tunnel makes it considerably more easy[sic] to admit that we are in a tunnel".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;  In Galtung's work, the most accessible way to influence these goals had been to work with those who officially defined them and led policy—the upper level leaders.

The importance of accurate and complete [[Conflict Analysis]] for a given conflict highlights how these two approaches can be complementary. Practical [[Conflict Analysis]] is often aimed at identifying the easiest "peace levers" to pull, within a conflict to "unstick" violent inter-group relations. This contrasts with intervening in a conflict with pre-set ideas of how a resolution will be found, and with which specific level or group to begin working.

Therefore [[Conflict Analysis]] may indicate which "entry points" offer the most promising chance to transform the relations between parties. And from this it will follow which approach, or combination of approaches, are likely to work from that entry point (whether it be at the grassroots, mid level or upper level or a combination). This integrative approach is summed up by peace practitioner and researcher Wendy Lambourne: "to rely on only one theoretical approach in peace practice risks being culturally blind".&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication, 27 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar approaches==
Sometimes also called [[conflict solution journalism]], [[conflict sensitive journalism]],&lt;ref name="journalismethics.ca"/&gt; and [[constructive conflict coverage]].  A similar approach is also found in [[preventive journalism]], which extends the principles to social, economic, environmental or institutional problems. Peace journalism is one of several approaches and movements in journalism history, including [[advocacy journalism]], [[development communication]] journalism, the [[new journalism]], and public or [[civic journalism]], which reject the universal or hegemonic claims to neutrality of professional journalism in the developed West.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hanitzsch, “Deconstructing Journalism Culture: Toward a Universal Theory,”'' Communication Theory 17'' (2007) p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Police memorabilia collecting''' is a [[hobby]] involving the collection and trading of law enforcement-related [[Embroidered patch|patches]] or [[badges]],&lt;ref&gt;In the [[United States]], the distinction is that patches are embroidered insignia, whereas badges are metallic or plastic items affixed to a uniform&lt;/ref&gt; and other memorabilia including [[Custodian helmet|bobby helmets]], training manuals, police medals, and historic artifacts such as turn-of-the-century screw-based [[handcuffs]] and police-box globes.

== Public collection ==

In the United States, many laws have been enacted which control possession of law enforcement insignia for security purposes, and this has impacted civilian collecting because they do not want the patches to be given to anyone other than law enforcement officers. In addition to this, patch reproductions have also become a problem amongst collectors, and most serious historians regard the reproductions as having no value. Various organizations, such as the California Law Enforcement Historical Society, sponsor annual events which spotlight the historical significance of preserving accurate information for future generations. West Virginia Law prohibits trading patches, yet North Carolina law prohibits departments selling patches.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide source of specific state laws that prohibit the trading or selling of patches in these two states|date=June 2014}}

Though many do not trade or give away patches, many agencies nationwide sell their patches, for around $5, some being for a new police cruiser, charity, or for their explorers program.

== Between agencies ==

Police memorabilia is also exchanged between police forces themselves. The exchange of patches has begun to be seen as a sign of respect and cooperation between agencies since patches came into more common use in the 1920s for agency identity{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. With the development of more modern communication between various law enforcement agencies, the trading of insignia has become widespread. One particular example can be seen at the [[New York Police Department]]'s Museum in [[New York City]], where hundreds of police badges and patches are on display, including those from other American forces, and all constabularies of the [[United Kingdom]], as well as forces from [[South East Asia]] and [[Australia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">The '''President's Peace Commission''' is a body composed of invited faculty, staff and students of [[St. Mary's University, Texas|St. Mary's University]] in San Antonio, Texas.  Each year the Commission chooses a significant theme bearing on the related subjects of peace and justice.  Always relevant to the United States, this theme can involve international considerations.  In the fall, two days are designated for discussions of the theme by invited speakers and panelists.  In the spring, a program is produced which features a concert and the bestowal of the Art of Peace award upon a chosen individual.

==History of the President's Peace Commission==

In 1984 the Faculty Senate of St. Mary's University proposed establishment of a commission by the university president to further peace education.  Initially this need focused on East-West tensions, especially the threat of nuclear war.  Two years later the first program was held.  More than 250 videos documenting the President's Peace Commission sessions can be viewed at the Louis J. Blume Library on the St. Mary's campus.  Thousands attend the Commission events each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = |authorlink = | title = The President's Peace Commission| work = St. Mary's University| publisher = | date =  | url = http://www.stmarytx.edu/ppc/index.php?go=history | format = | doi=  | accessdate  = 2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission Statement of the President's Peace Commission==

&lt;blockquote&gt;The President's Peace Commission fosters an ethical commitment to participate in the establishment of world peace and social justice. The Commission encourages respect for human rights and dignity of all people. The Commission annually hosts symposia that offer opportunities for students, faculty, and staff to grow in their active pursuit of peace and justice. Through the symposia and other activities, the Commission seeks to build within the St. Mary's University community a greater awareness of the Roman Catholic and Marianist perspectives on peace and justice. The President's Peace Commission reflects the University community through student, staff, and faculty representatives appointed by the University President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = |authorlink = | title = The President's Peace Commission Mission Statement| work = St. Mary's University| publisher = | date =  | url = http://www.stmarytx.edu/ppc/pdf/Fall2009PPC.pdf

==Art of Peace Award==

The Art of Peace award has been granted annually since 1999.  Normally the university president bestows the award in person at the spring program.  The chosen artist must possess a reputation for quality work and be known as a person who attempts to further the cause of peace.  Since it is desirable that the artist's work be integrated into the program, it must be performable.  The committee assigned to designate the Art of Peace awardee attempts to name an individual associated with St. Mary's University but is not limited to this association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Criteria for the Art of Peace Award| work =St. Mary's University| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.stmarytx.edu/ppc/content/Award_Description.html| doi =| accessdate =2010-01-23| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110608132941/http://www.stmarytx.edu/ppc/content/Award_Description.html| archivedate =2011-06-08| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ProCon.org''' is a [[non-profit]] [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|charitable organization]] headquartered in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]] in the United States. It operates the ProCon.org website, an online resource for research on controversial issues.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; The content of ProCon.org is produced by five staff researchers, and its stated mission is "Promoting critical thinking, education, and informed citizenship by presenting controversial issues in a straightforward, nonpartisan, primarily [[wikt:pros and cons|pro-con format]]."&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FactCheckED"/&gt;

== History ==
ProCon.org was formed under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the US [[Internal Revenue Code]] as a [[public charity]] in [[Santa Monica]] on July 12, 2004 by Steven C. Markoff, a [[Los Angeles]] businessman, who is also the co-chairman of A-Mark Entertainment, a film production company.&lt;ref name="view"/&gt;

The organization's first managing editor, Kamy Akhavan, was hired on December 12, 2004.&lt;ref name="ProConHistory"/&gt; ProCon.org's first appearance in the media was on June 6, 2005, when its material on [[medicinal marijuana]] was referenced by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="News2005-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCMedicalCannabis"/&gt; Akhavan was promoted from Managing Editor to President in 2010.&lt;ref name="ProConHistory"/&gt; The organization's board of directors consists of Markoff, his wife Jadwiga S.Z.-Markoff, John Kurtz, Stanley F. Shimohara and [[Bruce McNall]].&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt;

===Recognition===
[[File:233wilshireblvd.jpg|233 Wilshire Blvd, Santa Monica, CA, the building in which the office of ProCon.org is located|thumb]]
In addition, as of November 2, 2009, these materials were regularly being used by schools in all 50 states. Twelve international governments, 27 state governments, and many federal agencies have referenced ProCon.org including the US Dept. of Education, US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Congressional Research Service.&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt; In 2008, the [[Library of Congress]] archived three of ProCon.org's webpages as "materials of historical importance to the Congress and to the American people."&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt; Its materials on [[medical marijuana]] have been used by such governmental entities as the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] and the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CongressionalResearch" /&gt;

On February 2, 2009, ProCon.org received the "Best Non-Profit to Work For" award from [[opportunityknocks.org]].&lt;ref name="knocks" /&gt;

A division of the [[American Library Association]] voted ProCon.org as one of the "Top 25 Free Reference Websites of 2011" on June 17, 2011. (Other resources included on this list are [[WikiLeaks]] and [[Google Translate]].)&lt;ref name="aboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ALABestReference" /&gt; As a result of winning this award, the organization was honored by Congressman [[Rob Andrews]] (D-NJ) in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="ProcogHouse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CongressionalRecord" /&gt;

==Content==
As of November 2013, the site covered 49 topics,&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; including such historically controversial issues as [[prostitution]], [[illegal immigration]], [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|sports and drugs]], [[insider trading]], [[abortion]], the [[death penalty]],&lt;ref name="capital punishment" /&gt; [[euthanasia]], [[drinking age]], [[gay marriage]], [[voting machines]], [[presidential elections]], the [[Iraq War]], the [[ACLU]], [[medical marijuana]], the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], [[video game violence]], and the origins of [[sexual orientation]]. More recent topics include the [[2012 presidential election]], [[college education]], [[Obamacare]], [[standardized tests]], [[Teacher tenure reform|teacher tenure]], [[vegetarianism]],&lt;ref name="vegetarianism" /&gt; [[animal testing]], felony disenfranchisement,&lt;ref name="felonvoting" /&gt; the gold standard, and [[man-made climate change]].&lt;ref name="aboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gold standard" /&gt;

Each issue site contains collections of questions about the issue. After an introductory overview, the topic is then broken into subcategories and sub questions which are organized into "pro" and "con" columns.&lt;ref name="StPetersburgProCon" /&gt; The columns list the quoted arguments of different experts on that particular subject.{{cn|date=September 2016}} For example, the drug use in sports section includes responses from [[Lance Armstrong]], [[Gene Upshaw]], and various scientists and specialists.&lt;ref name="druguse" /&gt; ProCon.org staffers assess each source, assigning a self-defined "Theoretical Expertise" ranking system to rank expert responses on a scale of one star (for lowest expertise) to five stars (for highest expertise).&lt;ref name="knapp" /&gt;

ProCon.org users are encouraged by the organization to volunteer, donate, and propose new questions and topics.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt; An approval process exists in which the topic, core question, and 1-minute overview must be approved by both the Chairman and Managing Editor.&lt;ref name="WebsitesinDevelopment" /&gt;

===Research projects===
In addition to its collection of pro-con questions, ProCon.org develops proprietary research projects containing information on select subjects. In May 2008, ProCon.org published its "Fart Chart," which provided details on the dairy industry's greenhouse gas emissions from [[ruminant]] animals.&lt;ref name="draper" /&gt;

In July 2009, ProCon.org's chart "Deaths from Marijuana v. 17 FDA-Approved Drugs" was referenced in a [[CBS News]] article about anti-drug campaigns.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt; In October 2009, ProCon.org released a resource detailing the top ten richest US Senators' top stock trades in 2007 and the potential conflicts of interest that might arise from these trades.&lt;ref name="senator" /&gt;

==Reception==
The organization's materials have been referenced over 950 times by publications and media outlets, including ''[[TIME]]'',&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref name="teen"/&gt; the ''[[Merced Sun-Star]]'', [[ABC News]], the ''[[Daily World (Opelousas)|Daily World]]'', ''[[Courrier International]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Press TV]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Education Week]]'', and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; Akhavan has been interviewed by [[Pete the Planner]], [[Minyanville]], [[On Board (magazine)|On Board]], [[Fox Business]], [[ABC News]], and [[Voice of America]].&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;

As of 2013, 241 books had referenced or mentioned ProCon.org in some way.&lt;ref name="Referencebooks"/&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]],&lt;ref name="KrugmanNobel"/&gt; a Nobel Prize–winning economist and op-ed columnist, used ProCon.org in his breakdown of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|U.S. Affordable Care Act]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="KrugmanHealthcare"/&gt;

===Education===
In 2010, the [[Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction]] listed the site as a recommended resource for [[social studies]]. The website has also been listed as a resource by the [[State education agency|Utah State Office of Education]] and [[Michigan Department of Education]].&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt; ProCon.org has been endorsed by the [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction]],&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt; and the CA Department of Education.&lt;ref name="julyhigh"/&gt;

In his 2011 book, Michael J. Schmoker stated that ProCon.org is a useful website for science teachers, especially when teaching such subjects as alternative energy versus fossil fuels, cell phones and nuclear power.&lt;ref name="Schmokerbook"/&gt;

===Medicinal marijuana===
ProCon.org's materials on [[medical marijuana]] have been used as a resource by 12 governmental entities, including the [[Congressional Research Service]], the [[State of Michigan]], the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], the [[Hawaii Department of Public Safety]], the [[New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services]], the [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court of the State of California]], and the [[List of law enforcement agencies in Connecticut|Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">::''For retaliatory evictions in the United Kingdom see [[Revenge eviction]]''

In American [[landlord–tenant law]], a '''retaliatory eviction''' is a substantive defense and affirmative [[cause of action]] that can be used by a [[leasehold estate|tenant]] against a [[landlord]].  If a tenant reports sanitary violations or violations of minimum housing standards, the landlord cannot [[evict]] the tenant in retaliation for reporting the poor housing conditions.

==History==
Retaliatory eviction first appeared as a tenant's defense against eviction in ''[[Edwards v. Habib]]'' (1968), where a tenant was evicted after reporting sanitary code violations.  The [[D.C. Circuit]] recognized that the eviction was unjustified because it was in retaliation for the reporting of violations.&lt;ref&gt;Casner, A.J. et al.  ''Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2004, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a defense==
The defense of retaliatory eviction was first recognized in the D.C. Circuit case [[Edwards v. Habib]].
===West Virginia===
The case ''Imperial Colliery Co. v. Fout'',&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Colliery Co. v. Fout'', 179 W.Va. 776 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the West Virginia Supreme Court reaffirmed that retaliatory eviction was a valid defense against eviction, but added the condition that the retaliation must be against a tenant's exercise of a right incidental to their tenancy.  Therefore, a defense of retaliatory eviction did not exist for a tenant evicted after participating in a labor strike.

===California===
1942.5 is the California Civil Code that establishes a renters rights and defines a Retaliatory Eviction in the state of California.

==As a cause of action==
Retaliatory eviction was first recognized as a cause of action in the California case ''Aweeka v. Bonds''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aweeka v. Bonds'', 20 Cal.App.3d 278 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;  The case recognized the inequity of forcing the tenant to wait until they were confronted with an [[unlawful detainer]] action to bring up retaliatory eviction as a defense.

The '''Romanian Border Police''' ({{lang-ro|Poliţia de Frontieră}}) is the structure of the [[Romania]]n [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Ministry of Administration and Interior]] responsible for the border security and [[passport]] control at border crossing points, airports and ports.&lt;ref&gt;http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=40#Country_Profile_Section_177 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124192722/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=40 |date=2017-01-24 }} OSCE entry on Romanian Border Police&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranks==
The Border Police uses the same ranking system as the Romanian Police, with different colors. (''see [[Romanian Police#Ranks|Romanian Police]]'')

Before 2002, the Border Police had military status and a military ranking system, within the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior of Romania|Ministry of Administration and Interior]] (''see [[Romanian Armed Forces ranks and insignia]]''). In June 2002 it became a [[Law enforcement agency#civpol|civilian police force]], together with the [[Romanian Police|National Police]] (the first police service in [[Eastern Europe]] to do so) and its personnel was structured into two ''corps'':

*''Corpul ofiţerilor de poliţie'' (Police Officers Corps) - corresponding to the [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] ranks of a military force, to the ranks of [[Inspector]], [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] and [[Police commissioner|Commissioner]] in a British-style police force or to the both ''Corps de conception et de direction'' and ''Corps de commande et d'encadrement'' in the [[French National Police]] (''Police Nationale'').

'''Scientific dissent''' is [[dissent]] from [[scientific consensus]]. Disagreements can be useful for finding problems in underlying assumptions, methodologies, and reasoning, as well as for generating and testing new ways of tackling the unknown.&lt;ref name=immki&gt;de Melo‐Martín, I. and Intemann, K. (2013) [http://embor.embopress.org/content/14/3/231.short "Scientific dissent and public policy"]. ''EMBO Reports'', '''14''' (3): 231–235. {{doi|10.1038/embor.2013.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, with the increased role of science on the society and the [[politicization of science]], a new aspect gained prominence: effects of scientific dissent on public policies.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;

Scientific dissent is distinct from [[denialism]], which is a deliberate rejection of scientific consensus usually for commercial or ideological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/1/2 | title=Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond? | author=Diethelm, Pascal | journal=The European Journal of Public Health | year=2009 | volume=19 | issue=1 | doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 | pmid=19158101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific dissent as norm of scientific inquiry==
{{Main article|Scientific method|Scientific consensus}}
[[Miriam Solomon]] in her book ''Social Empiricism'' argues that scientific dissent is the normal state of [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], rather than a conflict situation that needs resolution. She argues that disagreements of  individual scientists about the proper direction of research are not cause for concern, because scientific rationality must be assessed at the level of the scientific community.&lt;ref name=se2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wylie|first=Alison|title=A More Social Epistemology: Decision Vectors, Epistemic Fairness, and Consensus in Solomon’s Social Empiricism|journal=Perspectives on Science|date=2008|volume=16|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As long as all theories being pursued yield some unique empirical successes, Solomon argues that their pursuit is worthwhile and even consistent with the common view that science aims at truth.&lt;ref name=se1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmaus|first1=W.|title=Book Review: What's So Social about Social Knowledge?|journal=Philosophy of the Social Sciences|volume=35|issue=1|year=2005|pages=98–125|issn=0048-3931|doi=10.1177/0048393104271927}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Solomon's view, competing scientific theories can even be inconsistent with one another while each containing some degree of truth.&lt;ref name=se1/&gt;  Empirical evidence may not be sufficient to distinguish between competing theories, and successful theories often have core assumptions that are incorrect.&lt;ref name=se1/&gt;

===Historical scientific dissent===
A number of famous scientists have been sceptical of what were, or came to be, mainstream scientific positions. For example, [[Ernst Mach]] famously declared in 1897: "I don't believe that atoms exist!"&lt;ref&gt;John T. Blackmore, ''Ernst Mach; His Work, Life, and Influence'', University of California Press, 1972, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZY9qjB34PMC&amp;pg=PA206 p. 206].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] expressed a similar scepticism about atoms, but changed his mind in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Nye, ''Molecular Reality: A perspective on the Scientific Work of Jean Perrin'', Macdonald, 1972, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[peptic ulcer]]s were  believed to be caused by stress and dietary factors. The physicians [[Robin Warren]] and [[Barry Marshall]] showed in 1982 that the bacterium ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' was responsible, but the medical community was slow to make appropriate changes in ulcer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cdc.gov/ulcer/history.htm |title=History of Ulcer Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher = CDC |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppressed dissent==
Scientific debate is a healthy and necessary part of science, but scientific debate may collide with power dynamics within the academic world.&lt;ref name="Delborne"&gt;Delborne, J.A. (2016) [http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/607/bok%253A978-981-287-098-8.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fbook%2F10.1007%2F978-981-287-098-8&amp;token2=exp=1472342037~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F607%2Fbok%25253A978-981-287-098-8.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Fbook%252F10.1007%252F978-981-287-098-8*~hmac=8928e332db73d21684a40f689be1b3d21e90e139d3d1922a7960f8a29bc7f985#page=941 "Suppression and Dissent in Science"]. In: Tracey Ann Bretag (Ed) ''Handbook of Academic Integrity'', '''64''': 943–956. Springer. {{ISBN|9789812870971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppression of legitimate scientific debate can be considered as a breach of academic integrity.&lt;ref name="Delborne"/&gt; Examples of suppression include journal editors rejecting a paper for political reasons prior to peer-review, refusing access to data for research which might draw negative conclusions about the safety of some commercial product, and putting pressure on a university to fire a dissenting researcher.&lt;ref name="Delborne"/&gt;

==False scientific dissent==
{{main article|Manufactured controversy}}
In modern times proponents of [[Denialism|science denialism]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[conspiracy theories]] often try to disguise their viewpoints as "scientific dissent" to take an advantage of the benefit of doubt. Such cases are typically recognized by lack of crucial elements of [[scientific approach]]: insufficient evidence base, lack of rigor and control, etc.&lt;ref name=assci&gt;[http://www.asianscientist.com/2014/04/features/keeping-modern-myths-conspiracy-theories-bay-2014/ "Keeping Modern Myths And Conspiracy Theories At Bay"], April 7, 2014, ''Asian Scientist Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Lack of discussion of claims coming from [[fringe science]] may be presented as suppression by [[mainstream science]]. This was described as "manufacturing dissent" and discussed in the context of [[neo-creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Brauer, Daniel R. Brumbaugh, "Biology Remystified: The Scientific Claims of the New Creationists," in: ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics: Philosophical, Theological, and Scientific Perspectives'', MIT Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0262661241}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=re4SXiklicAC&amp;pg=PA322 pp. 322, 323]&lt;/ref&gt;

David Harker in the introduction to his book ''Creating Scientific Controversies'', summarizes the history how tobacco industry worked towards manufacturing a controversy regarding the [[health effects of tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harker, ''Creating Scientific Controversies: Uncertainty and Bias in Science and Society'', {{ISBN|1107069610}}, Cambridge University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In what is sometimes known as the "[[Association fallacy#Galileo Gambit|Galileo gambit]]," pseudoscientists will sometimes compare themselves to Galileo, arguing that opposition from established scientists is actually a point in favour of their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Willingham, ''When Can You Trust the Experts?: How to Tell Good Science from Bad in Education'', Wiley, 2012, {{ISBN|1118233271}}, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Gordin, ''The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe'', University of Chicago Press, 2012, {{ISBN|0226304434}}, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]] writes that "No doubt the most famous example of mistaken analogy is the abuse of Galileo Galilei's case resulting in his conviction by the Holy Inquisition. The basic strategy consists of equating Galileo with the poor astrologer or parapsychologist and equating the Inquisition with the scientific establishment."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Paul Van Bendegem, "Argumentation and Pseudoscience The Case for an Ethics of Argumentation," In Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem'', University of Chicago Press, 2013, {{ISBN|022605182X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc4OAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298 p. 298].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on modern public policies==
{{Main article|Politicization of science}}
Views which disagree with [[scientific consensus]] may have an adverse effect on the perception of science by general public and affect decision making in various policies. When prominently promoted without due proportion, dissenting views can create an impression of uncertainty to laypeople.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;&lt;ref name=assci/&gt; Common examples of such situation include  [[global warming controversy]] and issues of [[public health]] and [[genetically modified organism]]s.  Therefore, scientists treat scientific dissent as problematic when it may have a significant impact on public and policy-making, and try to mitigate it.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;&lt;ref name=maju&gt;Aklin, M. and Urpelainen, J. (2014) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141 "Perceptions of scientific dissent undermine public support for environmental policy"]. ''Environmental Science &amp; Policy'', '''38''': 173–177. {{doi|10.1016/j.envsci.2013.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmaculada de Melo-Martín and Kristen Intemann criticize three major strategies in battling allegedly dangerous scientific dissent: masking the dissent, silencing the dissent, and discrediting the dissenters.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt; Melo-Martin and Intermann argue that these strategies come from a misdiagnosis: the real problem is not dissent,  but public scientific illiteracy. Rather than focusing on dissent, scientists must concentrate on educating the general public, so that people could make educated opinions and recognize false claims and invalid arguments. They further argue that silencing dissent rather than promoting literacy incurs the risk of undermining the public trust in science.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;

[[Sheila Jasanoff]], in the context of [[climate change]], mentions a common argument that public opinion is poorly informed because [[petroleum industry]] manufactures uncertainties and the media exaggerate the dissent, but argues that it is insufficient for the understanding of the problem. She writes that studies of scientific controversies show that credibility of science depend not only on strong scientific consensus, but also on the persuasive power of those who speak for science, especially in the situations of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Jasanoff, "Cosmopolitan Knowledge: [[Climate Science]] and Global Civic [[Epistemology]]", in: ''The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society'', 2011, {{ISBN|0199566607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Socialist Unity Network''' was a small network of the [[far-left]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which was not affiliated with any single [[political party]]. It grew out of the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] (SA) in England, and was initiated by several non-aligned members of the SA executive in March 2004.

Members of the network were supporters of [[Respect - The Unity Coalition]] and other left electoral initiatives including the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]. The main aspect of the network was its now defunct website, which had regularly updated articles from a wide range of socialist  perspectives on issues including the possibilities of creating socialist unity.

==History==
The network was formed in March 2004 by several non-aligned members of the Socialist Alliance in England, and grew to include left-wing activists from a range of political parties and campaigning organisations, and those with no party affiliation. It was centrally involved in the debates around the winding down of the Socialist Alliance and the formation of Respect. It produced its own leaflets on occasions and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] some members of the network stood as "Socialist Unity" candidates, providing a banner under which independent socialists could choose to stand, as part of the [[Socialist Green Unity Coalition]], a coalition with the Socialist Party.

Socialist Unity candidates stood again in the 2006 council elections, gaining over 5% of the vote in Swindon, and over 10% in Hackney. The network also produced a 2005 election guide with ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'' magazine.

Leading members included Jim Jepps (later a Green Party activist), Declan O'Neill, Andy Newman (later a Labour Party member),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-newman Andy Newman &amp;#124; The Guardian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420115503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andy-newman |date=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Caygill, John Nicholson, Martin Wicks (of Swindon Trades Council), Pete Green, Nick Bird, Salman Shaheen (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog), Reuben Rosenberg (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog) and Tawfiq Chahboune.

== Core beliefs ==
The "who we are" section on the socialist unity network webpage stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Socialist Unity Network originated in the Socialist Alliance. It is not a political group conceived to add to the competition between the many socialist organisations which already exist. It is a network of activists which campaigns for the widest practical collaboration of left groups and movements resisting the attacks of the Blair government.

In England the left has failed to make the break with the sectarian legacy that has dogged the "far left" for so long. Such divisions undermine our ability to build a fightback against the Blair government.

The Socialist Unity Network therefore believes that, in the interests of building resistance and striving to create the conditions in which a socialist alternative to New Labour can emerge, it is necessary to strive to develop [[collaborative method]]s of working as widely as possible. This is similar to the process that led to the formation of the SSP in Scotland, which was the result of a number of years of common work and discussion which enabled previously competing and sometimes hostile organisations to overcome old antagonisms and to develop greater political agreement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6194">[[Image:Olav den helliges saga CK5.jpg|thumb|250px|Torgny Lagmann speaks at Uppsala, by C. Krogh]]
'''Torgny the Lawspeaker''' ([[Old Icelandic]]: ''Þorgnýr lögmaðr'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Torgny Lagman'') is the name of one of at least three generations of [[lawspeaker]]s by the name ''Þorgnýr'', who appear in the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' by the Icelandic scholar and chieftain [[Snorri Sturluson]], and in the less known ''[[Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa]]'' and ''[[Hróa þáttr heimska]]''. They were the lawspeakers of [[Tiundaland]], and all lawspeakers in the Swedish kingdom were their subordinates.

The one who is the most famous is reported by the ''Heimskringla'' to have lived in the time of [[Olof Skötkonung]] and [[Olaf the Holy]], and there is an extensive account on him in this source. This Þorgnýr is held to have historic basis, but Snorri's account is doubted by modern Swedish historians,&lt;ref name="Lagerquist"&gt;Lagerquist 1997:36&lt;/ref&gt; who lack native Swedish documentation on the Tiundaland lawspeakers of this  time.

Snorri relates:
: ''In Tiundaland there was a lagman'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;lawspeaker] ''who was called Thorgny, whose father was called Thorgny Thorgnyson. His forefathers had for a long course of years, and during many kings' times, been lagmen of Tiundaland. At this time Thorgny was old, and had a great court about him. He was considered one of the wisest men in Sweden, and was [[Ragnvald Ulfsson|Earl Ragnvald]]'s relation and foster-father.''

The two kings were at war, and many wise men in both [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, the [[earl]] [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]] and the Norwegian king's emissaries [[Björn Stallare]] and [[Halte Skeggesson]] had arrived at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] of [[Uppsala]] to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]] to the king of Norway.

The Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker, who was the wisest and most respected man in Sweden.

: ''Then Thorgny stood up; and when he arose all the bondes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[yeomen]]] ''stood up who had before been sitting, and rushed together from all parts to listen to what Lagman Thorgny would say. At first there was a great din of people and weapons; but when the noise was settled into silent listening, Thorgny made his speech.''
::''The disposition of Swedish kings is different now from what it has been formerly. My grandfather Thorgny could well remember the Upsala king [[Eirik Eymundson]], and used to say of him that when he was in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself [[Finland]], [[Karelia|Kirjalaland]], [[Courland]], [[Estonia]], and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything to say to him. My father, again, was a long time with King [[Björn (III) Eriksson|Bjorn]], and was well acquainted with his ways and manners. In Bjorn's lifetime his kingdom stood in great power, and no kind of want was felt, and he was gay and sociable with his friends. I also remember King [[Eric the Victorious|Eirik the Victorious]], and was with him on many a war-expedition. He enlarged the Swedish dominion, and defended it manfully; and it was also easy and agreeable to communicate our opinions to him. But the king we have now got allows no man to presume to talk with him, unless it be what he desires to hear. On this alone he applies all his power, while he allows his scat-lands'' [territories paying protection money to the Swedes] ''in other countries to go from him through laziness and weakness. He wants to have the Norway kingdom laid under him, which no Swedish king before him ever desired, and therewith brings war and distress on many a man. Now it is our will, we bondes, that thou [[Olof Skötkonung|King Olaf]] make peace with the Norway king, [[Olaf the Thick]], and marry thy daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter|Ingegerd]] to him. Wilt thou, however, reconquer the kingdoms in the east countries which thy relations and forefathers had there, we will all for that purpose follow thee to the war. But if thou wilt not do as we desire, we will now attack thee, and put thee to death; for we will no longer suffer law and peace to be disturbed. So our forefathers went to work when they drowned five kings in a morass at the [[Mula-thing]], and they were filled with the same insupportable pride thou hast shown towards us. Now tell us, in all haste, what resolution thou wilt take.'' 
:''Then the whole public approved, with clash of arms and shouts, the lagman's speech.''

These arguments convinced the king to give in and he promised to have peace with the king of Norway and to give him his daughter. However, he later broke his promise.

In ''[[Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa]]'' about [[Styrbjörn Starke]], appears a Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker who is probably the father of the previously mentioned Þorgnýr. This Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker was very old and almost blind and so he could not take part in the battle between [[Eric the Victorious]] and Styrbjörn. Still he influenced the course of battle by having cattle and horses driven against the Danish army. These animals were harnessed with spears and spikes and caused many casualties in Styrbjörn's army. This Þorgnýr is also mentioned in ''[[Hróa þáttr heimska]]'' as a wise and just old man.

A food environment is the "physical presence of food that affects a person’s diet, a person’s proximity to food store locations, the distribution of food stores, food service, and any physical entity by which food may be obtained, or a connected system that allows access to food".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/healthtopics/healthyfood/general.htm|title=CDC - Healthy Places - Healthy Food - General Food Environment Resources|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the food environment the citizens are encompassed in makes it far too hard to choose healthy foods, and all too easy to choose unhealthy foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/food-environment-and-obesity/|title=Toxic Food Environment|date=2012-10-21|work=Obesity Prevention Source|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some call this food environment "'toxic' because of the way it corrodes healthy lifestyles and promotes obesity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/food-environment-and-obesity/|title=Toxic Food Environment|date=2012-10-21|work=Obesity Prevention Source|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Toxic Foods .jpg|thumb]]
The term '''toxic food environment''' was coined by [[Kelly D. Brownell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.activistfacts.com/person/1289-kelly-brownell/|title=Kelly Brownell {{!}} Biography, quotes, etc. {{!}} Activist FactsActivist Facts|work=Activist Facts|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his book, ''Food Fight: The Inside Story of the Food Industry''  which describes American culture at the end of the 20th century as one that fosters and promotes obesity and unprecedented food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Food_Fight.html?id=Zs4QWm9kaosC|title=Food Fight|last=Brownell|first=Kelly|last2=Horgen|first2=Katherine Battle|date=2003-09-22|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071435673|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brownell is a [[Yale]] professor &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanford.duke.edu/people/faculty/brownell-kelly-d|title=Brownell, Kelly D. {{!}} Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy|website=sanford.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and director of the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale]].

He uses the term “toxic” to describe unparalleled exposure to high-calorie, high-fat, heavily marketed, inexpensive, and readily accessible foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Food_Fight.html?id=Zs4QWm9kaosC|title=Food Fight|last=Brownell|first=Kelly|last2=Horgen|first2=Katherine Battle|date=2003-09-22|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071435673|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The toxic environment is the result of ubiquity of unhealthy, processed foods, an increasingly [[sedentary lifestyle]] in which individuals spend more time watching TV and using computers than they spend exercising, the explosion of fast food restaurants, the enormous growth of portion sizes, the power of food advertising and marketing, and the junk food industry’s takeover of schools by selling unhealthy items in vending machines, cafeterias, and through school fundraisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.activistfacts.com/person/1289-kelly-brownell/|title=Kelly Brownell {{!}} Biography, quotes, etc. {{!}} Activist FactsActivist Facts|work=Activist Facts|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main contributor to the notion of a toxic food environment is the marketing of it. Finding an advertisement that promotes “toxic” is not a difficult task. The Federal Trade Commission found, in 2008, that the food industry spent almost $10 billion per year on marketing food and beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/food-environment-and-obesity/|title=Toxic Food Environment|date=2012-10-21|work=Obesity Prevention Source|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; And that $10 million was just the amount for the marketing that appealed to children. Marketing for “toxic” food has infused the consumption of unhealthy, processed food into US culture.

Brownell and many of his colleagues attribute the nation’s obesity epidemic to the toxic environment.  In 1995, the Institute of Medicine noted that the human gene pool has not undergone any real change over the past several decades when obesity has been on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343651/|title=International Summit on Human Gene Editing: A Global Discussion|last=Olson|first=Steven|last2=Committee on Science|first2=Technology|last3=Affairs|first3=Policy and Global|last4=National Academies of Sciences|first4=Engineering|date=2016-01-01|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the root of the obesity crisis must lie in the environment—the social and cultural forces that promote an over-abundance of food and eating, and a deficit of physical activity.

Other factors can affect poor eating habits. Having personal issues that can affect your mood can bring your appetite down and promote a bad diet. An example would be: Depression, anxiety, and family issues. These factors can affect poor eating habits that cause a malnourished lifestyle which leads to a toxic food environment. Other factors may include laziness, and not having an active lifestyle. These factors can lead to obesity and other health risks.

'''Trooping the Colour''' is a ceremony performed by [[regiment]]s of the [[British Army|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth armies]]. It has been a tradition of British [[infantry]] regiments since the 17th century, although the roots go back much earlier. On battlefields, a regiment's [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]], or flags, were used as rallying points. Consequently, regiments would have their [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]s slowly march with their colours between the soldiers' ranks to enable soldiers to recognise their regiments' colours.

Since 1748, Trooping the Colour has also marked the [[Queen's Official Birthday|official birthday of the British sovereign]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trooping-the-colour.co.uk/ Trooping The Colour] at [http://www.turnipnet.com/ Turnipnet's] British Military Ceremonial website&lt;/ref&gt; It is held in London annually on a Saturday in June on [[Horse Guards Parade]] by [[St. James's Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/TroopingtheColour/TroopingtheColour.aspx Trooping the Colour] at the British Monarchy official website&lt;/ref&gt; and coincides with the publication of the [[Birthday Honours]] List. Among the audience are the Royal Family, invited guests, ticket holders and the general public. The ceremony is broadcast live by the [[BBC]] within the UK and is also shown in [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]], and since 2018, has been streamed online to viewers all over the world, via the ''Time'' magazine YouTube channel and the Facebook page of the British newspaper ''The Telegraph'', with the Associated Press providing live video coverage of the event.

The Queen travels down [[The Mall, London|the Mall]] from [[Buckingham Palace]] in a royal procession with a sovereign's escort of [[Household Cavalry]] (mounted troops or horse guards). After receiving a royal salute, she inspects her troops of the [[Household Division#United Kingdom|Household Division]], both [[foot guards]] and [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment|horse guards]], and the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]]. Each year, one of the foot-guards regiments is selected to troop its colour through the ranks of guards. Then the entire Household Division assembly conducts a march past the Queen, who receives a salute from the saluting base. Parading with its guns, the King's Troop takes precedence as the mounted troops perform a walk-march and trot-past.

The music is provided by the massed bands of the foot guards and the mounted Band of the Household Cavalry, together with a [[Corps of Drums]], and occasionally pipers, totalling approximately 400 musicians.

Returning to Buckingham Palace, the Queen watches a further march-past from outside the gates. Following a 41-[[gun salute]] by the King's Troop in [[Green Park]], she leads the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] on to the palace balcony for a [[Royal Air Force]] [[flypast]].

==Regimental colours==
{{main|Colours, standards and guidons}}
{{unreferenced section|date = June 2015}}
A regiment's colours embody its spirit and service, as well as its fallen soldiers. The loss of a colour, or the capture of an enemy colour, were respectively considered the greatest shame, or the greatest glory on a battlefield. Consequently, regimental colours are venerated by officers and soldiers of all ranks, second to the sovereign.

Only battalions of infantry regiments of the line carry colours; the Royal Artillery's colours, for example, are its guns. Rifle regiments did not form a line and thus never carried colours. Their battle honours are carried on their drums. The exception to this is the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], which has both a stand of colours and guns.

Trooping the Colour is an old ceremony whereby a battalion would fall in by companies and the colour-party would "troop" or march the colours through the ranks so that every man would see that the colours were intact. This was done before and after every battle. This ceremony has been retained through time and is today largely ceremonial.

==The sovereign's official birthday==
[[File:Trooping the Colour, 1956.jpg|thumb|Trooping the Colour in 1956]]
In the United Kingdom, Trooping the Colour is also known as the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s Birthday Parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article52462.ece | location=London | work=The Sun | title=Queens birthday parade | date=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has marked the official birthday of the sovereign since 1748, and has occurred annually since 1820 (except in bad weather, periods of mourning and other exceptional circumstances). From the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], the sovereign has taken the salute in person. It was Edward VII who moved Trooping the Colour to its June date, because of the vagaries of British weather (his actual birthday being in November). From 1979 to 2017 [[List of Trooping the Colour by date, regiment and sovereign from 1890|it was always held on the Saturday falling between 11–17 June]]; however, the date announced for 2018 fell on 9 June.&lt;ref&gt;Date announced on [http://www.householddivision.org.uk/trooping-the-colour Household Division website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Date announced at [https://changing-guard.com/ceremonial/trooping-the-colour.html Changing Guard website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Trooping the Colour allows the troops of the [[Household Division]] to pay a personal tribute to the sovereign with great pomp and pageantry. Crowds lining the route and in [[St. James's Park]] listen to music performed by both massed and mounted [[military bands|bands]].

The Queen has attended Trooping the Colour in every year of her reign, except when prevented by a rail strike in 1955. Formerly mounted herself, she commenced riding in a carriage in 1987. On 13 June 1981, she and her mount were startled by an unemployed youth, [[Marcus Sarjeant]], who fired six blank rounds from a starting revolver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/13/newsid_2512000/2512333.stm 1981: Queen shot at by youth] at [[BBC]] 'On this day'—13 June&lt;/ref&gt;

In her years attending on horseback, Her Majesty, as Colonel-in-Chief, wore a [[biretta]] and a Guards Regiment uniform with the medals she was awarded before becoming Queen ([[Order of the Crown of India]]; [[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]]; [[War Medal 1939–1945]]; [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]]; [[King George VI Coronation Medal]]; [[Canadian Forces Decoration]]) and the riband and star of the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle]] or a combination of those orders, depending which regiment was trooping its colour. Since 1987, she has not worn uniform, but wears the Brigade of Guards badge, a large brooch representing the different regiments that participate (Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Welsh Guards, Irish Guards, and Scots Guards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brigade of Guards brooch|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/sunday-brooch-guards-badge.html|publisher=Order of Splendor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 80th birthday in 2006 was marked by a large [[flypast]] of 40 planes led by the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]] and culminating with the [[Red Arrows]]. It was followed by the first [[feu de joie]] ("fire of joy") fired in her presence during her reign, a second being fired at her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. In 2008, a flypast of 55 aircraft commemorated the [[RAF]]'s 90th anniversary.

===Rehearsals===
The Unit presenting the Colours usually commences Troop practice in April provided that the company does not have other prior military operations. The entire parade will rehearse in [[Uniforms of the British Army|full dress]] at [[Horse Guards Parade]] before the Major General's Review, such rehearsals are referred to as Guard Mount from Horse Guards. The Major General's Review and the Colonel's Review are scheduled on the Saturdays two and one weeks preceding the Queen's Birthday Parade respectively. The salute is taken, respectively, by the [[Major-General commanding the Household Division]] and the Colonel of the Regiment which is trooping its colour.

==Trooping the Colour: participants and parade summary==
[[Image:Soldiers Trooping the Colour, 16th June 2007.jpg|thumb|left|A company of [[Welsh Guards]], recognisable by the leeks on their collars and five-button groupings on their jackets, denoting their status as the most junior of the five Foot Guards regiments.]]
On the day of Trooping the Colour, the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]] is flown from [[Buckingham Palace]] and from Horse Guards Building, while the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]] (colloquially known as the Union Jack), is flown from public buildings as well as the flags of the British Commonwealth of Nations, especially in recent years.

'''&lt;big&gt;Participants and positioning:&lt;/big&gt;'''

===Foot Guards, including Escort to the Colour (No 1 Guard)===
''Nos 1-6 Guards'' - six companies of [[Foot Guards]], each comprising 3 officers and 71 other ranks &lt;ref&gt;Major or Captain, two Subalterns&lt;/ref&gt; - line two sides of the perimeter of [[Horse Guards Parade]] in an extended "L" shape. This recalls the defensive formation known as the "[[hollow square]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trooping-the-colour.co.uk/trooping/marchon.htm|title=March On|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All six companies are collectively commanded as "Guards..." and individually by company number, e.g., "No. 3 Guard..." Up to eight Guards have taken part, the number varying over the years: six in 1939, five in 1954, seven from 1963 to 1967, and then eight until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;p.83 Gow, Michael ''Trooping the Colour: A History of the Sovereign's Birthday Parade'' 1988 Souviner Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[battalion]] trooping its colour in any given year is No. 1 Guard. During the parade, they are referred to as 'Escort for the Colour' (and, once they have collected their colour during the ceremony, as 'Escort to the Colour').

At the outset, the colour is held by the Colour Party - a colour sergeant and two other guardsmen of No. 1 Guards, standing well-spaced on the northern side of Horse Guards Parade. Once obtained by the [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] of No. 1 Guard, the colour is borne through the ranks of Nos 2-6 Guards by an Ensign of No. 1 Guard. It is a great honour for a young officer to carry the colour in this ceremony, as historically only the most courageous [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]s were assigned to carry the regiment's colours in battle. Nowadays the honour is normally given to [[second lieutenant]]s who excel at [[parade (military)|drill]] and ceremonial and who are physically fit.

===Mounted troops and Sovereign's Escort===
Lining the edge of [[St. James's Park]] are the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment]] - the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] and the [[Blues and Royals]] - as well as the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]].

In the Royal Procession, the Household Cavalry are termed Sovereign's Escort. Two divisions ride ahead of the Queen's carriage and two behind it, and the Life Guards and Blues and Royals alternate these positions each year.

===Commanding officers===
Three mounted officers drawn from No 1 Guard give drill commands during the parade. The most senior is the [[Field Officer in Brigade Waiting]] (rank of Lieutenant Colonel), assisted by the Major of the Parade. The Field Officer occupies a central position on the parade ground. The third mounted officer is the [[Adjutant]].

The [[Garrison Sergeant Major]] of [[London District (British Army)|London District]], who is not mounted, coordinates the whole event on the parade ground and the approach road from [[The Mall, London|The Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ceremonial for the Army 2008 Amdt 2|year=2008|publisher=British Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military bands===
With almost 300 musicians on the field, led by the massed [[military band]]s of the Household Division, the music forms an integral part of the day. The massed bands of the [[Foot Guards]] number over 200 musicians. Joining them, since 2014, is the Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry, formed by the 2 merged Household Cavalry bands. There is also a [[Corps of Drums]] from several of the regiments and, on some occasions, [[pipe band]]s of the [[Scots Guards]] and [[Irish Guards]].

[[File:Trooping the Colour.JPG|thumb|right|Musicians of the [[Foot Guards]] marching along [[The Mall, London|the Mall]], June 2012.]]

===Summary of the parade design===
The entire parade is best understood as an exercise of several elements carried out in slow and quick march time, with the Trooping the Colour phase forming the centrepiece.

* The Queen inspects first the [[Foot Guards]] and then the [[Household Cavalry]] and [[King's Troop]], to slow and quick march music respectively.
* Then the massed bands "troop" before the Queen in slow and quick time. A lone drummer breaks away.
* Drummer's Call signals No. 1 Guard - the Escort for the Colour - to march to the centre of the field and obtain their colour from the Colour Party. The massed bands execute the "[[Spin Wheel]]" manoeuvre.
* As "Escort to the Colour", No. 1 Guard then slowly troops its regimental colour through the ranks of Guards Nos. 6-2.
* After forming divisions, Nos. 1-6 Guards march past the Queen in slow and quick time.
* To music from the mounted band, the [[King's Troop]] leads the [[Household Cavalry]] past the Queen, first in walk-march and then in sitting-trot (i.e., slow and quick time for the horses). The mounted band then salute the Queen as they walk off.
* Finally, led by the Sovereign's Escort, the massed bands play the Queen back to Buckingham Palace, the foot guards following.

==The Queen's Birthday Parade in detail==
The entire parade is supervised by the [[Field Officer in Brigade Waiting]] (sometimes shortened to "Field Officer"), with the assistance of the [[Second-in-Command|Brigade Major]] and the [[Adjutant]], all on horseback, and joined by the London District Garrison Sergeant Major, who is unmounted and coordinates the proceedings of the ceremony.

=== March on ===
[[Image:Marker on Horseguards.jpg|thumb|Part of the Marker Detail marching at end of parade.]]

A detail of guardsmen bearing marker flags marches on, to mark the positions of Nos. 1-6 Guards. (These marker flags are the respective company colours from each regiment.)

Preceded by their regimental bands, Nos. 1-6 Guards march into position. No. 1 Guard is "Escort for the Colour."

*Nos. 1-5 Guards align in two ranks on the west side of the parade ground facing Horse Guards Building.
*No. 6 Guard lines up perpendicular to them on the north side, thus making an "L" shape.&lt;ref&gt;Up to eight Guards companies may take part. Nos. 7 and 8 Guards, if present, would line up next to No. 6 Guard. In 2009, to reflect the successful recruitment efforts of the Irish Guards, there were seven companies of Guards on the field. BBC1 television commentary, 13 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*The massed bands are on the south side, by the gardens of [[10 Downing Street]].
*Adjacent to No. 6 Guard is the Colour Party made up of 3 soldiers. A snare drummer joins them in the march on. As the party takes its place the drummer marches off and the colour's casing is removed, revealing the colour to be trooped.
*The King's Troop, the Household Cavalry, and their mounted band form up behind Nos. 1-5 Guards.&lt;ref&gt;2011 marked the first time that the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery did not attend the ceremony since its first appearance in 1997.  Instead, they performed the gun salutes on the anniversary of the Queen's coronation (2 June) and on the Duke of Edinburgh's birthday the day before. The job of handling the salutes was entrusted to the Honourable Artillery Company in the Tower of London grounds with a 62-gun Royal Salute as per tradition.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the foot guards in their home service order and the mounted band in state dress uniform, the assembled ranks of Household Division make a colourful spectacle.

Guards half-companies line up on the road to Horse Guards Parade to provide security to the Royal Family that will arrive later and to the marching and mounted contingents.

===Arrival of the sovereign===

[[File:Royal carriage, Trooping the Colour.JPG|thumb|right|Carriage carrying the Duchesses of Cornwall and Cambridge and Prince Harry, June 2013.]]
Preceding the sovereign, senior members of the [[Royal Family]], in attendance but not on parade, arrive in [[barouche]]s to view the ceremony from a central first floor window in the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]'s former office in [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] Building. This procession turns at the [[Guards Memorial]], and No. 3 Guard has opened ranks to allow their carriages to pass.   
[[Image:ElizabethIItroopingcolour.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] riding to Trooping the Colour for the last time in 1986 on her horse [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]]. Since then, she has travelled in a carriage of the [[Royal Mews]].]]
Preceded by the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment|Sovereign's Escort]], the Queen (Colonel-in-Chief) journeys from Buckingham Palace down [[The Mall (London)|the Mall]], in the [[Glass coach]].&lt;ref&gt;From 1987 until 2011, Queen Victoria's 1842 ivory-mounted [[phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]] was used; the phaeton is on display in the [[Royal Mews]]. Prior to that, the Queen rode horseback. Until 2017, the Queen was accompanied by the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], but he has  retired from carrying out royal duties.&lt;/ref&gt; Directly behind the Queen in the Royal Procession ride the [[Royal Colonels]] (the [[Prince of Wales]] (Welsh Guards), [[Duke of Kent]] (Scots Guards), [[Princess Royal]] (Blues and Royals), [[Duke of York]] (Grenadier Guards) and the [[Duke of Cambridge]] (Irish Guards)) followed by the non-royal Colonels of Regiments (those of the Coldstream Guards and the Life Guards). Other officers of the [[Household Division]] and of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] follow, all mounted, including the [[Master of the Horse]], the [[Major-General commanding the Household Division]] with his [[Chief of staff]] and [[Aide-de-camp]], [[Silver Stick]]-in-Waiting, the regimental [[Adjutant]]s and a number of the Queen's [[Equerry|Equerries]].

As the carriage arrives on Horse Guards Parade, the Royal Standard is prepared to be released and flown from the roof of [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]]. As the carriage passes behind the colour to the trooped, the head coachman, whip in hand, renders honours to it. The Queen alights at the Saluting Base to start the ceremonies.

The Field Officer commences the Parade with the command: "Guards - Royal Salute - Present Arms!" and the [[national anthem]] ([[God Save The Queen]]) is played by the Household Division's Foot Guards Massed Bands, led by the Senior Director of Music of the Household Division. Simultaneously, the Royal Standard is formally released and flies from the Horse Guards flagpole. This tradition was broken in the 2015 parade, as the salute and the playing of the National Anthem happened as the Queen approached the Saluting Base together with the Duke of Edinburgh, while the Royal Standard was released at the same time.

===Inspection of the line===
[[Image:Trooping the Colour Inspection.JPG|thumb|250px|The Queen inspects the foot guards, the Royal Colonels following her. Foreground: backs of No. 6 Guard. Background: garden of 10 Downing Street and massed bands.]]  
The Queen re-enters the carriage and is driven before and behind the long line of assembled guards, with the Royal Colonels following. [[BBC]] television commentaries every year emphasise the Queen's knowledge of the attributes of her guards, and single out "steadiness" as a highly prized quality for a guardsman.

The accompanying marches always carry a flavour of the regiment whose colour is being trooped, lending the royal inspection a unique atmosphere. For example, if the Welsh Guards are trooping their colour, the music will include their traditional regimental march, ''[[Men of Harlech]]''. While the Queen passes the six companies of foot guards on her left, a slow march or [[Air (music)|air]] is played. Once the [[phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]] turns around the rear of No. 6 Guard, the music changes to a quick march. The Queen is conveyed back up the line, passing the Household Cavalry and King's Troop stationed on her right, with the head coachman saluting the Sovereign's Standard of the Household Cavalry and the lead gun of the King's Troop in quick succession with a whip. The inspection completed, the music ceases, and she is conveyed back to the saluting base.

=== Massed bands troop ===

[[Image:Band Trooping the Colour, 16th June 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Massed bands of the foot guards, 16 June 2007]]
With the Queen once more seated at the saluting base, the command "Troop!" is given by the Field Officer. This is not to be confused with the trooping of the colour itself, which occurs later in the ceremony. Three strikes on a [[bass drum]] give the signal for the Massed Bands to start their march.

The Guards, after standing at attention, change arms. Under the command of the [[drum major|Senior Drum Major]], the Massed Bands march and countermarch on Horse Guards Parade in slow and quick time. The slow march music is traditionally the Waltz from ''[[Les Huguenots]]''. During the quick march, a lone drummer from the Corps of Drums breaks away from the massed bands, marching to two paces to the right of No. 1 Guard to take his post while the band marches on, stopping just near the colour party.

The Trooping of the Colour phase of the ceremony is initiated by the lone drummer's eight-bar "Drummer's Call", signalling the [[Captain (land)|Captain]] of No. 1 Guard to cede his command to the [[Subaltern]] of No.1 Guard. It slopes arms, while the Field Officer directs the other companies present to change arms and stand at ease. The call having been sounded, the lone drummer returns to the Massed Bands.

=== Escort for the Colour obtains the colour ===
[[Image:The Colour Hand Over.jpg|left|thumb|250px|In the centre, holding his sword and the Colour, the Regimental Sgt-Major of No. 1 Guard. Behind him, wearing a white flag belt, the Ensign waits to receive the Colour, standing in front of No. 1 Guard. To the right, the Massed Bands.]]  
As Escort for the Colour, No. 1 Guard performs the centrepiece of the parade.

An orderly takes the [[pace stick]] from the Regimental Sergeant-Major (RSM), positioned behind the Escort for the Colour, thus freeing the RSM to draw his sword - the only time a British Army infantry [[warrant officer]] ever does so on parade. The Subaltern then commands No. 1 Guard to move into close order, and then dresses it. Then, led by the Subaltern with the Ensign following, and with the Regimental Sergeant-Major marching behind the company, the Escort for the Colour quick marches onto the field to "[[The British Grenadiers]]". (This tune is always used irrespective of which regiment's colour is being trooped, because the right flank of every battalion used to be a grenadier company.) A guardsman behind the colour party marches forward towards the Colour Sergeant of the colour party at the same time during the Escort approaching then hands over the rifle to the Colour Sergeant, salutes the colour and leaves the parade ground. The Escort marks time while the Massed Bands "clear the line of march" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trooping-the-colour.co.uk/trooping/trooping.htm|title=Trooping of the Colour|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and move to the front of the Guards and mark time. Fifteen steps away from the Colour Party, the music halts and four paces later, the 'Escort for the Colour' halts in place, and is ordered to open ranks and dressed, followed by the Massed Bands making an about turn.

The guards are then called to attention and then change and slope arms under the direction of the Field Officer, while the Household Cavalry are also called to attention by the commander of the Sovereign's Escort.

The RSM marches around to the front of the Escort and, followed by the Ensign, approaches the Colour Party. Having saluted the colour with his sword, the Sergeant-Major takes it from the Colour Sergeant, freeing him to change and then slope arms. The RSM turns, marches to the Ensign, and presents the colour to him. The Ensign salutes the colour with his sword, sheathes the sword without taking his eyes off the colour, and takes possession of it.

Having obtained their colour, No. 1 Guard (formerly known as "Escort ''for'' the Colour") is now termed "Escort ''to'' the Colour." By then, the massed bands, now with the line cleared, face front, with the Corps of Drums, pipe bands and the senior director of music leading.

=== The Escort positions itself to troop its colour ===
To the first six bars of "God Save the Queen", the Escort to the Colour presents arms; simultaneously, turning outward at an angle of 45°, the NCOs (non-commissioned officers) at the four corners (or flanks) of the Escort port arms, as symbolic maximum protection for the colour.

The Escort to the Colour and Colour Party slope arms. The Colour Sergeant marches to the right and to the rear of the Escort. Once the Colour Party, Ensign and Regimental Sergeant-Major have joined the Escort, the RSM repositions himself to the left of and behind the Escort. The Subaltern then orders the Escort to change arms and orders the slow march.

==== Spinwheel of the massed bands ====
As the Escort to the Colour slow-marches down the field towards No. 6 Guard to begin their colour trooping, the massed bands perform their unique anti-clockwise "spinwheel" manoeuvre. This, a 90° turn in restricted space, is performed while playing the slow march "Escort to the Colour."

Prime responsibility for the celebrated spinwheel, which is largely individual and instinctive, rests with the [[Garrison Sergeant Major]].  &lt;blockquote&gt;A 'wheel' is not an easy manoeuvre with even a small body of troops, and with a block of 400 men the normal wheel is impossible. The massed band therefore pivots on its own centre, so that certain outer ranks and files march long distances in a hurry while the centre and inner ranks loiter with extreme intent, or merely mark time. Yet others not only step sideways but backwards as well. This highly complex movement is called a 'spin-wheel', the details of which can be found in no drill book or manual of ceremonial. Its complexity defies description, and if the truth were known, many of the participants know not whither they go or, on arrival, how they got there. The spin-wheel is almost an art form and each performance of it, although similar in essentials, is different in detail. Most of the performers are adjusting their actions to suit the needs of the spin-wheel of the moment, having adjusted their movements quite otherwise on other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Lieutenant-Colonel Rodney Bashford (former (1960-1970) Director of Music for the Grenadier Guards), quoted on {{cite web|url=http://www.trooping-the-colour.co.uk/trooping/trooping.htm#spin/|title=The Massed Bands' Spin-Wheel manoeuvre|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
   
Once the Escort reaches the edge of No. 6 Guard, the music stops, and the [[Field Officer in Brigade Waiting]] orders the entire parade (except the Escort) to present arms as the trooping proper starts. The music changes to "The Grenadiers' Slow March."

===Trooping the colour through the ranks===
To the strains of the Grenadiers Slow March, the Escort to the Colour then troops the colour down the long line of Nos 6-2 Guards. The colour itself is borne by the Ensign in front of the line of guards, but the ranks of the Escort interweave with their ranks. For Nos 6-2 Guards, who maintain the 'present arms' position, the long trooping, especially on a hot day, requires stamina.&lt;ref&gt;When the colour passes the spectators, members of the British and foreign armed services, and military attachés of the [[diplomatic corps]] salute the colour, as is customary in the British Army.&lt;/ref&gt; As this is done the Massed Bands move back in slow time to their original places.

Eventually the Escort arrives back at its original position as no. 1 Guard - from where it first marched off in quick time. Their Captain, who had temporarily ceded his command to the Subaltern, resumes his command over No. 1 Guard by ordering them to present arms, thus bringing the Escort back in line with Nos 2-6 Guards. The entire parade is now ordered by the Field Officer to slope arms, thus concluding the trooping phase.

The trooping phase is followed by the march-past in slow and quick time of the foot guards and then the Household Cavalry and King's Troop, also in slow and quick time.

=== Preparing for the march-past ===
[[File:Trooping the Colour form march past.JPG|thumb|right|From front to back: Guards Nos. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in ranks of two. Background at left: massed bands.]]
The Field Officer gives the command, "Officers, take post." Nos 1 to 5 Guard then "retire", about-turning and right-forming into review formation. Nos 1 to 5 Guard then about-turn again as the [[Corps of Drums]] play. Since No. 6 Guard is already standing at right angles to the other five companies it does not need to execute this movement, but instead it moves close-order position then to the right in threes after Nos 1 to 5 Guards turn back to advance position .&lt;ref&gt;Also, as No. 6 Guard is always formed on the left of the line by the Coldstream Guards if present, by tradition they do not recognize the command to "retire".&lt;/ref&gt;

Once intervals are established, the Field Officer salutes the Queen and informs her that the foot guards are ready to march past, then commands, "Guards will march past in slow and quick time. Slow march." No. 6 Guard will left turn to be advance and then form two ranks on Marching after the parade has started to execute the slow march.

=== Foot guards march past in slow and quick time ===
[[Image:March Past in Slow Time.jpg|thumb|right|Footguards march past in Slow Time at the Colonel's Review in 2008]]
No. 1 Guard - the Escort - leads the six companies for two circuits of Horse Guards Parade, saluting the Queen as they pass. The corners of the field are negotiated with the complex Left Form manoeuvre. Commands of "Change direction - left!" are then followed by the Left Guide (or Right Guide) of each Guard signalling "Right Sir!" to the Captain that the company has reached the position, the Captain will immediately orders "Left...Form!"&lt;ref&gt;See video of "Left Form" at {{cite web| url=http://www.trooping-the-colour.co.uk/trooping/marchpast.htm|title=The March Past of the Footguards|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of both the slow and quick march-past, the Field Officer rides out to salute the Queen with his sword, telling her that her Majesty's Guards have ended their march-past.

====Slow march-past====
Neutral slow marches start and conclude this section. The guards are preceded past the saluting base by the [[Field Officer in Brigade Waiting|Field Officer]] and the [[Second-in-Command|Major of the Parade]], who salute the Queen with their swords and eyes right.

To the strains of their distinctive regimental slow marches, each of Nos. 1-6 Guards passes before the Queen with their eyes right, their regimental officers saluting with swords. The leading company, No. 1 Guard - the Escort to the Colour - has a particular honour. The Ensign lowers the colour - the 'flourish'. The Queen acknowledges it with a bow of the head, and the [[Royal Colonels]] salute the colour. Once past the saluting base, the colour is raised again - the 'recover' - and "eyes front" is ordered.

Each company's salute is acknowledged by the Queen, the Duke, and the Royal Colonels.

====Quick march-past====
For this circuit, the colour is at the rear of the Escort (No. 1 Guard), protected by the Colour Party.  Their regimental quick marches are played as each guard passes before the Queen with eyes right.&lt;ref&gt;When the Scots or Irish Guards troop their colours, the regimental pipers move to the front of the massed bands for the march past in quick time. If there are pipers present when another regiment troops, then the pipers remain at the rear of the massed band.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this being a quick march, the officers do not salute with swords, but only with the eyes right instead. As with the slow march-past, neutral marches start and conclude this section.

The massed bands, led by the Corps of Drums and the pipes and drums, march away to allow the mounted bands on to the ground. By then, the foot guards have ended their march, and are now back in place and dressed.

===Mounted troops ride past===
[[Image:Troopingthecolour.jpg|thumb|left|Blues and Royals, one of the two regiments of the Household Cavalry, in their characteristic red plumes and dark blue uniforms.]]
The now sole Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry in state dress, led by the two drum horses&lt;ref&gt;The kettledrum players must manoeuvre the reins of the drum horses with their feet&lt;/ref&gt; representing the two constituent regiments of the Household Cavalry, and the Director of Music of the Household Cavalry, ride slowly on to the field, traditionally to the tune "Preobrajensky."

It is the turn of Household Cavalry and King's Troop to complete two circuits of Horse Guards Parade. For the horses, slow and quick time correspond to a walk-march and a sitting-trot, respectively. Since 1997, the mounted contingent is led by the commander of the King's Troop and then by the Sovereign's Escort commander.

In both turns of the ride past the Foot Guards present arms as per the Field Officer's orders.

====Walk-march====
Salutes are again given to the Queen, and returned by her and the Royal Colonels to the colours as they pass by.

The Royal Horse Artillery, marching to the "Royal Artillery Slow March" and then the "March from ''Aida''", is first, taking precedence over all other units when on parade with its guns. When the King's Troop passes the saluting base, the Queen acknowledges the leading gun as the colour.

The Life Guards, in red jackets and white plumes, are next, followed by the Blues and Royals, in blue jackets and red plumes. The sequence of regimental marches is: "Life Guards' Slow March", followed by "Blues and Royals' Slow March", and then "The Royals."

Riding at the rear of the Household Cavalry are the [[farrier]]s, one for each regiment, carrying their glinting axes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.householdcavalry.info/horses.html#farrier The Farrier] at Household Cavalry Information (non-official)&lt;/ref&gt; and flanked by a soldier of each regiment. (The Life Guards farrier wears a black plume rather than the usual regimental white.)

The two Household Cavalry regiments take turns to parade and the job of parading the Queen's Cavalry Standard of either of the two regiments alternates yearly between the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals. As the standard passes by, it is flourished in the presence of the Queen, the Duke and the Royal Colonels and after walking past them is recovered.

====Trot-past====
A state trumpeter of either of the two Household Cavalry regiments plays "The Trot" to signal the beginning of the sitting trot-past.  "[[The Keel Row]]" is traditionally played, and much dust is raised by the horses. Both the King's Troop's lead gun and the Queen's Cavalry Standard are trotted in the presence of the Queen and the Royal Colonels as they salute them.

As the trot-past ends the mounted band salutes the Queen, the drumhorse riders crossing their drumsticks above their heads. They then proceed back to the east side of Horse Guards Parade and halt in place.

===Preparing for march-off===

[[File:King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery.JPG|thumb|left|Members of King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, returning along [[The Mall, London|the Mall]].]]

Their director of music turns inwards on his horse as a signal to the Field Officer that the Household Cavalry and the King's Troop are now in position to formally end the proceedings under the command of the Field Officer.

During the final Royal Salute, as the parade renders their birthday wishes from all 7 regiments of the Household Division to their colonel-in-chief, the colour of No. 1 Guard is lowered to the ground by the Ensign while "God Save the Queen" is played by the Massed Bands. Forming divisions once more, accompanied by the Corps of Drums, the guards prepare to march off, and the Household Cavalry and the King's Troop leave the field. The Field Officer, after forming the parade for the march-off, then rides towards the saluting base, informing the Queen that the guards are ready to march off the field while the RSM of the Escort returns his sword into his scabbard as an orderly returns to him his pace stick.

The [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]] leaves Horse Guards Parade and proceeds to [[Green Park]] (adjacent to Buckingham Palace) to formally commence the royal 41-gun [[Gun salute|salute]]. At the same time in the Tower of London, the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] takes its positions in the tower grounds for the special 62-gun salute that will be happen when the Queen arrives. This gun salute is only done by the HAC during royal anniversaries.

===Marching off===
[[File:Trooping the Colour.JPG|thumb]]
Led by the massed bands, the Queen places herself at the head of her foot guards. The entire parade of 1,000 soldiers and 400 musicians marches up the Mall towards Buckingham Palace. The Markers then march off the grounds carrying the regimental company colours on the marker flags. The King's Troop and the HAC, now in place, get ready to commence firing their respective gun salutes during the Royal Family's arrival at the palace. At the same time, the old and new Queen's Guards, now performing the Changing of the Guard in the palace forecourt at the same time as the ceremony being done, also prepare for the royal carriages' arrival and to salute the Queen on her carriage when she arrives.

==After the ceremony==
[[File:Royal family on the balcony.JPG|thumb|Balcony appearance by the Royal Family following the 2012 Trooping the Colour.]]
[[File:Red Arrows June 2013.JPG|thumb|Red Arrows flypast after the ceremony, 15 June 2013]]

When the Queen returns to [[Buckingham Palace]], the first division of the Escort to the Colour forms into two detachments of the new guard and enters the forecourt, opposite the old guard; but unlike the usual [[Queen's Guard#Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace and The Tower of London|Changing of the Guard]], the Regimental Sergeant Major participates in the ceremony. The  remainder of the guards perform a march-past outside the gateway, in quick time instead of the usual slow time, with the Queen, positioned before the central gateway, receiving their salute. As the guards march past, their regimental marches are played by the massed and mounted bands respectively. The rest of the [[Royal Family]] observes the march-past from the balcony.

The Queen's carriage passes into the palace between the Old and New Guards, with both guards saluting her. The usual semi-daily [[Guard Mounting|Changing of the Guard]] continues on the forecourt of the palace.

The gun salutes begin on the arrival of the Queen at Buckingham Palace, with the King's Troop firing a 41-gun royal salute in [[Green Park]] and the Honourable Artillery Company firing a 62-gun royal salute from the Tower of London grounds.

Finally, the Queen and the Royal Family on the palace balcony witness a [[flypast]] by the Royal Air Force, often featuring the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]] and the [[Red Arrows]]. This is once again followed by the National Anthem and in special years, a [[feu de joie]] followed by the shouting of the three cheers to the Queen on behalf of the entire Household Division.

Since 1993, the 2nd Battalions of the [[Grenadier Guards]], [[Coldstream Guards]] and [[Scots Guards]] have been in "suspended animation" - they are represented in the parade by the three [[Guards Incremental Companies|incremental companies]]. No incremental companies, however, serve for their respective 3rd Battalions, as well as for the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Irish and Welsh Guards.

The number of soldiers participating in Trooping the Colour in London has declined over the years due to defence budget cuts in Household Division [[battalion]]s as well as the battalions' commitments to military and peacekeeping operations overseas.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Welsh Guards, prior to trooping their colour in 2006 had returned from Iraq and were scheduled to redeploy to Bosnia later that year.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives some of the units little time to practice ceremonial functions. However, the format of the ceremony has remained the same over the centuries following routines of old battle formations used in the era of musket warfare.

==Trooping the Colour in other countries==

===Australia===
In Australia the Trooping the Queen's Colour takes place annually on the Queen's Birthday Holiday by the staff cadets of [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in [[Canberra]], formerly at the RMC parade grounds and now at Rod Point at the shores of [[Lake Burley Griffin]]. The Queen's colour was trooped there for the first time on the Queen's Birthday Parade in 1956, a practice which has continued since then. Colours were first presented to the Corps of Staff Cadets by His Majesty King [[George VI]] when, as Duke of York, he visited Australia in 1927. These colours are now lodged in the college's Patterson Hall. Colours were again presented by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 10 May 1988&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/media/1998/09898.html] Department of Defence Media Release&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently on 22 October 2011 during a brief visit to Australia, coinciding with RMC Duntroon's centenary year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.defence.gov.au/2011/10/22/royal-military-college-queens-colours-parade-for-her-majesty-queen-elizabeth-ii/ Royal Military College Queen’s Colours Parade for Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326022542/http://news.defence.gov.au/2011/10/22/royal-military-college-queens-colours-parade-for-her-majesty-queen-elizabeth-ii/ |date=2012-03-26 }} Media release, Australian Department of Defence, 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Champion Company of the Corps of Staff Cadets is named after the Sovereign's Company and it carries the Queen Elizabeth II's banner, which was first presented to the Corps of Staff Cadets by Her Majesty the [[Queen Mother]] on February 26, 1958. The Sovereign's Company is entitled to carry the banner on all ceremonial parades as well as escorting the Queen's colour during the Trooping the Colour. The [[Governor-General of Australia]], being Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, is the reviewing officer of the parade, and since the move to Rod Field, has been attended by the public as well.

===Canada===
In Canada the Trooping the Colour ceremony on [[Parliament Hill]] takes place, with a trooping of the Queen's Colour, only for the Queen, members of the [[Monarchy in Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]], the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], or a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]], on [[Remembrance Day]], or in honour of the Queen's Birthday, on [[Victoria Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regions.cadets.forces.gc.ca/pac/rcis/FileLinks/JOLC-MOC%20Land%20PIP.pdf Department of National Defence; ''Cadet Instructor Cadre''; Pg. 38] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181621/http://www.regions.cadets.forces.gc.ca/pac/rcis/FileLinks/JOLC-MOC%20Land%20PIP.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New colours may also be trooped when they are presented. Colours are also trooped during unit anniversaries. In Ottawa, should any of the above be absent for the ceremony, the salute is taken by the Minister of National Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff, and the Regimental Colour is trooped instead.

In 2017, the Trooping of the Colour (officially known as the Flag Parade) was moved to September and is held annually. Around 1,000 troops take part in the parade, which is held yearly in [[Amman]], the national capital. Al Rayah Square (Square of the Emblem) was specially built for this occasion near the royal court. It stands on an area of 6,300 square metres and can host up to 5,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ar:إنشاء ميدان الراية |trans-title=Building the Square of the Emblem |url=http://islahjo.com/36282 |date=3 June 2016 |website=Islahjo.com |language=Arabic |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the parade, the King awards the Colours of the Arab Revolt to one of the army's battalions which holds it until the next Trooping the Colour.

=== Kenya ===
Kenya is one of two African countries that still practices the traditional British ceremony of Trooping the Colour.

This takes place every 12 December on [[Jamhuri Day]] (the day when Kenya became an independent nation and later a republic), but unlike the British one all the three services of the [[Kenya Defence Forces]] takes part in the Trooping the colour. The service whose battalion is trooping the colour provides number one and number two guards.

The ceremony normally begins at 11:30 after the arrival of the [[President of Kenya]], who takes the national salute. After finishing his inspection of the parade, the band plays a slow march followed with a quick march the lone drummer then breaks away to take his position beside number one guard to play the drummers call, signalling the officers of No.1 Guard to take positions to receive the colour. The escort for the colour then marches off to collect the colour as the massed KDF band plays the chosen Kenyan tune. After the hand over and as the Escort presents arms the first verse of the Kenya national anthem is played, then the escort to the colour marches off in a slow march to the tune of the British grenadier guards. The first tune normally played during the march is always 'By land and sea'.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Yang di-Pertuan Agong}}
Also part of the Commonwealth, Malaysia performs Trooping the Colours every first Saturday of June, the official birthday of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], the elected Malaysian King, in front of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the [[Raja Permaisuri Agong]], the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], the Deputy Prime Minister, and other officials of the Government, and officers of the [[Malaysian Armed Forces]], of which the King is the Commander-in-Chief as prescribed by the Malaysian Constitution of 1957 as amended.

The Malaysian trooping coincides with the publication of an Honours List for the King's Birthday on the same day. It also incorporates [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ZzqaDqht0 many elements of the British Trooping ceremony], including a Royal Procession before and after the parade, The Sovereign's Escort, Saluting Base at Merdeka Square or at the Merdeka Stadium, Royal Inspection, the duties of Field Officer, Major of the Parade and Adjutant officers and the NCO duties of Regt. Sergeant Majors and Colour Sergeants, the Royal Salute, 21-gun salutes by the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and flypasts (flying the Malaysian flag and the flags of the Armed forces). It is conducted in Malay and includes prayers, in the Islamic traditions of the Malaysian Armed Forces. Motorized vehicles are used in the Royal Procession from the [[Royal Malaysian Police]]. The main differences are that five colours are trooped, covering all three branches of the Armed Forces, and some of marches played are locally composed. This threefold representation is reflected in the composition of the Colours Party, the Escort for/to the Colours and the Massed Military Bands in attendance.

The 2014 event was held on Friday, 13 June, at Kem Perdana, [[Sungai Besi]], which was a departure from normal tradition of the Saturday troopings. This was the very first time in Malaysian history that Trooping the Colour was held on the Friday in June closest to the King's Birthday, rather than the traditional first Saturday of the month. In an old tradition which resumed in 2016 at the [[National Heroes Square (Malaysia)|National Heroes' Square, Putrajaya]], if the celebrations fall on [[Ramadan]], then the birthday parade is held on the Friday before 29 July, Heroes' Day.

For the first time in history, the traditional  Trooping the Colours was held on 19 September 2017, the Tuesday after Malaysia Day, in National Heroes' Square, Putrajaya, given the decision to move the King's Birthday to the Monday following Hari Merdeka. Thus, the Trooping the Colours in Putrajaya ends more than a month of national celebrations in honour of the anniversary of Malaysian independence in 1957 and the formation of the armed forces in 1932.

=== Malta ===
Given [[Malta]]'s history as a former British dominion, the [[Armed Forces of Malta]] performs Trooping the Colour every 13 December in celebration of Republic Day at [[St. George’s Square]] in [[Valletta]], the national capital. The salute is taken by the [[President of Malta]], who is the commander in chief of the AFM.

===Singapore===
The [[Singapore Armed Forces]] performs Trooping the Colours annually in the SAF Day Parade on 1 July. It is toned down as compared to the British version and is done after the awarding of the State Colours to the Best units of the Army, Navy and Air Force. If new Colours have been consecrated on SAF day, they are usually included in the Trooping, but if otherwise, are Trooped on a separate day. The Escorts to the Colour (No.1 Guard) are usually formed by the [[Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command]], while Nos. 2-4 Guards are composed of personnel from the SAF National Day Parade Guard of Honour Companies. Unlike the British parade, it has supporting contingents that march past as well.

The salute is taken by the [[President of Singapore]], the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], and the Chief of Defence Force, while the band in attendance is either the SAF Central Band or the SAF Ceremonial Band A (both from the [[Singapore Armed Forces Band]]s).

The No.2 Guard is usually made up of personnel from the Singapore Army's [[Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition|Best Army Unit Competition]]  winner for the current year, typically the 1st Commando Battalion, [[Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation]].

'''Tzeporah Berman''' (born February 5, 1969) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Environmentalism|environmental activist]], campaigner and writer. She is known for her role as one of the organizers of the [[Clayoquot protests|logging blockades]] in [[Clayoquot Sound]], [[British Columbia]] in 1992&amp;ndash;93. The protest against the logging of the [[temperate rainforest]] was, at the time, the largest act of [[civil disobedience]] in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="Clayoquot Sound"&gt;The Canadian Encyclopedia. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/clayoquot-sound Clayoquot Sound]. Historica Dominion. Retrieved on: 2012-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with [[Greenpeace]], Berman has helped bring the [[Clearcutting|clearcut logging]] of Canada's [[Temperate rainforest|rainforest]] to international prominence. She has worked on the [[Great Bear Rainforest]] campaign, and the [[Boreal forest|Boreal]] campaign. She is a strategic advisor on clean energy, oilsands and pipelines for many environmental, [[First Nations]] and philanthropic organizations. She has been co-director of Greenpeace International's Global Climate and Energy Program, Executive Director and Co-founder of PowerUp Canada and Co-founder and Campaign Director of ForestEthics.

In 2009, Berman served on [[British Columbia|British Columbia’s]] Green Energy Task Force. The task force, appointed by Premier [[Gordon Campbell]], was charged with making recommendations on the development of [[renewable energy]] for the province.  Berman was one of the experts in the environmental documentary [[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|''The 11th Hour'']], produced by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. She was named as one of six Canadian nominees for the [[Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship]] social entrepreneur of the year award, one of "50 Visionaries Changing the World" in ''[[Utne Reader]]'' and as "Canada's Queen of Green" in a cover story by ''[[Readers Digest]]''. She was included in the [[Royal British Columbia Museum]] permanent exhibit of “150 people who have changed the face of British Columbia.” In 2015 Berman served on the British Columbia Governments Climate Leadership Team and was appointed in 2016 to serve on the Alberta Governments Oil Sands Advisory Group as Co-Chair.  Berman was listed of one of the 35 Most Influential Women in British Columbia by BC Business Magazine and awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Law from University of British Columbia.

==Early life==
Born Susanne Faye Tzeporah Berman, she grew up in [[London, Ontario]], the third of four siblings in a middle-class Jewish family. Her father owned a small advertising company and her mother had a business that made promotional flags and pennants.&lt;ref name = Van-N09&gt;Glave, James (November 1, 2009). [http://www.vanmag.com/News_and_Features/Tzeporah_Berman_s_Green_Idea+?page=0%2C2 "Tzeporah Berman's Green Idea."] ''[[Vancouver Magazine]]''. Retrieved: 2013-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The family spent summers at her mother’s family's cottage in [[Lake of the Woods]]. Her father died when Berman was in her early teens and her mother died two years later. Her older sister, Corrine, who was then twenty, persuaded the authorities to allow the four children—including her other sister Wendy and younger brother Steven—to remain together until Corrine turned twenty-one and could assume legal custody.&lt;ref name = RD-N09&gt;Langlois, Christine (November, 2009). [http://www.tzeporahberman.com/uploads/7/7/4/2/7742276/readers_digest_nov_2009_tzeporah_berman_article.pdf “The Queen of Green.”] ''Readers Digest''. Retrieved: 2013-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Berman moved to Toronto to attend [[Ryerson University|Ryerson University's]] fashion arts design program. While she was successful in design—[[Harry Rosen]], who judged the school's final show called her a “bright light on Canada’s fashion scene”—she found a new calling and switched to environmental studies at York University.

Berman is a Professor at York University and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Law from the University of British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tzeporahberman.com/biography.html|title=Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=TzeporahBerman.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1992, Berman travelled to the [[Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park|Carmanah Valley]] on [[Vancouver Island]] to do fieldwork on threatened seabirds. The following year when she returned to continue her survey, she found that a logging crew had clear-cut the hillside. In 1993, the Clayoquot Sound Land Use Decision had granted pulp-and-paper giant [[MacMillan Bloedel]] rights to [[clearcutting|clear cut]] two thirds of a 650,000 acre lowland coastal [[temperate rainforest]]—the largest of its kind in the world. Berman joined with [[Valerie Langer]] and members of [[Friends of Clayoquot Sound]] in the growing [[Clayoquot protests]]. That summer, Friends of Clayoquot Sound and [[Greenpeace]] launched blockades against the logging. Berman came to national and international attention as one of the spokespersons for the protests, which employed nonviolent [[civil disobedience]] tactics taught in a series of peace camps in [[Tofino]] and in high-profile locations such as [[Stanley Park]] in Vancouver.&lt;ref name = Berman-2011&gt;Berman, Tzeporah, with [[Mark Leiren-Young]]. (2011). ''This Crazy Time: Living our environmental challenge''.  Toronto: Alfred A. Knopf Canada. {{ISBN|9780307399786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Saunders-M11&gt;Saunders, Doug (May 24, 2011). [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/greenpeace-tactics-not-so-clear-cut-anymore/article589576/?page=all "Greenpeace: tactics not so clear cut anymore."] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Retrieved: 2013-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The blockades lasted for five months and became the largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history; over 850 people were arrested.&lt;ref name="Clayoquot Sound"/&gt;

[[File:Tzeporah-kk-1.jpg|250px|right]] 
Berman played a key role in the negotiations between MacMillan Bloedel (now owned by [[Weyerhaeuser]]), the activists and the First Nations. MacBlo agreed to hand over its logging rights in Clayoquot Sound to native-controlled companies who would keep the [[old-growth forest]]s intact. However, the deal did nothing to end the polarization between the logging industry and the activists; clearcut logging of old growth forests in Canada continued. A poll by Greenpeace found that only 14% of Canadians supported the MacBlo deal.&lt;ref name = Saunders-M11/&gt;

By the late 1990s, Greenpeace had been successful in Europe using ad campaigns against companies engaging in practices considered damaging to the environment. In 2000, Berman co-founded [[Forestethics|ForestEthics]], a group devoted to using tactics that would convince companies to change their ways or risk loss of sales. One of Berman's first successful actions was the [[Victoria’s Secret]] campaign. The company had been printing a million copies per day of its glossy catalogues using paper from old-growth timber. The ForestEthics campaign initiated street-theatre demonstrations and fake fashion ads to force the undergarment manufacturer to consider changing its practices. After a few weeks, Berman was able to negotiate different wood-pulp sources with company management. Similar campaigns targeting [[Staples Inc.|Staples]] and [[Office Depot]] led them to reconsider using old-growth timber. The strategy was not just to tell companies what they should stop doing, but rather "what they should continue doing and start doing in order to stay in business but avoid protests."&lt;ref name = Saunders-M11/&gt; Berman went on to be one of the lead negotiators in the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement that protected millions of hectares of boreal forest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2004 Berman switched her focus to climate change and founded a nonprofit environmental organization called PowerUp Canada that worked successfully to create greater support in Canada for carbon pricing and defended the BC carbon tax from critics threatening to "axe the tax."  In 2010 Berman was hired to Co-direct Greenpeace International's climate and energy program in 40 countries.  In that capacity she was the team leader for the creation of the Arctic campaign, contributed to the campaign to get Volkswagen to support vehicle efficiency regulations in the EU and ran a successful campaign against Facebook, on Facebook to encourage the company to demand renewable energy in its procurement for data centers.  Before leaving Greenpeace she helped to design and coordinate the "Clean Our Cloud" campaign that encouraged the largest IT companies in the world such as Apple and Google to demand and invest in renewable energy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2012 Berman moved back to Canada and began consulting with philanthropic foundations, environmental organizations and First Nations on climate and energy policy and to design campaigns on oil sands and pipelines. In 2015 Berman was appointed by the British Columbia Government to the Climate Leadership Team to make recommendations on climate policy in British Columbia. In 2016 she was appointed to be Co-Chair of the Oil Sands Advisory Group by the Alberta Government to make recommendations on implementing the new Climate Leadership Plan, reviewing cumulative impacts of oil sands operations and design climate recommendations for the pathway to 2050.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29306">[[File:Debs Canton 1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Station WEVD was named in honor of Socialist Party orator and publicist Eugene Victor Debs, borrowing his initials.]]
'''WEVD''' (originally broadcasting at 1220 kHz [[AM broadcasting|AM]], later on 1300 kHz, for many years on 1330 kHz and finally on 1050 kHz), was an American brokered programming [[radio station]] with some  [[Talk radio|news-talk]]  launched in August 1927 by the [[Socialist Party of America]]. Making use of the initials of recently deceased party leader [[Eugene Victor Debs]] in its [[call sign]], the station operated from [[Woodhaven, Queens|Woodhaven]] in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Queens]]. The station was purchased with a $250,000 radio fund raised by the Socialist Party in its largest fundraising effort of the 1920s and was intended as spreading [[progressivism|progressive]] ideas to a mass audience. A number of national [[trade unions]] and other institutions aided the Socialists in obtaining the station.

Operation of the station was taken over by the publishing association responsible for producing the [[Yiddish]]-language [[social democracy|social democratic]] daily newspaper ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' in 1932. A FM station using the same call letters were added during the 1950s. After briefly leaving AM broadcasting in 1979, ''The Forward'' swapped its FM frequency for another AM frequency and continued broadcasting as a small ethnic station until divesting itself late in the 1980s.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Norman Thomas 1937.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Norman Thomas, who would run 6 times for President heading the Socialist ticket, was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Debs Memorial Radio Fund.]]

Radio broadcasting emerged on a mass scale in the United States during the first half of the 1920s, with the number of stations in operation rising from 28 in 1921 to 571 in 1925.&lt;ref name=Legit124&gt;Nathan Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure: The Socialists and American Broadcasting, 1926-1932," in Ronald C. Kent et al. (eds.), ''Culture, Gender, Race, and U.S. Labor History.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1993; pg. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; A new form of [[mass media]] had emerged. [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed federal legislation called the [[Radio Act of 1927]] early in that year establishing a [[Federal Radio Commission]] (FRC), which was granted power to regulate the emerging industry, granting licenses and assigning broadcasting wavelengths to bring order to a chaotic market.&lt;ref name=Legit124 /&gt;

Under this legislation, broadcasters would not own the right to broadcast at a certain frequency but would rather use what was deemed a public resource for a limited period of time, not to exceed three years.&lt;ref name=Legit124 /&gt; To earn continuation of the privilege of broadcasting over the public airwaves, stations would be forced to demonstrate service to the public interest under the new law.&lt;ref name=Legit124 /&gt;

The [[Socialist Party of America]] was in the throes of a membership decline throughout the decade of the 1920s, the [[communism|communist]] left wing of the organization having been suspended, expelled, or split from the organization beginning with the seminal [[1919 Emergency National Convention]] of the party.&lt;ref name=Legit126&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Dues-paying membership fell during this period from more than 100,000 to less than 10,000.&lt;ref name=Legit126 /&gt; The party's finances were similarly deeply affected and the organization felt pressed to explore new means of reaching an increasingly apathetic public. At its December 1926 quarterly meeting the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided to erect a radio broadcasting station as a memorial to its recently deceased co-founder, [[Eugene V. Debs]], who had died in October of the previous year.&lt;ref name=Legit127&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1927 the [[Socialist Party of America]] launched a fundraising drive aimed at generating $250,000 for the purchase of an [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] station.&lt;ref name=DriveOpens&gt;"Drive Opens to Build Debs Radio," ''The New Leader,'' vol. 3, no. 11 (March 12, 1927), pp. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Party leader and head of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]] [[Norman Thomas]] was chosen as chairman of the Board of Trustees for the new enterprise and venerated party founder [[Morris Hillquit]] was appointed as treasurer.&lt;ref name=DriveOpens /&gt;

A total of 21 others from the liberal, labor, and socialist community were appointed as a Board of Trustees, including such publicly recognized figures as [[pacifism|pacifist]] minister [[John Haynes Holmes]], [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]] founder [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America|Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] leader [[Sidney Hillman]], novelist [[Upton Sinclair]], and [[American Civil Liberties Union]] head [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]].&lt;ref name=DriveOpens /&gt; [[G. August Gerber]], son of [[Socialist Party of New York|New York Socialist Party]] functionary [[Julius Gerber]], was named as secretary of the Board and director of the fundraising drive.&lt;ref name=DriveOpens /&gt;

At the time of the fundraising drive's launch Norman Thomas remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The usefulness of a well established radio station open to full and frank discussion of great economic and social issues is beyond doubt. Past experience combines with common sense in assuring us that the commercial broadcasting stations cannot be expected to give much time or attention to the great vision for which Gene Debs gave his life. I am glad to observe that you have invited and obtained the acceptance of men and women as trustees who are not members of the Socialist Party. Such ... [shall] guarantee that the Debs Memorial Radio Fund will be free from a narrow and intolerant partisanship."&lt;ref name=DriveOpens /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas and Hillquit were explicit in their desire to make the radio station a memorial to the departed Debs. In a joint statement they called for a "monument" which was to be "a living instrument of social service...to be operated in the interests of all progressive movements and ideas and in aid of all struggles for social justice in the tolerant and broad-minded spirit of Gene Debs."&lt;ref name=DriveOpens /&gt;

The Debs Memorial Radio Fund launched its fundraising campaign with a [[direct mail|mailing]] of 15,000 letters soliciting funds for the establishment of a Socialist Party-owned radio station.&lt;ref name=Legit128&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; This first round of solicitation brought in just over $2650 — barely more than 1% of the declared goal $250,000 sought for the project.&lt;ref name=Legit128 /&gt; The Radio Fund's trustees estimated cost of launching a station at $100,000 and hoped to invest the balance to generate sufficient interest income to allow for perpetual operations.&lt;ref name=Legit128 /&gt; While this grand vision of substantial funding proved overly optimistic, the necessary funds for the acquisition of a station were successfully raised from party members and sympathetic labor unions during the first half of 1927.&lt;ref name=Legit128 /&gt;

===Launch===

Around the first of August 1927 the trustees of the "Debs Memorial Radio Fund" announced the purchase of AM radio station WSOM, transmitting from [[Woodhaven, New York|Woodhaven]] in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Queens]].&lt;ref name=FundBuys&gt;"Debs Fund Buys Radio Station: Broadcasting is to Begin Soon: Socialist, Labor and Liberal Group is Now Owner of WSOM," ''The New Leader,'' vol. 4, no. 7 (Aug. 6, 1927), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediate application was to be made to the [[Federal Radio Commission]] for a change of call letters to WDEBS, it was reported, as well as for an increase of transmission power from 500 to 1,000 watts to enable the station to broadcast with less interference from the skyscrapers of New York.&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt; The broadcast studio was to be located somewhere in [[Manhattan]], it was reported.&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt;

The Socialist Party and its partners had entered into the acquisition of the existing station, formerly owned by Union Course Laboratories of Woodhaven, after having received assurances from the Federal Radio Commission that a broadcasting license would be promptly granted upon purchase.&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt; Joining the Socialist Party with the Debs radio project were a number of national and international [[trade union]]s, including the [[United Mine Workers of America]], the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]], the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]], the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers]], the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], and the [[United Hebrew Trades]].&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt; Also joining the fundraising effort were the left wing [[fraternal benefit society]] the [[Workmen's Circle]] and the financially successful [[Yiddish]] language [[social democracy|social democratic]] daily, ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]],'' headed by [[Abraham Cahan]].&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt;

While the purchase price of the station was not revealed in the press, August Gerber indicated that the bulk of the $250,000 operating fund — which had still not been fully met — was to be used to cover ongoing operating expenses.&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt; Gerber expressed a belief that the station would become self-supporting in fairly short order and indicated a desire to make the new New York station the flagship of a network of "labor radio stations" throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt;

At the time of the station's purchase, Gerber declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The purchase of a labor station...will guarantee to minority opinion in America its right to be heard without censorship. With radio now privately owned and controlled, a station like WDEBS is the only cry in the wilderness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"We promise that, as soon as we can proceed with full operation, Station WDEBS will be not merely a chronicler of events, nor a vehicle of music and entertainment, though we hope not to fail even in these matters, but a militant, fighting champion of the rights of the oppressed, of all those who toil by hand or brain to produce the wealth of this world."&lt;ref name=FundBuys /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The party's plan for the use of call letters WDEBS was short-circuited by the FRC, which   ruled that only aircraft could use five-letter call names and that ground radio station was limited to four letters or fewer.&lt;ref name=Legit128 /&gt; Eugene V. Debs' initials were thus substituted, and WEVD was born.&lt;ref name=Legit128 /&gt;

The Debs Memorial Radio Fund began operating WEVD on August 18, 1927. Broadcasting was not limited to the English language, however. One of the organizations behind the funding of the WEVD project, the widely circulated and financially successful ''Jewish Daily Forward,'' launched what would become what one radio historian has called "the most famous Yiddish radio program of all time" — ''The Forward Hour.''&lt;ref name=YRP&gt;[http://yiddishradioproject.org/exhibits/history/ "The Yiddish Radio Dial,"] Sound Portraits Productions, 2002, yiddishradioproject.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The show was first broadcast every Sunday morning at 11 am and gained a significant following among the Yiddish-speaking immigrant community of New York City.&lt;ref name=YRP /&gt;

Finances were tight throughout the entire period of the Socialist Party's operation of the station.&lt;ref name=Legit129&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Operating costs were minimized through the generosity of the ILGWU, which allowed the station free use of the entire 6th floor of its headquarters building in New York City.&lt;ref name=Legit129 /&gt; A network of studios and reception rooms were created in the space, providing a fully adequate base of operations for the station.&lt;ref name=Legit129 /&gt;

Operating funding came from small-scale listener contributions, regular donations from the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations interested in the station's mission, and the left wing philanthropic trust, the [[American Fund for Public Service]], commonly known as the Garland Fund.&lt;ref name=Legit129 /&gt; Station manager August Gerber dedicated much of his time to keeping the station's meager revenue stream flowing, although already by January 1928 Norman Thomas was opining that the Socialist Party and its radio station "can't go on living like this."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Thomas to G. August Gerber, January 4, 1928. Norman Thomas Papers 1904-1967, Microfilm Edition, Reel 1. Quoted in Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory difficulties===

On top of the Socialist Party's financial troubles came regulatory problems with the FRC, which on May 25, 1928 demanded that WEVD and 163 other stations show cause why their broadcasting licenses should not be revoked as part of a plan to rationalize the distribution of radio bandwidth by forcing out small stations catering to niche audiences in favor of fewer high powered stations broadcasting commercially to a mass market.&lt;ref name=Legit129 /&gt;

Representatives of WEVD and 109 other threatened stations made their way to [[Washington, D.C.]] in July 1928 for two weeks of regulatory hearings on the issue.&lt;ref name=Legit130 /&gt; Station manager Gerber responded with a statement emphasizing the importance of defending [[freedom of speech|free speech]] and the right of political minorities to submit their ideas to a broad public.&lt;ref name=Legit130&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Party leader Norman Thomas echoed this perspective, declaring the value of WEVD and other community stations as a bulwark against a "big chain system" which tended to "standardize — to make robots and [[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitts]] of the American people."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of Gerber and Thomas ultimately proved successful, with the FRC approving the WEVD renewal application one month later.&lt;ref name=Legit131&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; In the FRC's judgment WEVD had followed a "very satisfactory policy" of representing a range of political and economic perspectives befitting "the mouthpiece of a substantial political or religious minority."&lt;ref name=Legit131 /&gt; A editor at the ''[[New York Times]]'' concurred with the radio regulators' assessment, noting that revoking WEVD's license on the basis of its political views "would be both unjust and stupid."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' August 23, 1928, pg. 20. Quoted in Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

WEVD won praise for its news reporting and commentary, taking an array of issues relating to world affairs, American foreign policy, and activities of the American labor movement.&lt;ref name=Legit132&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In an era in which few stations did likewise, WEVD did not fail to produce programming dealing with [[African-American]] history and culture, including the broadcast of a weekly ''Pullman Porters Hour'' sponsored by the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters which included both entertainment and talks on serious topics of interest to the black community of New York City.&lt;ref name=Legit132 /&gt;

WEVD's Educational Director, [[Paul Blanshard]], expanded the station's educational content following its August 1928 license renewal, including weekly courses on [[economics]] conducted by [[A. J. Muste|A.J. Muste]] of [[Brookwood Labor College]].&lt;ref name=Legit132 /&gt; Sunday afternoons the station broadcast a regular speakers' forum which included such prominent liberal voices as journalist [[Walter Lippman]], [[Rabbi]] [[Stephen S. Wise]], and [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], publisher of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Legit132 /&gt;

===Frequency change and more trouble===
[[File:Hillquit-Morris-240725.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Socialist Party leader Morris Hillquit, an attorney, was instrumental in the 1928 and 1931 regulatory defenses of WEVD.]]

Late in 1929 WEVD was moved to a new frequency by the Federal Radio Commission, 1300 AM, and was able to boost its power somewhat.&lt;ref name=Legit135&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; While the move had been sought by the Debs Memorial Radio Fund, which remained the legal entity owning the station, the change ultimately solved little — WEVD remained underpowered and forced to share its frequency with three other stations.&lt;ref name=Legit135 /&gt; The station broadcast 50 hours per week, ranging from as little as two hours on Fridays to 18 hours on Wednesdays.&lt;ref name=Legit135 /&gt;

WEVD found itself in a difficult financial position that was a veritable [[Catch-22]] — unions and other left wing institutions were difficult to motivate to make donations due to the station's limited broadcast time and poor signal coverage, but without these donations it would be impossible to improve the transmission situation which would make the donations happen.&lt;ref name=Legit135 /&gt; To make up the financial shortfall the station became aggressive in pushing for contributions from its listeners.&lt;ref name=Legit135 /&gt;

The FRC continued to seek a reduction in the number of stations to more closely match the limited number of broadcast frequencies and saw weak and underfinanced stations such as WEVD as fodder for the executioner's axe. A number of complaints about the station began to be accumulated.&lt;ref name=Legit135 /&gt; In October 1930 a new set of hearings began with respect to the license renewal of the socialist radio station.&lt;ref name=Legit135 /&gt; A range of violations of the [[1927 Radio Act]] were cited, including repeated failure to announce station call letters on the air every 15 minutes and inability to stay on its assigned wavelength.&lt;ref name=Legit135 /&gt; A recommendation was made by the FRC examiner assigned to the case to deny the station's license renewal application.&lt;ref name=Legit136&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once again Norman Thomas, August Gerber, and Morris Hillquit jumped to action, painting the station's woes as part of a political vendetta aimed at homogenization of the radio airwaves at the expense of political minorities.&lt;ref name=Legit136 /&gt; The American Civil Liberties Union promised its aid in making the WEVD renewal controversy a national free speech campaign.&lt;ref name=Legit136 /&gt; The final report of the FRC examiner was filed on December 11, 1930 and the station was notified of the decision a week later.&lt;ref name=Legit136 /&gt; Within two weeks the station had submitted a 17-page challenge of the FRC examiner's ruling, which combined with public pressure from listeners compelled the FRC to temporarily reverse its decision on January 13, 1931.&lt;ref name=Legit136 /&gt;

Additional regulatory hearings about WEVD were held in March and May 1931, with regulators charging that the Debs Memorial Radio Fund lacked sufficient financial resources to meet minimum standards established by the FRC.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pp. 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; The uniqueness of WEVD's broadcast content was also denied.&lt;ref name=Legit137&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulators thus sought to award the WEVD frequency to station [[WNSW|WFOX]], owned by [[Paramount Pictures]], arguing that station's "superior fitness to serve the public convenience, necessity and welfare."&lt;ref name=Legit137 /&gt;

In response to the FRC's hostile action, efforts were made to address the situation at WEVD through a fundamental reorganization of the operation.&lt;ref name=Legit137 /&gt; Problems to be addressed included inadequate equipment, poor broadcast location, insufficient funding, and a haphazard planning of station content.&lt;ref name=Legit137 /&gt; Party leader Morris Hillquit was particularly instrumental in the reorganization, coming up with the idea of selling $50,000 in WEVD stock in order to pay off standing obligations and invest in new capacity and content.&lt;ref name=Legit138&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to raise funds to improve and expand operations during the second half of 1931 was answered by Abe Cahan, editor and publisher of the social democratic ''Jewish Daily Forward,'' the largest Yiddish-language newspaper in the world.&lt;ref name=Legit138 /&gt; Cahan was firmly committed to the importance of the project and he made the newspapers funds freely available, depositing $70,000 on account in the fall of 1931 for the expansion of the station assuming the renewal of its broadcast license.&lt;ref name=Legit139&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with previous and subsequent cash infusions, the ''Forward'' had invested $200,000 in WEVD by the end of that year.&lt;ref name=Legit139 /&gt;

In a split decision the FRC renewed the license for WEVD at the end of October 1931.&lt;ref name=Legit139 /&gt; Preparations immediately began for the transfer of the station's operations from the 6th floor of the ILGWU building in Manhattan to a new home located on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], and the station's management was shuffled.&lt;ref name=Legit139 /&gt; The grand opening of the new studio took place on September 28, 1932, and was marked by an array of liberal and socialist worthies who spoke at the occasion, including Hillquit, Cahan, educator [[John Dewey]], magazine publisher [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], and writer [[Heywood Broun]].&lt;ref&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer to ''The Forward''===
[[File:Abraham Cahan NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Abraham Cahan (1860-1951) of the ''Jewish Daily Forward'' in his later years.]]

The [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] of 1932 mandated the change of broadcast frequencies of a number of radio stations to cause less interference in [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Fritz&gt;Jose Fritz, [http://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2006/10/wevd-yiddish-and-socialist.html "WEDV: Socialist and Yiddish,"] Arcane Radio Trivia, October 9, 2006. tenwatts.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Station WEVD was among those affected, forced to move from 1300 to 1330 [[kilohertz]].&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt; At this time WEVD shared its broadcast frequency with another station, WHAP/WFAB — a station which was ultimately sold to WEVD and eliminated through merger in 1938.&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt;

However, two other stations shared the broadcast frequency with WEVD:  [[WHAZ (AM)|WHAZ]], the radio station of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in [[Troy, New York]], which was on-air only on Monday evenings, and WBBR (later called WPOW) also of [[New York, New York]], owned by the [[Watchtower Bible and Tract Society]], publishing arm of the religious group [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt; From the time of the 1932 broadcasting agreement through the 1970s the Socialist and Yiddish-language WEVD continued to share its station frequency with the religious group, transmitting 86 hours per week while leaving Sundays and early mornings until 8 am to WPOW, and Monday nights to WHAZ.&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt;  WHAZ was sold to the owners of WPOW in 1973 and turned into a non-interfering, daytime-only station, with WPOW taking the old WHAZ Monday night hours.

It is said that "he who pays the piper calls the tune," and it was clear by 1932 from whence came the funding of "Debs radio."&lt;ref name=Legit140&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Jewish Daily Forward's'' investment in the station soon swelled to nearly $250,000 and its influence over programming increased commensurately.&lt;ref name=Legit140 /&gt; Throughout the 1930s the station's editorial line moved steadily away from explicitly socialist politics to a more [[centrism|centrist]] orientation, paralleling the political perspective of ''The Forward'' itself.&lt;ref name=Legit140 /&gt;

Free access to the airwaves by trade unions was increasingly restricted and left wing political broadcasting sometimes faced [[blackout (broadcasting)|preemption]] in favor of sponsored commercial content.&lt;ref name=Legit140 /&gt; The station ultimately emerged as the radio arm of ''The Forward,'' while the Socialist Party turned to the airwaves of the [[National Broadcast Company]] and other channels in its efforts to make its political message heard on a mass basis.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried, "Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure," pg. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

WEVD did not become completely apolitical in this period, however, as during the 1930s a weekly talk show was launched hosted by [[Chester M. Wright]] of the [[International Labor News Service]].&lt;ref name=WCFL198&gt;Nathan Godfried, ''WCFL: Chicago's Voice of Labor, 1926-78.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1997; pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This show paid its way through a commercial sponsorship by [[Avalon Cigarettes]] and was syndicated to a national audience through [[electrical transcription]].&lt;ref name=WCFL198 /&gt;

On January 9, 1950, [[Harold Cammer]], Burton Zorn, Edwin M. Ottenbourg, Samuel Harris Cohen spoke with Stanley G. House as moderator on "Should New York State Have a Little Taft-Hartley Law?"&lt;ref&gt;

In 1951, a WEVD-FM was added to the airwaves, first broadcasting at 107.5, then moving to 97.9 a year later, where it remained for the next 36 years.   [[FM broadcasting|FM]].&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt;

In 1981, the Forward Association sold WEVD to [[Salem Media]], which changed the station's format and call letters, making it the Christian station WNYM. Salem subsequently purchased WPOW, merging that station into WNYM and eliminating the 52-year time-share on 1330 as of December 31, 1984.&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt;  WEVD-FM remained on the air under ''The Forward's'' ownership at this time.&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt;   WNYM evolved into the present WWRV, now broadcasting around the clock on 1330 AM.

In 1988, [[Emmis Broadcasting]] acquired the license of [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] and moved [[WFAN]] from 1050 to 660 AM.&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt; Emmis sold the license for 1050 to [[Spanish Broadcasting System]] (SBS), which quickly agreed to trade that license with cash to the Forward Association for WEVD-FM. Until the latter transaction was approved, SBS operated 1050 as a Spanish-language station called WUKQ.&lt;ref name=Fritz /&gt; When the deal was finally consummated, WEVD moved its call letters and programming to 1050 and the former WEVD-FM became [[WSKQ-FM]]. WEVD gradually replaced much of its brokered ethnic programming with liberal talk shows over the next several years; it gained some loyal listeners, but not enough to keep the station economically viable. In 2001, the Forward Association entered into a local marketing agreement with [[ESPN Radio]], and WEVD began broadcasting that network's programming on September 2 of that year. In 2003 the station was sold outright to ESPN and its call letters changed to [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN]], officially ending the 76-year history of WEVD in New York City.   

The WEVD call letters currently reside on a low-power television satellite station in [[Dover, Delaware]] for [[Salisbury, Maryland]]-based [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television Network]] affiliate [[WMDT]]; in that case they stand for "Tel'''ev'''ision in '''D'''elaware".

'''Waithood''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "wait" and "[[adulthood]]") is a period of stagnation in the lives of young [[unemployment|unemployed]] [[tertiary education|college]] graduates in various industrializing and [[developing nations]] or regions, primarily in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] ([[MENA]]) and [[India]], where their expertise is still not widely needed or applicable.  "Waithood" is described as "a kind of prolonged adolescence",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/blog/detail/897/ Diane Singerman, "Thirty and Single, Coping with Delayed Marriage"], The Middle East Youth Initiative (February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bewildering time in which large proportions of [[youth]] spend their best years waiting". It is a phase in which the difficulties youth face in each of these interrelated spheres of life result in a debilitating state of helplessness and dependency. One commentator argues, waithood can be best understood by examining outcomes and linkages across five different sectors: [[education]], [[employment]], housing, [[Credit (finance)|credit]], and [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2008/0522_middle_east_youth_dhillon.aspx?rssid=global Navtej Dhillon, "Middle East Youth Bulge: Challenge or Opportunity?"], The Brookings Institution (May 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Waithood is applicable only to college educated people who are not compelled to settle in blue collar jobs due to the support from  family elders or resources. Due to the lack of any potential employment, waithood is also tangentially related to rising rate of belated parenthood in various developing countries, with younger people choosing to delay or being forced to delay starting their own families, likes of which were uncommon in the modern industrialized countries when they were developing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/section/about/why_shabab/understanding_waithood  "Understanding Waithood"], Middle East Youth Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/document/detail/558/ [[Hilary Silver]], "Social Exclusion: Comparative Analysis of Europe and Middle East Youth"], Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warning system''' is any [[system]] of biological or technical nature deployed by an individual or group to inform of a future [[Risk|danger]]. Its purpose is to enable the deployer of the warning system to prepare for the danger and act accordingly to mitigate or avoid it.

Warnings cannot be effective unless people react to them. People are more likely to ignore a system that regularly produces false warnings (the [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf|cry-wolf effect]]), but reducing the number of false warnings generally also increases the risk of not giving a warning when it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.ress.2015.05.003| issn = 0951-8320| volume = 142| pages = 192–202| last1 = Sättele| first1 = Martina| last2 = Bründl| first2 = Michael| last3 = Straub| first3 = Daniel| title = Reliability and effectiveness of early warning systems for natural hazards: Concept and application to debris flow warning| journal = Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety| accessdate = 2018-02-07|date=October 2015| url = http://www.era.bgu.tum.de/fileadmin/w00bkd/www/Papers/2013_Saettele_et_al_Reliability_EWS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some warnings are non-specific: for instance, the probability of an earthquake of a certain magnitude in a certain area over the next decade. Such warnings cannot be used to guide short-term precautions such as evacuation. Opportunities to take long-term precautions, such as better [[building code]]s and [[disaster preparedness]], may be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/may/30/attempts-predict-earthquakes-harm-good&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''Water conservation''' includes all the policies, strategies and activities to [[sustainably]] manage the [[natural resource]] of [[fresh water]], to protect the [[hydrosphere]], and to meet the current and future human  [[demand]]. Population, household size, and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as [[climate change]] have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in [[manufacturing]] and agricultural [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/water/conserve/|title=Water conservation « Defra |work=defra.gov.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many US cities have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation, with much success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf|title=Cases in Water Conservation: How Efficiency Programs Help Water Utilities Save Water and Avoid Costs|last=|first=|date=|website=EPA.gov|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of water conservation efforts include:
* Ensuring [[water resources|availability of water]] for future generations where the withdrawal of [[freshwater]] from an [[ecosystem]] does not exceed its natural replacement rate.
* [[Energy conservation]] as water pumping, delivery and [[wastewater treatment]] facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world over 15% of total [[electricity consumption]] is devoted to [[water management]]. 
* [[Habitat conservation]] where minimizing human water use helps to preserve [[freshwater habitat]]s for local wildlife and migrating [[waterfowl]], but also [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hermoso |first1=Virgilio |last2=Abell |first2=Robin |last3=Linke |first3=Simon |last4=Boon |first4=Philip |title=The role of protected areas for freshwater biodiversity conservation: challenges and opportunities in a rapidly changing world |journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems |date=2016 |volume=26 |issue=S1 |pages=3–11 |doi=10.1002/aqc.2681|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2681/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

The key activities that benefit water conservation(save water) are as follows:
#Any beneficial reduction in [[Drying|water loss]], use and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Duane D. Baumann|author2=John J. Boland|author3=John H. Sims|date=April 1984|title=Water Conservation: The Struggle over Definition|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=20|pages=428–434|url=  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR020i004p00428/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Avoiding any damage to [[water quality]].
#Improving [[water management]] practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water.&lt;ref name="Vickers, Amy 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Use and Conservation |last=Vickers |first=Amy |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= water plow Press |location=Amherst, MA |isbn=1-931579-07-5 |page=434 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Geerts | first1 = S. | last2 = Raes | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Deficit irrigation as an  on-farm strategy to maximize crop water productivity in dry areas | doi = 10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.009 | journal = Agric. Water Manage | volume = 96 | issue = 9| pages = 1275–1284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One strategy in water conservation is [[rain water harvesting]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar Kurunthachalam|first=Senthil|year=2014|title=Water Conservation and Sustainability: An Utmost Importance.|url=|journal=Hydrol Current Res|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digging ponds, lakes, canals, expanding the water reservoir, and installing rain water catching ducts and filtration systems on homes are different methods of harvesting rain water. Many people in many countries keep clean containers so they can boil it and drink it, which is useful to supply water to the needy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Harvested and filtered rain water can be used for toilets, home gardening, lawn irrigation, and small scale agriculture.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Another strategy in water conservation is protecting [[groundwater]] resources. When precipitation occurs, some infiltrates the soil and goes underground.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov/info/water_cycle/hydrology.cgi|title=Description of the Hydrologic Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=nwrfc.noaa.gov/rfc/|publisher=NOAA River Forecast Center|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water in this saturation zone is called groundwater.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; [[groundwater contamination|Contamination of groundwater]] causes the groundwater water supply to not be able to be used as resource of fresh drinking water and the natural regeneration of contaminated groundwater can takes years to replenish.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groundwater.org/get-informed/groundwater/contamination.html|title=Potential threats to Groundwater|last=|first=|date=|website=groundwater.org/|publisher=The Groundwater Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of potential sources of groundwater contamination include storage tanks, [[septic tank|septic]] systems, uncontrolled [[hazardous waste]], [[landfill]]s, [[atmospheric contaminants]], chemicals, and [[road salt]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Contamination of groundwater decreases the replenishment of available freshwater so taking preventative measures by protecting groundwater resources from contamination is an important aspect of water conservation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

An additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of  groundwater water supply.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation.

A fundamental component to water conservation strategy is communication and education outreach of different water programs.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delgado|first1=Jorge A.|last2=Groffman|first2=Peter M.|last3=Nearing|first3=Mark A.|last4=Goddard|first4=Tom|last5=Reicosky|first5=Don|last6=Lal|first6=Rattan|last7=Kitchen|first7=Newell R.|last8=Rice|first8=Charles W.|last9=Towery|first9=Dan|last10=Salon|first10=Paul|title=Conservation practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change|journal=Journal of Soil and Water Conservation|date=1 July 2011|volume=66|issue=4|pages=118A–129A|doi=10.2489/jswc.66.4.118A|url=http://www.jswconline.org/content/66/4/118A.refs|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=en|issn=0022-4561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing communication that educates science to land managers, policy makers, farmers, and the general public is another important strategy utilized in water conservation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Communication of the science of how water systems work is an important aspect when creating a management plan to conserve that system and is often used for ensuring the right management plan to be put into action.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Social solutions ==
[[File:VineyardDrip.JPG|thumb|right|[[Drip irrigation]] system in [[New Mexico]]]]
Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level, by either municipal [[water industry|water utilities]] or regional governments.  Common strategies include public [[outreach]] campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wateruseitwisely.com "Water - Use It Wisely."] U.S. multi-city public outreach program. Park &amp; Co., Phoenix, AZ. Accessed 2010-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; tiered water rates (charging progressively higher prices as water use increases), or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Cases in Water Conservation |url=http://www.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf |author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Document No. EPA-832-B-02-003.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of [[xeriscaping]] or [[natural landscaping]] in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/132/222/ |title= Xeriscape Rebates |author= Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |authorlink= |date= 2009-02-06 |work= |location=Albuquerque, NM |accessdate= 2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most urban outdoor water use in California is residential,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heberger|first=Matthew|year=2014|title=Issue Brief|url=http://pacinst.org/app/uploads/2014/06/ca-water-urban.pdf|journal=Urban Water Conservation and efficiency Potential in California|volume=|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses.

One fundamental conservation goal is universal metering. The prevalence of residential [[water meter]]ing varies significantly worldwide. Recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30% of UK households,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/environment_sciences/report-60279.html "Time for universal water metering?"] ''Innovations Report.'' May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and about 61% of urban Canadian homes (as of 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Municipal Water Use, 2001 Statistics |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/water-apps/en/info/pubs/sss/e_mun2001.pdf |author=Environment Canada |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Cat. No. En11-2/2001E-PDF. {{ISBN|0-662-39504-2}}. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/nps-conserve.html |title=How to Conserve Water and Use It Effectively |author=EPA |date=2010-01-13 |work= |location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use, metering is also an important way to identify and localize [[water leakage]].  Water metering would benefit society, in the long run, it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system, as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come.  One would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges, this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by the public, domestic and manufacturing services.

Some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers, in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pimentel, Berger|title=Water resources: agricultural and environmental issues |journal=BioScience |volume=54 |issue=10 |pages=909 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0909:WRAAEI]2.0.CO;2|display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically, and water subsidies are common.  Conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force [[farmers]] to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

New technology poses a few new options for consumers, features such as full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste.  Also available are modern [[shower head]]s that help reduce wasting water: Old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute, while new fixtures available are said to use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The Home Water Works website contains useful information on household water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-water-works.org|title=Water Usage Calculator, Water Conservation and Efficiency - Home Water Works|website=www.home-water-works.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the popular view that the most effective way to save water is to curtail water-using behavior (e.g., by taking shorter showers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1316402111|title=Perceptions of water use|first=Shahzeen Z.|last=Attari|date=26 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=201316402|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316402111|pmid=24591608|pmc=3986180}}&lt;/ref&gt; experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers; as demonstrated by two [[Residential water use in the U.S. and Canada|household end use logging]] studies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, P.W.; DeOreo, W.B.; Opitz, E.M.; Kiefer, J.C.; Davis, W.Y.; Dziegielewski, B.; &amp; Nelson, J.O., 1999.

Water-saving technology for the home includes:
#Low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy
#[[Low flush toilet|Low-flush toilet]]s and [[composting toilet]]s. These have a dramatic impact in the developed world, as conventional Western [[toilet]]s use large volumes of water
#[[Dual flush toilet]]s created by [[Caroma]] includes two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water. Dual flush toilets use up to 67% less water than conventional toilets
#[[Faucet aerator]]s, which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain "wetting effectiveness" while using less water. An additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes
#[[Raw water flushing]] where toilets use sea water or non-purified water
#[[Reclaimed water|Wastewater reuse]] or recycling systems, allowing:
#*Reuse of [[greywater|graywater]] for flushing toilets or watering gardens
#*Recycling of wastewater through [[water purification|purification]] at a water treatment plant. ''See also [[Wastewater#Reuse|Wastewater - Reuse]]''
#[[Rainwater harvesting]]
#High-efficiency [[washing machine|clothes washer]]s
#Weather-based irrigation controllers
#[[Garden hose]] [[nozzle]]s that shut off the water when it is not being used, instead of letting a hose run.
# Low flow taps in wash basins
#[[Swimming pool]] covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water, energy and chemical costs.
#[[Automatic faucet]] is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet. It automates the use of faucets without the use of hands.

== Commercial applications ==
Many water-saving devices (such as low-flush toilets) that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving. Other water-saving technology for businesses includes:
*[[Waterless urinal]]s
*[[Waterless car wash]]es
*[[Infrared]] or foot-operated taps, which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom
*Pressurized waterbrooms, which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks
*[[Radiography|X-ray]] film processor re-circulation systems
*[[Cooling tower]] conductivity controllers
*Water-saving [[steam sterilizer]]s, for use in hospitals and health care facilities
*[[Rain water harvesting]]
*Water to Water [[heat exchanger]]s.

== Agricultural applications ==
[[Image:PivotIrrigationOnCotton.jpg|thumb|216px|right|Overhead irrigation, [[Center pivot irrigation|center pivot]] design]]
For crop irrigation, optimal [[water efficiency]] means minimizing losses due to [[evaporation]], [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or subsurface drainage while maximizing production.  An [[evaporation pan]] in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements.  [[surface irrigation|Flood irrigation]], the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. [[Irrigation#Overhead (sprinkler) irrigation|Overhead irrigation]], using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. [[Drip irrigation]] is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses. However, drip irrigation is increasingly affordable, especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates. Using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/outdoor/tech.html|title=Water-Saving Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation.

As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system.  This may include chiseling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"/&gt; Usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report notes that "[i]mproved [[soil organic matter]] from the use of green manures, mulching, and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains",&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season.

== Water Reuse ==
Water shortage has become an increasingly difficult problem to manage. More than 40% of the world's population live in a region where the demand for water exceeds its supply. The imbalance between supply and demand, along with persisting issues such as climate change and exponential [[population growth]], has made water reuse a necessary method for conserving water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0|title=Wastewater Reuse and Current Challenges - Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of methods used in the [[Water treatment|treatment of waste water]] to ensure that it is safe to use for irrigation of food crops and/or drinking water.

Seawater desalination requires more energy than the desalination of fresh water. Despite this, many seawater desalination plants have been built in response to water shortages around the world. This makes it necessary to evaluate the impacts of seawater desalination and to find ways to improve desalination technology. Current research involves the use of experiments to determine the most effective and least energy intensive methods of desalination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elimelech|first=Menachem|last2=Phillip|first2=William A.|date=2011-08-05|title=The Future of Seawater Desalination: Energy, Technology, and the Environment|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/712|journal=Science|language=en|volume=333|issue=6043|pages=712–717|doi=10.1126/science.1200488|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21817042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Songlee|last2=Rhee|first2=Young-Woo|last3=Kang|first3=Seong-Pil|date=2017-02-17|title=Investigation of salt removal using cyclopentane hydrate formation and washing treatment for seawater desalination|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916416309742|journal=Desalination|volume=404|pages=132–137|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2016.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sand filter|Sand filtration]] is another method used to treat water. Recent studies show that sand filtration needs further improvements, but it is approaching optimization with its effectiveness at removing pathogens from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seeger|first=Eva M.|last2=Braeckevelt|first2=Mareike|last3=Reiche|first3=Nils|last4=Müller|first4=Jochen A.|last5=Kästner|first5=Matthias|date=2016-10-01|title=Removal of pathogen indicators from secondary effluent using slow sand filtration: Optimization approaches|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857416303937|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=95|pages=635–644|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.06.068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=D.|last2=Bertelkamp|first2=C.|last3=Kegel|first3=F.

The removal of [[pathogen]]s from recycled water is of high priority because wastewater always contains pathogens capable of infecting humans. The levels of pathogenic viruses have to be reduced to a certain level in order for recycled water to not pose a threat to human populations. Further research is necessary to determine more accurate methods of assessing the level of pathogenic viruses in treated wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerba|first=Charles P.|last2=Betancourt|first2=Walter Q.|last3=Kitajima|first3=Masaaki|title=How much reduction of virus is needed for recycled water: A continuous changing need for assessment?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313541630865X|journal=Water Research|volume=108|pages=25–31|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.020|pmid=27838026|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wasting of water ==
[[File:Leaking garden hose bib.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Leaking garden hose bib]]
Wasting of water (also called "water waste" in the U.S.) is the flip side of water conservation and, in household applications, it means causing or permitting discharge of water without any practical purpose. Inefficient water use is also considered wasteful. By [[EPA]] estimate, household leaks in the U.S. can waste approximately 900 billion gallons (3.4 billion cubic meters) of water annually nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/watersense/statistics-and-facts |title=Statistics and Facts &amp;amp;#124; WaterSense &amp;amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, water management agencies are reluctant or unwilling to give a concrete definition to the somewhat fuzzy concept of '''water waste'''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/bibarticles/neuman_forfeiture.pdf |title=Janet C. Neuman. Beneficial Use, Waste, and Forfeiture:The Inefficient Search for Efficiency in Western Water Use |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, definition of water waste is often given in local drought emergency ordinances. One example refers to any acts or omissions, whether willful or negligent, that are “causing or permitting water to leak, discharge, flow or run to waste into any gutter, sanitary sewer, watercourse or public or private storm drain, or to any adjacent property, from any tap, hose, faucet, pipe, sprinkler, pond, pool, waterway, fountain or nozzle.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qcode.us/codes/roseville/view.php?topic=14-14_09-14_09_030&amp;frames=off |title=14.09.030 Definition of water waste |website=Qcode.us |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example, the city code also clarifies that “in the case of washing, “discharge,” “flow” or “run to waste” means that water in excess of that necessary to wash, wet or clean the dirty or dusty object, such as an automobile, sidewalk, or parking area, flows to waste. Water utilities (and other media sources) often provide listings of wasteful water-use practices and prohibitions of wasteful uses. Examples include utilities in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saws.org/conservation/waterwaste/whatiswaste.cfm |title=SAWS Report Water Waste - What is Water Waste? |website=Saws.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Vegas, Nevada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvvwd.com/conservation/waste.html |title=Water Waste |website=Lvvwd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; California Water Service company in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.calwater.com/conservation/water-waste-report/ |title=Report Water Waste |publisher=Cal Water |date=2015-12-03 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and City of San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiego.gov/water/conservation/kids/tips |title=Water Saving Tips &amp;#124; City of San Diego Official Website |website=Sandiego.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Palo Alto in California enforces permanent water use restrictions on wasteful practices such as leaks, runoff, irrigating during and immediately after rainfall, and use of potable water when non-potable water is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=2336&amp;TargetID=235,310 |title=Water &amp; Drought Update - Palo Alto Water Use Guidelines |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions are in effect in the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.water.vic.gov.au/liveable-cities-and-towns/permanent-water-saving-rules |title=Permanent water saving rules |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary water use bans (also known as "hosepipe bans") are used in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Water UK http://www.water.org.uk/consumers/tubs&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strictly speaking, water that is discharged into the sewer, or directly to the environment is not wasted or lost. It remains within the [[hydrologic cycle]] and returns to the land surface and surface water bodies as precipitation. However, in many cases, the source of the water is at a significant distance from the return point and may be in a different catchment. The separation between extraction point and return point can represent significant environmental degradation in the watercourse and riparian strip. What is "wasted" is the community's supply of water that was captured, stored, transported and treated to drinking quality standards. Efficient use of water saves the expense of water supply provision and leaves more fresh water in lakes, rivers and aquifers for other users and also for supporting ecosystems. A concept that is closely related to water wasting is "water-use efficiency." Water use is considered [[inefficiency|inefficient]] if the same purpose of its use can be accomplished with less water. Technical [[efficiency]] derives from engineering practice where it is typically used to describe the ratio of output to input and is useful in comparing various products and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dziegielewski, B. J.|author2=Kiefer, C.|title=Water Conservation Measurement Metrics: Guidance Report|journal=American Water Works Association|date=January 22, 2010|url=https://www.awwa.org/Portals/0/files/resources/resource%20dev%20groups/tech%20and%20educ%20program/documents/WaterConservationMeasurementMetricsGuidanceReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one showerhead would be considered more efficient than another if it could accomplish the same purpose (i.e., of showering) by using less water or other inputs (e.g., lower water pressure). However, the technical efficiency concept is not useful in making decisions of investing money (or resources) in water conservation measures unless the inputs and outputs are measured in value terms. This expression of efficiency is referred to as [[economic efficiency]] and is incorporated into the concept of water conservation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12910">The '''World Courts of Women''' are public hearings that give a forum to those who are traditionally excluded from formal political and legal proceedings. Organized around particular topics relevant to the hosting country, these unofficial public enquiries highlight the injustices that women face. They include testimonies of personal experience, analyses by scholars and activists, and skill-sharing and strategizing. Through these, the World Courts aim to educate and raise awareness, record injustice and human rights violations, give voice to marginalized women, and develop alternative visions and strategies for the future.

==Overview==

World Courts of Women are symbolic processes that hold [[Unofficial hearing|unofficial public enquiries]] into crimes against women, including the violation of their basic [[human rights]]. The main function of these hearings is to allow an opportunity for participants to relate experiences that are not widely publicized by traditional media sources and [[public discourse]]. It aims to challenge dominant public discourse by pointing to contradictions between principles of human rights and the experiences of women. The secondary function is for the [[testimony]] to provide a resource for [[social movements]] and [[political movements]] working for [[social justice]] and [[women's liberation]], which seek to hold powerful governments and other entities accountable to human rights standards and [[international law]] and "transform the dominant paradigm of politics." &lt;ref name="Courts of Women"/&gt;

The World Courts of Women have been inspired and promoted by Corinne Kumar, an [[activist]] leader in the Tunis-based [[non-governmental organization]] and human rights advocacy group, El Taller International.&lt;ref name="Courts of Women1"/&gt; In the countries where these occur, the intent is to hold their governments accountable to both international law and human [[ethics]]. While such courts lack [[Legitimacy (political)|official legitimacy]], by pointing out the failures of formal laws to protect women, they can help undermine the popular acceptance of government authority that is based in [[patriarchy]]. In this sense, they aim to increase [[popular sovereignty]] and to delegitimize institutions, [[bureaucracy]], and other social groups which are thought to be inadequate in punishing persons who violate the ethics and [[Norm (social)|norms]], if not also the [[Law|formal laws]], governing society. They challenge the traditional notion of power and powerholders; according to Kumar, "moving out of the patriarchal mindset would mean refusing the mono-dimensional definition of power, seeking to redefine and relocate power, to discover an alternate concept of power, to find new patterns of power."&lt;ref name="Women, Violence, and Nonviolent Change"/&gt;

There are many gender biases’ in the courts especially against women. Women can be denied equal justice, equal treatment, and equal opportunity (Harbour). Women have had laws passed to protect them against violence. It took many years to actually allow them to recognize women as victims of stalking or sexual harassment. Eventually laws were passed to protect these victims. Many women have experienced and lived through the domestic violence that was done to them and no one believed them. Now society is finally recognizing the violence against women more than ever before. Even though women are still put down compared to men in certain situations or jobs the world has evolved to better the understanding that women are just as capable as men.

== People's tribunals ==

[[Tribunal|People’s tribunals]] assert that targeted judicial systems are failing to provide access for low-income, minority, and other non-elite groups and individuals to [[prosecute]] or even bring forth a [[criminal charge]]. Investigation is also made into laws recognized by states that fail to consider [[personal and cultural values]] of [[human rights]] and [[dignity]]. These tribunals are also intended to help strengthen international conventions or norms to which governments and other [[elites]] are held.&lt;ref name="People's Tribunals as Constructive Resistance"/&gt;

The [[social space]]s where the World Courts of Women occur are [[communities]] in which "social categories are suspended, [[social roles|roles]] become fluid and [[social interaction|interaction]] is privileged."&lt;ref name="The Courts of Women"/&gt;  The [[symbolic system|symbolic]] use of the World Courts of Women intends to provide [[social influence|influence]], [[people power|power]], and [[Standing (law)|standing]] for victims unable to find resolution in official judicial systems and institutions.&lt;ref name="Courts of Women2"/&gt;

The first [[International War Crimes Tribunal]] was an investigative body immediately followed the 1966 publication of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s book, ''War Crimes in Vietnam''.  The tribunal investigated and evaluated the United States of [[criticism of American foreign policy|America's foreign policy]] and military [[Vietnam War|intervention in Vietnam]] and provided a model for further tribunals related to [[war crimes]], [[human rights violations]], and [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Bertrand Russell: Critical Assessments, Volume 1,"/&gt;

The [[International Tribunal on Crimes against Women]] was a people's tribunal which took place on March 4–8, 1976 in [[Brussels]], Belgium. The event was created with the intention to "make public the full range of crimes, both violently brutal and subtly discriminatory, committed against women of all cultures."&lt;ref name="Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book"/&gt;

== History ==

What follows is a partial list of past World Courts.

In 1992 the first World Court of Women, called the "Asia Court on Violence Against Women" was held in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. The Courts of Women organized by Asian Women's Human Rights Council (AWHRC) in the [[Asia Pacific region]] inspired courts in other regions, particularly in the [[Arab world]], [[Africa]], and [[Central America]].  In 1995 Arab women organized the Arab Women's Court with the assistance of human rights organizations including the international NGO, El Taller.  That year the court held a public hearing in [[Beirut, Lebanon]] on violence directed against women. In 1996 the ''Mahkamate El Nissa El Arabiya'' (Permanent Arab Women’s Court) was established.  Different member organizations were to host this court on a rotating basis.&lt;ref name="Arab World"/&gt;

The [[Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery]] was held in December 2000. It was a people's tribunal convened to gather testimony from victims, and then, based on [[international criminal law|international laws]] that were in place during [[World War II]], to try groups and individuals for [[rape]] or [[sexual slavery]], i.e., forcing women to sexually service Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref name="Did NHK Balk at Covering War Tribunal?"/&gt;
  
The World Court of Women Against War, for Peace was held March 8, 2001 in [[Khayelitsha]], Cape Town, South Africa to bear witness to the enormous violence and [[genocide]] caused by wars around the world. 4,000 people from around the Republic of South Africa and the world participated.&lt;ref name="The World Court of Women Against War, for Peace"/&gt;

World Court of Women on U.S. War Crimes took place in [[Mumbai]], India, on January 18, 2004, as part of the 2004 [[World Social Forum]].&lt;ref name="World Court of Women on US War Crimes"/&gt;

The 36th Court of Women, "Daughters of Fire : The Indian Court of Women on Dowry and Related Forms of Violence Against Women" was held in [[Bangalore]], India on July 26–29, 2009.&lt;ref name="Background: India Court of Women on Dowry and Related Forms of Violence Against Women"/&gt;

The 37th Court of Women, "Southeast Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking" was held on August 6, 2009 during the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) in [[Nusa Dua]], Bali. Twenty-two women, from six Southeast Asian countries ([[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], the [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Singapore]]) spoke about living with [[HIV/AIDS]] and their experiences with [[human trafficking]], [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]], and [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="Survivors seek justice from podium"/&gt;

"World Court of Women on Poverty in the United States: Disappeared in America" was the first US example, held in [[Oakland, California]], USA, from May 10–13, 2012. Representing the western region of the country, the focus was on poverty in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Let's Make Poverty History"/&gt;

In 2013, another World Court of Women was held in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia 2013"/&gt;

The 2015 session took place in Bangalore, India, to witness the violence and injustice, and highlight the political lessons and resistance, and oppose "the unending wars against women".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Courts of Women: against war, for peace|url = https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/rebecca-johnson/courts-of-women-resisting-violence-and-war|website = openDemocracy|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
