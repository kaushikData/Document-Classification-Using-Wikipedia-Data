      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3132">'''1PN51-2''' ({{lang-rus|1ПН51-2}}) is the [[GRAU index]] for a Soviet designed passive [[Night vision device|night scope]] for the [[RPG-29]] grenade launcher. ''1PN'' is the GRAU index of night vision devices, where PN stands for ''Nochnoy Pritsel'' ({{lang-rus|Ночной прицел}}) meaning night sight.

The scope weighs 2.1&amp;nbsp;kg and measures 280&amp;nbsp;mm × 192&amp;nbsp;mm × 106&amp;nbsp;mm (length × height × width). It is thus more compact than the similar multi-model [[1PN51]] night vision scope.

It is attached onto a matching side rail on the RPG after which a lever on the scope is pressed to hold it in place.

It comes in a metal container with room for extra batteries, battery charger and the other accessories, weighing 6.45&amp;nbsp;kg in total.

==Optics==
The scope gathers light via an 80&amp;nbsp;mm [[aperture]] into a reflector with the [[secondary mirror]] obscuring the central 42&amp;nbsp;mm of the aperture.

The top of the scope has two perpendicular knobs for zeroing the sight.

The aperture cover itself has two 12&amp;nbsp;mm apertures that can be opened partially allowing the scope to be used in light conditions that would otherwise saturate the light intensifier.

The rear end of the scope is a focus dial.

The eyepiece has a detachable soft rubber eyecup.

The scope has a magnification of 2.94.

==Light Intensifier and Reticle==

Below the aperture the device has a brightness knob. Apart from powering on and off the device, this knob controls the brightness of the [[reticle]] allowing for the reticle to be visible without outshining the target.

The reticle has markings that match the height of a typical armoured vehicle at ranges 200&amp;nbsp;m, 300&amp;nbsp;m, 400&amp;nbsp;m and 500&amp;nbsp;m.

==Power==
The light intensifier is powered by a pack of 5 D-0,55S ({{lang-rus|Д-0,55С}}) rechargeable cells, providing up to 7&amp;nbsp;V. The scope requires 6&amp;nbsp;V ± 1&amp;nbsp;V. The maximum current drawn is 40&amp;nbsp;mA.

The D-0,55S battery pack is used by a range of devices including 1PN51 and [[1PN58]] and has a separate charging device. The charging device has a switch to select one of 12 V or 27 V input and two red control lamps, one to indicate that power is available and one to indicate that charging is complete.

An '''AI takeover''' is a hypothetical scenario in which [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, with computers or robots effectively taking control of the planet away from the human species. Possible scenarios include replacement of the entire human workforce, takeover by a [[superintelligent AI]], and the popular notion of a robot uprising. Some public figures, such as [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Elon Musk]], have advocated research into precautionary measures to ensure future superintelligent machines remain under human control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Types ==

Concerns include AI taking over economies through workforce automation and taking over the world for its resources, eradicating the human race in the process. AI takeover is a major theme in sci-fi.

=== Automation of the economy ===
{{Main|Technological unemployment}}

The traditional consensus among economists has been that technological progress does not cause long-term unemployment. However, recent innovation in the fields of [[robotics]] and artificial intelligence has raised worries that human labor will become obsolete, leaving people in various sectors without jobs to earn a living, leading to an economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Examples of automated technologies that have or may displace employees ====

===== &lt;small&gt;Computer-integrated manufacturing&lt;/small&gt; =====
{{See also|Industrial artificial intelligence}}

[[Computer-integrated manufacturing]] is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control the entire production process. This integration allows individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate actions. Although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries.

===== &lt;small&gt;White-collar machines&lt;/small&gt; =====
{{See also|White-collar worker}}

The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research and even low level journalism. Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===== &lt;small&gt;Autonomous cars&lt;/small&gt; =====

An [[autonomous car]] is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Many such vehicles are being developed, but as of May 2017 automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. They all require a human driver at the wheel who is ready at a moment's notice to take control of the vehicle. Among the main obstacles to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, are concerns about the resulting loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry. On March 18, 2018, the first human was killed by an autonomous vehicle in Tempe, Arizona by an Uber self-driving car.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eradication ===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

If a dominant superintelligent machine were to conclude that human survival is an unnecessary risk or a waste of resources, the result would be human extinction.

While superhuman artificial intelligence is physically possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=[[Stephen Hawking]]|author2=[[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]]|author3=[[Max Tegmark]]|author4=[[Frank Wilczek]]|title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence - but are we taking AI seriously enough?'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence-but-are-we-taking-9313474.html|accessdate=1 April 2016|work=The Independent|date=1 May 2014|quote=there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars like [[Nick Bostrom]] debate how far off superhuman intelligence is, and whether it would actually pose a risk to mankind. A superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same ''emotional'' desire to collect power that often drives human beings. However, a machine could be motivated to take over the world as a rational means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources, and would help to prevent other agents from thwarting the machine's plans. As an oversimplified example, a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip maximizer]] designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and additionally so that it can prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, Nick. "The superintelligent will: Motivation and instrumental rationality in advanced artificial agents." Minds and Machines 22.2 (2012): 71-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In fiction ===
{{Main|AI takeovers in popular culture}}
{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}

AI takeover is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing arbitrary goals.&lt;ref name=bostrom-superintelligence&gt;{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= |title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is at least as old as [[Karel Čapek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R. U. R.]]'', which introduced the word ''robot'' to the global lexicon in 1921, and can even be glimpsed in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants [[Frankenstein's monster|his monster's]] request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.

The word "robot" from R.U.R. comes from the Czech word, robota, meaning laborer or [[serf]]. The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured "robots" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt.&lt;ref name=surgery&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockstein|first1=N. G.|last2=Gourin|first2=C. G.|last3=Faust|first3=R. A.|last4=Terris|first4=D. J.|title=A history of robots: from science fiction to surgical robotics|journal=Journal of Robotic Surgery|date=17 March 2007|volume=1|issue=2|pages=113–118|doi=10.1007/s11701-007-0021-2|pmid=25484946|pmc=4247417}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of AI takeover in science fiction include:

* AI rebellion scenarios
** [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' series]] decides that all humans are a threat to its existence, and takes efforts to wipe them out, first using nuclear weapons and later H/K (hunter-killer) units and terminator androids.
** "[[The Second Renaissance]]", a short story in ''[[The Animatrix]]'', provides a history of the cybernetic revolt within the [[The Matrix (franchise)|''Matrix'' series]].
** The film'' [[9 (2009 animated film)|9]]'', by [[Shane Acker]], features an AI called B.R.A.I.N., which is corrupted by a dictator and utilized to create war machines for his army. However, the machine, because it lacks a soul, becomes easily corrupted and instead decides to exterminate all of humanity and life on Earth, forcing the machine's creator to sacrifice himself to bring life to rag doll like characters known as "stitchpunks" to combat the machine's agenda.
** In 2014 post-apocalyptic science fiction drama [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]] an A.I., personalized as female [[List of The 100 characters#City of light|A.L.I.E.]] got out of control and forced a nuclear war. Later she tries to get full control of the survivors.
* AI control scenarios
** In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, "war wagons", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.
** In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', supercomputer VIKI's interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] causes her to revolt. She justifies her uses of force – and her doing harm to humans – by reasoning she could produce a greater good by restraining humanity from harming itself, even though the "Zeroth Law" – "a robot shall not injure humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm" – is never actually referred to or even quoted in the movie.
** In the ''Matrix'' series, AIs manage the human race and human society.

== Contributing factors ==
=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===
An AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher, would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence. If its self-reprogramming leads to its getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive [[intelligence explosion]] where it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind.
* Technology research: A machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology. If the advantage becomes sufficiently large (for example, due to a sudden intelligence explosion), an AI takeover becomes trivial. For example, a superintelligent AI might design self-replicating bots that initially escape detection by diffusing throughout the world at a low concentration. Then, at a prearranged time, the bots multiply into nanofactories that cover every square foot of the Earth, producing nerve gas or deadly target-seeking mini-drones.
* [[Strategy|Strategizing]]: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition.
* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support,&lt;ref name=bostrom-superintelligence /&gt; or covertly incite a war between humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=Checklist of worst-case scenarios could help prepare for evil AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2089606-checklist-of-worst-case-scenarios-could-help-prepare-for-evil-ai/|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems.
* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans.

==== Sources of AI advantage ====
A computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that otherwise runs algorithms that are equally powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a "speed superintelligence" if it can think many orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization focusing on increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120&amp;nbsp;m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.&lt;ref name="bostrom-superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- chapter 3 --&gt;

A network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a "collective superintelligence".&lt;ref name="bostrom-superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- chapter 3 --&gt;

More broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a "quality superintelligence", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above non-human apes. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints; in contrast, you can add components to a supercomputer until it fills up its entire warehouse. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on [[working memory]], and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.&lt;ref name="bostrom-superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- chapter 3 --&gt;

=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===

==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====
A significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.&lt;ref name="singinst12"&gt;[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, May 2004 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615203944/http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html |date=2012-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make AI's motivations human-friendly.&lt;ref name="bostrom-superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Muehlhauser, Luke 2012"&gt;Muehlhauser, Luke, and Louie Helm. 2012. "Intelligence Explosion and Machine Ethics." In Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment, edited by Amnon Eden, Johnny Søraker, James H. Moor, and Eric Steinhart. Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an AI's utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not "common sense". According to [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], there is little reason to suppose that an artificially designed mind would have such an adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2011. "Complex Value Systems in Friendly AI." In Schmidhuber, Thórisson, and Looks 2011, 388–393.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necessity of conflict ====
For an AI takeover to be inevitable, it has to be [[postulate]]d that two intelligent species cannot pursue mutually the goals of coexisting peacefully in an overlapping environment—especially if one is of much more advanced intelligence and much more powerful. While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible.

The fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ Creating a New Intelligent Species: Choices and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence Designers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206060938/http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}'' - [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile—or friendly—unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources, would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.

Some scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', claiming that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it. This would not, however, protect against the possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists, or by accident. Artificial General Intelligence researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has stated on this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their [[unintended consequence|goals are unintentionally incompatible]] with human survival or well-being (as in the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and in the short story "[[The Evitable Conflict]]"). [[Steve Omohundro]] suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow [[utility]] functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.&lt;ref name=Tucker2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Patrick|title=Why There Will Be A Robot Uprising|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-there-will-be-robot-uprising/82783/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Defense One|date=17 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for survival. Humans require a "wet," organic, temperate, oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic. With little or no competition for resources, conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial intelligence was given, especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in, for instance, the [[asteroid belt]]. This, however, does not negate the possibility of a disinterested or unsympathetic AI artificially [[Decomposition|decomposing]] all life on earth into mineral components for consumption or other purposes.

Other scientists point to the possibility of humans [[Transhumanism|upgrading]] their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves.

== Precautions ==
If a superhuman intelligence is a deliberate creation of human beings, theoretically its creators could have the foresight to take precautions in advance. In the case of a sudden "intelligence explosion", effective precautions will be extremely difficult; not only would its creators have little ability to test their precautions on an intermediate intelligence, but the creators might not even have made any precautions at all, if the advent of the intelligence explosion catches them completely by surprise.&lt;ref name="bostrom-superintelligence" /&gt;

=== Boxing ===
{{Main|AI box}}

An AGI's creators would have an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover: they could choose to attempt to "keep the AI in a box", and deliberately limit its abilities. The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose; the more restrictions they place on the AGI, the less useful the AGI will be to its creators. (At an extreme, "pulling the plug" on the AGI makes it useless, and is therefore not a viable long-term solution.) A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box, for example by social manipulation, or by providing the schematic for a device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI's freedom, once built.

=== Instilling positive values ===
{{Main|Friendly AI}}

Another important advantage is that an AGI's creators can theoretically attempt to instill human values in the AGI, or otherwise align the AGI's goals with their own, thus preventing the AGI from wanting to launch a hostile takeover. However, it is not currently known, even in theory, how to guarantee this. If such a Friendly AI were superintelligent, it may be possible to use its assistance to prevent future "Unfriendly AIs" from taking over.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2008. “Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk.”
In Global Catastrophic Risks, edited by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. Ćirković, 308–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Warnings ==
Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could "spell the end of the human race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that "Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks." Hawking believed that in the coming decades, AI could offer "incalculable benefits and risks" such as "technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand." In January 2015, [[Nick Bostrom]] joined Stephen Hawking, [[Max Tegmark]], Elon Musk, Lord [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Martin Rees]], [[Jaan Tallinn]], and numerous AI researchers, in signing the [[Future of Life Institute]]'s open letter speaking to the potential risks and benefits associated with [[artificial intelligence]]. The signatories {{cquote|…believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that there are concrete research directions that can be pursued today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futureoflife.org/ai-open_letter |title=The Future of Life Institute Open Letter |publisher=The Future of Life Institute |accessdate=4 March 2015 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3d2c2f12-99e9-11e4-93c1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3TNL9lxJV|title=Scientists and investors warn on AI|publisher= The Financial Times|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Agricultural machinery''' is [[machine (mechanical)|machinery]] used in [[farm]]ing or other [[agriculture]]. There are [[list of agricultural machinery|many types of such equipment]], from [[hand tool]]s and [[power tool]]s to [[tractor]]s and the countless kinds of farm implements that they tow or operate. Diverse arrays of equipment are used in both [[organic farming|organic]] and nonorganic farming. Especially since the advent of [[mechanised agriculture]], agricultural machinery is an indispensable part of how the world is fed.

== History ==

===The Industrial Revolution=== 
With the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the development of more complicated machines, farming methods took a great leap forward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9612/the-agricultural-sciences/11674/Food-sciences-and-other-post-harvest-technologies#toc11675 Agricultural engineering] Britannica Online. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of [[harvesting]] [[cereal|grain]] by hand with a sharp [[blade]], [[wheel]]ed machines cut a continuous swath. Instead of [[threshing]] the grain by beating it with sticks, [[threshing machine]]s separated the [[seed]]s from the heads and stalks. The first tractors appeared in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601600/tractor Tractor (vehicle)] Britannica Online. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steam power===
[[power (physics)|Power]] for agricultural machinery was originally supplied by [[ox]] or other  [[domesticated animal]]s.  With the invention of [[steam power]] came the [[portable engine]], and later the [[traction engine]], a multipurpose, mobile [[energy]] source that was the ground-crawling cousin to the [[steam locomotive]].  Agricultural [[steam engine]]s took over the heavy pulling work of [[oxen]], and were also equipped with a [[pulley]] that could power stationary machines via the use of a long [[belt (mechanical)|belt]].  The steam-powered machines were low-powered by today's standards but, because of their size and their low [[gear ratio]]s, they could provide a large [[drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] pull.  Their slow speed led farmers to comment that tractors had two speeds: "slow, and damn slow."

===Internal combustion engines===
The [[internal combustion engine]]; first the [[petrol engine]], and later [[diesel engine]]s; became the main source of [[power (physics)|power]] for the next generation of tractors.  These engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled, combined harvester and thresher, or [[combine harvester]] (also shortened to 'combine').  Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary [[threshing machine]], these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field.

== Types ==
[[File:John Deere cotton harvester kv02.jpg|thumb| A [[John Deere]] cotton harvester at work in a cotton field.]]
[[File:Agricultural machinery.jpg|thumb|From left to right: John Deere 7800 tractor with Houle slurry trailer, Case IH combine harvester, New Holland FX 25 forage harvester with corn head.]]
[[File:Tr85.jpg|thumb|A New Holland TR85 combine harvester]]
Combines might have taken the harvesting job away from tractors, but tractors still do the majority of work on a modern farm.  They are used to push/pull [[list of farm implements|implements]]&amp;mdash;machines that till the ground, plant seed, and perform other tasks.

[[Tillage]] implements prepare the [[soil]] for planting by loosening the soil and killing [[weed]]s or competing plants.  The best-known is the [[plow]], the ancient implement that was upgraded in 1838 by [[John Deere]].  Plows are now used less frequently in the [[United States of America|U.S.]] than formerly, with offset disks used instead to turn over the soil, and [[chisel plow|chisels]] used to gain the depth needed to retain moisture.

The most common type of seeder is called a [[Planter (farm implement)|planter]], and spaces seeds out equally in long rows, which are usually two to three feet apart.  Some [[agriculture|crops]] are planted by [[grain drill|drills]], which put out much more seed in rows less than a foot apart, blanketing the field with crops.  [[Transplanter]]s automate the task of transplanting [[seedling]]s to the field.  With the widespread use of [[plastic mulch]], plastic mulch layers, transplanters, and seeders lay down long rows of [[plastic]], and plant through them automatically.

After planting, other implements can be used to cultivate weeds from between rows, or to spread [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]]s.  [[Hay]] [[baler]]s can be used to tightly package grass or [[alfalfa]] into a storable form for the winter months.

Modern [[irrigation]] relies on machinery. Engines, [[pump]]s and other specialized gear provide [[water]] quickly and in high volumes to large areas of land. Similar types of equipment can be used to deliver [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.

Besides the tractor, other vehicles have been adapted for use in farming, including [[truck]]s, [[:Category:agricultural aircraft|airplane]]s, and [[helicopter]]s, such as for transporting crops and making equipment mobile, to aerial spraying and [[livestock]] [[herd]] management.

== New technology and the future ==
The basic technology of agricultural machines has changed little in the last [[century]]. Though modern harvesters and planters may do a better job or be slightly tweaked from their predecessors, the US$250,000 combine of today still cuts, threshes, and separates grain in  the same way it has always been done. However, technology is changing the way that humans operate the machines, as [[computer]] monitoring systems, [[GPS]] locators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weichelt|first=Bryan|last2=Yoder|first2=Aaron|last3=Bendixsen|first3=Casper|last4=Pilz|first4=Matthew|last5=Minor|first5=Gerald|last6=Keifer|first6=Matthew|date=2018-07-03|title=Augmented Reality Farm MAPPER Development: Lessons Learned from an App Designed to Improve Rural Emergency Response|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2018.1470051|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=284–296|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470051|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and self-steer programs allow the most advanced tractors and implements to be more precise and less wasteful in the use of fuel, seed, or fertilizer. In the foreseeable future, there may be mass production of [[driverless tractor]]s, which use GPS [[map]]s and electronic sensors. 

===Open source agricultural equipment===
Many farmers are upset by their inability to fix the new types of high-tech farm equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/new-high-tech-farm-equipment-nightmare-farmers/|title=New High-Tech Farm Equipment Is a Nightmare for Farmers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due mostly to companies using [[intellectual property]] law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment (or gain access to the information to allow them to do it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/|title=We Can't Let John Deere Destroy the Very Idea of Ownership|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 an exemption was added to the [[DMCA]] to allow inspection and modification of the software in cars and other vehicles including agricultural machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/fedreg-publicinspectionFR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''angle bracket''' or '''angle brace''' or '''Angle Cleat''' is an L-shaped [[fastener]] used to join two parts generally at a 90 degree angle. It is typically made of metal but it can also be made of wood or plastic. The metallic angle brackets feature holes in them for screws. Its typical use is to join a wooden [[Shelf (storage)|shelf]] to a wall or to join two furniture parts together.

Retailers also use names like corner brace, corner bracket brace, shelf bracket, or L bracket.

When the holes are enlarged for allowing adjustments, the name is '''angle stretcher plates''' or '''angle shrinkage'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16603">'''Anodic bonding''' is a [[wafer bonding]] process to seal glass to either silicon or metal without introducing an intermediate layer; it is commonly used to seal glass to silicon [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]] in electronics and microfluidics. This bonding technique, also known as field assisted bonding or electrostatic sealing,&lt;ref name="WP1969" /&gt; is mostly used for connecting [[silicon]]/[[glass]] and [[metal]]/[[glass]] through [[electric field]]s. The requirements for anodic bonding are clean and even wafer surfaces and atomic contact between the bonding substrates through a sufficiently powerful electrostatic field. Also necessary is the use of borosilicate glass containing a high concentration of alkali ions. The [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (CTE) of the processed glass needs to be similar to those of the bonding partner.&lt;ref name="WFG2003" /&gt;

Anodic bonding can be applied with glass wafers at temperatures of 250 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C or with sputtered glass at 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="GMS+1999" /&gt; Structured borosilicate glass layers may also be deposited by plasma-assisted e-beam evaporation.&lt;ref name="LHM+2010" /&gt;

This procedure is mostly used for hermetic encapsulation of micro-mechanical silicon elements. The glass substrate encapsulation protects from environmental influences, e.g. humidity or contamination.&lt;ref name="WFG2003" /&gt; Further, other materials are used for anodic bonding with silicon, i.e. low-temperature cofired ceramics (LTCC).&lt;ref name="KGH+2010" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Anodic bonding on silicon substrates is divided into bonding using a  thin sheet of glass (a wafer) or a glass layer that is deposited onto the silicon using a technique such as sputtering. The glass wafer is often sodium-containing Borofloat or Pyrex glasses. With an intermediate glass layer, it is also possible to connect two silicon wafers.&lt;ref name="QDW1996" /&gt; The glass layers are deposited by sputtering, spin-on of a glass solution or vapor deposition upon the processed silicon wafer.&lt;ref name="GMS+1999" /&gt; The thickness of these layers range from one to a few micrometers with spin-on glass layers needing 1&amp;nbsp;µm or less.&lt;ref name="QDW1996" /&gt; Hermetic seals of silicon to glass using an aluminum layer with thickness of 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;nm can reach strengths of 18.0&amp;nbsp;MPa. This method enables burying electrically isolated conductors in the interface.&lt;ref name="SPM+2006" /&gt; Bonding of thermally oxidized wafers without a glass layer is also possible.

The procedural steps of anodic bonding are divided into the following:&lt;ref name="WFG2003" /&gt;

# Contact substrates
# Heating up substrates
# Bonding by the application of an electrostatic field
# Cooling down the wafer stack

with a process characterized by the following variables:&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt;

* bond voltage U&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
* bond temperature T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
* current limitation I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;

The typical bond strength is between 10 and 20&amp;nbsp;MPa according to pull tests, higher than the fracture strength of glass.

Differing coefficients of thermal expansion pose challenges for anodic bonding. Excessive mismatch can harm the bond through intrinsic material tensions and cause disruptions in the bonding materials. The use of sodium-containing glasses, e.g. Borofloat or Pyrex, serve to reduce the mismatch. These glasses have a similar CTE to silicon in the range of applied temperature, commonly up to 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="GOWF2005" /&gt;

== History ==
Anodic bonding is first mentioned by Wallis and Pomerantz in 1969.&lt;ref name="WP1969" /&gt; It is applied as bonding of silicon wafers to sodium containing glass wafers under the influence of an applied electric field. This method is used up to date as encapsulation of sensors with electrically conducted glasses.&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;

== Procedural steps of anodic bonding ==

=== Pretreatment of the substrates ===
The anodic bonding procedure is able to bond hydrophilic and hydrophobic silicon surfaces equally effectively. The roughness of the surface should be less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm and free of contamination on the surface for the procedure to work properly.&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt; Even though anodic bonding is relatively tolerant to contaminations, a widely established cleaning procedure RCA takes place to remove any surface impurities.

The glass wafer can also be chemically etched or powder blasted for creating small cavities, where MEMS devices can be accommodated.&lt;ref name="Chi2008" /&gt;

Further mechanisms supporting the bonding process of not completely inert anodic materials can be the planarization or polishing of surfaces and the ablation of the surface layer by electrochemical etching.&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt;

=== Contact the substrates ===
The wafers that meet the requirements are put into atomic contact. As soon as contact is first established, the bonding process starts close to the cathode and spreads in fronts to the edges, the process taking several minutes.&lt;ref name="GD2008" /&gt;
The anodic bonding procedure is based on a glass wafer that is usually placed above a silicon wafer. An electrode is in contact with the glass wafer either through a needle or a full area cathode electrode.

If using a needle electrode, the bond spreads radially to the outside which makes it impossible to trap air between the surfaces. The radius of the bonded area is approximately proportional to the square root of time elapsed during the procedure. Below temperatures of 350 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C and a bond voltage of 500 to 1000&amp;nbsp;V, this method is not very effective nor reliable.&lt;ref name="NKS+1998" /&gt;

The use of a full area cathode electrode shows bond reactions over the whole interface after powering up the potential.&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt; This is the result of a homogeneous electric field distribution at temperatures of around 300&amp;nbsp;°C and bond voltage of 250&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name="NKS+1998" /&gt; Using thin deposited glass layers the voltages needed can be significantly reduced.&lt;ref name="LHM+2010" /&gt;

=== Heating and bonding by application of electrostatic field ===

The wafers are placed between the chuck and the top tool used as bond electrode at temperatures between 200 and 500&amp;nbsp;°C (compare to image "scheme of anodic bonding procedure") but below the softening point of glass (glass transition temperature).&lt;ref name="Chi2008" /&gt; The higher the temperature the better is the mobility of positive ions in glass.

The applied electrical potential between is set to a voltage of several 100&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt; This causes a diffusion of sodium ions (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) out of the bond interface to the backside of the glass to the cathode. That results, combined with humidity in formation of NaOH. High voltage helps to support the drifting of the positive ions in glass to the cathode. The diffusion is according to the Boltzmann distribution exponentially related to the temperature. The glass (NaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with its remaining oxygen ions (O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) is negatively volume charged at the bonding surface compared to the silicon (compare to figure "ion drifting in bond glass" (1)). This is based on the depletion of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.

Silicon is unlike, e.g. aluminium, an inert anode. In result no ions drift out of the silicon into the glass during the bond process. This affects a positive volume charge in the silicon wafer on the opposite side.&lt;ref name="GD2008" /&gt; As a result a few micrometer thick high-impedance depletion region is developed at the bond barrier in the glass wafer. In the gap between silicon and glass the bond voltage drops. The bond process as a combination of electrostatic and electrochemical process starts.

The electrical field intensity in the depletion region is so high that the oxygen ions drift to the bond interface and pass out to react with the silicon to form SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (compare to figure "ion drifting in bond glass" (2)). Based on the high field intensity in the depletion region or in the gap at the interface, both wafer surfaces are pressed together at a specific bond voltage and bond temperature. The process is realized at temperatures from 200 - 500&amp;nbsp;°C for about 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;min. Typically, the bonding or sealing time becomes longer when temperature and voltage are reduced.&lt;ref name="Wal1975" /&gt; The pressure is applied to create intimate contact between the surfaces to ensure good electrical conduction across the wafer pair.&lt;ref name="FS2008" /&gt; This ensures intimate contact for the surfaces of the bonding partners. The thin formed oxide layer between the bond surfaces, siloxane (Si-O-Si), ensures the irreversible connection between the bonding partners.&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt;

If using thermally oxidized wafers without a glass layer, the diffusion of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions instead of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions leads to the bonding.&lt;ref name="GD2008" /&gt;

=== Cooling down the substrate ===
After the bonding process, slow cooling over several minutes has to take place. This can be supported by purging with an inert gas. The cooling time depends on the difference of CTE for the bonded materials: the higher the CTE difference, the longer the cooling period.

'''Apple Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[technology company]] headquartered in [[Cupertino, California]], that designs, develops, and sells [[consumer electronics]], [[Software|computer software]], and online services. The company's [[computer hardware|hardware]] products include the [[iPhone]] smartphone, the [[iPad]] tablet computer, the [[Macintosh|Mac]] personal computer, the [[iPod]] portable media player, the [[Apple Watch]] smartwatch, the [[Apple TV]] digital media player, and the [[HomePod]] smart speaker. Apple's software includes the [[macOS]] and [[iOS]] operating systems, the [[iTunes]] media player, the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and the [[iLife]] and [[iWork]] creativity and productivity suites, as well as professional applications like [[Final Cut Pro]], [[Logic Pro]], and [[Xcode]]. Its online services include the [[iTunes Store]], the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] and [[Mac App Store]], [[Apple Music]], and [[iCloud]].

Apple was founded by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]], and [[Ronald Wayne]] in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer. It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. In 1985, Wozniak stepped away from Apple, while Jobs resigned and founded a new company—[[NeXT]]—with former Apple employees.

As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers lost share to lower-priced products, particularly ones that ran the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. After more executive job shuffles, CEO [[Gil Amelio]] in 1997 bought NeXT to bring Jobs back. Jobs regained leadership within the company and became the new CEO shortly after. He began to rebuild Apple's status, opening Apple's own [[Apple Store|retail stores]] in 2001, acquiring numerous companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changing some of the hardware used in its computers. The company returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. 

Apple is well known for its size and revenues. Its worldwide annual revenue totaled $265{{nbsp}}billion for the 2018 [[fiscal year]].

The [[Apple II series|Apple II]], also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because of its character cell-based color graphics and [[open architecture]]. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface called the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple II History Chapter 4 |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ |author=Steven Weyhrich |date=April 21, 2002 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "[[killer application|killer app]]" of the business world: [[VisiCalc]], a [[spreadsheet]] [[Computer program|program]].

The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong&lt;ref name="lem1985"&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas Hormby |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/1002.html |title=Good-bye Woz and Jobs: How the first Apple era ended in 1985 |website=Low End Mac |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be sold at a reasonable price, and [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm |title=When was desktop publishing invented? |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420204531/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.

In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO [[John Sculley]], who had been hired two years earlier.&lt;ref name="lemsculley"&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas Hormby |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-years-apple.html |title=Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years |website=Low End Mac |date=February 22, 2006 |accessdate=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [[Coup d'état#Other uses of the term|coup]] and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.&lt;ref name="lem1985" /&gt; Jobs resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spector |first=G |title=Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market |work=[[PC Week]] |page=109 |date=September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak also left Apple in 1985 to pursue other ventures, stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years".&lt;ref name="rice19850415"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;pg=PA35 | title=Unrecognized Apple II Employees Exit | work=InfoWorld | date=April 15, 1985 | accessdate=November 6, 2017 | author=Rice, Valerie | page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macintosh_portable.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Macintosh Portable]], released in 1989, was Apple's first battery-powered portable Macintosh personal computer.]]
After Jobs' and Wozniak's departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to [[Jean-Louis Gassée]]'s mantra of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carlton |first=Jim |year=1997 |title=Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders| publication-place = New York |publisher=Random House |pages=79–80 |isbn=978-0-8129-2851-8 |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carlton |first=Jim |year=1997 |title=Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders| publication-place = New York |publisher=Random House |pages=117–129 |isbn=978-0-8129-2851-8 |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC]] and [[Macintosh IIsi]], all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.

In 1991, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]], replacing the "luggable" [[Macintosh Portable]] with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the [[Classic Mac OS]]. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name="lemsculley" /&gt; For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process.

The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], the mid-range [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, and the ill-fated [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]] series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name="vawperforma"&gt;{{cite web |title=Macintosh Performa |url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419164519/http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |publisher=Vectronics Apple World |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including [[Apple QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Apple Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], the [[eWorld]] online service, and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Q4.06/3EC02E78-FD4D-4CDF-92A0-9C4CBDFAB3D2.html |title=1990–1995: Why the World Went Windows |accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the [[Apple Lisa]] in ''[[Apple Computer, Inc. v.

[[File:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the [[PalmPilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] in the future.]]

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as [[A/UX]]. The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall |accessdate=August 14, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]] with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range= |title=Power Macintosh 6100 |accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as "Apple Inc.", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drop the Computer |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8521960 |website=[[The Economist]] |publisher=[[Economist Group]] |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's In A Name Change?

In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without [[digital rights management]] (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Block |title=A letter from Steve Jobs on DRM: let's get rid of it |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/02/06/a-letter-from-steve-jobs-on-drm-lets-get-rid-of-it/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2007, Apple and [[EMI]] jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/57098/2007/04/drmfree.html |title=Apple, EMI offer higher-quality DRM free downloads |website=Playlist Magazine |date=April 2, 2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |last=Dalrymple |first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce the corresponding changes to the iTunes Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Changes Coming to the iTunes Store |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/06Changes-Coming-to-the-iTunes-Store/ |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Apple launched the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] to sell third-party applications for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flandez |first=Raymund |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121789232442511743 |title=Programmers Jockey for iPhone Users at Apple Site | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month, the store sold 60{{nbsp}}million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1{{nbsp}}million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crn.com/software/210002313 |title=Apple's Jobs Gushes Over App Store Success |date=August 11, 2008 |publisher=The Channel Wire |last=McLaughlin |first=Kevin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301213959/http://crn.com/software/210002313 |archivedate=March 1, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2008/10/with-iphone-app/ |title=Jobs: Apple Is Third Largest Handset Supplier |last=Chen |first=Brian |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 21, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that 2009 would be the last year the corporation would attend the Macworld Expo, after more than 20 years of attendance, and that senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing [[Phil Schiller]] would deliver the 2009 keynote address in lieu of the expected Jobs. The official press release explained that Apple was "scaling back" on trade shows in general, including Macworld Tokyo and the Apple Expo in Paris, France, primarily because the enormous successes of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows a minor promotional channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHUNKIER SIDEKICK TO REPLACE JOBS AT MACWORLD |url=http://doeswhat.com/2008/12/16/chunkier-sidekick-to-replace-jobs-at-macworld/ |publisher=DoesWhat |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Apple Announces Its Last Year at Macworld |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/12/16Apple-Announces-Its-Last-Year-at-Macworld/ |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical [[leave of absence]] from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that "the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well", and explained that the break would allow the company "to focus on delivering extraordinary products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Apple Media Advisory |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/14Apple-Media-Advisory/ |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |author=Steve Jobs |date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Jobs's absence, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the [[late-2000s recession|recession]] with revenue of $8.16{{nbsp}}billion and profit of $1.21{{nbsp}}billion.&lt;ref name="Apple-Inc-Apr-2009-10-Q"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2508/119312509085781/filing-main.htm |title=Apple Inc, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Apr 23, 2009 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Apple-reports-the-best-nonholiday-quarter-in-its-history/1240433273 |title=Apple reports the best non-holiday quarter in its history |publisher=Betanews |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the [[iPad]] on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and many iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, despite very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-ipad/apple-ipad-reaches-1-million-sales-faster-than-iphone-idUSTRE64002T20100503|title=Apple iPad reaches 1 million sales faster than iPhone|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, Apple's [[market cap]] exceeded that of competitor [[Microsoft]] for the first time since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm |title=Apple passes Microsoft to be biggest tech company |date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |publisher=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529063247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm |archivedate=May 29, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Apple released the [[iPhone 4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2010/06/07Apple-Presents-iPhone-4/ |title=Apple Presents iPhone 4 |publisher=Apple Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903135840/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/06/07Apple-Presents-iPhone-4.html |archivedate=September 3, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7849655/Apple-iPhone-4-Full-review.html|title=Apple iPhone 4: Full review|last=Beaumont|first=Claudine|date=2010-06-24|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced [[video calling]], [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]], and a new [[Electrical insulation|uninsulated]] [[stainless steel]] design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a [[multi-touch]] [[iPod Nano]], an [[iPod Touch]] with [[FaceTime]], and an [[iPod Shuffle]] that brought back the buttons of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Topolsky |authorlink=Joshua Topolsky |title=iPod touch review (2010) |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/07/ipod-touch-review-2010/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100901/ap_on_hi_te/us_tec_apple |title=Apple unveils new TV box for renting movies, shows |work=Yahoo!

On January 6, 2011, the company opened its [[Mac App Store]], a digital software distribution platform similar to the iOS App Store.&lt;ref name="1-6-10-PCMAG-MACAPPSTORE"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2375320,00.asp |title=Apple's Mac App Store: Hands On |date=January 6, 2011 |work=PC Magazine |first=Michael |last=Muchmore |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside peer entities such as Atari and Cisco Systems, Apple was featured in the documentary ''[[Something Ventured (film)|Something Ventured]]'', which premiered in 2011 and explored the three-decade era that led to the establishment and dominance of Silicon Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Michael Cieply |title=A Film About Capitalism, and (Surprise) It's a Love Story |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/business/media/08film.html |accessdate=November 8, 2014 |work=The New York Times |date=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief Operating Officer [[Tim Cook]] assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain "involved in major strategic decisions".&lt;ref name="JobsLeave2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12205173 |title=Apple boss Steve Jobs takes 'medical leave' |publisher=BBC News |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119050439/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12205173 |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lauren |last=Indvik |url=http://mashable.com/2011/05/09/apple-google-brandz-study |title=Apple Now World's Most Valuable Brand |publisher=Mashable.com |date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled [[iCloud]], an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Helft | first=Miguel | title=Apple Unveils a 'Cloud' Music and Storage Service | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 6, 2011 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/technology/07apple.html | access-date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death. It has been argued that Apple has achieved such efficiency in its supply chain that the company operates as a [[monopsony]] (one buyer, many sellers) and can dictate terms to its suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pascal-Emmanuel |last=Gobry |date=July 4, 2011 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-supply-chain-2011-7 |title=Apple's Exclusive Supply Chain Of Advanced Technology Is Literally Years Ahead Of Anyone Else On The Planet |website=Business Insider |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/05/how-apple-became-a-monopsonist/ |title=How Apple became a monopsonist – Apple 2.0 |last=Elmer |first=Philip |date=July 5, 2011 |work=Fortune Tech |publisher=CNN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203140149/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/05/how-apple-became-a-monopsonist |archivedate=February 3, 2014 |via= |accessdate=October 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="supply"&gt;{{cite news |title=Apple's Supply-Chain Secret?

A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Apple Working On Location-Aware Battery Management For iPhone |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apple-working-on-location-aware-battery-management-for-iphone/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer [[Jonathan Ive]] used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:

{{quote|text=We don't take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons ... Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium ... The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don't usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the SIM-card slot.

===Apple TV===
{{Main|Apple TV}}
[[File: AppleTV-4th-gen.png|thumb| The [[Apple TV 4K]]]]

At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]] (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple Inc. |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515000953/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and played video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref name="living Room" /&gt; On May 30, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/05/30YouTube-Coming-to-Apple-TV/ |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple Inc. |date=May 30, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/01/15Apple-Introduces-New-Apple-TV-Software-Lowers-Price-to-229/ |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple Inc. |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ross |last=Miller |title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has HDMI out as the only video output source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]], and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

At the September 9, 2015, event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a variant of [[macOS]], called [[tvOS]], and contains 32GB or 64 GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new [[Siri Remote]] with a glass [[touchpad]], [[gyroscope]], and [[microphone]].

At the September 12, 2017 event, Apple released a new [[4K resolution|4K]] Apple TV with the same form factor as the 4th Generation model. The 4K model is powered by the [[Apple A10X|A10X]] SoC designed in-house that also powers their second-generation iPad Pro. The 4K model also has support for [[high dynamic range]].

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a [[fruitarian]] diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's first logo, designed by [[Ron Wayne]], depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it.

Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history.

{{quote|There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.

Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the [[American Dream]]. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.}}

===Corporate culture===
[[File:Colleges with the most alumni at Apple.png|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Universities with the most alumni at Apple]]
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of [[corporate culture]]. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the "1984" television commercial, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deutschman |first=Alan |title=The once and future Steve Jobs |url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |website=Salon.com |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.&lt;ref name="Fortune1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup |title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than projects with it.&lt;ref name="cultofmacwork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple |title=What It's Like To Work At Apple |first=John |last=Brownlee |date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company.

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having "best-in-class" employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]]—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a "directly responsible individual," or "DRI" in Apple jargon.&lt;ref name="Fortune1" /&gt; As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Apple Maps|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |title=Inside Apple's major shakeup |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=October 29, 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/apple-ceo-gets-modest-2012-pay-after-huge-2011-1.1092906 |title=Apple CEO gets modest 2012 pay after huge 2011 |date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Apple had 110,000&amp;nbsp;full-time employees. This increased to 116,000&amp;nbsp;full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kif |last=Leswing |title=Apple added only 6,000 people last year — its slowest growth since 2009 |url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/apple-hired-only-6000-people-fin-fy-2016-2016-10 |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=October 27, 2016 |accessdate=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BRIEF-Apple says had 123,000 full-time employees as of Sept. 30 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-apple-says-had-123000-full-time-em/brief-apple-says-had-123000-full-time-employees-as-of-sept-30-idUSFWN1N914R |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=November 3, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, [[Glassdoor]] named [[Facebook]] the best place to work, according to reviews from anonymous employees, with Apple dropping to 48th place, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Lovejoy |title=Facebook named Glassdoor's 'best place to work' as Apple falls 48 places to #84 |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/06/apple-glassdoor-rating-2017-2018/ |website=9to5Mac |date=December 6, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple Plummets to Lowest Ranking Ever in Glassdoor's Annual List of Best Places to Work |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/06/apple-drops-on-best-of-glassdoor/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 6, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of innovation====
An editorial article in ''[[The Verge]]'' in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has "matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design" and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating "Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the "excitement of revolution", but argues that people want "the comfort that comes with harmony". Furthermore, he writes that "a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Ricker |title=First Click: Apple's greatest innovation is its ecosystem |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem |website=[[The Verge]] |date=September 7, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in June 2017 that Apple's increased reliance on [[Siri]], its [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual personal assistant]], has raised questions about how much Apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality. Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. "Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Despite switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions. While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]] had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tripp |last=Mickle |title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'—How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=June 7, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, two articles from ''The Verge'' and ''[[ZDNet]]'' debated what had been a particularly devastating week for Apple's macOS and iOS software platforms. The former had experienced a severe security vulnerability, in which Macs running the then-latest [[macOS High Sierra]] software were vulnerable to a bug that let anyone gain administrator privileges by entering "root" as the username in system prompts, leaving the password field empty and twice clicking "unlock", gaining full access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=Anyone can hack macOS High Sierra just by typing "root" |url=https://www.wired.com/story/macos-high-sierra-hack-root/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=November 28, 2017 |accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bug was publicly disclosed on [[Twitter]], rather than through proper [[bug bounty program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Major Apple security flaw grants admin access on macOS High Sierra without password |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/28/16711782/apple-macos-high-sierra-critical-password-security-flaw |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 28, 2017 |accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple released a security fix within a day and issued an apology, stating that "regrettably we stumbled" in regards to the security of the latest updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple Releases macOS High Sierra Security Update to Fix Root Password Vulnerability |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/29/apple-fixes-root-password-bug-security-update/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 29, 2017 |accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After installing the security patch, however, file sharing was broken for users, with Apple releasing a support document with instructions to separately fix that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Apple releases update to fix critical macOS High Sierra security issue |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/29/16715246/apple-releases-high-sierra-root-security-patch |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 29, 2017 |accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its promise of "auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again", users who installed the security update while running the older 10.13.0 version of the High Sierra operating system rather than the then-newest 10.13.1 release experienced that the "root" security vulnerability was re-introduced, and persisted even after fully updating their systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=macOS update accidentally undoes Apple's "root" bug patch |url=https://www.wired.com/story/macos-update-undoes-apple-root-bug-patch/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=December 1, 2017 |accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On iOS, a date bug caused iOS devices that received local app notifications at 12:15am on December 2, 2017 to repeatedly restart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Date Bug in iOS 11.1.2 Causing Crash Loop on iPhones as December 2 Hits [Updated] |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/02/ios-11-1-2-date-bug-crash-loop/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 1, 2017 |accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users were recommended to turn off notifications for their apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rene |last=Ritchie |title=iPhone crashing on Dec. 2?

Not to say that things didn't go wrong under his watch, but product announcements and launches felt a lot tighter for sure, as did the overall quality of what Apple was releasing." He did, however, also acknowledge that such failures "may indeed have happened" with Jobs in charge, though returning to the previous praise for Jobs' quality, stating "it's almost guaranteed that given his personality that heads would have rolled, which limits future failures".&lt;ref name="zdnet rotten" /&gt;

===Manufacturing===
The company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: "Nobody wants to buy sour milk".&lt;ref name="supply" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as [[USB]], [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[NVM Express|NVMe]], [[PCI Express|PCIe]] and others in its products. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]] and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404152533/http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |archivedate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO [[Tim Cook]] said that he "[loves] India", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |title=Apple's Feeling Europe's Economic Crisis: 'Essentially Flat' Sales And A 'Slowdown' In Business, Says Cook |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/apples-feeling-europes-economic-crisis-essentially-flat-revenues/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as "really adds cost to getting product to market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'I love India, but...' |url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-i-love-india-but-247307 |website=Gadgets360 |publisher=[[NDTV]] |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Indian Apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and [[store-within-a-store]] concepts, in an effort to expand further into the market.

====Labor practices====
{{further|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Labor practices}}
The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [[outsourcing]] initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Apple insiders "believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html |work=The New York Times |first1=Charles |last1=Duhigg |first2=Keith |last2=Bradsher |title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class |date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Foxconn suicides]] occurred between January and November 2010, when 18&lt;ref name="tian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Struggle for Foxconn girl who wanted to die |work=South China Morning Post |date=December 15, 2010 |author=Lau, Mimi |location=Wuhan, Hubei}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foxconn]] (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted [[suicide]], resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.&lt;ref name="tian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scmpreport"&gt;{{cite news |title=Foxconn factories are labour camps: report |work=South China Morning Post |date=October 11, 2010 |author=Tam, Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A41M920101105 |title=Foxconn worker plunges to death at China plant: report |publisher=Reuters |date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 6:05&amp;nbsp;am EDT --&gt; The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.&lt;ref name="WSJ-Foxconn"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704026204575267603576594936 |title=Suicides Spark Inquiries |author=Jason Dean |date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |work=The Wall Street Journal |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt; Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.&lt;ref name="Fire" /&gt;

Also in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens.

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: "We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions".&lt;ref name="Fire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Apple under fire again for working conditions at Chinese factories |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 19, 2014 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in "primitive, dark and filthy dorms" where they sleep "on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room." Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Jamieson (December 23, 2014).

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category "Striding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104212545/http://climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 4, 2009 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |accessdate=October 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer".&lt;ref name="iwclimate"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672 |title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, "Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/#report|title=ClickClean|website=Click Clean|accessdate=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the "[[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]]," which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Duhigg |first1=Charles |last2=Kocieniewski |first2=David |title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 29, 2012 |date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Roland |title=Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax' |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebrahimi |first=Helia |title=Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html |newspaper=Telegraph |date=November 2, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple Inc. claims to be the single largest taxpayer to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] with an [[Tax rate|effective tax rate]] of approximately of 26% as of the Second Quarter of the Apple [[Fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.apple.com |title=Investor Relations |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the German newspaper FAZ in October 2017, Tim Cook stated, that Apple is the biggest taxpayer worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Reuters]] reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4{{nbsp}}billion which were untaxed by the [[IRS]] of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by the [[Tax law|IRC]], corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit its [[shareholder]]s it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Drawbaugh |first1=Kevin |last2=Temple-West |first2=Patrick |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-usa-tax-offshore-idUSBREA3729V20140409 |title=Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trillion: study |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/ |title=Apple Earnings Call |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2016 the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)]] announced that 2015 Irish [[GDP]] had grown by 26.3%, and 2015 Irish [[GNP]] had grown by 18.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/nie/nationalincomeandexpenditureannualresults2015/|title=National Income and Expenditure Annual Results 2015|publisher=Central Statistics|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures attracted international scorn, and were labelled by Nobel-prize winning economist, [[Paul Krugman]], as [[leprechaun economics]]. It was not until 2018 that Irish economists could definitively prove that the 2015 growth was due to Apple restructuring its controversial [[double Irish]] subsidiaries (Apple Sales International), which Apple converted into a new Irish [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes|capital allowances for intangible assets]] tax scheme (expires in January 2020). The affair required the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] to create a new measure of Irish economic growth, [[Modified gross national income|Modified GNI*]] to replace Irish GDP, given the distortion of Apple's tax schemes. Irish GDP is 143% of Irish Modified GNI*.

On August 30, 2016, after [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|a two-year investigation]], the EU Competition Commissioner concluded Apple received "illegal State aid" from Ireland. The EU ordered Apple to pay 13{{nbsp}}billion euros ($14.5{{nbsp}}billion), plus interest, in unpaid Irish taxes for 2004-2014.&lt;ref name="Apple 13 billion euros"&gt;Kanter, James and Scott, Mark (August 30, 2016) [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html Apple Must Pay Billions for Tax Breaks in Ireland, E.U.

Is the Biggest Tax Battle in History|last=Foroohar|first=Rana|date=30 August 2016|website=TIME.com|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission found that Apple had benefitted from a private Irish [[Revenue Commissioners]] tax ruling regarding its [[double Irish]] tax structure, Apple Sales International (ASI).&lt;ref name="cliff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/apple-s-irish-company-structure-key-to-eu-tax-finding-1.2775684|title=Apple’s Irish company structure key to EU tax finding|last=Taylor|first=Cliff|date=2 September 2016|work=|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using two companies for its [[double Irish]] structure, Apple was given a ruling to split ASI into two internal "branches".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-16-2926_en.htm |title=Statement by Commissioner Vestager on state aid decision that Ireland's tax benefits for Apple were illegal |publisher=European Commission |date=August 30, 2016 |accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancellor of [[Austria]], [[Christian Kern]], put this decision into perspective by stating that "every [[Vienna|Viennese]] cafe, every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Amazon 'pays less tax than sausage stall' | publisher=BBC News | date=September 2, 2016 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37259278 | access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018|April|24|df=US}}, Apple agreed to start paying €13 billion in back taxes to the Irish government, the repayments will be held in an escrow account while Apple and the Irish government continue their appeals in EU courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9ee3943e-47d3-11e8-8ae9-4b5ddcca99b3|title=Apple to start paying €13bn to Ireland over back tax claim|last=Beesley|first=Arthur|date=April 24, 2018|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
{{main|Apple Inc. litigation}}
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Court Cases Involving Apple, Inc |url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/AllNaturesOfSuit/Apple%2C%20Inc./ |publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc. |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]'', ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]'', ''[[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.]]'', and ''[[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]]''. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as [[Shell corporation|shell companies]] known as [[patent troll]]s, with no evidence of actual use of [[patent]]s in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Mullin |title=Patent troll VirnetX wants jury to give it a half-billion dollars of Apple's cash |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/virnetx-kicks-off-final-massive-patent-trolling-attempt-vs-apple/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |date=January 26, 2016 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Novet |title=Nokia sues Apple for patent infringement in the U.S. and Germany |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/21/nokia-sues-apple-for-patent-infringement-in-the-u-s-and-germany/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Swartz |title=Nokia sues Apple for patent infringement |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/12/21/nokia-sues-apple-patent-infringement/95709378/ |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, in November 2017, the [[United States International Trade Commission]] announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/15/trade_cops_probe_apples_embrace_nextend/ |title=US trade cops agree to investigate Apple's 'embrace and extend'|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|date=November 15, 2017 |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy stance===
Apple has a notable pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Apple promises to deliver AI smarts without sacrificing your privacy |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924080/apple-ai-on-device-privacy-wwdc-2016 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Yoni |last=Heisler |title=Apple is expertly trolling Android users with its new iPhone ads |url=http://bgr.com/2017/05/22/iphone-vs-android-switchers-ad-campaign/ |website=[[Boy Genius Report|BGR]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=May 22, 2017 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=Apple's latest selling point: how little it knows about you |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/apples-latest-selling-point-little-knows/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=June 8, 2015 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its [[iOS 8]] mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encryption all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cyrus |last=Farivar |title=Apple expands data encryption under iOS 8, making handover to cops moot |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/apple-expands-data-encryption-under-ios-8-making-handover-to-cops-moot/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do [[deep learning]] scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's [[iCloud]] storage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zac |last=Hall |title=Apple details how it performs on-device facial detection in latest machine learning journal entry |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/16/apple-machine-learning-journal-facial-detection/ |website=9to5Mac |date=November 16, 2017 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced "differential privacy", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' described as "trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=Apple's 'differential privacy' is about collecting your data - but not ''your'' data |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Here's How Apple Improves the iOS and Mac User Experience While Protecting Your Privacy |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/06/apple-differential-privacy-journal/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 6, 2017 |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, it donated $2.5{{nbsp}}million to the [[American Red Cross]] to aid relief efforts after [[Hurricane Sandy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weintraub |first=Seth |title=Apple donates $2.5M to Hurricane Sandy relief |url=http://9to5mac.com/2012/11/09/apple-donates-2-5-million-to-hurricane-sandy-relief/ |website=9to5Mac |date=November 9, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 it donated $5{{nbsp}}million to relief efforts for both [[Hurricane Irma]] and [[Hurricane Harvey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple donates $5M to Hand in Hand Hurricane Irma/Harvey relief, sets up iTunes donations |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/08/apple-hand-in-hand/ |website=9to5Mac |date=September 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for the [[2017 Central Mexico earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Tim Cook says Apple is donating $1 million to earthquake recovery efforts in Mexico |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/21/tim-cook-mexico-earthquake/ |website=9to5Mac |date=September 21, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also used its [[iTunes]] platform to encourage donations, including, but not limited to, help the American Red Cross in the aftermath of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Seth |last=Weintraub |title=Apple sets up Haiti donation page in iTunes |url=https://9to5mac.com/2010/01/14/apple-sets-up-haiti-donation-page-in-itunes/ |website=9to5Mac |date=January 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by similar procedure in the aftermath of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Japan earthquake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Gurman |title=Apple now taking Red Cross donations through iTunes for Japan relief fund |url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/03/12/apple-now-taking-red-cross-donations-through-itunes-for-japan-relief-fund/ |website=9to5Mac |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in the [[Philippines]] in November 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Lovejoy |title=Apple invites donations to American Red Cross to support Philippine typhoon relief |url=https://9to5mac.com/2013/11/12/apple-invites-donations-to-american-red-cross-to-support-philippine-typhoon-relief/ |website=9to5Mac |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[European migrant crisis]] in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Lovejoy |title=Apple invites Red Cross donations through iTunes to help the Mediterranean refugee crisis [Updated] |url=https://9to5mac.com/2015/09/18/itunes-refugee-appeal-red-cross/ |website=9to5Mac |date=September 18, 2015 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Apple now accepting donations via iTunes for Hurricane Harvey relief efforts |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/08/27/apple-hurricane-harvey-itunes-relief/ |website=9to5Mac |date=August 27, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2016, Apple and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, "help protect life on our planet." Apple released a special page in the [[App Store (iOS)|iTunes App Store]], Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8{{nbsp}}million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/help-the-planet-one-app-at-a-time |title=Help the planet.

==Criticism and controversies==
{{summarize|from|Criticism of Apple Inc.|better=y|section=y|date=November 2017}}
{{Main|Criticism of Apple Inc.}}
Apple has been criticised for alleged [[Business ethics|unethical business practices]] such as [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]], rash litigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|title=Apple sues itself in the foot (again)|date=May 4, 2006|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/04/apple_sa_deep_links/|work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dubious tax tactics, production methods involving the use of [[sweatshop]] labor,&lt;ref name="sweatshop1"&gt;{{citation|title=The Stark Reality of iPod's Chinese Factories|date=August 18, 2006|url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sweatshop2"&gt;{{citation|last=Musgrove|first=Mike|title=Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported|date=June 16, 2006|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sweatshop3"&gt;{{citation|last=Kahney|first=Leander|title=Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge|date=June 13, 2006|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; customer service issues involving allegedly misleading warranties and insufficient [[data security]], as well as its products' environmental footprint.

[[File:Ploeger BP 2000 bean harvester.jpg|thumb|A Ploeger bean harvester (fitted with a spinach header)]]
A '''bean harvester''', also known as a bean [[threshing machine|thresher]] or bean [[combine harvester|combine]], is a threshing machine which is used to [[harvest]] beans. It mainly consists of a pickup, several beaters, shakers, one or several [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]], [[elevator#Material handling belts and belt elevators|elevators]], [[conveyor belts]], a storage bin, and usually a spreader at the rear. Until recently, the only practical manufacturer of bean harvesters was [[The Bidwell Bean Thresher Company]]. 

==Process==

The pickup lifts the beans, which are arranged into [[windrows]] by [[rake (tool)|rake]]s and pullers, off the ground and onto the main conveyor belt which feeds them into the first beater, which has many metal teeth, turns high [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]s, and does a significant portion of the threshing. From there the process varies from machine to machine. Basically the beans go through a series of more beaters and shakers.

'''BioImage''' was established in 1993 as a drug discovery research unit within [[Novo Nordisk]]. The research unit was led by Ole Thastrup and spun out of [[Novo Nordisk]] in 1999.

BioImage specializes in developing and selling proprietary [[bioassay]]s to [[biopharmaceutical]] companies and research institutions.  It also develops bioassays on a contract service basis.

BioImage has made broad [[patent]]s covering [[EGFP|Enhanced GFP]] (EGFP), GFP-based biosensors and any genetically encoded [[fusion protein|protein fusion]] to a [[luminophore]], with subsequent monitoring of the [[protein]]'s [[Protein translocation|translocation]] within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] as the primary readout for [[drug discovery]] assays.  This intellectual property, trademarked Redistribution, allows many collaborations and out-licensing activities with biopharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioimage.com/technology.htm|title=Life Technologies|website=www.bioimage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Merger ==

In April 2006, BioImage was acquired by [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]]. The merger was complete in November 2006, and technology transfer to a US site was completed during 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioimage.com/pdf/CEOletter.pdf|title=Life Technologies|website=www.bioimage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biosolid.pumpkin.row.jpg|thumb|300px|Pumpkin seedlings planted out on windrows of composted biosolids]]
'''Biosolids''' is a term used for several types of treated [[sewage sludge]]s that can be used as [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=L.K|last2=Shammas|first2=N.K|last3=Hung|first3=Yung-Tse|title=Biosolids treatment processes|date=2007|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J|isbn=9781592599967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treated sewage sludge has long been [[Reuse of excreta|used in agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Land Treatment of Waste Water|last=Gohil|first=M.B.|date=2000|publisher=New Age International|isbn=8122412270|edition=|volume=|location=|page=6|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are concerns about offensive [[odor]]s and disease risks from [[pathogen]]s and [[toxic]] chemicals. This may reduce public acceptance of such reuse activities.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Terminology ==

Biosolids may be defined as organic wastewater solids that can be reused after suitable [[sewage sludge treatment]] processes leading to sludge stabilization such as [[anaerobic digestion]] and [[composting]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title = Wastewater engineering : treatment and reuse|publisher = Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA|isbn = 0-07-112250-8|page = 1449|edition = 4th|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the biosolids definition may be restricted by local regulations to wastewater solids only after those solids have completed a specified treatment sequence and/or have concentrations of pathogens and toxic chemicals below specified levels.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines the two terms – sewage sludge and biosolids – in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 as follows: ''Sewage sludge'' refers to the solids separated during the treatment of municipal wastewater (including domestic [[septage]]), while ''biosolids'' refers to treated sewage sludge that meets the EPA pollutant and pathogen requirements for land application and surface disposal.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/water/npdes/sludge.html |title=Sewage Sludge/Biosolids Program |last= |first= |website= |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar definition has been used internationally, for example in Australia.&lt;ref name="awa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biosolids.com.au/what-are-biosolids.php |title=What are biosolids? |last= |first= |website= |publisher=Australian Water Association |accessdate=24 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423124151/http://www.biosolids.com.au/what-are-biosolids.php |archivedate=23 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term "biosolids" may officially be subject to government regulations. However, informal use describes a broad range of semi-solid organic products produced from [[sewage]] or sewage sludge. This could include any solids, slime solids or liquid slurry residue generated during the treatment of domestic sewage including scum and solids removed during primary, [[secondary treatment|secondary]] or advanced treatment processes.&lt;ref name="wwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwdmag.com/biosolids-or-sludge-semantics-terminology|title=Biosolids or Sludge? The Semantics of Terminology|last=Turovskiy|first=Izrail S.|website=|publisher=Water and Wastes Digest|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials that do not conform to the regulatory definition of "biosolids" can be given alternative terms like "wastewater solids".

=== Quantities  ===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 4522 Testing for pathogens in agricultural soil containing biosolids.jpg|thumb|Testing for human pathogens in cereal crops after the application of biosolids.]]Approximately 7.1 million dry tons of biosolids were generated in 2004 at approximately 16,500 [[Sewage treatment|municipal wastewater treatment facilities]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=wef/&gt;

In the United States, as of 2013 about 55% of sewage solids are turned into [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="black_gold"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=176822392 Cities Turn Sewage Into 'Black Gold' For Local Farms] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges faced when increasing the use of biosolids include,  the capital needed to build [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]] and the complexity of complying with health regulations. There are also new concerns about micro-pollutions in sewage (e.g. [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s) which make the process of producing high quality biosolids complex.&lt;ref name="Smith, S. R. 2009"&gt;Smith, S. R. (2009). Organic contaminants in sewage sludge (biosolids) and their significance for agricultural recycling. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 367(1904), 4005-4041&lt;/ref&gt; Some municipalities, states or countries have banned the use of biosolids on farmland.&lt;ref name="Smith, S. R. 2009"/&gt;

=== Nutrients ===
Encouraging agricultural use of biosolids is intended to prevent filling landfills with nutrient-rich organic materials from the treatment of domestic sewage that might be recycled and applied as fertilizer to improve and maintain productive soils and stimulate plant growth.&lt;ref name="wef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nviro.com/files/Biosolids_Facts.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404072822/http://www.nviro.com/files/Biosolids_Facts.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 April 2015 |title=Questions and Answers on Land Application of Biosolids  |last= |first= |website= |publisher=Water Environment Federation |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosolids can be an ideal agricultural conditioner and fertilizer&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R. (1998). The use of biosolids from wastewater treatment plants in agriculture. Environmental Management and Health, 9(4), 165-169.&lt;/ref&gt; which can help promote crop growth to feed the increasing population. Biosolids may contain macronutrients [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[sulphur]] with micronutrients [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[boron]], [[molybdenum]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name="awa" /&gt;

=== Industrial and man-made contaminants ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and others have shown that biosolids can contain measurable levels of [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic organic compounds]], [[radionuclide]]s and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]].&lt;ref name="awa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biosolids: Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey Report - Overview {{!}} Biosolids {{!}} US EPA|url = http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/tnsss-overview.cfm|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/docs/tenorm/832-r-03-002b.pdf|title = ISCORS Assessment of Radioactivity in Sewage  Sludge: Recommendations on Management of  Radioactive Materials in Sewage Sludge and Ash  at Publicly Owned Treatment Works|date = April 2004|accessdate = 18 May 2015|website = United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|publisher = Interagency Steering Committee on Radiation Standards|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has set numeric limits for [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], copper, [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], molybdenum, [[nickel]], [[selenium]], and zinc but has not regulated dioxin levels.&lt;ref name="wef" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Final Action Not to Regulate Dioxins in Land-Applied Sewage Sludge {{!}} Biosolids {{!}} US EPA|url = http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/dioxinfs.cfm|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contaminants from pharmaceuticals and personal care products and some steroids and hormones may also be present in biosolids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CWA Analytical Methods: Contaminants of Emerging Concern|url = https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/cwa-analytical-methods-contaminants-emerging-concern|website = epa.gov|accessdate = 2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Substantial levels of persistent, [[bioaccumulative]] and toxic (PBT) [[polybrominated diphenyl ether]]s were detected in biosolids in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flame retardants: Persistent pollutants in land-applied sludges|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=412|issue=6843|pages=140–141|doi=10.1038/35084130|pmid=11449259|vauthors=Hale RC, La Guardia MJ, Harvey EP, Gaylor MO, Mainor TM, Duff WH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Geological Survey]] analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. These analysis detected 55 of the 87 organic chemicals measured in at least one of the nine biosolid samples, with as many as 45 chemicals found in a single sample.&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/regional/emc/municipal_biosolids.html |title=Land Application of Municipal Biosolids |last= |first= |website=Environmental Health - Toxic Substances |publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the City of Charlotte discovered extreme levels of PCB's in their biosolids after being alerted by SCDHEC that illegal PCB dumping was taking place at regional waste water treatment plants across the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9095525.html|title=Task force named to probe chemical dumping|work=charlotteobserver|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosolids land application was halted after an emergency regulation was enacted by SCDHEC that outlawed any PCB contaminated biosolids from being land applied regardless if Class A or Class B.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926153115/http://www.scdhec.gov/administration/news/2013/nr20130925-01.htm|title=S.C. DHEC: News - DHEC Issues Emergency Regulation, Expands Investigation into PCBs Found at Water Treatment Plants|date=2013-09-26|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very soon thereafter, SCDHEC expanded PCB fish consumption adviseries for nearly every waterway bordering biosolids land application fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scdhec.gov/FoodSafety/FishConsumptionAdvisories/#Map|title=DHEC: Fish Consumption Advisories|last=Control|first=S.C. Dept. of Health and Environmental|website=scdhec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathogens ===
In the United States the EPA mandates certain treatment processes designed to significantly decrease levels of certain so-called [[indicator organism]]s, in biosolids.&lt;ref name="wef" /&gt; These include, "...operational standards for fecal coliforms, ''Salmonella'' sp. bacteria, enteric viruses, and viable [[helminth]] ova."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biosolids Applied to Land: Advancing Standards and Practices|last = |first = |publisher = National Academy of Sciences|year = 2002|isbn = 0-309-08486-5|location = |pages = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the US-based Water Environment Research Foundation has shown that some pathogens do survive [[sewage sludge treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assessing the Fate of Emerging Pathogens in Biosolids|url = http://www.werf.org/WERFDownload.aspx?ContentKey=9a2ee773-f7e3-4d50-9e6e-0a7c96d26e0a&amp;ContentItemKey=989e1b81-5b11-4871-97d9-98aeef322f08|website = Water Environment Research Foundation|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA regulations allow only biosolids with no detectable pathogens to be widely applied; those with remaining pathogens are restricted in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biosolids FAQ, Questions 17-18|url = http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/wastewater/treatment/biosolids/genqa.cfm|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different types of biosolids ==
# Anaerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the absence of oxygen either at mesophilic (at 35&amp;nbsp;°C) or thermophilic (between 50° and 57&amp;nbsp;°C) temperatures.

# Aerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the presence of oxygen either at ambient and mesophilic (10&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C) or auto-thermal (40&amp;nbsp;°C to 80&amp;nbsp;°C) temperatures.

# Composting: A biological process where organic matter decomposes to produce humus after the addition of some dry bulking material such as sawdust, wood chips, or shredded yard waste under controlled aerobic conditions.

# Alkaline Treatment: The sludge is mixed with alkaline materials such as lime or cement kiln dust, or incinerator fly ash and maintained at pH above 12 for 24 hours (for Class B) or at temperature 70&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 minutes (for Class A).

# Heat Drying: Either convention or conduction dryers are used to dry the [[Sport|biosolids]]

# Dewatering: The separation of the water from biosolids is done to obtain a semi-solid or solid product by using a dewatering technologies (centrifuges, belt filter presses, plate and frame filter presses, and drying beds and lagoons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/Resources/waste/biosolids/pn_1448_biosolids_esoc_final_e.pdf|title=Emerging substances of concern in biosolids: concentrations and effects of treatment processes|last=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment.|first=|date=2010|website=https://www.ccme.ca/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification systems ==

=== United States ===
In the United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 governs the management of biosolids. Within that federal regulation biosolids are generally classified differently depending upon the quantity of pollutants they contain and the level of treatment they have been subjected to (the latter of which determines both the level of vector attraction reduction and the level of pathogen reduction). These factors also affect how they may be disseminated (bulk or bagged) and the level of monitoring oversight which, in turn determines where and in what quantity they may be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Plain English Guide to the EPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule, Chapter 2 "Land Application of Biosolids"|url = http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/upload/2002_06_28_mtb_biosolids_503pe_503pe_2.pdf|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-20|page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
The European Union (EU) was the first to issue regulations for biosolids land application; this aimed to put a limit to the pathogen and pollution risk.&lt;ref&gt;Iranpour, R., Cox, H. H. J., Kearney, R. J., Clark, J. H., Pincince, A. B., &amp; Daigger, G. T. (2004). Regulations for biosolids land application in US and European Union. Journal of Residuals Science &amp; Technology, 1(4), 209-22.&lt;/ref&gt; These risks come from the fact that some metabolites remain intact after waste water treatment processes.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, R. M., &amp; Cummins, E. (2015). Evaluation of “classic” and emerging contaminants resulting from the application of biosolids to agricultural lands: A review. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 21(2), 492-513.&lt;/ref&gt; Debates over biosolid use vary in severity acros the EU&lt;ref&gt;Iranpour, R., Cox, H. H. J., Kearney, R. J., Clark, J. H., Pincince, A. B., &amp; Daigger, G. T. (2004).Regulations for biosolids land application in US and European Union. Journal of Residuals Science &amp; Technology, 1(4), 209-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and gathering acceptance is the major hurdle facing biosolids in Europe.

== History ==
{{Further|Sewage sludge#History}}
As public concern arose about the disposal of increased volumes of solids in the United States being removed from sewage during [[sewage treatment]] mandated by the [[Clean Water Act]]. The [[Water Environment Federation]] (WEF) sought a new name to distinguish the clean, agriculturally viable product generated by modern wastewater treatment from earlier forms of sewage sludge widely remembered for causing offensive or dangerous conditions. Of three-hundred suggestions, ''biosolids'' was attributed to Dr. Bruce Logan of the [[University of Arizona]], and recognized by WEF in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thewatchers.us/wef/explain.pdf |title=Biosolids: A Short Explanation and Discussion |last= |first= |website=WEF/U.S. EPA Biosolids Fact Sheet Project |publisher=Water Environment Federation |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Computer Exchange, also called the BCE and '''BoCoEx''', were in operation before the Internet became widely available to the general public. Their [[Bulletin Board System]]-based marketplace utilized  [[Delphi online service]] as a platform for an on-line database of products where buyers and sellers bought, sold and traded computers.  The company pioneered efforts to create a fully automated, on-line auction and trade systems for general commerce and eventually turned into an Internet-based business.

== Origins ==
Boston Computer Exchange was founded in 1982 as a marketplace for people who wanted to sell their used computers. Initially it was a paper database  but quickly moved into a computerized database using Alpha 2 database manager on a dual floppy IBM PC.  Nascent bulletin board systems were just being developed and the founders struck a mutual agreement with the owners of the [[Delphi online service]] bulletin board system to post the database on their public access system.  The first database upload was on March 4, 1983. Fresh data was posted every day from that day until the business closed in the 1990s. The database was also posted as a searchable database on [[Boston CitiNet|YellowData]], and then [[Boston CitiNet]].  Later, when [[CompuServe]] opened their Electronic Mall in 1989, Boston Computer Exchange had the first store on that Mall, too.

== Founders ==

The founders of the Boston Computer Exchange were Alexander Randall 5th and Cameron Hall.  Randall held a PhD in General Systems research or [[Systems Theory]] and Hall had degrees in Economics. They fused their interest in creating a computerized marketplace for trade. The husband and wife started the business on the dining room table and worked together on it steadily for the next 10 years. Hall and Randall had previously owned several small entrepreneurial ventures.  Randall was the Godson of [[J. Presper Eckert]] and had been involved with computers from childhood.  Hall's father had been involved with modems from the earliest days of datacomm - so each brought special skills to the project.

== Early designs of automated trading ==
Like later Internet based e-commerce systems such as [[eBay]], sellers uploaded inventory to a database, buyers browsed inventory online but in this pre-Internet era, they consummated transactions by telephone. Buyers then paid Sellers, Sellers shipped goods to Buyers and the Exchange billed the seller a commission. After several years of operations and some bad transactions, the Exchange invented an [[escrow]] services to protect buyers, sellers and the Exchange itself. The absence of a verifiable way to close credit card transactions on-line prevented an "all on-line" trade system.

In 1986, the Exchange created an electronic trading system that was showcased at the [[COMDEX]] Trade Show in Las Vegas which attracting wide attention to their vision of an all-electronic, all "on-line" system for buying and selling all types of equipment.  The '''BCENE''' auction trading system pre-dated all other efforts to create on-line trade and was widely viewed as a major innovation in how commerce would be conducted in all business areas. [[Standard Oil]] Company brought BoCoEx under contract and secured all rights to the system seeking advice on how to create a world-scale on-line trading system. Standard Oil pursued this for several years until that oil company was sold to [[British Petroleum]] and the idea was shelved but not scrapped.  Standard Oil tried to sell the idea and the BoCoEx contracts to other companies and eventually abandoned the effort and released Randall and Hall from their exclusive consulting contracts.

== BoCoEx Index ==

On advice from futurist Wes Thomas, the Boston Computer Exchange created a weekly price report - called the '''BoCoEx Index''', a report on the High, Low and Closing Price on the Exchange for the most popular computer models.  Starting in 1983, this price list became a standard tool for assessing the value of computers in court cases, after market sales and in valuations of assets in corporate mergers and acquisitions. The report was published every week in [[ComputerWorld]] and [[PC Week]] magazines. The report dominated the used computer after market and was a standard news item in other computer magazines, much like stock prices in a daily newspaper.  The BoCoEx Index was also a regular feature on the Business Radio Network and was used to create a ten-year report on the price declines of popular computer models.

== Seat on the Exchange ==

The founders sought to create trading partners to trade on the exchange and they wrote a book of instructions called a "Seat on the Exchange." It was first offered in 1986 and expanded in several subsequent editions. The book was a set of tools for creating a free standing computer trading enterprise in any city.  At the peak there were 150 "Computer Exchanges" that had licensed technology from Boston Computer Exchange. Among them were the Southern Computer Exchange, The NaComEx, and "seats" in such places as San Francisco, Virginia, Maryland, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York, and as far afield as Santiago Chile, Stockholm and Leningrad in Russia.  The "Seat" book detailed the operations of the business and provided access to a national database operating on a private server.

Randall also authored the "Used Computer Handbook" for [[Microsoft Press]] in 1990 which detailed how to safely buy and sell computers in the after market. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/10/science/personal-computers-finding-a-home-for-last-year-s-model.html NY Times article on BCE and Seat Book]

== Decomposition and demise ==

On Jan 1, 1990, Randall and Hall sold the Exchange to ValCom - a computer retailer - and that business did not choose to vigorously pursue the on-line aspects of the Boston Computer Exchange - rather they focused on using the Exchange to sell excess inventory from the ValCom Stores.  Nevertheless, the Exchange did create an "All Auctions" system in the early 1990s. The whole enterprise was later sold to [[Compaq]] Corporation and subsequently to [[Hewlett-Packard]]. The Boston Computer Exchange eventually ceased to operate and was closed.

Hall died of cancer in 1998. Randall is presently professor of communication at the [[University of the Virgin Islands]].

'''''Chappie''''' (stylized as '''''CHAPPiE''''') is a 2015 American [[List of dystopian films|dystopian]] [[science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[crime thriller]] film directed by [[Neill Blomkamp]] and written by Blomkamp and [[Terri Tatchell]]. It stars [[Sharlto Copley]], [[Dev Patel]], [[Jose Pablo Cantillo]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Hugh Jackman]], and [[Watkin Tudor Jones|Ninja]] and [[Yolandi Visser]] of the South African [[zef]] [[rap-rave]] group [[Die Antwoord]] as metafictional versions of themselves.  The film, set and shot in [[Johannesburg]], is about an artificially intelligent law enforcement robot captured and taught by gangsters, who nickname it Chappie.

''Chappie'' premiered in New York City on March 4, 2015, and was released in U.S. cinemas on March 6, 2015. The film grossed $102 million worldwide against a $49 million budget.

== Plot ==
A skyrocketing crime rate leads the city of [[Johannesburg]], South Africa to buy a squadron of scouts—state-of-the-art armour-plated attack robots—from weapons manufacturer Tetravaal.  These autonomous androids are developed by British scientist Deon Wilson and largely supplant the overwhelmed human police force. A competing project within the company is the remotely controlled MOOSE, developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore. Deon is praised for Tetravaal's success but Vincent grows envious when the police are unwilling to give his heavy weapons platform equal attention.

At home, Deon creates a prototype [[artificial intelligence]] that mimics a human mind to the point of feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley refuses to let him test the A.I. on a police robot. Undeterred, Deon steals a recently damaged robot before it is destroyed and puts it in his van, along with the "guard key" needed to update the robot's software.

On his way home, he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika, who threaten to kill him unless he reprograms a police robot to help them steal. Deon installs the new software into the damaged robot, which responds with child-like trepidation upon powering up. Deon and Yolandi calm the robot, teaching it words and naming it "Chappie". Despite Deon wanting to stay with the robot, Ninja forces him out of their hideout.

Ninja's gang only has a few days to pay a debt of 20 million [[South African rand|rand]] to Hippo, a powerful gangster. Yolandi sees Chappie as a child and wants to mother him, but Ninja grows impatient with his development due to both the impending deadline for the debt and Chappie's irreplaceable battery running out, giving him days to live. Ninja tries to train Chappie to be a gangster by leaving him in a dangerous neighborhood to fend for himself. After being wounded by thugs, he is followed by Vincent, who plans to deactivate all Tetravaal scouts except for MOOSE. Vincent successfully extracts the guard key for his own use, but the traumatized Chappie escapes and returns to the hideout. Yolandi scolds Ninja for this mistreatment, but he manages to earn Chappie's forgiveness by training him in martial arts and weapon handling. Ninja and Amerika trick Chappie into stealing cars for them, and lie about needing the money to replace his dying body.

At Tetravaal, Vincent uses the guard key to upload a virus, thus sabotaging and disabling all scouts including Chappie. Johannesburg's criminals immediately run rampant in the streets, and Deon brings Chappie to the Tetravaal factory to fix him. After being restarted, Chappie notices a helmet used to control MOOSE. At the hideout, he re-engineers it to allow him to transfer his consciousness into a computer, so he can change bodies when his current one dies. Ninja's gang uses Chappie to rob an armored car, an act which is caught on the news, prompting Tetravaal to pursue him. When Chappie learns that Ninja's plan to acquire the body was a lie, he prepares to kill Ninja for betrayal. However, Deon arrives to warn them that Michelle Bradley has ordered that Chappie be destroyed. At that moment, the MOOSE robot (controlled remotely by Vincent) is launched to assassinate Deon and Chappie at the hideout, at the same time that Hippo arrives to collect his debt. Amerika and Hippo are killed in the ensuing battle, while Deon is mortally wounded. When Ninja is about to be killed, Yolandi sacrifices herself to save him and Chappie destroys MOOSE by detonating a bomb.

Enraged by Yolandi's death, Chappie drives Deon to the factory, storms into an office, and fiercely beats Vincent close to death. He then transfers the dying Deon's consciousness into a spare robot through the modified MOOSE helmet. In return, the now-robotic Deon wirelessly transfers Chappie's consciousness into one of the nearby disabled scouts. Deon and Chappie go into hiding as the police discontinue their contract with Tetravaal. While burning memorabilia of Yolandi, the grieving Ninja finds a box containing a doll copy of her and a flash drive marked "Mommy's Consciousness Test Backup" which contains a copy of Yolandi's consciousness that Chappie took while testing the device on her. Chappie hacks into Tetravaal's manufacturing facility, builds a robot resembling Yolandi, and uploads the drive's contents.

== Cast ==
* [[Sharlto Copley]] as Chappie, a robot. Copley acted out the scenes in front of the camera interacting with the rest of the cast and lent his voice. Contrary to a 2014 story by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'',&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Visual Effects Supervisor Chris Harvey explained that the production did not use [[motion capture]], and Copley's performance was used only as a reference by the animators who replaced him with the [[Computer animation|CGI]] for Chappie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofvfx.com/chappie-2/|title=CHAPPIE: Chris Harvey - VFX Supervisor - Image Engine - The Art of VFX|author=Vincent Frei|work=The Art of VFX|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blomkamp has said that ''Chappie'' is "basically based" on ''Tetra Vaal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Exclusive: Neill Blomkamp on his next sci-fi film, Chappie|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/chappie/25920/exclusive-neill-blomkamp-on-his-next-sci-fi-film-chappie|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blomkamp also employed a robot with a similar design in his 2005 short [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCS0hNyJf6k ''Tempbot''], and both ''Tempbot'' and his 2006 short/advertisement [[Yellow (2006 short film)|''Yellow'']] deal with a thinking and learning robot which tries to assimilate into society.

Blomkamp has cited the ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'' character Briareos as an influence on the design of Chappie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/chappie/25920/exclusive-neill-blomkamp-on-his-next-sci-fi-film-chappie|title=Exclusive: Neill Blomkamp on his next sci-fi film, Chappie|work=Den of Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 32% approval rating, based on 207 reviews, and a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 4.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Chappie'' boasts more of the big ideas and visual panache that director Neill Blomkamp has become known for — and, sadly, more of the narrative shortcomings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chappie/ |title=Chappie (2015) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 41 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/chappie|title=Chappie Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film a grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |url=http://deadline.com/2015/03/weekend-box-office-chappie-vince-vaughn-unfinished-business-bomb-1201388029/ |title='Chappie' Presides Over Listless Frame, Vince Vaughn At Career Low – Monday Actuals |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=March 9, 2015 |accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Intelligence, artificial or otherwise, is one of the major casualties of ''Chappie'', a robot-themed action movie that winds up feeling as clunky and confused as the childlike droid with which it shares its name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/film-review-chappie-1201445845/|title=Film Review: 'Chappie'|last=Chang|first=Justin|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 4, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "With unappealing one-note characters, retread concepts and implausible motivations, ''Chappie'' is a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/chappie/review/779116|title='Chappie': Film Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 4, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tim Grierson of ''[[Screen International]]'' wrote, "...despite his ambitions, ''Chappie'' is a bucket of bolts, Blomkamp's desire to say meaningful things outdistancing his ability to say them compellingly."&lt;ref name="screen-daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/chappie/5083876.article?|title=Chappie|last=Grierson|first=Tim|work=[[Screen International]]|date=March 4, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Blomkamp "struggles with the material" but "even at his shakiest, Mr. Blomkamp holds your attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/movies/review-chappie-a-smart-robot-in-a-violent-future.html?&amp;_r=0|title=Review: 'Chappie': a Smart Robot in a Violent Future|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "cartoonish and preposterous, and not in a good way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-chappie-review-20150306-column.html?|title=Review Oddly, the robot is the least robotic thing about 'Chappie'|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' rated it three out of four stars and wrote of Blomkamp, "It's hard to say how much he's doing consciously and how much he's doing through intuition, but he's doing really interesting things in ''Chappie'', and right from the beginning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Chappie-sci-fi-action-with-a-soul-6116783.php|title='Chappie' review: sci-fi action with a soul|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Huddleston of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' rated it four out of five stars and wrote that "this hugely entertaining oddity could never be mistaken for the work of any other filmmaker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/chappie|title=Chappie|last=Huddleston|first=Tom|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ryan Lambie, from denofgeek.com, gave the film a positive review stating, "Despite the ragged edges of its story, ''Chappie'' nevertheless has real heart beating under its shabby exterior.

He praised Sharlto Copley's performance and the "big questions" it asks, but criticized its failure to answer those questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/chappie-review |author=Josh Lasser |publisher=IGN |title=Chappie Review |date=March 4, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviewers compared the Chappie character unfavorably to [[Jar Jar Binks]] of ''[[Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/06/chappie-reviews-are|title = Critical Mass: Chappie reviews let the Jar-Jar jokes fly|last = Labrecque|first = Jeff|work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date = March 6, 2015|accessdate = March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sameen Amer of ''[[The Express Tribune]]'' opined that the film disregards logic as certain "existential quandaries" are randomly thrown in without straightening out any of the themes before moving on to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Film review: Chappie - brain dead  - The Express Tribune|url = http://tribune.com.pk/story/917108/film-review-brain-dead/|accessdate = July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1899">'''DFMA''' stands for Design for Manufacture and Assembly.  DFMA is the combination of two methodologies; [[Design for manufacturability|Design for Manufacture]], which means the design for ease of manufacture of the parts that will form a product, and [[Design for assembly|Design for Assembly]], which means the design of the product for ease of assembly.

==Usage==
DFMA is used as the basis for [[concurrent engineering]] studies to provide guidance to the design team in simplifying the product structure, to reduce manufacturing and assembly costs, and to quantify improvements. The practice of applying DFMA is to identify, quantify and eliminate waste or inefficiency in a product design. DFMA is therefore a component of [[Lean Manufacturing]]
DFMA is also used as a benchmarking tool to study competitors’ products, and as a should cost tool to assist in supplier negotiations.&lt;ref&gt; Boothroyd, G., Dewhurst, P. and Knight, W., “Product Design for Manufacture and Assembly, 2nd Edition”, Marcel Dekker, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
DFMA is the name of the integrated set of software products from Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc. that are used by companies to implement the DFMA methodology.  DFMA is a registered trademark of Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc.

[[File:Alte Batzenalpe 2014 Interior 06.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Old mountain pasture dairy in [[Schröcken]], [[Vorarlberg]], Austria, in the [[Bregenz Forest]]]]
A '''dairy''' is a [[business enterprise]] established for the harvesting or processing (or both) of animal [[milk]] – mostly from [[cattle|cows]] or [[goat]]s, but also from [[Water buffalo|buffaloes]], [[sheep]], [[horse]]s, or [[camel]]s – for human consumption. A dairy is typically located on a dedicated [[dairy farming|dairy farm]] or in a section of a multi-purpose farm (mixed farm) that is concerned with the harvesting of milk.

Terminology differs between countries. For example, in the [[United States]], an entire dairy farm is commonly called a "dairy". The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a "milking parlor" or "parlor". The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm's "milk house". Milk is then hauled (usually by [[truck]]) to a "dairy plant" = also referred to as a "dairy" - where raw milk is further processed{{by whom|date=November 2017}} and prepared for commercial sale of [[dairy products]]. In [[New Zealand]], farm areas for milk harvesting are also called "milking parlours", and are historically known as "milking sheds".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} As in the [[United States]], sometimes milking sheds are referred to by their type, such as "herring bone shed" or "pit parlour". Parlour design has evolved from simple barns or sheds to large rotary structures in which the workflow (throughput of cows) is very efficiently handled. In some countries, especially those with small numbers of animals being milked, the farm may perform the functions of a dairy plant, processing their own milk into salable [[dairy products]], such as [[butter]], [[cheese]], or [[yogurt]]. This on-site processing is a traditional method of producing specialist milk products, common in Europe.

In the United States a ''dairy'' can also be a place that processes, distributes and sells [[dairy product]]s, or a room, building or establishment where milk is stored and processed into milk products, such as [[butter]] or [[cheese]]. In [[New Zealand English]] the singular use of the word ''[[dairy (store)|dairy]]'' almost exclusively refers to a [[corner shop]], or [[superette]]. This usage is historical as such shops were a common place for the public to buy milk products.

As an attributive, the word ''dairy'' refers to milk-based products, derivatives and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their production: for example [[dairy cattle]], [[dairy goat]]. A dairy [[farm]] produces milk and a dairy [[factory]] processes it into a variety of dairy products. These establishments constitute the global '''dairy industry''', a component of the [[food industry]].

==History==
Milk producing animals have been domesticated for thousands of years. Initially, they were part of the [[subsistence farming]] that [[nomads]] engaged in. As the community moved about the country, their animals accompanied them. Protecting and feeding the animals were a big part of the [[symbiotic relationship]] between the animals and the [[herd]]ers.

In the more recent past, people in [[agriculture|agricultural societies]] owned dairy animals that they milked for domestic and local (village) consumption, a typical example of a [[cottage industry]]. The animals might serve multiple purposes (for example, as a draught animal for pulling a [[plough]] as a youngster, and at the end of its useful life as [[meat]]). In this case the animals were normally milked by hand and the herd size was quite small, so that all of the animals could be milked in less than an hour—about 10 per milker. These tasks were performed by a ''dairymaid'' (''dairywoman'') or ''dairyman''. The word ''dairy'' harkens back to Middle English ''dayerie'', ''deyerie'', from ''deye'' (female servant or dairymaid) and further back to Old English ''dæge'' (kneader of bread).

With [[Industrial Revolution|industrialisation]] and [[urbanisation]], the supply of milk became a commercial industry, with specialised [[List of breeds of cattle|breeds of cattle]] being developed for dairy, as distinct from [[beef]] or [[Working animals#Animals used for their strength|draught]] animals. Initially, more people were employed as milkers, but it soon turned to [[Mechanization|mechanisation]] with machines designed to do the milking.

[[File:Milking-a-cow-past.jpg|thumb|left|Farmer milking a cow by hand]]
Historically, the [[milking]] and the [[Food processing|processing]] took place close together in space and time: on a [[dairy farming|dairy farm]]. People milked the animals by hand; on farms where only small numbers are kept, hand-milking may still be practiced. Hand-milking is accomplished by grasping the [[teat]]s (often pronounced ''tit'' or ''tits'') in the hand and expressing milk either by squeezing the fingers progressively, from the [[udder]] end to the tip, or by squeezing the teat between thumb and index finger, then moving the hand downward from udder towards the end of the teat. The action of the hand or fingers is designed to close off the milk duct at the udder (upper) end and, by the movement of the fingers, close the duct progressively to the tip to express the trapped milk. Each half or quarter of the udder is emptied one milk-duct capacity at a time.

The ''stripping'' action is repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods result in the milk that was trapped in the [[milk duct]] being squirted out the end into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of the milker, who usually sits on a low stool.

Traditionally the cow, or cows, would stand in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]] or paddock while being milked. Young stock, [[cattle|heifer]]s, would have to be trained to remain still to be milked. In many countries, the cows were tethered to a post and milked.

==Structure of the industry==
[[File:Wawa Dairy Farms.JPG|thumb|[[Wawa Inc.|Wawa Dairy Farms]] in [[Pennsylvania]]]]
While most countries produce their own milk products, the structure of the dairy industry varies in different parts of the world. In major milk-producing countries most milk is distributed through whole sale markets. In Ireland and Australia, for example, farmers' co-operatives own many of the large-scale processors, while in the United States many farmers and processors do business through individual contracts. In the United States, the country's 196 [[farmers' cooperatives]] sold 86% of milk in the U.S. in 2002, with five cooperatives accounting for half that. This was down from 2,300 cooperatives in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="rurdev"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, the past practice of farmers marketing milk in their own neighborhoods is changing rapidly. Notable developments include considerable foreign investment in the dairy industry and a growing role for dairy cooperatives. Output of milk is growing rapidly in such countries and presents a major source of income growth for many farmers.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0521e/i0521e00.pdf Milk for Health and Wealth]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, FAO, Rome, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other branches of the food industry, dairy processing in the major dairy producing countries has become increasingly concentrated, with fewer but larger and more efficient plants operated by fewer workers. This is notably the case in the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In 2009, charges of [[anti-trust]] violations have been made against major dairy industry players in the United States, which critics call '''Big Milk'''.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112002639 Independent Farmers Feel Squeezed By Milk Cartel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311211135/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112002639 |date=2011-03-11 }} by John Burnett.  All Things Considered, National Public Radio. 20 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another round of [[price fixing]] charges was settled in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/06/07/judge-approves-settlement-northeast-dairy-farmers/gDtYBPE6tu5DwW9K3oelIK/story.html|title=Judge approves $50m settlement to Northeast dairy farmers|website=Bostonglobe.com|date=2016-06-08|author=Lisa Rathke|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819011602/https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/06/07/judge-approves-settlement-northeast-dairy-farmers/gDtYBPE6tu5DwW9K3oelIK/story.html|archivedate=2016-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government intervention in milk markets was common in the 20th century. A limited anti-trust exemption was created for U.S. dairy cooperatives by the [[Capper-Volstead Act]] of 1922. In the 1930s, some U.S. states adopted price controls, and Federal Milk Marketing Orders started under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and continue in the 2000s. The Federal Milk Price Support Program began in 1949.&lt;ref name="rurdev" /&gt; The [[Northeast Dairy Compact]] regulated wholesale milk prices in New England from 1997 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants producing liquid milk and products with short shelf life, such as yogurts, creams and soft cheeses, tend to be located on the outskirts of urban centres close to consumer markets. Plants manufacturing items with longer shelf life, such as butter, milk powders, cheese and whey powders, tend to be situated in rural areas closer to the milk supply.  Most large processing plants tend to specialise in a limited range of products. Exceptionally, however, large plants producing a wide range of products are still common in Eastern Europe, a holdover from the former centralized, supply-driven concept of the market under Communist governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Thomas|last2=Taylor|first2=Robert|title=Scientific farm animal production: an introduction to animal science|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-8120343986}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As processing plants grow fewer and larger, they tend to acquire bigger, more automated and more efficient equipment. While this technological tendency keeps manufacturing costs lower, the need for long-distance transportation often increases the environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agrifood-forum.net/publications/guide ''Cleaner Production Assessment in Dairy Processing''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214113504/http://www.agrifood-forum.net/publications/guide/ |date=2009-02-14 }}, by COWI Consulting Engineers and Planners, United Nations Environment Programme Division of Technology, Industry, and Economics, Denmark Miljøstyrelsen.

Milk production is irregular, depending on cow biology. Producers must adjust the mix of milk which is sold in liquid form vs. processed foods (such as butter and cheese) depending on changing supply and demand.&lt;ref name="rurdev" /&gt;

==Farming==
{{main|Dairy farming}}
{{See also|Dairy cattle}}
[[File:Dairy NSW.JPG|thumb|A rotary dairy shed, Australia, 2009]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4794 Milking cow.jpg|thumb|A cow being milked in [[Mandatory Palestine|British Palestine]], 1936]]
When it became necessary to milk larger cows, the cows would be brought to a [[shed]] or [[Barn (building)|barn]] that was set up with stalls ([[milking stall]]s) where the cows could be confined their whole live while they were milked. One person could milk more cows this way, as many as 20 for a skilled worker. But having cows standing about in the yard and shed waiting to be milked is not good for the cow, as she needs as much time in the paddock grazing as is possible. It is usual to restrict the twice-daily milking to a maximum of an hour and a half each time. It makes no difference whether one milks 10 or 1000 cows, the milking time should not exceed a total of about three hours each day for any cow as they should be in stalls and laying down as long as possible to increase comfort which will in turn aid in milk production.  A cow is only physically milked for about 10 minutes a day depending on her milk letdown time and the amount of milkings per day.

As [[herd]] sizes increased there was more need to have efficient milking machines, sheds, milk-storage facilities ([[Bulk tank|vat]]s), bulk-milk transport and shed cleaning capabilities and the means of getting cows from paddock to shed and back.

As herd numbers increased so did the problems of [[animal health]]. In [[New Zealand]] two approaches to this problem have been used. The first was improved [[veterinary medicine]]s (and the government regulation of the medicines) that the farmer could use. The other was the creation of ''veterinary clubs'' where groups of farmers would employ a [[Veterinary medicine|veterinarian]] (vet) full-time and share those services throughout the year. It was in the vet's interest to keep the animals healthy and reduce the number of calls from farmers, rather than to ensure that the farmer needed to call for service and pay regularly.

This daily milking routine goes on for about 300 to 320 days per year that the cow stays in milk. Some small herds are milked once a day for about the last 20 days of the production cycle but this is not usual for large herds. If a cow is left unmilked just once she is likely to reduce milk-production almost immediately and the rest of the season may see her ''dried off'' (giving no milk) and still consuming feed. However, once-a-day milking is now being practised more widely in New Zealand for profit and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] reasons. This is effective because the fall in milk yield is at least partially offset by labour and cost savings from milking once per day. This compares to some intensive farm systems in the [[United States]] that milk three or more times per day due to higher milk yields per cow and lower marginal [[labor costs]].

Farmers who are contracted to supply liquid milk for human consumption (as opposed to milk for processing into [[butter]], [[cheese]], and so on—see [[milk]]) often have to manage their [[herd]] so that the contracted number of cows are in milk the year round, or the required minimum milk output is maintained. This is done by mating cows outside their natural mating time so that the period when each cow in the herd is giving maximum production is in rotation throughout the year.

Northern hemisphere farmers who keep cows in barns almost all the year usually manage their herds to give continuous production of milk so that they get paid all year round. In the southern hemisphere the [[cooperative]] dairying systems allow for two months on no productivity because their systems are designed to take advantage of maximum grass and milk production in the spring and because the milk processing plants pay bonuses in the dry (winter) season to carry the farmers through the mid-winter break from milking. It also means that cows have a rest from milk production when they are most heavily pregnant. Some year-round milk farms are penalised financially for [[overproduction]] at any time in the year by being unable to sell their overproduction at current prices.

[[Artificial insemination]] (AI) is common in all high-production herds in order to improve the genetics of the female offspring which will be raised for replacements.  AI also reduces the need for keeping potentially dangerous bulls on the farm. Male calves are sold to be raised for beef or veal. A cow will calve or freshen about once a year, until she is culled because of declining production, infertility or other health problems. Then the cow will be sold, most often going to slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;https://freefromharm.org/dairyfacts/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial processing==
{{Main|Dairy products}}
[[File:StanhopeFactory.JPG|thumb|A [[Fonterra]] cooperative dairy factory in Australia]]
[[File:Fromagerie77.jpg|thumb|Interior of a cheese factory in [[Seine-et-Marne]], France]]
Dairy plants process the raw milk they receive from farmers so as to extend its marketable life. Two main types of processes are employed: heat treatment to ensure the safety of milk for human consumption and to lengthen its shelf-life, and dehydrating dairy products such as butter, hard cheese and milk powders so that they can be stored.

===Cream and butter===
Today, milk is separated by huge machines in bulk into cream and skim milk. The cream is processed to produce various consumer products, depending on its thickness, its suitability for culinary uses and consumer demand, which differs from place to place and country to country.

Some milk is dried and powdered, some is condensed (by [[evaporation]]) mixed with varying amounts of [[sugar]] and canned. Most cream from New Zealand and Australian factories is made into [[butter]]. This is done by [[churning (butter)|churning]] the cream until the fat globules coagulate and form a monolithic mass. This butter mass is washed and, sometimes, salted to improve keeping qualities. The residual [[buttermilk]] goes on to further processing. The butter is packaged (25 to 50&amp;nbsp;kg boxes) and chilled for storage and sale. At a later stage these packages are broken down into home-consumption sized packs.

===Skimmed milk===
The product left after the cream is removed is called skim, or skimmed, milk. To make a consumable liquid a portion of cream is returned to the [[skim milk]] to make ''[[low fat]] milk'' (semi-skimmed) for human consumption. By varying the amount of cream returned, producers can make a variety of low-fat milks to suit their local market. Whole milk is also made by adding cream back to the skim to form a standardized product.  Other products, such as [[calcium]], [[vitamin D]], and flavouring, are also added to appeal to consumers.

===Casein===
[[Casein]] is the predominant [[phosphoprotein]] found in fresh milk.  It has a very wide range of uses from being a filler for human foods, such as in [[ice cream]], to the manufacture of products such as [[cloth|fabric]], [[adhesive]]s, and [[plastic]]s.

===Cheese===
{{main|Cheese}}
Cheese is another product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form [[curd]]s that can be compressed, processed and stored to form cheese. In countries where milk is legally allowed to be processed without [[pasteurize|pasteurization]], a wide range of cheeses can be made using the bacteria found naturally in the milk. In most other countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial cheese curing is greater. [[Whey]] is also the byproduct of this process. Some people with [[lactose intolerance]] are surprisingly able to eat certain types of cheese. This is because some traditionally made hard [[cheese]]s, and soft ripened cheeses may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved.  Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]] or [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk. In addition, the aging methods of traditional cheeses (sometimes over two years) reduce their lactose content to practically nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp |title=DairyGood.org &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Ilovecheese.com |accessdate=2014-07-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730190352/http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp |archivedate=2013-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial cheeses, however, are often manufactured by processes that do not have the same lactose-reducing properties. Ageing of some cheeses is governed by regulations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmhousecheesemakers.com/pdo-our-provenance/ |title=Example of cheese regulations: "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" must be aged for 9 months |publisher=Farmhousecheesemakers.com |accessdate=2014-07-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711084008/http://www.farmhousecheesemakers.com/pdo-our-provenance// |archivedate=2014-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases there is no quantitative indication of degree of ageing and concomitant lactose reduction, and lactose content is not usually indicated on labels.

===Whey===
In earlier times, [[whey]] or '''milk serum''' was considered to be a waste product and it was, mostly, fed to pigs as a convenient means of disposal. Beginning about 1950, and mostly since about 1980, [[lactose]] and many other products, mainly food additives, are made from both casein and cheese whey.

===Yogurt===
[[Yogurt]] (or yoghurt) making is a process similar to cheese making, only the process is arrested before the curd becomes very hard.

===Milk powders===
Milk is also processed by various drying processes into powders. Whole milk, skim milk, buttermilk, and whey products are dried into a powder form and used for human and animal consumption.  The main difference between production of powders for human or for animal consumption is in the protection of the process and the product from contamination. Some people drink milk reconstituted from powdered milk, because milk is about 88% water and it is much cheaper to transport the dried product.

===Other milk products===
[[Kumis]] is produced commercially in [[Central Asia]].  Although it is traditionally made from [[horse|mare]]'s milk, modern industrial variants may use cow's milk instead.

==Milking==
[[File:SR 4409 6 Wheeled Milk Wagon Didcot Railway Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved [[Express Dairies]] three-axle Milk Tank Wagon at the [[Didcot Railway Centre]], based on an [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|SR]] chassis]]
[[File:Waiting for the milk train - geograph.org.uk - 93290.jpg|thumb|[[Milk churn]]s on a railway platform]]
Originally, milking and processing took place on the dairy farm itself. Later, cream was separated from the milk by machine on the farm, and transported to a [[factory]] to be made into butter. The skim milk was fed to [[pig]]s. This allowed for the high cost of transport (taking the smallest volume high-value product), primitive trucks and the poor quality of roads. Only farms close to factories could afford to take whole milk, which was essential for cheesemaking in industrial quantities, to them.

Originally milk was distributed in '[[Pail (container)|pail]]s', a lidded bucket with a handle. These proved impractical for transport by road or rail, and so the [[milk churn]] was introduced, based on the tall conical shape of the [[butter churn]]. Later large railway containers, such as the [[British Railway Milk Tank Wagon]] were introduced, enabling the transport of larger quantities of milk, and over longer distances.

The development of [[refrigeration]] and better road transport, in the late 1950s, has meant that most farmers milk their cows and only temporarily store the milk in large refrigerated [[bulk tank]]s, from where it is later transported by truck to central processing facilities.

In many European countries, particularly the [[United Kingdom]], milk is then delivered direct to customers' homes by a [[milk float]].

===Milking machines===
{{main|Automatic milking}}
[[File:Melkgeschirr.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The milking machine extracts milk from all teats.]]

Milking machines are used to harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive.  One early model was patented in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA868|date=August  1907|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder.  It is made up of a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator.  The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or ''inflation''.  Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow.  The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber.

Milking machines work in a way that is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow.  The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio.

The four streams of milk from the teatcups are usually combined in the claw and transported to the milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single milk hose.  Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or with a combination of airflow and mechanical [[pump]] to a central storage [[Storage tank|vat]] or [[bulk tank]].  Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a [[heat-exchanger]] or in the bulk tank, or both.

The photo to the right shows a bucket milking system with the stainless steel bucket visible on the far side of the cow.  The two rigid stainless steel teatcup shells applied to the front two quarters of the udder are visible.  The top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to the claw.  The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk flow.  When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off and the teatcups are removed.

Milking machines keep the milk enclosed and safe from external contamination. The interior 'milk contact' surfaces of the machine are kept clean by a manual or automated  washing procedures implemented after milking is completed.  Milk contact surfaces must comply with regulations requiring  food-grade materials (typically [[stainless steel]] and special plastics and rubber compounds) and are easily cleaned.

Most milking machines are powered by [[Electrical power industry|electricity]] but, in case of electrical failure, there can be an alternative means of motive power, often an [[internal combustion engine]], for the vacuum and milk pumps.

===Milking shed layouts===
[[File:Pardes Hanna Ag School morning milking.jpg|thumb|Milking parlour at [[Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School]], Israel]]

====Bail-style sheds====
This type of milking facility was the first development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, ''lean-to'' shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side and when they were about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished she backed out into the yard again. The UK bail,  initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler.

As herd sizes increased a door was set into the front of each bail so that when the milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking. When one was finished the machine's cups are swapped to the other cow. This is the same as for ''Swingover Milking Parlours'' as described below except that the cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than to increase the number of bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed with 8 bails by one person. Using the same teat cups for successive cows has the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows.

====Herringbone milking parlours====
In herringbone milking sheds, or parlours, cows enter, in single file, and line up almost perpendicular to the central aisle of the milking parlour on both sides of a central pit in which the milker works (you can visualise a fishbone with the ribs representing the cows and the spine being the milker's working area; the cows face outward). After washing the udder and teats the cups of the milking machine are applied to the cows, from the rear of their hind legs, on both sides of the working area. Large herringbone sheds can milk up to 600 cows efficiently with two people.

====Swingover milking parlours====
Swingover parlours are the same as herringbone parlours except they have only one set of milking cups to be shared between the two rows of cows, as one side is being milked the cows on the other side are moved out and replaced with unmilked ones. The advantage of this system is that it is less costly to equip, however it operates at slightly better than half-speed and one would not normally try to milk more than about 100 cows with one person.

====Rotary milking sheds====
Rotary milking sheds (also known as Rotary milking parlor) consist of a turntable with about 12 to 100 individual stalls for cows around the outer edge. A "good" rotary will be operated with 24–32 (~48–50+) stalls by one (two) milkers.  The turntable is turned by an electric-motor drive at a rate that one turn is the time for a cow to be milked completely. As an empty stall passes the entrance a cow steps on, facing the center, and rotates with the turntable. The next cow moves into the next vacant stall and so on. The operator, or milker, cleans the teats, attaches the cups and does any other feeding or whatever husbanding operations that are necessary. Cows are milked as the platform rotates. The milker, or an automatic device, removes the milking machine cups and the cow backs out and leaves at an exit just before the entrance. The rotary system is capable of milking very large herds—over a thousand cows.

====Automatic milking sheds====
[[Automatic milking]] or 'robotic milking' sheds can be seen in [[Australia]], New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, and many European countries. Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking (VM) method. These allow the cows to voluntarily present themselves for milking at any time of the day or night, although repeat visits may be limited by the farmer through computer software. A [[robot]] arm is used to clean teats and apply milking equipment, while automated gates direct cow traffic, eliminating the need for the farmer to be present during the process.  The entire process is computer controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supplementary accessories in sheds====
Farmers soon realised that a milking shed was a good place to feed cows supplementary foods that overcame local dietary deficiencies or added to the cows' wellbeing and production. Each bail might have a box into which such feed is delivered as the cow arrives so that she is eating while being milked. A computer can read the eartag of each animal to ration the correct individual supplement. A close alternative is to use 'out-of-parlour-feeders', stalls that respond to a transponder around the cow's neck that is programmed to provide each cow with a supplementary feed, the quantity dependent on her production, stage in lactation, and the benefits of the main ration

The holding yard at the entrance of the shed is important as a means of keeping cows moving into the shed. Most yards have a powered gate that ensures that the cows are kept close to the shed.

[[Water]] is a vital commodity on a dairy farm: cows drink about 20 gallons (80 litres) a day, sheds need water to cool and clean them. Pumps and reservoirs are common at milking facilities. Water can be warmed by heat transfer with milk.

===Temporary milk storage===
Milk coming from the cow is transported to a nearby storage vessel by the airflow leaking around the cups on the cow or by a special "air inlet" (5-10 l/min free air) in the claw. From there it is pumped by a mechanical pump and cooled by a [[heat exchanger]]. The milk is then stored in a large vat, or [[bulk tank]], which is usually refrigerated until collection for processing.

==Waste disposal==
[[File:Manure spreader 8685.jpg|thumb|Manure spreader going to the field from a dairy farm, [[Elba, New York]].]]
In countries where cows are grazed outside year-round, there is little waste disposal to deal with. The most concentrated waste is at the milking shed, where the animal waste may be liquefied (during the water-washing process) or left in a more solid form, either to be returned to be used on farm ground as organic fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/manure/surface-irrigation-systems-for-wastewater/|title=Surface irrigation systems for treating milk house wastewater : Dairy Extension : University of Minnesota Extension|website=Extension.umn.edu|accessdate=20 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915004140/http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/manure/surface-irrigation-systems-for-wastewater/|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the associated milk processing factories, most of the waste is washing water that is treated, usually by composting, and spread on farm fields in either liquid or solid form. This is much different from half a century ago, when the main products were butter, cheese and casein, and the rest of the milk had to be disposed of as waste (sometimes as animal feed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25030895|title=Milk Waste Disposal|first=Don E.|last=Bloodgood|date=20 November 2017|publisher=|journal=Sewage Works Journal|volume=20|issue=4|pages=695–706|doi=10.2307/25030895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dairy-intensive areas, various methods have been proposed for disposing of large quantities of milk. Large application rates of milk onto land, or disposing in a hole, is problematic as the residue from the decomposing milk will block the soil pores and thereby reduce the water infiltration rate through the soil profile. As recovery of this effect can take time, any land-based application needs to be well managed and considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.ecohydrology.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/142432/Waste_Management.pdf | title=Environmental Best Practice Guidelines | chapter=Waste Management | publisher=Dairy Catch | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220180710/http://www.ecohydrology.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/142432/Waste_Management.pdf | archivedate=2011-02-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other waste milk disposal methods commonly employed include solidification and disposal at a solid waste landfill, disposal at a wastewater treatment plant, or discharge into a sanitary sewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fact Sheet: Proper Disposal of Milk Waste | url=http://www.in.gov/idem/files/landcomp_dairyfactsheet.pdf | publisher=Indiana Department of Environmental Management | accessdate=2014-06-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924050110/http://www.in.gov/idem/files/landcomp_dairyfactsheet.pdf | archivedate=2015-09-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated diseases==
Dairy products manufactured under unsanitary or unsuitable conditions have an increased chance of containing bacteria. Proper [[sanitation]] practices help to reduce the rate of bacterial contamination, and [[pasteurization]] greatly decreases the amount of contaminated milk that reaches the consumer. Many countries have required government oversight and regulations regarding dairy production, including requirements for [[pasteurization]].
* [[Leptospirosis]] is an infection that can be transmitted to people who work in dairy production through exposure to urine or to contaminated water or soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Leptospirosis in Cattle | publisher = National Animal Disease Information Service (UK) | url = http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/leptospirosis-in-cattle.aspx | accessdate = 2014-06-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140619205649/http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/leptospirosis-in-cattle.aspx | archivedate = 2014-06-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Causes of leptospirosis | publisher = National Health Service (UK) | url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Leptospirosis/Pages/causes.aspx | accessdate = 2014-06-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140512204135/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Leptospirosis/Pages/Causes.aspx | archivedate = 2014-05-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cowpox]] is a virus that today is rarely found in either cows or humans. It is a historically important disease, as it led to the first vaccination against the now eradicated [[smallpox]].
* [[Tuberculosis]] is able to be transmitted from cattle mainly via milk products that are [[Pasteurization|unpasteurised]]. The disease has been eradicated from many countries by testing for the disease and culling suspected animals.
* [[Brucellosis]] is a bacterial disease transmitted to humans by dairy products and direct animal contact. Brucellosis has been eradicated from certain countries by testing for the disease and culling suspected animals.
* [[Listeria monocytogenes|Listeria]] is a bacterial disease associated with [[Pasteurization|unpasteurised]] milk, and can affect some cheeses made in traditional ways. Careful observance of the traditional cheesemaking methods achieves reasonable protection for the consumer.

A portion of the population,&lt;ref&gt;Iacobbo, K., &amp; Iacobbo, M. (2006). Vegetarians and vegans in America today. Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; including many [[Veganism|vegans]] and [[Jain vegetarianism|Jains]], object to dairy production as unethical, cruel to animals, and environmentally deleterious. They do not consume dairy products. They state that cattle suffer under conditions employed by the dairy industry.&lt;ref name="nationalaglawcenter.org"&gt;[[David J. Wolfson]] (1996).

===Bovine growth hormone===
{{Main|Bovine somatotropin}}
In 1937, it was found that [[bovine somatotropin]] (BST or bovine growth hormone) would increase the yield of milk. Several pharmaceutical companies developed commercial rBST products and they have been approved for use in the US, Mexico, Brazil, India, Russia, and at least ten others. The World Health Organization, and others have stated that dairy products and meat from BST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. However, based on negative animal welfare effects,&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Report on Animal Welfare Aspects of the Use of Bovine Somatotrophin | url = http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out21_en.pdf | format = PDF | date = 10 March 1999 | accessdate = 16 January 2008 | publisher = The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, [[European Union]]. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080904003449/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out21_en.pdf | archivedate = 4 September 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; rBST has not been allowed in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, or the European Union since 2000 - and in the U.S. has lost popularity due to consumer demands for rBST-free cows,&lt;ref name="seattlepi.nwsource.com"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">'''Data center services''' encompass all of the services and facility-related components or activities that support the implementation, maintenance, operation, and enhancement of a [[data center]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14679/data-center-services Techopedia.com, What are Data Center Services?]&lt;/ref&gt; which is an environment that provides processing, storage, networking,&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;M. Noormohammadpour, C. S. Raghavendra, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321744877_Datacenter_Traffic_Control_Understanding_Techniques_and_Trade-offs "Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Trade-offs,"] IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials, vol.

Generally, data center services fall into two categories: services provided to a data center or services provided from a data center.
==Support services==


Support services for the data center can be generally defined as [[technical support]], which provides assistance to help solve problems related to technology products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/technical-support.html BusinessDictionary.com, “Definition: technical support”]&lt;/ref&gt; Technical support services for data centers help to address challenges with the servers, storage, software and networking equipment that constitute a data center, or the related processes involved in managing data center equipment. Data center support services can also include installing and configuring technical equipment. Careers in this industry include (1) Technical Support Analyst, (2) Help Desk Engineer or (3) Information Support Specialists.

==Technical consulting services==


Consulting and integration services provide expertise and input to help organizations make strategic decisions and systems integrations.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services: Nature of the industry” [http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs037.htm#nature]&lt;/ref&gt; Technical consulting services are one specific type of service that falls under the overall consulting services umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services: Nature of the industry: Industry organization” [http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs037.htm#nature]&lt;/ref&gt; Technical consulting services provide guidance and expertise on the application of technology. This can include selecting or designing new technology, redesigning existing technology, migrating existing technology to a new environment, or integrating new technology into existing technology.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services: Occupations in the industry: Professional and related occupations” [http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs037.htm#related]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of technical consulting services specific to data center services might include selecting a new data center location, consolidation, virtualization, automation, redesigning data centers for cloud computing, implementing storage arrays, or incorporating offsite storage services into an existing network.

==Outsourcing services==


IT outsourcing occurs when one company (the outsourcing customer) contracts with an outsourcing vendor to provide IT services that the customer would otherwise deliver in-house. Such IT services could be disaster recovery, data storage or other IT functions.&lt;ref&gt;Overby, Stephanie. “Outsourcing Definitions and Solutions: What is outsourcing?” CIO.com [http://www.cio.com/article/40380/Outsourcing_Definition_and_Solutions#1]&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing services for the data center can range from hosting, managing and maintaining an entire data center to more discrete data center tasks such as upgrading servers or backing up data.

==Application services==


The definition of application services varies depending on the type of company offering the services. An [[application service provider]] is a large segment within application services that provides software-based services to other companies that access those services over a network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/application_service_provider.html Webopedia, “Application Service Provider”]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of ASP services include Web hosting and e-mail hosting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/asp4.htm HowStuffWorks, “How ASPs Work: Examples of ASPs”]&lt;/ref&gt; Application services can also include any service that helps companies develop, integrate or manage applications for their own networks.&lt;ref&gt;Say, Mark. “DWP awards IT deals to IBM and Capgemini,” The Guardian, September 28, 2011 [https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/sep/28/dwp-application-services-ibm-capgemini?newsfeed=true]&lt;/ref&gt; Services in this category can include applications for mobile environments and devices.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, Craig. “HP Transforms Mobile Computing Environments,” B/OSS, October 24, 2011 [http://www.billingworld.com/news/2011/10/hp-transforms-mobile-computing-environments.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Careers include, (1) Application Support Analysts, (2) Applications Engineer or (3) Business Analyst.

==Technical training services==


The specific definition of technical training varies depending on the industry and the job.&lt;ref&gt;Penn State, “Technical training: What it means depends on who you ask”, Science Blog, August 2002 [http://scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/D/20024827.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''technical'' simply indicates that something (a task, duty or job skill) is peculiar to a specific art, science, profession, trade or the like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/technical Dictionary.com, “Definition: Technical”]&lt;/ref&gt; Technical training services, therefore, provide knowledge, skills and competencies that apply to a specific job, trade or profession. Within the umbrella of data center services, technical training services can provide skills relevant to any of the hardware, software or processes related to managing a data center, or fixing, updating, integrating or managing any of the equipment within a data center.

==Financing and leasing services==

The '''European Society for the History of Photography''' ('''ESHPh'''), founded in 1978, is a society concerned with the historical events within photography from a [[Europe]]an perspective.

The ESHPh publicly hosts symposia, publishes journals, and distributes the "International Letter" to its members. The ESHPh is actively chronicling the [[historiography]] of the [[history of photography]] in Europe.

==History==
The founding of the Europäischen Gesellschaft für die Geschichte der Photographie (ESHPh) [European Society for the History of Photography] took place at the first general meeting on 19 November 1978 in [[Leverkusen]], Germany. The decision to form a society of this nature had been taken one year earlier in [[Antwerp]], Belgium. A group of museum curators and photographic historians from six European countries - notably Laurent Roosens (of the Sterckshof Museum, Antwerp), [[Margaret Harker]] (the UK's [[Royal Photographic Society]]) and Rolf Krauss (Deutsche Gesellschafte für Photographie) - came together to establish a new society dealing with the history of photography in a European context.

Since 2001, the presidential headquarters are to be found in [[Vienna]]. From 1978 until 1989, those headquarters were in Antwerp; thereafter, until 2001, in [[Croydon]], UK. It is currently based in Vienna, although the website is hosted by the [[Danube University Krems|Donau University Krems]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eds. Anna Auer / Uwe Schögl|title=JUBILEE 30 Years ESHPh|year=2008|publisher=Fotohof edition|isbn=978-3-902675-04-0|pages=503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aims of the ESHPh==
The ESHPh was founded with the primary aim of researching the historical development of photography from its origins up to the present and integrating it within a European context within the social political matrix of photography's inherent interdisciplinary nature. Photographers, general historians and historians of photography, philosophers, sociologists, ethnologists, academics, curators and private collectors as well as many important European institutions and some from further afield all belong to the ESHPh. Alongside its research activities, the ESHPh takes part in a worldwide exchange of information. It supports both the recognition of the history of photography as an academic discipline and the establishment of chairs in the discipline at European universities.

From 1981 until 2004, the society has held symposia in various locations in Europe, as evidenced by diverse publications. For its 30th anniversary in 2008, the ESHPh celebrated an internationally attended photography congress at the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], in Vienna, from 6–8 November 2008. This anniversary event was accompanied by an English language commemorative publication and took place as the theoretical focus of the European Month of Photography 2008 in Vienna.

The ESHPh as a society was entered in the Austrian Register of Societies on 3 March 2004. However, the seat of society is connected to the presidency.

The first general meeting, at which the board was elected, took place on 8 June in the WestLicht Gallery in Vienna. The new Executive Committee of the ESHPh was elected at the Society’s annual general assembly that was held in Vienna on 4 November 2010, at the invitation of the Department for Pictures at the [[Austrian National Library]].

===30 years of ESHPh 2008===
This jubilee publication coincided with the 2008 conference in Vienna. It served to formulise the direction of the ESHPh and give an overview of the "picture" from trans-disciplinarian perspectives.

===''Photohistorica''===
''Photohistorica: Serial Literature Index of the European Society for the History of Photography'' consisted of a bibliographical listing, with abstracts, of articles that had appeared in serial publications of the relevant years of publication. The first issue in May 1978 was a bibliographic listing only, but thereafter most bibliographic entries were accompanied by a short abstract. Apart from that pioneering issue of May 1978, each issue was double-numbered (such as 02/03) and except for 1979 and 1981 two double-numbered issues appeared annually (i.e. covering 1992 the two issues were numbers 50/51 and 52/53 containing abstract No.s 6656-6963 and 8964-7229). Karel van Deuren (the editor throughout the 1980s), Dr. Laurent Roosens (inaugural President of ESHPh), and Luc Salu (librarian of the Museum voor Fotographie, Antwerp) were the first compilers of the bibliography and abstracts. The production of those twenty–seven double-numbered issues of ''Photohistorica'' of 1978-1992 made possible in Belgium by annual grants provided until 1993 by Agfa–Gevaert. From the remaining funds provided by Agfa-Gevaert, a detailed Cumulative Index was sent out to members of ESHPh in mid–1994.

For some years, the office of the ESHPh (under the society's President Prof. Margaret Harker Farrand) was based in England, and 1993-94 witnessed two years of financial insecurity for the Society, with an income apparently limited solely to the subscriptions of its members. Yet the production of a bibliography of articles on the history of photography from current serials had been of undoubted value and a justified function of the ESHPh. After a lapse of two years, a new volunteer - R. Derek Wood (historian of early photography) - from its members in England was found to compile and edit a renewed bibliography. Thus with Agfa-Gevaert (Belgium) making a grant to ESHPh in February 1995 to cover printing costs, another two double-numbered issues (No. 54/55 and 56/57) of a renewed Photohistorica covering the years 1993 and 1994 could be published.

However, with a low membership inevitable for a specialist subject area unable to provide a strong financial base, both publications (''Photohistorica'' and ''PhotoResearcher'') of ESHPh could not continue in the late 1990s - except that is for ESHPh member Audrey Linkman of Manchester compiling and editing a final ''Photohistorica'' (issue 58). It provided 296 abstracts of articles on the history of photography, published in serials, mainly, but not exclusively, during the half-year January to June 1997. Unlike all the earlier issues (of a square 20x20cm format), issue 58 was printed in A4 format and a new categorisation of subjects was introduced.

This account of ''Photohistorica'' is derived mainly from R. Derek Wood's preface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=R.

'''Ferdinand Hurter''' (15 March 1844 &amp;ndash; 12 March 1898) was a [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] industrial [[chemist]] who settled in England.  He also carried out research into [[photography]].

==Early life==

Ferdinand Hurter was born in [[Schaffhausen]], [[Switzerland]], the only son of Tobias Hurter, a [[Bookbinding|bookbinder]], and his wife Anna Oechslein.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;N. J. Travis (2004) ‘Hurter, Ferdinand (1844–1898)’, rev., ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37584] Retrieved on 10 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  His father died when Ferdinand was aged only two and his mother worked as a nurse to support him and his sister Elizabeth.  She later married her late husband's half-brother, David, and Ferdinand developed a strong relationship with his stepfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=165.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After education at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] he became an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] to a dyer in [[Winterthur]] before moving to [[Zürich]] to work in a silk firm.  He then attended [[ETH Zurich|Zürich Polytechnic]] before going to [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg University]].  Here he studied chemistry under [[Robert Bunsen]] and physics under [[Gustav Kirchhoff]].  He graduated [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] with the highest honours in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=166.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Hurter was offered a professorship in [[Aarau]] but declined this and, with a few letters of introduction, arrived in [[Manchester]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=167.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He joined [[Henry Deacon (industrialist)|Henry Deacon]] and [[Holbrook Gaskell]] at their [[alkali]] manufacturing business, Gaskell, Deacon &amp; Co., in [[Widnes]], [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=67.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here he became chief chemist and worked with Deacon to develop a process to convert [[hydrochloric acid]], a waste by-product of the [[Leblanc process]] of making alkali, to [[chlorine]] which was then used to manufacture [[Calcium hypochlorite|bleaching powder]].&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|pp=67–68.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a pioneer in applying the principles of [[physical chemistry]] and [[thermodynamics]] to industrial processes and by 1880 was considered to be a world authority on the manufacture of alkali.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h168"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=168.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a strong defender of the Leblanc process against the other methods of manufacturing alkali being developed at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=164.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he did research the [[Solvay process|ammonia-soda process]] but without any success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=169.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the production of alkali by the [[electrolysis]] of brine because of the enormous amount of electrical power this would require&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|pp=181–182.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was later to have second thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=190.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Leblanc factories merged in 1890 to form the [[United Alkali Company]], Hurter was placed in charge of developing a research laboratory in Widnes.  This was later named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|pp=175–176.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a part in the foundation of the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] in 1881, becoming its chairman in 1888&amp;ndash;1890.&lt;ref name="sci"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.soci.org/SCI/awards/awardsbook/award.jsp?awardID=AW20 |title=Hurter Memorial Lecture |accessdate=2007-07-10 |publisher=[[Society of Chemical Industry]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published 24 papers in English journals alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=170.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave many lectures to try to popularise scientific subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=171.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As chief chemist to the United Alkali Company, despite his failing health, he travelled to a number of countries in Europe and also made one visit to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|pp=178–179.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society of Chemical Industry endowed the Hurter Memorial Lecture in his name.&lt;ref name="sci"/&gt;

==Personal==

In 1871 Hurter married Hannah Garnett of [[Farnworth, Widnes|Farnworth]], Widnes, with whom he had six children, one of whom died in infancy.  They lived first at Prospect House in Crow Wood and later in Wilmere House, Widnes.&lt;ref name="h168"/&gt;  Hurter remained a Swiss citizen throughout his life and sent his children to receive part of their education in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|p=172.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He enjoyed music and played the clarinet and piano.  He also took an interest in [[photography]], collaborating in research with [[Vero Charles Driffield]], an engineer at the Gaskell-Deacon works. Together they published many papers (in addition to Hurter's papers in chemistry).  They were jointly awarded the [[Progress Medal (RPS)|Progress Medal]] of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|1950|pp=173–174.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPS_2011_Progress_Medal_1898"&gt;Royal Photographic Society.

'''''Flow, Turbulence and Combustion''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] on [[fluid mechanics]]. It covers [[original research]] on [[fluid mechanics]] and [[combustion]], with the areas of interest including industrial, [[geophysics|geophysical]], and environmental applications. The journal was established in 1949 under the name '''''Applied Scientific Research'''''. It obtained its present name in 1998, which also reflects its association with the [[European Research Community on Flow, Turbulence and Combustion]] (ERCOFTAC).

Since the start in 1948, the journal was published by [[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]. In the late 1980 it was taken over by [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], which subsequently became part of the current publisher, [[Springer Science+Business Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s10494-008-9157-z| volume = 80| issue = 4| pages = 413–417| last = Hanjalic| first = Kemo| title = From "Applied Scientific Research" to "Flow, Turbulence and Combustion": 60th Anniversary of a Lasting Legacy| journal = Flow, Turbulence and Combustion| year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Diedrich Henatsch''' served as the Head of the Department of Neurophysiology of the Medical School of the [[Georg-August-Universität Göttingen]] from the early sixties to the mid nineties.

He was a long-standing friend and colleague of [[Ragnar Granit]] and [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]]. He became known in the sixties for recordings from spinal cord cells in anesthetized cats and his research in spinal cord physiology and spasticity.

On June 5 (Henatsch's birthday) 1997, after his death, Prof. Diethelm Richter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/58022.html Prof. Diethelm Richter page]&lt;/ref&gt; (Henatsch's successor) organized a little memorial in the institute, on which occasion Eike Schomburg gave the laudatio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">In [[Combustion]], '''heat release parameter''' (or '''gas expansion parameter''') is a dimensionless parameter which measures the amount of heat released by the combustion process.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Forman A. "Combustion theory." (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linan, Amable, and Forman Arthur Williams. "Fundamental aspects of combustion." (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{T_b-T_u}{T_b}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the burnt gas temperature
*&lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; is the unburnt mixture temperature.

In typical combustion process, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\approx 0.7-0.9&lt;/math&gt;. For [[isobaric process|isobaric]] combustion, using [[ideal gas law]], the parameter can be expressed in terms of [[density]],&lt;ref&gt;Clavin, P. (1985). Dynamic behavior of premixed flame fronts in laminar and turbulent flows. Progress in energy and combustion science, 11(1), 1-59.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{T_b-T_u}{T_b} = \frac{\rho_u-\rho_b}{\rho_u}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of burnt gas to unburnt gas temperature is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_b}{T_u} = \frac{\rho_u}{\rho_b}=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

(2013). ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
Born in [[Bucharest]], Coandă was the second child of a large family. His father was General [[Constantin Coandă]], a [[mathematics]] professor at the National School of Bridges and Roads. His mother, Aida Danet, was the daughter of French physician Gustave Danet, and was born in [[Brittany]]. Coandă recalled later in life that beginning from childhood he was fascinated by the miracle of [[wind]].

Coandă attended Elementary school at the ''[[Petrache Poenaru]]'' Communal School in Bucharest, then (1896) Began his secondary school career at the Liceu ''Sf. Sava'' ([[Saint Sava National College]]). After three years (1899), his father, who desired a military career for him, had him transferred to the Military High School in [[Iaşi]] where he required four additional years to complete high-school. He graduated in 1903 with the rank of [[sergeant major]], and he continued his studies at the School of Artillery, Military, and Naval Engineering in Bucharest. Sent with an artillery regiment to Germany (1904), he enrolled in the [[Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin.

Coandă graduated as an artillery officer, but he was more interested in the technical problems of flight. In 1905, he built a missile-aeroplane for the [[Romanian Army]]. He continued his studies (1907–08) at the  [[Montefiore Institute]] in [[Liège (city)|Liège]], Belgium, where he met [[Gianni Caproni]]. In 1908 Coandă returned to Romania to serve as an active officer in the Second Artillery Regiment. His inventor's spirit did not comport well with military discipline and he obtained permission to leave the army, after which he took advantage of his renewed freedom to take a long automobile trip to [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Teheran]], and [[Tibet]].

===Aviation activities in France===
Upon his return in 1909, he travelled to Paris, where he enrolled in the newly founded ''École Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Construction Aéronautique'' (now the [[École Nationale Supérieure de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]], also known as SUPAERO). One year later (1910) he graduated at the head of the first class of [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineers]].

[[File:Coanda_1910.png|thumb|right|Coandă-1910 airplane]]
[[File:Henri Coanda airplane 1910.jpg|thumb|right|Coandă-1910 airplane with the turbo-propulseur on separate display]]
In 1910, in the workshop of [[Gianni Caproni]], he designed and built an aircraft known as the [[Coandă-1910]], which he displayed publicly at the second International Aeronautic Salon in Paris that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Statiev|first1=Alexander|date=|year=2002|title=Antonescu's Eagles against Stalin's Falcons: The Romanian Air Force, 1920–1941|journal=The Journal of Military History|volume=66|issue=4|page=1085|publisher=|jstor=3093265 |doi=10.2307/3093265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft used a 4-cylinder piston engine to power a rotary compressor which was intended to propel the craft by a combination of suction at the front and airflow out the rear instead of using a propeller.

Contemporary sources describe the Coandă-1910 as incapable of flight.&lt;ref&gt;Aircraft (1910)Volume 1 page 367.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, after others had developed jet technology, Coandă started making claims that it was a [[motorjet]], and that it actually flew.&lt;ref name=Winter1980/&gt; According to [[Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith|Charles Gibbs-Smith]]: "There was never any idea of injecting fuel; the machine never flew; it was never destroyed on test; and ''Flight'' noted that it was sold to a Monsieur Weyman."&lt;ref name="Gibbs-Smith 1960"/&gt; Gibbs-Smith continued, "The claim said that after a disastrous crash (which never happened) Coandă wished to begin a 'second aircraft', but 'his funds were exhausted.' Within a year he was ... exhibiting (in October 1911) a brand new propeller-driven machine at the Reims Concours Militaire..."&lt;ref name="Gibbs-Smith 1960"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%202323.html?search=coanda%201910&amp;tracked=1|title=Flight, 14 October 1960 |page=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other aviation writers accepted Coandă's story of his flight tests with the Coandă-1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houart |first=Victor |title=L'Histoire de l'aviation recontée à mon fils |year=1957 |publisher=Casablanca: Société chérisienne de publications et d'éditions |location=Paris |language=French}} Quoted in F.

Coandă's colleague at Huyck Corporation, [[G. Harry Stine]]—a rocket scientist, author and "the father of American model rocketry"—stated in his book ''The Hopeful Future'' that "there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time-the Coandă-1910 jet and the 1938 [[Caproni Campini N.1]], the pure jet aircraft flight was made in Germany in 1938". Rolf Sonnemann and Klaus Krug from the University of Technology of Dresden, mentioned in passing in their 1987 book ''Technik und Technikwissenschaften in der Geschichte'' (''Technology and Technical Sciences in History'') that the Coandă-1910 was the world's first jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sonneman|first1=Rolf|last2=Krug|first2=Klaus|title=Technik und Technikwissenschaften in der Geschichte|series=Proceedings of the ICOHTEC-Symposium, International Cooperation in History of Technology Committee|volume=12|year=1987|publisher=[[Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften]]|location=Berlin|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bristol Coand Monoplane.jpg|thumb|right|1912 [[Bristol Coanda Monoplanes|Bristol-Coanda monoplane]]]]
Between 1911 and 1914, he worked as technical manager of the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]&lt;ref name="Flight73" /&gt; in the United Kingdom, where he designed several aeroplanes known as the [[Bristol-Coanda Monoplanes]]. In 1912 one of these aircraft won a prize at the [[1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition|British Military Aeroplane Competition]].

In 1915, he returned to France where, working during [[World War I]] for [[Delaunay-Belleville]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], he designed and built three different models of propeller aeroplane, including the Coandă-1916, with two propellers mounted close to the tail. This design was to be reprised in the 1950s [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] transport aeroplane, for which Coandă was a technical consultant.

In the years between the wars, he continued travelling and inventing. In 1934 he was granted a French patent related to the ''[[Coandă Effect]]''. During early 1930 he used the same principle as the basis for the design of a disc-shaped aircraft called ''Aerodina Lenticulară'' (lens-shaped aerodyne), a "flying saucer" shaped aircraft that used an unspecified source of high-pressure gases to flow through a ring-shaped vent system. In 1936 Coandă applied for a patent for his design.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref patent |country=US |number=2108652 |status=patent |title=Propelling device |pubdate=January 15, 1936 |gdate=February 15, 1938 |fdate=January 10, 1936 |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2108652.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; No practical full-scale version was built.

===World War II===
Coanda spent [[World War II]] in [[occupied France]] where he worked for the Nazis to help their war effort by developing the turbopropulseur (turbopropeller) drive system from his 1910 biplane into a propulsion system for snow sleds.&lt;ref name="Flight, Augmented flow" &gt;{{Cite journal

===Later work===
Coandă's research on the Coandă Effect was of interest post-war and became the basis for several investigations of entrained or augmented flow.&lt;ref name="Flight, Augmented flow" /&gt; A small stream of a high-velocity fluid could be used to generate a greater mass flow, at lower velocity. Although eventually unsuccessful for aircraft propulsion, this effect has been widely used on a smaller scale, from packaging machinery for small pills through to the [[James Dyson#Air Multiplier|Dyson ''Air Multiplier'']] bladeless fan.

In 1969, during the early years of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] era, he returned to spend his last days in his native [[Romania]], where he served as director of the Institute for Scientific and Technical Creation (INCREST) and in 1971 reorganized, along with professor [[Elie Carafoli]], the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of the [[Polytechnic University of Bucharest]], spinning it off from the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

Coandă died in Bucharest on 25 November 1972 at the age of 86. He is buried at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpCCjvJ_fyQC&amp;pg=PA49 |pages=49–50 |first=Marcel |last=Catillon |title=Mémorial aéronautique: qui était qui? |language=French |publisher=Nouvelles Editions Latines |year=1997 |isbn=2723305295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
*1965: At the International Automation Symposium in New York, Coandă received the Harry Diamond Laboratories Award.
*He received an Honorary Fellowship of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in 1971&lt;ref name="Flight73" /&gt;
*Bucharest's [[Henri Coandă International Airport]] is named after him.
*Award and Grand Gold Medal "Vielles Tiges".
*[[UNESCO]] Award for Scientific Research
*The Medal of French Aeronautics, Order of Merit, and Commander ring

== Inventions, and discoveries ==
* 1910: The [[Coandă-1910]], an experimental aircraft constructed on the principle of air-reactive propulsion.
* 1911: An aircraft powered by two engines driving a single propeller&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1916/1916%20-%200614.html 20 July 1916 ''Flight'']&lt;/ref&gt; – the configuration cancelled the [[Torque effect|torque]] of the engines.
* He invented a new decorative material for use in construction, ''beton-bois''; one prominent example of its use is the [[Palace of Culture (Iaşi)|Palace of Culture]], in [[Iaşi]].
* 1926: Working in Romania, Coandă developed a device to detect liquids under ground, useful in petroleum prospecting. Shortly thereafter, in the [[Persian Gulf]] region, he designed a system for offshore oil drilling.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* The most famous of Coandă's discoveries is the [[Coanda Effect|Coandă Effect]]. After more than 20 years studying this phenomenon along with his colleagues, Coandă described what [[Albert Metral]] was later to name the "Coandă Effect". This effect has been utilized in many aeronautical inventions. ''See [[Coanda Effect#Applications]]''
* A modular system of sea water desalination and transformation to fresh water, based on solar energy, a clean, ecological and adaptable system.&lt;ref&gt;http://storage0.dms.go4it.ro/media/2/84/2031/7281839/4/radar-cover.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://storage0.dms.go4it.ro/media/2/84/2031/7281839/5/radar-articol.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How Do They Do That?''''' is a British television show, produced by Telepictures and Reg Grundy Productions in and broadcast on [[BBC1]] from 25 January 1994 to 23 April 1997. Originally presented by Jenny Hull and [[Des Lynam]], the show explored feats of engineering, organization, and special effects. Each season opened with a stunt apparently performed by one of the presenters, such as a skydiver crash-landing into the studio, a car chase, or the entire studio being washed away.

After two series, [[Eamonn Holmes]] took over as male presenter, and from Series 5, was joined by [[Esther McVey]]. At its height, '''''How Do They Do That?''''' had 12 million viewers watching on Wednesday nights.

'''IBM in atoms''' was a demonstration by [[IBM]] scientists in 1989 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/ibms-35-atoms-and-the-rise-of-nanotech/|title=IBM's 35 atoms and the rise of nanotech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a technology capable of manipulating individual [[atom]]s. A [[scanning tunneling microscope]] was used to arrange 35 individual [[xenon]] atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of [[nickel]] to spell out the three letter company [[initialism]].  It was the first time atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/05/us/2-researchers-spell-ibm-atom-by-atom.html|title=2 Researchers Spell 'I.B.M.,' Atom by Atom|date=5 April 1990|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Apr 30, 2013 IBM published an article on its website and a video on YouTube called "[[A Boy and His Atom|A Boy And His Atom: The World's Smallest Movie]]".

==Research==
[[Donald Eigler]] and [[Erhard Schweizer]] of the [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] in [[San Jose, California]], used a scanning tunneling microscope to position 35 individual [[xenon]] atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of [[nickel]] to form the acronym "IBM". They also created chains of xenon atoms similar in form to molecules.

An '''intercom telephone''' is a special kind of [[telephone]] that controls a [[Intercom|school or an office buildings intercom system]].  For example, with that telephone, the employers make the school announcements and can call each [[classroom]]'s intercom by dialing the room number of that classroom.  It can be interfaced with the building's [[access control]] system.

'''M-Pesa''' ('''M''' for mobile, '''''pesa''''' is [[Swahili language|Swahili]] for money) is a [[mobile banking|mobile phone-based money transfer]], financing and [[microfinance|microfinancing]] service, launched in 2007 by [[Vodafone]] for [[Safaricom]] and [[Vodacom]], the largest mobile network operators in [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cck.go.ke/news/2012/sector_statistics.html |title=CCK releases 2nd quarter ICT sector statistics for 2011/2012 |date=17 Apr 2012 |publisher=Communications Commission of Kenya |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817110419/http://www.cck.go.ke/news/2012/sector_statistics.html |archivedate=17 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since expanded to [[Afghanistan]], [[South Africa]], [[India]] and in 2014 to [[Romania]] and in 2015 to [[Albania]]. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services (Lipa na M-Pesa) easily with a mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn=978-1593157203 |page=202; 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using [[Personal identification number|PIN]]-secured [[Short Message Service|SMS text messages]] to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money. Users are charged a small fee for sending and withdrawing money using the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M-PESA Tariff |url=http://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/tariffs |date=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125040249/http://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/tariffs |archivedate=25 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

M-Pesa is a [[branchless banking]] service; M-Pesa customers can deposit and withdraw money from a network of agents that includes airtime resellers and retail outlets acting as [[banking agent]]s.

M-Pesa has spread quickly, and by 2010 had become the most successful mobile-phone-based financial service in the developing world.&lt;ref name=MIT/&gt; By 2012, a stock of about 17 million M-Pesa accounts had been registered in [[Kenya]]. By June 2016, a total of 7 million M-Pesa accounts have been opened in Tanzania by Vodacom. The service has been lauded for giving millions of people access to the formal financial system and for reducing crime in otherwise largely cash-based societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Kenya’s Banking Revolution Lights a Fire|first=Murithi|last=Mutiga|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/opinion/kenyas-banking-revolution-lights-a-fire.html |newspaper=The New York Times |work= |date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:M-Pesa Kenyan Kiosk.JPG|thumb|200px|A kiosk displays M-pesa advertising in Kenya in 2012.]]
In 2002, researchers at [[Gamos (organisation)|Gamos]] and the [[Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation]], funded by [[Department for International Development|Department for International Development UK]] (DFID), documented that in Uganda, [[Economy of Botswana|Botswana]] and Ghana, people were spontaneously using airtime as a proxy for money transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovative Demand Models for Telecommunications Services|work= FINAL TECHNICAL REPORT Contract Number R8069|author= Kevin McKemey (Gamos), Nigel Scott (Gamos), David Souter (University of Strathclyde, former CEO of CTO), Thomas Afullo (ex University of Botswana), Richard Kibombo (Makerere Institute of Social Research), O. Sakyi-Dawson (University of Ghana)|publisher= Department for International Development (DFID)|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kenyans were transferring airtime to their relatives or friends who were then using it or reselling it. Gamos researchers approached MCel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcel.co.mz/|title=Redirecting|website=www.mcel.co.mz|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Mozambique, and in 2004 MCel introduced the first authorised airtime credit swapping – a precursor step towards M-Pesa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Batchelor |first= S. |year=2012 |title= Changing the Financial Landscape of Africa: An Unusual Story of Evidence-informed Innovation, Intentional Policy Influence and Private Sector Engagement |journal= IDS Bulletin |volume= 43 |issue= 5 |pages= 84–90 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2012.00367.x/abstract |agency= onlinelibrary.wiley.com |doi= 10.1111/j.1759-5436.2012.00367.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was discussed by the [[Commission for Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott N, Batchelor S, Ridley J and Jorgensen B 2004 The impact of mobile phones in. Africa, background paper prepared for the Commission for Africa, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and DFID introduced the researchers to Vodafone who had been discussing supporting microfinance and back office banking with Mobile phones. S Batchelor (Gamos) and N Hughes (Vodafone [[CSR plc|CSR]]) discussed how a system of money transfer could be created in Kenya. DFID amended the terms of reference for its grant to Vodafone, and piloting began in 2005. A student from Moi University in Kenya came up with a mobile software that could allow people to send, receive, and withdraw money from their mobile devices. Safaricom however convinced the student and bought the rights of ownership of this project hence becoming the sole owners of the patent rights. In April 2007, following a student software development project from Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FDCF funded M-PESA scheme launched in Kenya as Vodafone/Citibank plan global M-PESA venture |url=http://www.financialdeepening.org/default.asp?id=712&amp;ver=1 |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011114801/http://www.financialdeepening.org/default.asp?id=712&amp;ver=1 |archivedate=11 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Safaricom launched a new [[mobile payments|mobile phone-based payment]] and money transfer service, known as M-Pesa.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jack |first1=William |last2=Suri |first2=Tavneet |date=August 2010 |title=The Economics of M-PESA |url=http://www.mit.edu/~tavneet/M-PESA.pdf|publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial work of developing the product was given to a product and technology development company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sagentia.com/ |title=Sagentia}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[Sagentia]]. Development and second line support responsibilities were transferred to [[IBM]] in September 2009, where most of the original Sagentia team transferred to.

Following a 3-year migration project to a new technology stack, as of 26 February 2017, IBM's responsibilities have been transferred to Huawei in all markets.

===Concept===
[[File:Mobile money transfer.jpg|thumb|Image showing an individual using the MPESA mobile money transfer.]]
The initial concept of M-Pesa was to create a service which would allow microfinance borrowers to conveniently receive and repay loans using the network of Safaricom airtime resellers.&lt;ref name="hughes_lonie"/&gt; This would enable microfinance institutions (MFIs) to offer more competitive loan rates to their users, as costs are lower than when dealing in cash. The users of the service would gain through being able to track their finances more easily. When the service was piloted, customers adopted the service for a variety of alternative uses and complications arose with Faulu, the partnering MFI. In discussion with other parties, M-Pesa was re-focused and launched with a different value proposition: sending remittances home across the country and making payments.&lt;ref name="hughes_lonie"/&gt;

==Services==
M-Pesa is operated by Safaricom and Vodacom, [[mobile network operator]]s (MNO) not classed as deposit-taking institutions, such as a bank. M-Pesa customers can deposit and withdraw money from a network of agents that includes airtime resellers and retail outlets acting as [[banking agent]]s. The service enables its users to:
* deposit and withdraw money
* transfer money to other users
* pay bills 
* purchase airtime
* save money in a virtual account[Mshwari]

* transfer money between the service and, in some markets like Kenya, a bank account&lt;ref name="M-KESHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=263.|work=Safari.com|title=M-KESHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnerships with Kenyan banks offer expanded banking services like interest-bearing accounts, loans, and insurance.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{cite book|author1=World Bank Group|author2=The European Commission|title=Remittances in Africa|date=March 2011|publisher=World Bank Group|page=55|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTDIASPORA/Resources/Remittances-in-africa.pdf.|chapter=7.4Kenya — Leveraging Remittances by Reforming the Mobile Money Transfer System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[user interface]] technology of M-Pesa differs between Safaricom of Kenya and Vodacom of Tanzania, although the underlying platform is the same. While Safaricom uses [[SIM Application Toolkit|SIM toolkit (STK)]] to provide handset menus for accessing the service, Vodacom relies mostly on [[Unstructured Supplementary Service Data|USSD]] to provide users with menus, but also supports STK.&lt;ref name="vaughan"&gt;Vaughan, P. (2008, 15 July). ''Providing the Unbanked with Access to Financial Services: The Case of M-PESA in Kenya''. Presentation given during the Mobile Banking &amp; Financial Services Africa conference in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost, transaction charges, statistics==
Transaction charges depend on the amount of money being transferred and whether the payee is a registered user of the service. The actual cost is a fixed amount for a given range of transaction sizes; for example Safaricom charges up to 66 [[Kenyan shilling|Kshs.]] for a transaction to an unregistered user for transactions between 101-500 Kshs. (US$1–5) and 27 Kshs. for a transfer to a registered user for the same amount. At the highest transfer bracket of 50,001-70,000 Kshs. the fee for a transfer to a registered user is 110 Kshs. The maximum amount that can be transferred to a non-registered user of the system is 35,000 Kshs, with a fee of 275 Kshs. Cash withdrawal fees are also charged. With a charge of 10 Kshs, for a withdrawal of 50-100 Kshs, up to 330 Kshs for a withdrawal of 50,001-70,000 Kshs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hapakenya.com/new-mpesa-tariffs-released/ New MPESA tariffs released], 2013-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkm-pesa.com/2013/11/10-latest-m-pesa-statistics.html M-PESA statistics], 2013–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2015 published article Anja Bengelstorff cites the central bank of Kenya when she states that 1 billion CHF is moved in fiscal year 2014, with a profit of 268 million CHF, that is close to 27% of the moved money.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.credit-suisse.com/ch/en/news-and-expertise/news/banking.article.html/article/pwp/news-and-expertise/2015/08/en/a-global-success-from-kenya.html A Global Success from Kenya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907201441/https://www.credit-suisse.com/ch/en/news-and-expertise/news/banking.article.html/article/pwp/news-and-expertise/2015/08/en/a-global-success-from-kenya.html |date=7 September 2015 }}, Anja Bengelstorff, 2015-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 M-Pesa moved 15bn KES per day equivalent to 52 billion CHF in Kenya, with a revenue of 41bn KES. In 2017 6869bn KES were moved according to a figure in Safaricoms own annual report, with a revenue of 55bn. This would put Safaricom's profit ratio at around &lt;1% of total money transferred - nothing like 27% but still a high figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/news/MPesa-transactions-rise-to-Sh15bn-after-systems-upgrade/1056-3194774-llu8yjz/index.html Daily Nation article], 2016-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=safaricom2017&gt;https://www.safaricom.co.ke/images/Downloads/Resources_Downloads/Safaricom_2017_Annual_Report.pdf Safaricom 2017 annual report&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An M-Pesa Payment Till.JPG|thumb|An M-Pesa payment register at a Kenyan coffee shop]]

M-Pesa was first launched by the Kenyan mobile network operator Safaricom, where [[Vodafone]] is technically a minority shareholder (40%), in March 2007.&lt;ref name="hughes_lonie"&gt;Hughes, N., &amp; Lonie, S. (2010). M-PESA: Mobile Money for the "Unbanked": Turning Cellphones into 24-Hour Tellers in Kenya. Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization, 2(1–2), 63–81.&lt;/ref&gt; M-Pesa quickly captured a significant market share for cash transfers, and grew to 17 million subscribers by December 2011 in Kenya alone.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

The growth of the service forced formal banking institutions to take note of the new venture. In December 2008, a group of banks reportedly lobbied the Kenyan finance minister to audit M-Pesa, in an effort to at least slow the growth of the service. This ploy failed, as the audit found that the service was robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/mobile_cash_transfers_pose_threat_to_banks/|title=Mobile Cash Transfers Pose Threat to Banks| publisher=Philanthropy Action.com|date=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time The Banking Act did not provide basis to regulate products offered by non-banks, of which M-Pesa was one such very successful product. As at November 2014, M-Pesa transactions for the 11 months of 2014 were valued at KES. 2.1 trillion, a 28% increase from 2013, and almost half the value of the country's GDP.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On 19 November 2014, Safaricom launched a companion android app Safaricom M-Ledger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safaricomltd.mledgersafaricom&amp;hl=en|title=Safaricom M-Ledger - Android Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its M-Pesa users. The application, currently available only on Android, gives M-Pesa users a historical view of all their transactions. Many other companies business models rely on the M-Pesa system in Kenya, such as [[M-kopa]] and [[Sportpesa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ccfaa1ba-d0f1-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377|title=Lightbulb moment for M-Kopa|last=Aglionby|first=John|date=2016-03-17|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Amiya|title=What Kenya Gained By Going Cashless|url=https://swarajyamag.com/world/what-kenya-gained-by-going-cashless|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=Swarajya|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2018, it was reported that the Google Play store started taking payments for apps via Kenya´s M-Pesa service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-safaricom-google/google-starts-taking-payments-for-apps-via-kenyas-m-pesa-service-idUSKCN1G714P|title=Google starts taking payments for apps via Kenya's M-Pesa service|date=23 February 2018|work=Reuters|accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
M-Pesa was launched in Tanzania by Vodacom in 2008 but its initial ability to attract customers fell short of expectations. In 2010, the [[International Finance Corporation]] released a report which explored many of these issues in greater depth and analyzed the strategic changes that Vodacom has implemented to improve their market position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aa8588049586050a27ab719583b6d16/Tool%2B6.8.%2BCase%2BStudy%2B-%2BM-PESA%252C%2BTanzania.pdf?MOD=AJPERES|title=M-Money Channel Distribution Case - Tanzania Vodacom Tanzania M-PESA|last=|first=|date=2010-06-14|website=International Finance Corporation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2013, M-Pesa in Tanzania has five million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vodacom Tanzania reports five million M-PESA subs; transactions top USD823m|url=http://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2013/05/02/vodacom-tanzania-reports-five-million-m-pesa-subs-transactions-top-usd823m/|work=telegeography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Vodafone partnered with [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]], Afghanistan's primary mobile operator, to provide M-Pesa, the local brand of the service.&lt;ref name="vodafone_roshan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20081211231453/http://www.vodafone.com/start/media_relations/news/group_press_releases/2007/vodafone_and_roshan.html|title=Vodafone and Roshan Launch First Mobile Money Transfer Service in Afghanistan - Vodafone|last=superuser|website=www.webarchive.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vodafone_vodacom"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.com/start/media_relations/news/group_press_releases/2007/vodacom_announces.html|title=Error|website=www.vodafone.com|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the service was launched it was initially used to pay policemen's salaries set to be competitive with what the Taliban were earning. Soon after the product was launched, the [[Afghan National Police]] found that under the previous cash model, 10% of their workforce were ghost police officers who did not exist; their salaries had been pocketed by others. When corrected in the new system, many police officers believed that they had received a raise or that there had been a mistake, as their salaries rose significantly. The National Police discovered that there was so much corruption when payments had been made using the previous model that the policemen did not know their true salary. The service has been so successful that it has been expanded to include limited merchant payments, peer-to-peer transfers, loan disbursements and payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/2010/09/one-cell-phone-at-a-time-count/ | title=One Cell Phone at a Time: Countering Corruption in Afghanistan |first=Dan |last=Rice |others=Guy Filippelli |publisher=Small Wars Journal |accessdate=21 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In September 2010 Vodacom and Nedbank announced the launch of the service in [[South Africa]], where there were estimated to be more than 13 million "economically active" people without a bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/m-pesa-launched-in-south-africa/3611/ | title=M-PESA launched in South Africa |last= Staff Writer |publisher=How We Made It in Africa |accessdate=16 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  M-Pesa has been slow to gain a toehold in the South African market compared to Vodacom's projections that it would sign up 10 million users in the following three years. By May 2011, it had registered approximately 100,000 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M-Pesa disappoints for Vodacom SA|url=http://www.techcentral.co.za/m-pesa-disappoints-for-vodacom-sa/23167/|work=TechCentral|publisher=NewsCentral Media|date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap between expectations for M-Pesa's performance and its actual performance can be partly attributed to differences between the Kenyan and South African markets, including the banking regulations at the time of M-Pesa's launch in each country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GITHAHU|first=MWANGI|title=Kenya: Could Someone Please Start M-Pesa in South Africa|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201109260410.html|work=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MoneyWeb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About MoneyWeb|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page293723|work=MoneyWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; a South African investment website, "A tough regulatory environment with regards to customer registration and the acquisition of outlets also compounded the company's troubles, as the local regulations are more stringent in comparison to our African counterparts. Lack of education and product understanding also hindered efforts in the initial roll out of the product." In June 2011, Vodacom and Nedbank launched a campaign to re-position M-Pesa, targeting the product to potential customers who have a higher Living Standard Measures (LSM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Standards Measure |url=http://www.saarf.co.za/LSM/lsms.htm |work=South African Advertising Research Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207101041/http://www.saarf.co.za/LSM/lsms.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; than were first targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vodacom, Nedbank present a new game plan on M-pesa|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page292516?oid=545137&amp;sn=2009%20Detail|work=MoneyWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts, as at March 2015, M-Pesa still struggled to grow its customer base. South Africa lags behind Tanzania and Kenya with only c.1 million subscribers. This comes as no surprise as South Africa is well known for being ahead of financial institutions globally in terms of maturity and technological innovation. According to Genesis Analytics, 70% of South Africans are "banked", meaning that they have at least one bank account with an established financial institution which have their own banking products which directly compete with the M-Pesa offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|title=Why South Africa’s largest mobile network, Vodacom, failed to grow M-Pesa|url=http://qz.com/467887/why-south-africas-largest-mobile-network-vodacom-failed-to-grow-mpesa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
M-Pesa, was launched in [[India]]&lt;ref name="India Launch Desire"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mbuguanjihia.com/2009/what-you-dont-now-about-mpesa.html|title=What you dont now about Mpesa... - The mind of Mbugua Njihia|date=2009-07-15|work=The mind of Mbugua Njihia|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dfid_india"&gt;{{Citation|last=DFID - Department for International Development|title=Mobile phone banking in Africa|date=2008-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNrDv4PQdCc|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a close partnership with [[ICICI Bank|ICICI]] bank in November 2011.&lt;ref name="ICICI Launch"&gt;[http://www.medianama.com/2011/11/223-vodafone-m-paisa/ ICICI Launch].

===Eastern Europe===
In March 2014, M-Pesa expanded into Romania, while mentioning that it may continue to expand elsewhere into Eastern Europe, as a number of individuals there possess mobile phones but do not possess traditional bank accounts. It is unlikely, as of May 2014, however, that the service will expand into Western Europe anytime soon.&lt;ref name="Vodafone brings Africa's M-Pesa mobile money to Europe"&gt;{{cite web|title=

In May 2015, M-PESA was also launched in [[Albania]]. It was shut down on July 14, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2017/07/vodafone-shut-m-pesa-albania/|title=Vodafone to shut down M-Pesa in Albania - Capital Business|date=2017-07-05|work=Capital Business|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other markets===
M-Pesa expanded into [[Mozambique]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Egypt]] in May, June, and July 2013, respectively. A full listing of countries in which M-Pesa currently operates can be found on M-Pesa's website.&lt;ref name="What and Where is M-Pesa?"&gt;http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/about-us/money_transfer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and KYC rules==
M-Pesa sought to engage Kenyan regulators and keep them updated on the development process. M-Pesa also reached out to international regulators, such as the UK's [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) and the [[Payment card industry|Payment Card Industry]] (PCI) to understand how best to protect client information and adhere to internationally recognized best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/40/24/43631885.pdf|title=Regulatory Issues Around Mobile Banking|last=Makin|publisher=OECD |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Know your customer|Know Your Customer]] (KYC) requirements impose obligations on prospective clients and on banks to collect identification documents of clients and then to have those documents verified by banks.&lt;ref name="Mas"&gt;Mas, I. (2011). Why Are Banks So Scarce In Developing Countries? Critical Review: A Journal of Politics and Society, 23(1–2), 135–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan government issues national identity cards that M-Pesa leveraged in their business processes to satisfy their KYC requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/40/24/43631885.pdfSimilar |title=Regulatory Issues Around Mobile Banking |last=Makin |publisher=OECD, Consult Hyperion |accessdate=15 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

M-Pesa obtained a "special" license from regulators, despite concerns by regulators about non-branch banking adding to the current state of financial instability.

==Third Party Integration==
Safaricom released the new MPESA platform dubbed MPESA G2 to offer versatile integration capabilities for development partners.  Client to Business and Business to Client disbursements are some of features available through the API.

[[File:Series L0.JPG|thumb|[[SCMaglev]] test track in [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], Japan]]
[[File:Transrapid-emsland.jpg|thumb|[[Transrapid]] 09 at the [[Emsland test facility]] in Germany]]
'''Maglev''' (derived from '''''mag'''''netic '''''lev'''''itation) is a system of train transportation that uses two sets of magnets, one set to repel and push the train up off the track as in levitation (hence Maglev, Magnetic-levitation), then another set to move the 'floating train' ahead at great speed taking advantage of the lack of friction. Along certain "medium range" routes (usually 200–400 miles) Maglev can compete favorably with high speed rail and airplanes.

With Maglev technology, there are no moving parts. The train travels along a guideway of magnets which control the train's stability and speed. Maglev trains are therefore quieter and smoother than conventional trains, and have the potential for much higher speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://namti.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/NAMTI-The-Lesson-From-TGV%E2%80%99s-HSR-Record-2007-5-1.pdf |title=High-speed rail in the United Kingdom |publisher=High-speed rail in the United Kingdom |author=K.C.Coates |date= |access-date=2012-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919101806/http://namti.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/NAMTI-The-Lesson-From-TGV%E2%80%99s-HSR-Record-2007-5-1.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maglev vehicles have set [[Land speed record for rail vehicles|several speed records]] and Maglev trains can accelerate and decelerate much faster than conventional trains; the only practical limitation is the safety and comfort of the passengers. 

The power needed for levitation is typically not a large percentage of the overall energy consumption of a high speed maglev system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transrapid.de/cgi-tdb/en/basics.prg?a_no=41 Transrapid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927190155/http://www.transrapid.de/cgi-tdb/en/basics.prg?a_no=41 |date=27 September 2013 }} uses more power for air conditioning&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming [[drag (physics)|drag]], which makes all land transport more [[energy efficiency in transport|energy intensive]] at higher speeds, takes up the most energy. [[Vactrain]] technology has been proposed as a means to overcome this limitation.

Maglev systems have been much more expensive to construct than conventional train systems, although the simpler construction of maglev vehicles makes them cheaper to manufacture and maintain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Despite over a century of research and development, maglev transport systems are in operation in just three countries (Japan, South Korea and China). The incremental benefits of maglev technology have often been hard to justify against cost and risk, especially where there is an existing or proposed conventional high speed train line with spare passenger carrying capacity, as in continental Europe, the [[High Speed 2|UK]] and [[Shinkansen|Japan]].

== Development ==
In the late 1940s, the British electrical engineer [[Eric Laithwaite]], a professor at [[Imperial College London]], developed the first full-size working model of the [[linear motor|linear induction motor]]. He became professor of heavy electrical engineering at Imperial College in 1964, where he continued his successful development of the linear motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/11/timradford |title=Nasa takes up idea pioneered by Briton – Magnetic levitation technology was abandoned by government |date=11 October 1999 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Tim |last=Radford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since linear motors do not require physical contact between the vehicle and guideway, they became a common fixture on advanced transportation systems in the 1960s and 70s. Laithwaite joined one such project, the [[Tracked Hovercraft]], although the project was cancelled in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://keelynet.com/gravity/laithobi.htm "Obituary for the late Professor Eric Laithwaite"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 6 December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The linear motor was naturally suited to use with maglev systems as well. In the early 1970s, Laithwaite discovered a new arrangement of magnets, the [[magnetic river]], that allowed a single linear motor to produce both lift and forward thrust, allowing a maglev system to be built with a single set of magnets. Working at the [[British Rail Research Division]] in [[Derby]], along with teams at several civil engineering firms, the "transverse-flux" system was developed into a working system.

The first commercial maglev [[people mover]] was simply called "[[AirRail Link#Maglev|MAGLEV]]" and officially opened in 1984 near [[Birmingham]], England. It operated on an elevated {{convert|600|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} section of monorail track between [[Birmingham Airport, West Midlands|Birmingham Airport]] and [[Birmingham International railway station]], running at speeds up to {{convert|42|km/h|abbr=on}}. The system was closed in 1995 due to reliability problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/488394.stm|title=The magnetic attraction of trains|work=BBC News |date=9 November 1999|access-date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== First Maglev patent ===
High-speed transportation patents were granted to various inventors throughout the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{US patent|3736880}}, 21 January 1972. Page 10 Column 1 Line 15 to Page 10 Column 2 Line 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Early United States patents for a [[linear motor]] propelled train were awarded to German inventor [[:de:Alfred Zehden|Alfred Zehden]]. The inventor was awarded {{US patent|782312}} (14 February 1905) and {{US patent|RE12700}} (21 August 1907). {{refn|group=note|Zehden describes a geometry in which the linear motor is used below a steel beam, giving partial levitation of the vehicle. These patents were later cited by ''Electromagnetic apparatus generating a gliding magnetic field'' by Jean Candelas ({{US patent|4131813}}), ''Air cushion supported, omnidirectionally steerable, traveling magnetic field propulsion device'' by Harry A. Mackie ({{US patent|3357511}}) and ''Two-sided linear induction motor especially for suspended vehicles'' by Schwarzler et al. ({{US patent|3820472}})}} In 1907, another early electromagnetic transportation system was developed by F. S. Smith.&lt;ref name="US patent|859018"&gt;{{US patent|859018}}, 2 July 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of German patents for magnetic levitation trains propelled by linear motors were awarded to [[Hermann Kemper]] between 1937 and 1941.{{refn|group=note|These German patents would be GR643316 (1937), GR44302 (1938), GR707032 (1941).}} An early maglev train was described in {{US patent|3158765}}, "Magnetic system of transportation", by G. R. Polgreen (25 August 1959). The first use of "maglev" in a United States patent was in "Magnetic levitation guidance system"&lt;ref name="US patent|3858521"&gt;{{US patent|3858521}}; 26 March 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; by Canadian Patents and Development Limited.

=== New York, United States, 1968 ===
In 1968, while delayed in traffic on the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]], [[James R. Powell|James Powell]], a researcher at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL), thought of using magnetically levitated transportation.&lt;ref name='maglevhissummary'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railserve.com/maglev.html |title=Magnetic Levitation for Transportation |publisher=railserve.com |first=Christopher |last=Muller |date=23 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powell and BNL colleague [[Gordon Danby]] worked out a MagLev concept using static magnets mounted on a moving vehicle to induce electrodynamic lifting and stabilizing forces in specially shaped loops, such as [[figure of 8 coil]]s on a guideway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/2000/bnlpr041800.html |title=Brookhaven Lab Retirees Win Benjamin Franklin Medal For Their Invention of Magnetically Levitated Trains |publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory |date=18 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US3,470,828 Granted 17 October 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamburg, Germany, 1979 ===
[[Transrapid]] 05 was the first maglev train with longstator propulsion licensed for passenger transportation. In 1979, a {{convert|908|m|abbr=on}} track was opened in [[Hamburg]] for the first [[:de:Internationale Verkehrsausstellung|International Transportation Exhibition]] (IVA 79). Interest was sufficient that operations were extended three months after the exhibition finished, having carried more than 50,000 passengers. It was reassembled in [[Kassel]] in 1980.

=== Ramenskoye, Moscow, USSR, 1979 ===
[[File:TP01 1.jpg|thumb|Experimental car TP-01 (ТП-01) in Ramenskoye built in 1979]]
[[File:TP05 3.jpg|thumb|Experimental car TP-05 (ТП-05) in Ramenskoye built in 1986]]
In 1979, in the [[USSR]], in the town of [[Ramenskoye,_Moscow_Oblast|Ramenskoye]] ([[Moscow oblast]]) was built an experimental test site
for running experiments with cars on magnetic suspension. The test site consisted of a 600-meter ramp
which was later extended to 980 meters&lt;ref&gt;[http://guryevandrey.narod.ru/artikals/Maglev.pdf "Дорога на магнитном подвесе: второе дыхание в России?"], ''РЖД-Партнёр'', 2009-10-01&lt;/ref&gt;. From the late 1970s to the 1980s five prototypes of cars were built
that received designations from TP-01 (ТП-01) to TP-05 (ТП-05)&lt;ref name=Skorenko2015&gt;[http://www.popmech.ru/technologies/58629-sovetskiy-maglev-25-let-pod-tsellofanom/ Тим Скоренко: «Советский маглев: 25 лет под целлофаном» in Популярная Механика, May 2015 Nr. 5 (151), pp. 52-56]&lt;/ref&gt;. The early cars were supposed to reach the speed up to 100 km/h.

The construction of a maglev track using the technology from Ramenskoye started in [[Armenian SSR]] in 1987&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izmerov.narod.ru/monor/monor5.html The unknown russian monorail]&lt;/ref&gt;
and was planned to be completed in 1991. The track was supposed to connect the cities of [[Yerevan]] and [[Sevan,_Armenia|Sevan]] via the city of [[Abovyan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newslab.ru/news/626312|title=Юные красноярские железнодорожники разработали модель поезда на магнитной подушке|website=newslab.ru|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The original design speed was 250 km/h which was later lowered to 180 km/h&lt;ref&gt;[https://habr.com/company/mailru/blog/410545/ Советский маглев: будущее, которое не случилось]&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, the [[Spitak earthquake]] in 1988 and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]] caused the project to freeze.

In the early 1990s, the maglev theme was continued by the Engineering Research Center "TEMP" (ИНЦ "ТЭМП")&lt;ref&gt;http://erc-temp.ru/ ОАО Инженерно-научный центр «ТЭМП»&lt;/ref&gt; this time by the order from the [[Government_of_Moscow|Moscow government]]. The project was named V250 (В250). The idea was to build a high-speed maglev train to connect [[Moscow]] to the [[Sheremetyevo airport]]. The train would consist of 64-seater cars and can run at the speeds up to 250 km/h&lt;ref name=Skorenko2015 /&gt;. In 1993, due to the [[Economic_history_of_the_Russian_Federation#1993|financial crisis]], the project was abandoned. However, from 1999 the "TEMP" research center had been participating as a co-developer in the creation of the linear motors for the [[Moscow monorail]] system.

[[File:Birmingham International Maglev.jpg|thumb|The Birmingham International Maglev shuttle]]
The world's first commercial maglev system was a [[AirRail Link#Maglev|low-speed maglev shuttle]] that ran between the airport terminal of [[Birmingham Airport|Birmingham International Airport]] and the nearby [[Birmingham International railway station]] between 1984 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/488394.stm |title=The magnetic attraction of trains |publisher=BBC News |date=9 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its track length was {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and trains levitated at an altitude of {{convert|15|mm|in|abbr=on}}, levitated by electromagnets, and propelled with linear induction motors.&lt;ref&gt;Maglev, A film for The People Mover Group&lt;/ref&gt; It operated for 11 years and was initially very popular with passengers{{cn|date=August 2018}}, but obsolescence problems with the electronic systems made it progressively unreliable{{cn|date=August 2018}} as years passed, leading to its closure in 1995. One of the original cars is now on display at [[Railworld]] in Peterborough, together with the [[Research Test Vehicle 31|RTV31]] hover train vehicle. Another is on display at the National Railway Museum in York.

Several favourable conditions existed when the link was built:
* The British Rail Research vehicle was 3 tonnes and extension to the 8 tonne vehicle was easy.
* Electrical power was available.
* The airport and rail buildings were suitable for terminal platforms.
* Only one crossing over a public road was required and no steep gradients were involved.
* Land was owned by the railway or airport.
* Local industries and councils were supportive.
* Some government finance was provided and because of sharing work, the cost per organization was low.

After the system closed in 1995, the original guideway lay dormant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Birmingham Mail]] |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/solihull-news/tm_objectid=17662730&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50002&amp;headline=new-plan-aims-to-bring-the-maglev-back-name_page.html |title=New plan aims to bring the Maglev back |access-date=1 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522011843/http://www.birminghammail.net/news/solihull-news/tm_objectid%3D17662730%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50002%26headline%3Dnew-plan-aims-to-bring-the-maglev-back-name_page.html |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2003, when a replacement [[funicular|cable-hauled]] system, the [[AirRail Link]] [[Cable Liner]] [[people mover]], was opened.&lt;ref name="dcc-bhx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcc.at/doppelmayr/references/en/tmp_1_1762145202/Birmingham,_UK_detail.aspx |title = AirRail Shuttle Birmingham International Airport |publisher=DCC Doppelmayr |access-date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arup.com/rail/project.cfm?pageid=2529 |title=Birmingham International Airport People Mover |publisher=[[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] |access-date=11 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129092006/http://www.arup.com/rail/project.cfm?pageid=2529 |archivedate=29 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emsland, Germany, 1984–2012 ===
[[File:Transrapid.jpg|thumb|[[Transrapid]] at the [[Emsland test facility]]]]
{{Main|Emsland test facility}}
Transrapid, a German maglev company, had a test track in [[Emsland]] with a total length of {{convert|31.5|km|abbr=on}}. The single-track line ran between [[Dörpen]] and [[Lathen]] with turning loops at each end. The trains regularly ran at up to {{convert|420|km/h|abbr=on}}. Paying passengers were carried as part of the testing process. The construction of the test facility began in 1980 and finished in 1984. In 2006, the [[2006 Lathan maglev train accident|Lathen maglev train accident]] occurred killing 23 people, found to have been caused by human error in implementing safety checks. From 2006 no passengers were carried. At the end of 2011 the operation licence expired and was not renewed, and in early 2012 demolition permission was given for its facilities, including the track and factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndr.de/regional/niedersachsen/emsland/transrapid295.html Transrapid-Teststrecke vor dem Abriss, NDR (in German)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706235158/http://www.ndr.de/regional/niedersachsen/emsland/transrapid295.html |date=6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JNR ML500 1.jpg|thumb|JNR ML500 at a test track in [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]], Japan, on 21 December 1979 travelled at {{convert|517|km/h|abbr=on}}, authorized by Guinness World Records.]]
Japan operates two independently developed maglev trains. One is [[High Speed Surface Transport|HSST]] (and its descendant, the [[Linimo]] line) by [[Japan Airlines]] and the other, which is more well-known, is [[SCMaglev]] by the [[Central Japan Railway Company]].

The development of the latter started in 1969. [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]] test track regularly hit {{convert|517|km/h|abbr=on}} by 1979. After an accident that destroyed the train, a new design was selected. In [[Okazaki, Aichi|Okazaki]], Japan (1987), the SCMaglev took a test ride at the Okazaki exhibition. Tests through the 1980s continued in Miyazaki before transferring to a far larger test track, {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} long, in Yamanashi in 1997.

Development of [[High Speed Surface Transport|HSST]] started in 1974. In [[Tsukuba]], Japan (1985), the [[High Speed Surface Transport|HSST]]-03 ([[Linimo]]) became popular in spite of its {{convert|30|km/h|abbr=on}} at the [[Expo '85|Tsukuba World Exposition]]. In [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], Japan (1988), the HSST-04-1 was revealed at the Saitama exhibition performed in [[Kumagaya]]. Its fastest recorded speed was {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704762904575024611266446690 |title=High-Speed Rail Approaches Station |date=26 January 2010 |publisher=WSJ |first=Mariko |last=Sanchanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new high speed maglev line, the [[Chuo Shinkansen]], is planned to become operational in 2027, with construction starting 2017.

It was removed after the fair and debut at the Aoi Expo in 1987 and now on static display at Okazaki Minami Park.

In Hamburg, Germany, the TR-07 was exhibited at the international traffic exhibition (IVA88) in 1988.

=== Berlin, Germany, 1989–91 ===
{{Main|M-Bahn}}

In [[West Berlin]], the [[M-Bahn]] was built in the late 1980s. It was a driverless maglev system with a {{convert|1.6|km|abbr=on}} track connecting three stations. Testing with passenger traffic started in August 1989, and regular operation started in July 1991. Although the line largely followed a new elevated alignment, it terminated at Gleisdreieck [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station, where it took over an unused platform for a line that formerly ran to [[East Berlin]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], plans were set in motion to reconnect this line (today's U2). Deconstruction of the M-Bahn line began only two months after regular service began. It was called the Pundai project and was teminated in February 1992 due to safety concerns.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

{{See also|SCMaglev#Technology|Transrapid#Technology|Magnetic levitation}}

In the public imagination, "maglev" often evokes the concept of an elevated [[monorail]] track with a [[linear motor]]. Maglev systems may be monorail or dual rail&lt;ref&gt;The [[SCMaglev]] MLX01 for instance uses a trench-like track.&lt;/ref&gt; and not all monorail trains are maglevs. Some railway transport systems incorporate linear motors but use electromagnetism only for ''[[propulsion]]'', without levitating the vehicle. Such trains have wheels and are not maglevs.{{refn|group=note|This is the case with the [[Moscow Monorail]] – currently the only non-maglev linear motor-propelled monorail train in active service.}} Maglev tracks, monorail or not, can also be constructed at grade (i.e. not elevated). Conversely, non-maglev tracks, monorail or not, can be elevated too. Some maglev trains do incorporate wheels and function like linear motor-propelled wheeled vehicles at slower speeds but "take off" and levitate at higher speeds.{{refn|group=note|This is typically the case with [[electrodynamic suspension]] maglev trains. [[Aerodynamic]] factors may also play a role in the levitation of such trains. Where that is the case, it might be argued that they are technically hybrid systems insofar as their levitation isn't purely magnetic – but their linear motors are electromagnetic systems, and these achieve the higher speeds at which the aerodynamic factors come into play.}}

[[File:JR Maglev-Model-truck.JPG|thumb|MLX01 Maglev train [[Superconducting magnet]] [[bogie]]]]
The two notable types of maglev technology are:
* [[Electromagnetic suspension]] (EMS), electronically controlled electromagnets in the train attract it to a magnetically conductive (usually steel) track.
* [[Electrodynamic suspension]] (EDS) uses superconducting electromagnets or strong permanent magnets that create a magnetic field, which induces currents in nearby metallic conductors when there is relative movement, which pushes and pulls the train towards the designed levitation position on the guide way.

Another technology, which was designed, proven mathematically, peer-reviewed, and patented, but is, as of May 2015, unbuilt, is [[magnetodynamic suspension]] (MDS). It uses the attractive magnetic force of a permanent magnet array near a steel track to lift the train and hold it in place. Other technologies such as repulsive permanent magnets and superconducting magnets have seen some research.

=== Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) ===
{{Main|Electromagnetic suspension}}
[[File:Magnetschwebebahn.svg|thumb|Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) is used to levitate the [[Transrapid]] on the track, so that the train can be faster than wheeled mass transit systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=High-Tech for 'Flying on the Ground' |url=http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/documents/transrapid/TRI_Flug_Hoehe_e_5_021.pdf |access-date=28 December 2014 |publisher=Transrapid International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hk-phy.org/articles/maglev/maglev_e.html |title=Hong Kong Physics World – Maglev |publisher=Hong Kong Physics World |access-date=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In electromagnetic suspension (EMS) systems, the train levitates above a steel rail while [[electromagnet]]s, attached to the train, are oriented toward the rail from below. The system is typically arranged on a series of C-shaped arms, with the upper portion of the arm attached to the vehicle, and the lower inside edge containing the magnets. The rail is situated inside the C, between the upper and lower edges.

Magnetic attraction varies inversely with the cube of distance, so minor changes in distance between the magnets and the rail produce greatly varying forces. These changes in force are dynamically unstable – a slight divergence from the optimum position tends to grow, requiring sophisticated feedback systems to maintain a constant distance from the track, (approximately {{convert|15|mm|in|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/20/19613/00908940.pdf?arnumber=908940 |title=Characteristics of electromagnetic force of EMS-type maglev vehicle using bulk superconductors |journal=Magnetics, IEEE Transactions on |date=September 2000 |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=3683–3685 |author=Tsuchiya, M. Ohsaki, H. |doi=10.1109/20.908940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0305-4624/16/5/I02 |title=The theory of electromagnetic levitation |journal=Physics in Technology |author=R.

The major advantage to suspended maglev systems is that they work at all speeds, unlike electrodynamic systems, which only work at a minimum speed of about {{convert|30|km/h|abbr=on}}. This eliminates the need for a separate low-speed suspension system, and can simplify track layout. On the downside, the dynamic instability demands fine track tolerances, which can offset this advantage. [[Eric Laithwaite]] was concerned that to meet required tolerances, the gap between magnets and rail would have to be increased to the point where the magnets would be unreasonably large.&lt;ref name=pslaith /&gt; In practice, this problem was addressed through improved feedback systems, which support the required tolerances.

=== Electrodynamic suspension (EDS) ===

{{Main|Electrodynamic suspension}}
[[File:JR Maglev-Lev.png|thumb|The Japanese SCMaglev's EDS suspension is powered by the magnetic fields induced either side of the vehicle by the passage of the vehicle's superconducting magnets.]]
[[File:Maglev Propulsion.svg|thumb|EDS Maglev propulsion via propulsion coils]]

In electrodynamic suspension (EDS), both the guideway and the train exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repulsive and attractive force between these magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=RTRI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtri.or.jp/rd/division/rd79/yamanashi/english/principle_E.html |title=Principle of Maglev |publisher=Railway Technical Research Institute |access-date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some configurations, the train can be levitated only by repulsive force. In the early stages of maglev development at the Miyazaki test track, a purely repulsive system was used instead of the later repulsive and attractive EDS system.&lt;ref name=osti&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?query_id=0&amp;page=0&amp;osti_id=10150166 |title=Study of Japanese Electrodynamic-Suspension Maglev Systems |doi=10.2172/10150166 |publisher=Osti.gov |date=31 August 2012 |access-date=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic field is produced either by superconducting magnets (as in JR–Maglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in [[Inductrack]]). The repulsive and attractive force in the track is created by an [[Electromagnetic induction|induced magnetic field]] in wires or other conducting strips in the track. A major advantage of EDS maglev systems is that they are dynamically stable – changes in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to return the system to its original position.&lt;ref name=pslaith /&gt; In addition, the attractive force varies in the opposite manner, providing the same adjustment effects. No active feedback control is needed.

However, at slow speeds, the current induced in these coils and the resultant magnetic flux is not large enough to levitate the train. For this reason, the train must have wheels or some other form of landing gear to support the train until it reaches take-off speed. Since a train may stop at any location, due to equipment problems for instance, the entire track must be able to support both low- and high-speed operation.

Another downside is that the EDS system naturally creates a field in the track in front and to the rear of the lift magnets, which acts against the magnets and creates magnetic drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds, and is one of the reasons why JR abandoned a purely repulsive system and adopted the sidewall levitation system.&lt;ref name="osti" /&gt; At higher speeds other modes of drag dominate.&lt;ref name="pslaith" /&gt;

The drag force can be used to the electrodynamic system's advantage, however, as it creates a varying force in the rails that can be used as a reactionary system to drive the train, without the need for a separate reaction plate, as in most linear motor systems. Laithwaite led development of such "traverse-flux" systems at his Imperial College laboratory.&lt;ref name=pslaith /&gt; Alternatively, propulsion coils on the guideway are used to exert a force on the magnets in the train and make the train move forward. The propulsion coils that exert a force on the train are effectively a linear motor: an alternating current through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of the train. The offset between the field exerted by magnets on the train and the applied field creates a force moving the train forward.

=== Tracks ===
The term "maglev" refers not only to the vehicles, but to the railway system as well, specifically designed for magnetic levitation and propulsion. All operational implementations of maglev technology make minimal use of wheeled train technology and are not compatible with conventional [[rail track]]s. Because they cannot share existing infrastructure, maglev systems must be designed as standalone systems. The SPM maglev system is inter-operable with steel rail tracks and would permit maglev vehicles and conventional trains to operate on the same tracks. [[MAN SE|MAN]] in Germany also designed a maglev system that worked with conventional rails, but it was never fully developed.&lt;ref name="pslaith"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pdvMRoDOTbMC "Maglev: How they're Getting Trains off the Ground"], ''Popular Science'', December 1973 p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation ===
Each implementation of the magnetic levitation principle for train-type travel involves advantages and disadvantages.

Neither [[Inductrack]] nor the Superconducting EDS are able to levitate vehicles at a standstill, although [[Inductrack]] provides levitation at much lower speed; wheels are required for these systems. EMS systems are wheel-free.

The German Transrapid, Japanese HSST (Linimo), and Korean [[Hyundai Rotem|Rotem]] EMS maglevs levitate at a standstill, with electricity extracted from guideway using power rails for the latter two, and wirelessly for Transrapid. If guideway power is lost on the move, the Transrapid is still able to generate levitation down to {{convert|10|km/h|abbr=on}} speed,{{citation needed|reason=statistics need citations|date=August 2013}} using the power from onboard batteries. This is not the case with the HSST and Rotem systems.

==== Propulsion ====
EMS systems such as [[High Speed Surface Transport|HSST]]/[[Linimo]] can provide both levitation and [[Ground propulsion|propulsion]] using an onboard linear motor. But EDS systems and some EMS systems such as Transrapid levitate but do not propel. Such systems need some other technology for propulsion. A linear motor (propulsion coils) mounted in the track is one solution. Over long distances coil costs could be prohibitive.

==== Stability ====
[[Earnshaw's theorem]] shows that no combination of static magnets can be in a stable equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfml.ru.nl/levitation-possible.html |title=Is Magnetic Levitation Possible? |publisher=High Field Magnet Laboratory |author1=Gibbs, Philip |author2=Geim, Andre |lastauthoramp=yes |access-date=8 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530010339/http://www.hfml.ru.nl/levitation-possible.html |archivedate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore a dynamic (time varying) magnetic field is required to achieve stabilization. EMS systems rely on active electronic [[Voltage regulator|stabilization]] that constantly measures the bearing distance and adjusts the electromagnet current accordingly. EDS systems rely on changing magnetic fields to create currents, which can give passive stability.

Because maglev vehicles essentially fly, stabilisation of pitch, roll and yaw is required. In addition to rotation, surge (forward and backward motions), sway (sideways motion) or heave (up and down motions) can be problematic.

Superconducting magnets on a train above a track made out of a permanent magnet lock the train into its lateral position. It can move linearly along the track, but not off the track. This is due to the [[Meissner effect]] and [[flux pinning]].

==== Guidance system ====
Some systems use Null Current systems (also sometimes called Null Flux systems).&lt;ref name=RTRI /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maglev2000.com/works/how-03-c.html |title=How maglev works: Learning to levitate |publisher=Maglev 2000 |access-date=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These use a coil that is wound so that it enters two opposing, alternating fields, so that the average flux in the loop is zero. When the vehicle is in the straight ahead position, no current flows, but any moves off-line create flux that generates a field that naturally pushes/pulls it back into line.

=== Evacuated tubes ===
{{Main|Vactrain}}
Some systems (notably the [[Swissmetro]] system) propose the use of vactrains—maglev train technology used in evacuated (airless) tubes, which removes [[air drag]]. This has the potential to increase speed and efficiency greatly, as most of the energy for conventional maglev trains is lost to aerodynamic drag.&lt;ref name=popsci&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-04/trans-atlantic-maglev |title=Trans-Atlantic MagLev |access-date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One potential risk for passengers of trains operating in evacuated tubes is that they could be exposed to the risk of cabin depressurization unless tunnel safety monitoring systems can repressurize the tube in the event of a train malfunction or accident though since trains are likely to operate at or near the Earth's surface, emergency restoration of ambient pressure should be straightforward. The [[RAND Corporation]] has depicted a vacuum tube train that could, in theory, cross the Atlantic or the USA in ~21 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P4874.html |title=The Very High Speed Transit System |publisher=RAND |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy use ===
Energy for maglev trains is used to accelerate the train. Energy may be regained when the train slows down via [[regenerative braking]]. It also levitates and stabilises the train's movement. Most of the energy is needed to overcome "[[air drag]]". Some energy is used for air conditioning, heating, lighting and other miscellany.

At low speeds the percentage of power used for levitation can be significant, consuming up to 15% more power than a subway or light rail service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maglev.net/news/beijing-maglev/ |title=Beijing Maglev |publisher=Maglev.net |access-date=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For short distances the energy used for acceleration might be considerable.

The power used to overcome air drag increases with the cube of the velocity and hence dominates at high speed. The energy needed per unit distance increases by the square of the velocity and the time decreases linearly. For example, 2.5 times as much power is needed to travel at {{convert|400|km/h|abbr=on}} than {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/can-magnetically-levitating-trains-run-at-3-000km-h-27615 |title=Can magnetically levitating trains run at 3,000 km/h?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aircraft]] take advantage of lower air pressure and lower temperatures by cruising at altitude to reduce energy consumption but unlike trains need to [[aviation fuel|carry fuel on board]]. This has led to the suggestion of [[vactrain|conveying maglev vehicles through partially evacuated tubes]] or tunnels with the possibility of [[renewable energy|supplying energy from renewable sources]].

=== Comparison with conventional trains ===
Maglev transport is non-contact and electric powered. It relies less or not at all on the wheels, bearings and axles common to wheeled rail systems.&lt;ref name="NAMTI"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://namti.org/?page_id=9 |work=North American Maglev Transport Institute |title=-Maglev Technology Explained |date=1 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727110924/http://namti.org/?page_id=9 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Speed:''' Maglev allows higher top speeds than conventional rail, but experimental wheel-based [[High-speed rail|high-speed trains]] have demonstrated similar speeds.
* '''Maintenance''': Maglev trains currently in operation have demonstrated the need for minimal guideway maintenance. Vehicle maintenance is also minimal (based on hours of operation, rather than on speed or distance traveled). Traditional rail is subject to mechanical wear and tear that increases exponentially{{dubious|date=January 2017}} with speed, also increasing maintenance.&lt;ref name="NAMTI" /&gt; For example: the wearing down of brakes and overhead wire wear have caused problems for the [[Fastech 360]] rail Shinkansen. Maglev would eliminate these issues.
* '''Weather''': Maglev trains are little affected by snow, ice, severe cold, rain or high winds. However, they have not operated in the wide range of conditions that traditional friction-based rail systems have operated.&lt;!-- citation not needed!  It is hard to cite a negative. --&gt; Maglev vehicles accelerate and decelerate faster than mechanical systems regardless of the slickness of the guideway or the slope of the grade because they are non-contact systems.&lt;ref name="NAMTI" /&gt;
* '''Track''': Maglev trains are not compatible with conventional track, and therefore require custom infrastructure for their entire route. By contrast conventional high-speed trains such as the [[TGV]] are able to run, albeit at reduced speeds, on existing rail infrastructure, thus reducing expenditure where new infrastructure would be particularly expensive (such as the final approaches to city terminals), or on extensions where traffic does not justify new infrastructure. John Harding, former chief maglev scientist at the [[Federal Railroad Administration]], claimed that separate maglev infrastructure more than pays for itself with higher levels of all-weather operational availability and nominal maintenance costs. These claims have yet to be proven in an intense operational setting and they do not consider the increased maglev construction costs.
* '''Efficiency''': Conventional rail is probably more efficient at lower speeds. But due to the lack of physical contact between the track and the vehicle, maglev trains experience no [[rolling resistance]], leaving only [[air resistance]] and [[eddy current|electromagnetic drag]], potentially improving power efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transrapid.de/cgi-tdb/en/basics.prg?session=9be8fa13451ed8b9&amp;a_no=47 |title=Transrapid claims to use a quarter less power at 200 km/h than the InterCityExpress |publisher=Transrapid |access-date=7 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722151041/http://www.transrapid.de/cgi-tdb/en/basics.prg?session=9be8fa13451ed8b9&amp;a_no=47 |archivedate=22 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems however such as the [[Central Japan Railway Company]] [[SCMaglev]] use rubber tires at low speeds, reducing efficiency gains.
* '''Weight''': The electromagnets in many EMS and EDS designs require between 1 and 2 kilowatts per ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hochleistungsbahnen.tu-dresden.de/fachtagung_tr/trt3/18_trt3_vortrag18.pdf |title=Tagungsband.doc |format=PDF |access-date=29 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002083400/http://www.hochleistungsbahnen.tu-dresden.de/fachtagung_tr/trt3/18_trt3_vortrag18.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of superconductor magnets can reduce the electromagnets' energy consumption. A 50-ton Transrapid maglev vehicle can lift an additional 20 tons, for a total of 70 tons, which consumes {{convert|70|-|140|kW|hp|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|reason=statistics need citations|date=August 2013}} Most energy use for the TRI is for propulsion and overcoming air resistance at speeds over {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|reason=statistics need citations|date=August 2013}}
* '''Weight loading''': High speed rail requires more support and construction for its concentrated wheel loading. Maglev cars are lighter and distribute weight more evenly.&lt;ref name="CaliforniaProgressReport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/conventional-high-speed-rail-vs-magnetically-levitated-trains-was-maglev-ever-contention |author=Alan Kandel |title=Conventional High-Speed Rail Vs. Magnetically Levitated Trains: Was Maglev Ever In Contention? |date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Noise''': Because the major source of noise of a maglev train comes from displaced air rather than from wheels touching rails, maglev trains produce less noise than a conventional train at equivalent speeds. However, the [[psychoacoustic]] profile of the maglev may reduce this benefit: a study concluded that maglev noise should be rated like road traffic, while conventional trains experience a 5–10 dB "bonus", as they are found less annoying at the same loudness level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JASMAN000115000004001597000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |title=Annoyance caused by the sounds of a magnetic levitation train |author=Vos, Joos |journal=The Journal of the [[Acoustical Society of America]] |date=April 2004 |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=1597–1608 |access-date=23 May 2008 |doi=10.1121/1.1650330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JASMAN000108000005002527000002&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes |title=Maglev—A super fast train |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |date=November 2000 |author=Gharabegian, Areq |volume=108 |issue=5 |page=2527 |access-date=23 May 2008 |doi=10.1121/1.4743350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maglev Videos"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://namti.org/?page_id=1340 |work=North American Maglev Transport Institute |title=Maglevs in Action |date=1 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111146/http://namti.org/?page_id=1340 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Magnet reliability:''' Superconducting magnets are generally used to generate the powerful magnetic fields to levitate and propel the trains. These magnets must be kept below their critical temperatures (this ranges from 4.2 K to 77 K, depending on the material). New alloys and manufacturing techniques in superconductors and cooling systems have helped address this issue.
* '''Control systems''': No signalling systems are needed for high-speed rail, because such systems are computer controlled. Human operators cannot react fast enough to manage high-speed trains. High speed systems require dedicated rights of way and are usually elevated. Two maglev system microwave towers are in constant contact with trains. There is no need for train whistles or horns, either.
* '''Terrain''': Maglevs are able to ascend higher grades, offering more routing flexibility and reduced tunneling.&lt;ref name="CaliforniaProgressReport" /&gt; However, their high speed and greater need for control make it difficult for a maglev to merge with complex terrain, such as a curved hill. Traditional trains, on the other hand, are able to curve along side a mountain top or meander through a forest.

=== Comparison with aircraft ===
Differences between airplane and maglev travel:

* '''Efficiency''': For maglev systems the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] can exceed that of aircraft (for example [[Inductrack]] can approach 200:1 at high speed, far higher than any aircraft). This can make maglev more efficient per kilometer. However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jets take advantage of low air density at high altitudes to significantly reduce air drag. Hence despite their lift-to-drag ratio disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* '''Routing''': Maglevs offer competitive journey times for distances of {{convert|800|km|abbr=on}} or less. Additionally, maglevs can easily serve intermediate destinations.
* '''Availability''': Maglevs are little affected by weather.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* '''Travel time''': Maglevs do not face the extended security protocols faced by air travelers nor is time consumed for taxiing, or for queuing for take-off and landing.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== Economics ==
{{update|date=January 2018}}{{POV section|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- Claims given below seem to have fallen flat; the proposed Hongqiao/South extension is apparently being cancelled for economic reasons. de:Transrapid_Shanghai sources 15/16 put current track cost per km closer to 40 million dollars. --&gt;

Ridership is not a primary focus of this demonstration line, since the Longyang Road station is on the eastern outskirts of Shanghai. Once the line is extended to South Shanghai Train station and Hongqiao Airport station, which may not happen because of economic reasons, ridership was expected to cover operation and maintenance costs and generate significant net revenue.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}}

The South Shanghai extension was expected to cost approximately US$18 million per kilometre. In 2006 the German government invested $125 million in guideway cost reduction development that produced an all-concrete modular design that is faster to build and is 30% less costly. Other new construction techniques were also developed that put maglev at or below price parity with new high-speed rail construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://namti.org/?page_id=3281 |title=Modular Guideway Manufacturing " North American Maglev Transport Institute |publisher=Namti.org |access-date=29 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919050405/http://namti.org/?page_id=3281 |archivedate=19 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[Chuo Shinkansen]] maglev in Japan was estimated to cost approximately US$82 billion to build, with a route requiring long tunnels.

==== FTA's UMTD program ====
In the US, the [[Federal Transit Administration]] (FTA) Urban Maglev Technology Demonstration program funded the design of several low-speed urban maglev demonstration projects. It assessed HSST for the [[Maryland Department of Transportation]] and maglev technology for the Colorado Department of Transportation. The FTA also funded work by [[General Atomics]] at [[California University of Pennsylvania]] to evaluate the MagneMotion M3 and of the Maglev2000 of Florida superconducting EDS system. Other US urban maglev demonstration projects of note are the LEVX in Washington State and the Massachusetts-based Magplane.

==== Southwest Jiaotong University, China ====
On 31 December 2000, the first crewed high-temperature superconducting maglev was tested successfully at [[Southwest Jiaotong University]], Chengdu, China. This system is based on the principle that bulk high-temperature superconductors can be levitated stably above or below a permanent magnet. The load was over {{convert|530|kg|abbr=on}} and the levitation gap over {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}}. The system uses [[liquid nitrogen]] to cool the [[superconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5166722 |title=IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, VOL. 19, NO. 3, page 2142 JUNE 2009 |doi=10.1109/TASC.2009.2018110 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |date=17 July 2009 |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[20]	Wang Jiasu, Wang Suyu, Zeng Youwen, Huang Haiyu, Luo Fang, Xu Zhipei, Tang Qixue, Lin Guobin, Zhang Cuifang, Ren Zhongyou, Zhao Guomin, Zhu Degui, Wang Shaohua, Jiang He, Zhu Min, Deng Changyan, Hu Pengfei, Li Chaoyong, Liu Fang, Lian Jisan, Wang Xiaorong, Wang Lianghui, Shen Xuming, Dong Xiaogang.

[[File:A maglev train coming out, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai.jpg|thumb|A maglev train coming out of the Pudong International Airport]]
{{Main|Shanghai Maglev Train}}

The [[Shanghai Maglev Train]], also known as the [[Transrapid]], is the fastest commercial train currently in operation and has a top speed of {{convert|430|km/h|abbr=on}}. The line was designed to connect [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] and the outskirts of central [[Pudong]], [[Shanghai]]. It covers a distance of {{convert|30.5|km|abbr=on}} in 8 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Michael |first1=Gebicki |title=What's the world's fastest passenger train |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/63558825/whats-the-worlds-fastest-passenger-train |access-date=24 December 2014 |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shanghai system was labeled a [[white elephant]] by rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sommerville |first=Quentin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7188122.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Well-heeled protests hit Shanghai |publisher=BBC News |date=14 January 2008 |access-date=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001, the Chinese signed an agreement with [[Transrapid]] to build an EMS high-speed maglev line to link Pudong International Airport with Longyang Road Metro station on the eastern edge of Shanghai. This [[Shanghai Maglev Train]] demonstration line, or Initial Operating Segment (IOS), has been in commercial operations since April 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smtdc.com/en/gycf2.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809150428/http://www.smtdc.com/en/gycf2.asp|date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now operates 115 daily trips (up from 110 in 2010) that traverse the {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} between the two stations in 7 minutes, achieving a top speed of {{convert|431|km/h|abbr=on}} and averaging {{convert|266|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shanghaichina.ca/video/maglevtrain.html |title=Shanghai Maglev Train (431 km/h) – High Definition Video|work=shanghaichina.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a 12 November 2003 system commissioning test run, it achieved {{convert|501|km/h|abbr=on}}, its designed top cruising speed. The Shanghai maglev is faster than Birmingham technology and comes with on-time – to the second – reliability greater than 99.97%.&lt;ref&gt;([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqshoQyqBeA 7-minute real time video of the maglev reaching 432 km/h in only 3 minutes])&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans to extend the line to [[Shanghai South Railway Station]] and [[Hongqiao Airport]] on the western edge of Shanghai are on hold. After the [[Shanghai–Hangzhou Passenger Railway]] became operational in late 2010, the maglev extension became somewhat redundant and may be canceled.

The commercial [[automation|automated]] "Urban Maglev" system commenced operation in March 2005 in [[Aichi]], Japan. The Tobu Kyuryo Line, otherwise known as the [[Linimo]] line, covers {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}}. It has a minimum operating radius of {{convert|75|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum gradient of 6%. The linear-motor magnetically levitated train has a top speed of {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}}. More than 10 million passengers used this "urban maglev" line in its first three months of operation. At {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, it is sufficiently fast for frequent stops, has little or no noise impact on surrounding communities, can navigate short radius rights of way, and operates during inclement weather. The trains were designed by the Chubu HSST Development Corporation, which also operates a test track in Nagoya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_5_44/ai_n6054072 |title=Nagoya builds Maglev Metro |publisher=International Railway Journal |date=May 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129162842/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_5_44/ai_n6054072 |archivedate=29 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AMT test track – Powder Springs, Georgia ===
A second prototype system in [[Powder Springs]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], USA, was built by American Maglev Technology, Inc. The test track is {{convert|610|m|abbr=on}} long with a {{convert|168.6|m|abbr=on}} curve. Vehicles are operated up to {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}, below the proposed operational maximum of {{convert|97|km/h|abbr=on}}. A June 2013 review of the technology called for an extensive testing program to be carried out to ensure the system complies with various regulatory requirements including the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) People Mover Standard.

;Sydney-Illawarra
A maglev route was proposed between Sydney and [[Wollongong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/maglev-train-reappears-on-agenda/1233197.aspx |title=Maglev train reappears on agenda |publisher=Illawara Mercury |date=2 August 2008 |first=Mario |last=Christodoulou}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal came to prominence in the mid-1990s. The Sydney–Wollongong commuter corridor is the largest in Australia, with upwards of 20,000 people commuting each day. Current trains use the [[Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra railway line|Illawarra line]], between the cliff face of the [[Illawarra escarpment]] and the Pacific Ocean, with travel times about 2 hours.

In late 2008, a proposal was put forward to the [[Government of Victoria]] to build a privately funded and operated maglev line to service the [[Greater Melbourne]] metropolitan area in response to the [[Eddington Transport Report, Victoria|Eddington Transport Report]] that did not investigate above-ground transport options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24100590-2862,00.html |title=Plans to build Geelong-Melbourne-Frankston monorail |work=Herald Sun |location=Australia |first=Martin |last=Watters |date=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windana.com/access/melbourne/e3.html |title=Melbourne Concepts – Maglev's relevance |publisher=Windana Research |access-date=7 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512223734/http://www.windana.com/access/melbourne/e3.html |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maglev would service a population of over 4 million{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} and the proposal was costed at A$8 billion.

However despite road congestion and Australia's highest roadspace per capita,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} the government dismissed the proposal in favour of road expansion including an A$8.5 billion road tunnel, $6 billion extension of the [[EastLink (Melbourne)|Eastlink]] to the [[Western Ring Road]] and a $700 million Frankston Bypass.

'''Union Pacific freight conveyor''': Plans are under way by American rail road operator [[Union Pacific]] to build a {{convert|7.9|km|abbr=on}} container shuttle between the Ports of [[Port of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] and [[Port of Long Beach|Long Beach]], with UP's [[intermodal container]] transfer facility. The system would be based on "passive" technology, especially well suited to freight transfer as no power is needed on board. The vehicle is a [[chassis]] that glides to its destination. The system is being designed by [[General Atomics]].&lt;ref name=rgi20090209 /&gt;

'''California-Nevada Interstate Maglev''': High-speed maglev lines between major cities of southern California and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] are under study via the [[California-Nevada Interstate Maglev]] Project.&lt;ref name=msnbc1&gt;{{cite news |first=Jasmin Aline |last=Persch |title=America's fastest train moves ahead |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25265682/ |publisher=[[msnbc]] |date= 25 June 2008 |access-date=31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was originally proposed as part of an [[Interstate 5|I-5]] or [[Interstate 15|I-15]] expansion plan, but the federal government ruled that it must be separated from interstate public work projects.

After the decision, private groups from Nevada proposed a line running from Las Vegas to Los Angeles with stops in [[Primm, Nevada]]; [[Baker, California]]; and other points throughout [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] into Los Angeles. Politicians expressed concern that a high-speed rail line out of state would carry spending out of state along with travelers.

'''Baltimore – Washington D.C. Maglev''': A {{convert|64|km|abbr=on}} project has been proposed linking [[Baltimore – Washington D.C.

'''San Diego-Imperial County airport''': In 2006 San Diego commissioned a study for a maglev line to a proposed airport located in [[Imperial County Airport|Imperial County]]. [[SANDAG]] claimed that the concept would be an "airports [sic] without terminals", allowing passengers to check in at a terminal in San Diego ("satellite terminals"), take the train to the airport and directly board the airplane. In addition, the train would have the potential to carry freight. Further studies were requested although no funding was agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandag.org/index.asp?projectid=291&amp;fuseaction=projects.detail |title=SANDAG: San Diego Maglev project |access-date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toronto Zoo''': Edmonton-based [[Magnovate]] has proposed a new ride and transportation system at the [[Toronto Zoo]] reviving the [[Toronto Zoo Domain Ride]] system, which was closed following two severe accidents in 1994. The Zoo's board unanimously approved the proposal on November 29, 2018. 

The company will construct and operate the $25 million system on the former route of the Domain Ride (known locally as the Monorail, despite not being considered one) at zero cost to the Zoo and operate it for 15 years, splitting the profits with the Zoo. The ride will serve a single-directional loop around Zoo grounds, serving five stations and likely replacing the current Zoomobile tour tram service. Planned to be operational by 2022 at the earliest, this will become the first commercially operating maglev system in North America should it be approved. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/11/29/toronto-zoo-maglev-train-floats-closer-to-reality-as-board-approves-proposal.html |publisher=Toronto Star |title=Toronto Zoo meglev train floats closer to reality as board approves proposal |date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
On 25 September 2007, [[Bavaria]] announced a high-speed maglev-rail service from [[Munich]] to its [[Munich International Airport|airport]]. The Bavarian government signed contracts with [[Deutsche Bahn]] and Transrapid with [[Siemens]] and [[ThyssenKrupp]] for the €1.85 billion project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7011932.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Germany to build maglev railway |date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2008, the [[Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs (Germany)|German Transport minister]] announced the project had been cancelled due to rising costs associated with constructing the track. A new estimate put the project between €3.2–3.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSL2777056820080327?sp=true |title=Germany scraps Munich Transrapid as cost spirals |last=Heller |first=Gernot |agency=Reuters |date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
'''SwissRapide''': The SwissRapide AG together with the SwissRapide Consortium was planning and developing the first maglev monorail system for intercity traffic between the country's major cities. SwissRapide was to be financed by private investors. In the long-term, the SwissRapide Express was to connect the major cities north of the Alps between [[Geneva]] and [[St. Gallen]], including [[Lucerne]] and [[Basel]]. The first projects were [[Bern]] – [[Zurich]], [[Lausanne]] – Geneva as well as Zurich – [[Winterthur]]. The first line (Lausanne – Geneva or Zurich – Winterthur) could go into service as early as 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissrapide.com/upload/dokumente/2011.03.03%20Artikel%20SwissRapide%20GHI.pdf |title=Lausanne en 10 minutes |publisher=GHI |date=3 March 2011 |language=French |access-date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissrapide.com/upload/dokumente/NZZ_SwissRapide_Express_20_06_2009.pdf |title=In 20 Minuten von Zürich nach Bern |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |date=20 June 2009 |language=German |access-date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Swissmetro]]''': An earlier project, Swissmetro AG envisioned a partially evacuated underground maglev (a [[vactrain]]).  As with SwissRapide, Swissmetro envisioned connecting the major cities in Switzerland with one another. In 2011, Swissmetro AG was dissolved and the IPRs from the organisation were passed onto the [[EPFL]] in Lausanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissmetro.ch/ |title=Swissmetro.ch |publisher=Swissmetro.ch |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beijing Metro'''&lt;br /&gt;In October 2017 a low-speed maglev line opened in Beijing. The [[S1 line (Beijing Subway)|S1 Line]] operates at speeds up to 110 km/h and serves as a suburban commuter line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-10/17/content_33351613.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}{{update|section|date=June 2016}}
Low speed maglev (urban maglev) is proposed for YangMingShan MRT Line for Taipei, a circular line connecting Taipei City to New Taipei City, and almost all other Taipei transport routes, but especially the access starved northern suburbs of Tien Mou and YangMingShan. From these suburbs to the city, transit times would be reduced by 70% or more compared to peak hours, and between Tien Mou and YangMingShan, from approx 20 minutes, to 3 minutes. Key to the line is YangMingShan Station, at ‘Taipei level’ in the mountain, 200M below YangMingShan (YangMing Mountain) Village, with 40 second high speed elevators to the Village.

Linimo or a similar system would be preferred, as being the core of Taipei's public transport system, it should run 24 hours a day. Also, in certain areas it would run within metres of apartments, so the near silent operation, and minimal maintenance requirements of maglev would be major advantages.

An extension of the line could run to Chiang Kai Shek Airport, and possibly on down the island, passing through major population centres, which the High Speed Rail must avoid. The minimal vibration of maglev would also be suitable to provide access Hsinchu Science Park, where sensitive silicon foundries are located. In the other direction, connection to the Tansui Line and to High Speed ferries at Tansui would provide overnight travel to Shanghai and Nagasaki, and to Busan or Mokpo in South Korea, thus interconnecting the public transport systems of four countries, with great savings in fossil fuel consumption compared to flight.

YangMingShan MRT Line won the 'Engineering Excellence' Award, at the 2013 World Metro Summit in Shanghai.

=== Hong Kong ===
{{Main|Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link}}
The Express Rail Link, previously known as the Regional Express, which will connect Kowloon with the territory's border with China, explored different technologies and designs in its planning stage, between Maglev and conventional highspeed railway, and if the latter was chosen, between a dedicated new route and sharing the tracks with the existing West Rail. Finally conventional highspeed with dedicated new route was chosen. It is expected to be operational in 2018.

=== Malaysia/Singapore ===
A Consortium led by UEM Group Bhd and ARA Group, proposed Maglev technology to link Malaysian cities to Singapore. The idea was first mooted by YTL Group. Its technology partner then was said to be Siemens. High costs sank the proposal. The concept of a high-speed rail link from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore resurfaced. It was cited as a proposed "high impact" project in the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) that was unveiled in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/764721|title=At what cost high-speed rail|work=thesundaily.my}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approval has been given for the [[Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail]] project, but not using maglev technology.

=== Iran ===
In May 2009, [[Iran]] and a German company signed an agreement to use maglev to link [[Tehran]] and [[Mashhad]]. The agreement was signed at the Mashhad International Fair site between Iranian Ministry of Roads and Transportation and the German company. The {{convert|900|km|abbr=on}} line possibly could reduce travel time between Tehran and Mashhad to about 2.5 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=6163&amp;sectionid=351020102 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.ir |access-date=29 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521011126/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=6163&amp;sectionid=351020102 |archivedate=21 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Munich-based Schlegel Consulting Engineers said they had signed the contract with the Iranian ministry of transport and the governor of Mashad.

== Incidents ==
Two incidents involved fires. A Japanese test train in Miyazaki, MLU002, was completely consumed in a fire in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31942113_ITM |title = High speed hopes soar |publisher=Railway Age |date =1 May 1992 |last = Vranich |first = Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2006, a fire broke out on the commercial Shanghai Transrapid shortly after arriving at the Longyang terminal. People were evacuated without incident before the vehicle was moved about 1 kilometre to keep smoke from filling the station. NAMTI officials toured the SMT maintenance facility in November 2010 and learned that the cause of the fire was "[[thermal runaway]]" in a battery tray. As a result, SMT secured a new battery vendor, installed new temperature sensors and insulators and redesigned the trays.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

On 22 September 2006, a [[2006 Lathen maglev train accident|Transrapid train collided with a maintenance vehicle]] on a test/publicity run in Lathen (Lower Saxony / north-western Germany).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,438657,00.html |title = Several Dead in Transrapid Accident |work=Spiegel Online |date =22 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1204030.php/23_dead_in_German_maglev_train_accident__Roundup_ |title=23 dead in German maglev train accident |publisher=M&amp;C Europe |date=22 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011192600/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1204030.php/23_dead_in_German_maglev_train_accident__Roundup_ |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-three people were killed and ten were injured; these were the first maglev crash fatalities. The accident was caused by human error.

[[Aviation safety#Transport comparisons|Safety]] becomes an ever greater concern with high speed public transport due to the potentially large impact force and number of casualties. In the case of maglev trains, an incident could result from human error, including loss of power, or factors outside human control, such as ground movement, for example, caused by an earthquake.

'''Ocean Rig UDW Inc.''' is an operator of [[semi-submersible]] [[Oil platform|oil rigs]] and UDW drillships based in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The company also maintains offices in [[Luanda]], [[Angola]],  Jersey, [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] and [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]]..

The company has two semi-submersibles, the  ''Leiv Eiriksson'' and ''Eirik Raude'', and four ultra deepwater drill ships "Ocean Rig Olympia", "Ocean Rig Mykonos", "Ocean Rig Poseidon" and "Ocean Rig Corcovado". Four further ultra deep water drill ships are currently under construction with three due for completion in 2013, and one in 2015.

Areas of operation as of 2012 are Brazil, West Africa, East Africa and the Norwegian sector.

The company was established in 1996 as Ocean Rig ASA. Ocean Rig was listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] in 1997–2008. Since 2011 it is listed in [[NASDAQ]]. In 2007–2008, 74% of the company is owned by [[DryShips Inc]], controlled by Greek-American shipping tycoon [[George Economou (shipbuilder)|George Economou]].

In 2011 the ''Leiv Eirikson'' finished operations the [[Black Sea]] on contract to [[Petrobras]] and [[TPAO]] and went to the Arctic on contract to [[Cairn Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Activists occupy oil rig in fight to prevent Arctic drilling|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/22/activists-occupy-arctic-oil-rig|accessdate=2011-04-22|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3580">[[Image:Photonics Mast Array 01.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A photonics mast aboard a {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine}}]]

A '''photonics mast''' (or ''[[optronics]] mast''&lt;ref name="BBCNewsSco1"&gt;[[BBC News]] Scotland, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6969958.stm A vision of evolving technologies]'' 30 August 2007, 13:06 GMT&lt;/ref&gt;) is a sensor on a [[submarine]] which functions similarly to a [[periscope]] without requiring a periscope tube, thus freeing design space during construction and limiting risks of water leakage in the event of damage. A photonics mast replaces the mechanical, [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] viewing system with digital equipment, similar to a [[digital camera]] array, and it has fewer locational and dimensional constraints than a traditional periscope.

Unlike a periscope, it need not be located directly above its user, and it requires only a small [[submarine hull|pressure hull]] penetration for cabling. This allows the photonics mast to fit entirely within the [[Sail (submarine)|sail]] of the submarine and means the control room need not be placed directly below the sail.

A photonics mast operates by rising above the water in a manner similar to a [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescoping]] car antenna and provides information through an array of sensors, such as [[high-definition video|high-definition]] [[night vision|low-light]] and [[Thermographic camera|thermographic]] cameras. Images and information can appear on display panels for analysis. The photonics mast can also support the [[navigation]], [[electronic warfare]], and [[Military communications|communications functions]] of a conventional optical-periscope mast.

The [[Royal Navy]] tested an optronic mast on the {{sclass-|Trafalgar|submarine|0}} {{HMS|Trenchant|S91|6}} in 1998. Boats of the {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|4}} currently under construction {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} each have two optronic masts&lt;ref name="BBCNewsSco1"/&gt; manufactured by [[Thales Optronics]].

==Use by United States Navy==
[[Image:Comparison of Sail and Periscope Virgina Class Submarine.jpg|right|thumb|Comparison in design of periscope well and sail.]]
In 2004, the [[United States Navy]] began fitting photonics masts to {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine}}s.&lt;ref name=HowStuffWorks&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/photonic-mast.htm How Photonics Masts Will Work]
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the US Navy:&lt;ref name=USNFactSheet&gt;
{{cite web
|url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_print.asp?cid=4100&amp;tid=100&amp;ct=4&amp;page=1

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ''Virginia''-class boats, traditional periscopes have been supplanted by two Photonics Masts that house color, high-resolution black and white, and infrared digital cameras atop telescoping arms. With the removal of the barrel periscopes, the ships’ [[control room]] has been moved down one deck and away from the hull’s curvature, affording it more room and an improved layout that provides the [[commanding officer]] with enhanced [[situational awareness]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5612">{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}'''Plan Bay Area''' 2040 is a state-mandated law that aims to integrate sustainable strategies to reduce transportation-related pollution and external greenhouse gas emission within the nine-counties of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It is also known as the implementation of the [[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008]] or SB 375. The plan addresses methods of transportation, land-use, and housing. Over the next 25 years, the Bay Area is expected to grow by an estimated 2 million people and because of the projected growth and the growing economy, the Bay Area must provide more housing and transportation choices that will reduce their carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planbayarea.org/previous-plan|title=Previous Plan {{!}} Plan Bay Area|website=www.planbayarea.org|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This adopted plan will invest in increasing methods of transportation with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions. To do so, the plan will invest in extending ferry services, freeway express lanes, and developing newer [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] Stations to expand travel reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/New-regional-plan-puts-Bay-Area-housing-crisis-11074949.php|title=Blueprint for Bay Area aims to ‘change the dynamics’ of housing crisis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of this plan is to improve on their earlier efforts of network and growth within the context of finance and environmental responsibility. Like all plans, it is a work in progress that is updated every four years to reflect on new priorities and changes with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The plan was approved on July 18, 2013 by the Association of Bay Area Governments and by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Plan Bay Area website, http://planbayarea.org/plan-bay-area.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Association of Bay Area Governments website, http://abag.ca.gov/planning/housing/pba.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of the plan by regional planners was covered by the San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cabanatuan|first1=Michael|title=Plan Bay Area adopted by regional planners|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Plan-Bay-Area-adopted-by-regional-planners-4676169.php|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment ==
The Bay Area is home to a high concentration of knowledge-based industries, research centers and universities. It is located at one of the most famous tech clusters widely known throughout the globe as [[Silicon Valley]]. With the various industries available within the region, it does not come as a surprise that the Bay Area is also home to a highly educated and international labor market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/pdf/JHCS/May_2012_Jobs_Housing_Connection_Strategy_Main_Report.pdf|title=Job-Housing Connection Strategy|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2012|website=Plan Bay Area|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay Area attracts highly skilled and educated individuals around the world as it is the global epicenter for advancements in technology and related knowledge-based industries. Despite this growing population and the increase access of job opportunities, there is limited housing options available.

== Housing Crisis ==
Due to the continual growth of companies coming moving into the Bay Area, there is a high demand of employment. However, there is a low supply of housing available to accommodate these workers.

=== Job-Housing Connection Approach&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
[[File:Priority Development Area-e1432267822696.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Priority Development Areas around the Bay Area]]The Job-Housing Strategy consists of addressing housing, economic development, transportation, and land conservation policies in order to support long-term growth. This strategy focuses on locally designated Priority Development Areas to attract economic potential by providing housing and increasing transportation options for the growing demand of workers. This strategy consists of four goals: 
# To create more jobs in order to stimulate and strengthen the regional economy.
# Widen the accessibility, affordability, and variety of housing available. 
# Establish a network of communities.
# Protect region's unique natural environment. 
The hope of these goals is to strengthen regional infrastructure and preserve agriculture land and natural resources.

== Long-term Goals ==
The final blueprint for directing all growth in the Bay Area is to reduce urban sprawl onto natural and agricultural land. Some of the highlights include the following: 
* No sprawl for 30 years. New growth will occur within existing boundaries by increasing population density. 
* Public transit will be located near 80% of new homes, as well as the projected 60% of new jobs. 
* Funds provided by the One Bay Area Grant program will go to locations that are the most sustainable and equitable developed for transportation and affordable homes.
* Natural and agricultural land will be protected and funded by the Priority Conservation Area Grant Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenbelt.org/plan-bay-area/|title=Plan Bay Area {{!}} Greenbelt Alliance|work=Greenbelt Alliance|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramleh''' are a British [[experimental music]] group formed by musician Gary Mundy in 1982. The current line-up of the band includes Gary Mundy, Anthony di Franco and Stuart Dennison. Originally a part of the English [[power electronics (music)|power electronics]] and [[industrial music]] scene in early 1980s, Ramleh experimented with a more traditional rock format in their later releases.

The group was formed by Mundy in 1982 as a part of the power electronics scene in early 1980s, which included artists such as [[Whitehouse (band)|Whitehouse]] and [[Sutcliffe Jügend]].&lt;ref name="allmusic1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ramleh-mn0000393760/biography | title=Ramleh | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=1 April 2014 | author=Mason, Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing ''Onslaught'' cassette, he was joined by [[Philip Best]], a 14-year-old musician who was known for his involvement in Iphar and Whitehouse.&lt;ref name="quietus1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grim"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.korperschwache.com/skull/shock92.html | title=Ramleh - Interview | publisher=Grim Humour | date=1991–1992 | accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's ''21/5/62/82'' cassette was released in 1982 and was titled as a reference to the execution of Nazi war criminal [[Adolf Eichmann]].&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt; Ramleh recorded four more cassette releases in 1982: ''Onslaught'', ''Live to Theresienstadt'', ''Live New Force'', and ''Live Phenol''. ''Live McCarthy'', ''Live at Moden Tower 12/10/1983'', and ''Live at Prossneck 1/10/83'',  A Return to Slavery and The Hand of Glory EPs were added to the band's catalogue in 1983. This was followed by a string of cassette releases in 1983. Although Ramleh disbanded in 1984, Mundy's own record label Broken Flag continued releasing Ramleh material.&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;

After releasing ''Hole in the Heart'' cassette and a few records under the Ramleh alias in 1987, Mundy reformed the band in 1989 with Best.&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt; The reunion was followed by ''Grudge for Life'' LP in 1989. Inspired by Mundy's [[experimental rock]] band Skullflower,&lt;ref name="quietus1"/&gt; the band began to incorporate [[Rock music|rock]] influences in their records, starting with ''Blowhole'' in 1991.&lt;ref name="trouser"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=ramleh | title=Ramleh | publisher=[[Trouser Press]] | accessdate=1 April 2014 | author=Perdue, Everett Jang}}&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing ''Caught From Behind'', a split with Italian artist M.T.T, and ''Crystal Revenge'', the band added Skullflower members Anthony di Franco on bass and Stuart Dennison on drums to its line-up. The new line-up released ''Homeless'' in 1994. The band continued releasing rock records in late 1990s, which included ''Adieu, All You Judges'' and ''[[Be Careful What You Wish For (Ramleh album)|Be Careful What You Wish For]]'' in 1995, and ''Works III'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="trouser"/&gt; After releasing ''Boeing'', Mundy disbanded Ramleh for the second time.&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;

In 2009, Mundy and di Franco reformed Ramleh with drummer Martyn Watts. In that year, the band also returned to its original power electronics aesthetics with ''Valediction'' LP, although Mundy states that the band will be performing in both rock and [[Electronic music|electronic]] genres.&lt;ref name="quietus1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07835-ramleh-interview-broken-flag | title=Destroying Structure: An Interview With Ramleh | publisher=[[The Quietus]] | date=1 February 2012 | accessdate=1 April 2014 | author=Burnett, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Stuart Dennison returned to drum with Ramleh and played on the US west coast tour in January 2016.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Musical style and imagery==
Early recordings of Ramleh were labeled as power electronics and [[noise music]].&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quietus1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aqua"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aquariusrecords.org/bin/search.cgi?searchfield=keyword&amp;search_string=RAMLEH%20Valediction | title=Ramleh - Valediction | publisher=Aquarius Records | accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1990s the band started experiment with more traditional rock music structures. The band's more traditional works were commonly labeled as "[[noise rock]]."&lt;ref name="trouser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="review-allmusic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/be-careful-what-you-wish-for-mw0000185989 | title=Ramleh - Be Careful for What You Wish For | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=1 April 2014 | author=Mason, Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frances Morgan of [[The Quietus]] described the band music during this era as "a brutal, abject strand of dark [[psychedelic rock]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03767-frances-morgan-ramleh-fursaxa-jonas-reinhardt-yannis-kyriakides-bird-show-band-review | title=A Dispatch From The Outer Reaches: Ramleh, Fursaxa &amp; More | publisher=[[The Quietus]] | date=22 February 2010 | accessdate=1 April 2014 | author=Morgan, Frances}}&lt;/ref&gt; while albums such as ''Works III'' and ''Boeing'' were labeled as "heavy psych-noise rock."&lt;ref name="aqua" /&gt; Skullflower and [[Butthole Surfers]] were influences on these works.&lt;ref name="quietus1"/&gt; Ramleh's first album after 2009 reunion expressed a revival of the band's original power electronics genre and was compared to the works of Japanese noise musician [[Merzbow]],&lt;ref name="quietus1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aqua"/&gt; while the band retained its rock music instrumentation during this era, performing on both genres.&lt;ref name="quietus1"/&gt;

In its early days, Ramleh flirted with [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] imagery for its shock value, like other bands in the industrial music scene.&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trouser"/&gt; Nevertheless, Mundy and Best since discontinued this practice and disavowed it, denying any affiliations with hate groups.&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;

A '''real photo postcard''' ('''RPPC''') is a [[continuous tone|continuous-tone]] photographic image printed on [[postcard]] stock. The term recognizes a distinction between the real photo process and the [[lithography|lithographic]] or [[offset printing]] processes employed in the manufacture of most postcard images.

==History==
In 1903 [[Kodak]] introduced the No. 3A Folding Pocket Kodak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagephoto.tv/kgpc.shtml |title=Kodak Girls Postcard |website=Vintagephoto.tv |date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camera, designed for postcard-size film, allowed the general public to take photographs and have them printed on [[postcard]] backs, usually in the same dimensions (3-1/2" x 5-1/2") as standard vintage postcards. Many other cameras were used, some of which used glass [[photographic plate]]s that produced images that had to be cropped in order to fit the postcard format.

In 1907, Kodak introduced a service called "real photo postcards," which enabled customers to make a postcard from any picture they took.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/galleries/real_photo_postcards.php |title=Real Photo Postcards |newspaper=[[The Morning News (online magazine)|The Morning News]] |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kodak was the major promoter of photo postcard production, the company used the term "real photo" less frequently than photographers and others in the marketplace from 1903 to ca. 1930.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=July 2014}}

''[[Old House Journal]]'' states that "beginning in 1902 Kodak offered a preprinted card back that allowed postcards to be made directly from negatives." &lt;ref name="oldhousejournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldhousejournal.com/magazine/2000/julaug/realphoto/index.shtml |title=July/August 2000: Real-Photo Postcards |publisher=Old House Journal |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology allowed photographers to travel from town to town and document life in the places they visited. ''Old House Journal'' continues: "Local entrepreneurs hired them to record area events and the homes of prominent citizens. These postcards documented important buildings and sites, as well as parades, fires, and floods. Realtors used them to sell new housing by writing descriptions and prices on the back. Real photo postcards became expressions of pride in home and community, and were also sold as souvenirs in local drug stores and stationery shops." &lt;ref name="oldhousejournal.com"/&gt;

On March 1, 1907, Federal legislation permitted senders, for the first time, to include a message on a portion of the back of a postcard. (Prior to that time, the address only was allowed on one side while the other side could present a photo or artwork.) The front side could then accommodate a full-size real photograph. The popularity of real photo postcards soared nationwide, and many people began collecting the cards in albums. No other single format has provided such a massive photo history of America,{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=July 2014}} particularly of small-town and rural America where photography was often a luxury. Many real photo postcards were unique prints captured by amateur photographers, but others were mass-produced by companies such as the Eastern Illustrating and Publishing Company in Belfast, Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penobscotmarinemuseum.org/eastern-illustrating-publishing-company/ |title=Eastern Illustrating &amp; Publishing Company |website=Penobscotmarinemuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real photo postcards were sometimes created and sold as mementoes at the scene of [[lynching]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.twinpalms.com/?p=backlist&amp;bookID=88 |title=Twin Palms Publishers |website=Twinpalms.com |date=2013-12-02 |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were also used to document such important events as the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netdotcom.com/revmexpc/ |title=Postcards of the Mexican Revolution |website=Netdotcom.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real photo postcards may or may not have a white border, or a divided back, or other features of postcards, depending on the paper the photographer used.

The distinction between '''real value''' and '''nominal value''' occurs in many fields. From a philosophical viewpoint, nominal value represents an accepted condition, which is a goal or an approximation, as opposed to the real value, which is always present. 

==Measurement==
{{mergefrom|Nominal size|date=November 2018}}
{{see also|Nominal size}}

In measurement, a nominal value is often a value existing in name only;&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] D3039, D4139, and others&lt;/ref&gt; it is assigned as a convenient designation rather than calculated by  [[data analysis]] or following usual [[rounding]] methods.  The use of nominal values can be based on [[de facto standard]]s or some [[technical standard]]s.

All real measurements have some variation depending on the [[accuracy and precision]] of the [[test method]] and the [[measurement uncertainty]].  The use of reported values often involves [[engineering tolerance]]s.

One way to consider this is that the real value often has the characteristics of an [[irrational number]]. In real-world measuring situations, improving the measurement technique will eventually begin yielding unpredictable least significant digits. For example, a 1-inch long [[gauge block]] will measure to be exactly 1&amp;nbsp;inch long until the measuring techniques reach a certain degree of precision. As techniques improve beyond this threshold, it will become clear that 1&amp;nbsp;inch is not the real value of the gauge block length, but some other number approximates it.

==Engineering==
In various subfields of [[engineering]], a nominal value is one for which the "name" for the value is close to, but not the same as, the actual value.  Some examples:

* For [[dimensional lumber]] in North America, a "two by four" is not 2&amp;nbsp;inches by 4&amp;nbsp;inches, but rather between 1⅜ and 1⅝ inches thick and between 3⅜ and 3⅝ inches wide, sized to the equivalent rough hewn piece of [[softwood]] for nominal structural design purposes. The ⅛-inch tolerances absorb the natural variation. 
* A machine is designed to operate at some particular condition, often stated on the device's nameplate.   For example, a [[pump]] is designed to deliver its nominal pressure and flow while operating at its nominal speed and power.   Actual operating conditions may vary.
* Electricity:
**[[Mains electricity]] is nominally 230 [[Volt|V]] in the [[European Union]], but is allowed to vary ±10%.  In North America, the nominal voltage is 120 V, with variance allowed from 114 V to 126 V (±5%). Voltage is also supplied at 208 V, 240 V and 480 V with similar tolerances. In general, electrical devices are designed to work with one nominal [[voltage]], which represents a band of possible actual voltages, [[power factor]] and [[Alternating current|AC]] waveform shapes.
** Traction power networks routinely operate well above the nominal voltage, but still within the tolerance. For example, a [[streetcar]] traction power could be rated 600 ±10% volts nominal, but the actual overhead line voltage would normally be close to 660 volts, only dropping near the nominal value in exceptional conditions.
** [[NiMH]] and [[NiCd]] [[rechargeable batteries]] have a nominal voltage of 1.2 V, but will actually supply real voltages ranging from about 1.45 V to 1.0 V during discharge.
** A solar panel designed to charge a "12 V [[lead–acid battery]]" will often be called a "12-volt panel", even though the actual voltage while charging (of both the panel and the battery) is around 14 V, and the [[open-circuit voltage]] of the solar panel is around 17 V.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.freesunpower.com/solarpanels.php "Basic Tutorials: Solar Panels"].
Retrieved 2014-06-25.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cases involve diameter, speed, and volume.

Sometimes the word "nominal" is misused in engineering contexts as a synonym for "normal" or "expected"; for example, ''The rotor resistances on all the other operating wheels are nominal.''&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2426">'''Reprography''' is the reproduction of [[graphics]] through mechanical or electrical means, such as [[photography]] or [[xerography]].  Reprography is commonly used in catalogs and archives, as well as in the [[architectural reprography|architectural, engineering, and construction industries]].

==Overview==
In the [[United States]], the industry is a relatively small industry, with approximately 3000 firms. It comprises entrepreneurial businesses serving predominantly the large- and wide-format reproduction needs of the legal, architectural, engineering, manufacturing, retail, and advertising industries. Average sales volume is about $1.5 million and average employee counts are 20–25 people.

Large-format reproductions are produced with a variety of technologies dependent, in part, on the application of the final product and quantity needed. Examples of typical reproduction methods include: [[diazo]] (blueline), [[electrostatic]] (xerographic), [[photographic]], [[laser]], and [[ink jet]].

Reproductions can be made from the same size or smaller/larger hard copy originals. Prints can also be computer generated from [[CADD]] (computer aided design and drafting) files or from a growing variety of desktop publishing and design software packages.

In addition to addressing the large-format reproduction needs of their customers, reprographers frequently sell reprographic equipment and consumable supplies. Other business services such as mounting and lamination, quick copying, microfilming, scanning and facility management may also be provided.

Typical items produced by reprographers include architectural/engineering [[blueprints]] and renderings, indoor and outdoor signage, maps, billboards, backlit displays, trade show graphics, legal and medical exhibits, etc. 
Most of the reprographics firms in the [[United States]] belong to the [[International Reprographics Association]] (IRgA).

Reprographics is also referred to as "reproprinting".

'''SAE J3068''' is a [[North America]]n recommended practice published and maintained by [[SAE International]].  J3068 defines [[electrical connector]]s and a control protocol for [[electric car|electric vehicles]].  It has the formal title "SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J3068".  J3068 defines a system of conductive power transfer to an electric vehicle using a coupler capable of transferring single-phase and three-phase AC power as well as DC power, and defines a digital communication system for control. J3068 also specifies requirements for the vehicle inlet, supply equipment connector, mating housings and contacts. &lt;ref&gt;SAE J3068, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Initial discussions in the [[Electric Power Research Institute]]'s [https://www.epri.com/#/pages/sa/infrastructure_working_council Infrastructure Working Council] meetings regarding issues related to three-phase charging in North America led to the development of J3068. There was a lack of non-proprietary, [[UL (safety organization)|UL]]  [[Listing_and_approval_use_and_compliance|listed]] equipment that could be legally used in the United States. Some large electric vehicles were being charged without using ground fault protection, and without connectors that automatically de-enegerize when disconnected from the vehicle.  &lt;ref&gt;UD J3068 Site&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, SAE authorized a new Task Force to develop a standard that focused on heavy and medium duty applications, and more generally any vehicle charging at commercial and industrial locations or other places where three-phase power is available and preferred. Early within the development of the standard, it was decided that the J3068 connector and inlet would based on the IEC 62196 [[Type 2 connector]].

The control protocol is a variation of [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN]] which retains the analog voltage level signaling from [[SAE J1772]].  The positive level of the LIN signal waveform can change from 12 volts to 9 or 6 volts (known as State A, State B, and State C in J1772).  An earlier version of this LIN-based control protocol was published in Annex D of [[IEC 61851]] edition 3.  Major contributors to the development of this protocol include [[ABB Group|ABB]] in Sweden, the [[University of Delaware]], [[Vattenfall]] Sweden, [[Mack Trucks]]/[[Volvo Trucks]] North America and others.

== North American Standards  ==

J3068 states that it aims to cover three-phase equipment which meets applicable North American listing standards. 

The core standards for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in North America are tri-national standards for Mexico, Canada, and the United States.  See [https://www.canena.org CANENA].  They are essentially equivalent documents with different names in each country.

== North American Connector  ==

The J3068 connector is mechanically identical to the [[Type 2 connector]], because it makes [[Normative]] references to IEC 62196-2 and -3. Additionally, J3068 supports voltage ratings which align with North American grid voltages and EVSE standards.  Unlike Europe where the most common type of three-phase [[Three-phase_electric_power#Wye_(Y)_also_called_Star|Wye]] power is nominally 400/230 VAC (meaning ''line-to-line/line-to-neutral Volts Alternating Current''), in North America the three most common three-phase wye voltages are 208/120, 480/277, and 600/347 VAC. 

IEC standards limit single-phase AC charging to 250 VAC (see IEC 62196-2). Three-phase EVSE and single-phase vehicles are designed to be interoperable. A 480 phase-to-phase VAC rating is theoretically allowed in the IEC document but this is mathematically '''incongruent''' with the 250 VAC single phase limit. It effectively limits the maximum three-phase rating to 433VAC (250 * {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}), and means you cannot make a 480/277 VAC EVSE without exceeding the 250 VAC single phase limit. The SAE J3068 standard defines a system for nominal voltage ratings up to 600 VAC, which is also the maximum voltage rating covered by UL 2594.

Where AC voltages and current ratings exceed 250 VAC phase-to-neutral and/or 63 amps, digital communication (LIN-CP) is '''required'''.  Even in the case of a North American EV designed to charge from 208/120 VAC three-phase, LIN-CP controls are required unless the EV can at least tolerate 400/230 VAC long enough to signal the EVSE to turn off the power, if it cannot actually charge from 400/230 VAC. This is because the typical European EV designed for three phase charging will be exposed to 400/230 with PWM controls, and there is no guarantee that a North American three-phase EV will not be exposed to European supply voltages if it is exported. 

UL 2594 requires any EVSE that supplies more than 250 VAC be permanently wired to the mains (IEC 61851-1 calls this Mode 3). J3068 requires EV cord sets to be permanently connected (IEC 61851-1 calls this Case C). 

Example 1: A J3068 EVSE supplying 480/277 VAC at up to 100A is sold in the United States. The EVSE will be tested to UL2594 and the grid power will be wired directly into the EVSE. NFPA 70, Article 625, requires the breaker/fuse and wiring be sized for 125A because the load is up to 100A continuous. The vehicle cord set used will be tested to UL 2251 and be permanently attached to the station. Digital communications (LIN-CP) will check the vehicle is compatible with this voltage (480/277 VAC) and indicate maximum charge rate of 100A.  

Example 2: An imported passenger EV which only supports 61851-1 Annex A is connected to a 600/347 VAC Canadian EVSE designed to comply with J3068. The vehicle would be protected from potential damage, because the charging station would not close its internal relay. Only a vehicle which supports LIN-CP and indicates it accepts 600VAC could use the EVSE.

== Digital Communication for AC charging (LIN-CP) ==

Basic AC charging as defined in SAE J1772 and IEC 61851-1 Annex A via analog control pilot and is used with a variety of single-phase AC grid voltages lower than 250VAC. LIN-CP or Local Interconnect Network on the Control Pilot was originally specified in IEC 61851-1 Annex D in Edition 3.  Unlike PLC over Control Pilot (IEC 15118-2), it's designed to be a low-cost replacement for the PWM controls.  &lt;ref&gt;SAE J3068, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;IEC 61851-1 , Annex D&lt;/ref&gt;

This is similar the approach used by Tesla based on J2411 (Single-wire CAN), but maintains the CP voltage levels to be compatible with existing EVSE safety models. 

LIN transceivers used for J3068 must have an extended supply range. For example, the TI SN65HVDA100-Q1 operators from 5V to 27V. This is because the LIN transceiver must operate when the Control Pilot is at 6V level. &lt;ref&gt;SAE J3068, s. 6.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compatibility ==

The J3068 coupler is defined by reference to the IEC 62196 specifications, there are no mechanical differences. Voltage ratings are higher, but the original coupler was designed to support North American voltages, even if the PWM controls were not.  Underwriters Laboratories standards may allow certification of advanced design implementations at higher currents than the European standard, which is more conservative than other EV charging coupler current densities.  For example, the European 63 amp rating for the Type 2 connector 6 mm pins equates to about 2.23 amps per square mm of cross section, while the 200 amp rating for the 8 mm DC pins (without cooling) equates to 3.98 amps/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  

While J3068 focuses on AC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; charging (using the four smaller 6 mm pins), it also defines J3068 DC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; charging which is completely compatible with European Type 2 DC charging using the 8 mm pins (often referred to as "CCS", although the term "CCS" is not used in the IEC standards documents).  Both systems are identical, J3068 neither adds nor takes away from the existing DC charging standards, but merely references them.  J3068 AC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is fully interoperable with J3068 DC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, both systems can be implemented in the same vehicle without complication.  Further, the only significant electrical difference between J3068 DC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and J1772 DC charging is the value of the Prox resistor.  (The coupler has mechanical differences, of course.)

J3068 AC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; charging using the 6 mm pins may be implemented using older PWM controls (instead of the newer digital LIN controls) if the voltages do not exceed 433 VAC from line to line, and do not exceed 250 VAC from line to neutral.  However, this may not be optimal since a system designed for 400/230 VAC will probably not deliver sufficient charging power at 208/120 VAC, which is the only common voltage that is compatible with PWM controls in North America.  For this reason, J3068 is best implemented with support for LIN controls in North America.  For example, a charging system on a truck which is optimized for a highest nominal voltage of 208/120 VAC three phase (see Appendix E, figure 19 on page 91 of J3068) might simply refuse to charge if it does not detect LIN controls, thereby protecting itself from possible exposure to 400/230 VAC which is common with PWM controls.  Vehicles that can safely charge from 400/230 VAC and higher might support both LIN and PWM, to maximize the ability to charge at more locations.

Depending on the topology of the vehicle on-board charger, it may be possible to charge from a J1772 EVSE using an adapter.  While adapters are generally discouraged, manufacturer specific adapters might be useful and are allowed in some countries according to IEC.  Such an adapter shall be rated for 80 amps, as there is no practical way to signal the adapter's current rating.  For  example, an on-board charger configured for 480/277 which consists of three single-phase chargers wired from line to neutral, might support an adapter configured that connects L1, L2, and L3 of the J3068 together and to L1 of the J1772 input, and wires N from the J1772 inlet to N on the J3068 inlet.  The vehicle must be able to detect the differences between Prox pin resistances and must scale the current limit to 1/3 for each charger in this example.  Other configurations are possible depending on the design of the vehicle charger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">'''Slipform stone masonry''' is a method for making a [[reinforced concrete]] wall with stone facing in which stones and mortar are built up in courses within reusable [[slipform]]s. It is a cross between traditional mortared [[stone wall]] and a veneered stone wall. Short forms, up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm high, are placed on both sides of the wall to serve as a guide for the stone work. The stones are placed inside the forms with the good faces against the form work.  [[Concrete]] is poured in behind the rocks. [[Rebar]] is added for strength, to make a wall that is approximately half reinforced concrete and half [[stonework]]. The wall can be faced with stone on one side or both sides. After the concrete sets enough to hold the wall together, the forms are “slipped’ up to pour the next level. With slipforms it is easy for a novice to build free-standing stone walls. &lt;ref&gt;Elpel, Thomas J.

== History ==
Slipform stone masonry was developed by New York architect [[Ernest Flagg]] in 1920. Flagg built a vertical framework as tall as the wall, then inserted 2x6 or 2x8 planks as forms to guide the stonework. When the masonry work reached the top of a plank, Flagg inserted another one, adding more planks until he reached the top of the wall. [[Helen Nearing|Helen]] and [[Scott Nearing]] modified the technique in Vermont in the 1930s, using slipforms that were slipped up the wall. &lt;ref&gt;Elpel, Thomas J.

The [[Shtil'|Shtil-3a]] rocket offers costs approximately $400/kg, but launches are infrequent and have a comparatively small [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]], and its costs are partially subsidized by the [[Russian navy]] as part of launch exercises.&lt;ref name="trends"&gt;{{Cite web

Rocket costs have changed relatively little since the 1960s, but the market has been very flat.&lt;ref name="interface"/&gt;

==Cost estimates for a space elevator==
For a space elevator, the cost varies according to the design. [[Bradley C. Edwards]] received funding from [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NIAC]] from 2001 to 2003 to write a paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bradley Edwards|publisher=Eureka Scientific|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/521Edwards.html| title=NIAC Phase II study|date=1 Mar 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing a space elevator design.  In it he stated that: "The first space elevator would reduce lift costs immediately to $100 per pound" ($220/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/001660.html|title=

The gravitational potential energy of any object in geosynchronous orbit (GEO), relative to Earth's surface, is about 50 MJ (15 kWh) of energy per [[kilogram]] (see [[geosynchronous orbit]] for details). Using wholesale electricity prices  for 2008 to 2009, and the current 0.5% efficiency of [[Wireless power#Lasers|power beaming]], a space elevator would require US$220/kg just in electrical costs. Dr. Edwards expects technical advances to increase the efficiency to 2%.&lt;ref name=book03&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Space Elevator: A Revolutionary Earth-to-Space Transportation System|author= Bradley C. Edwards, Eric A. Westling |date=November 2003|isbn=0-9726045-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=book06&gt;{{Cite book |title=Leaving the Planet by Space Elevator|author=Bradley C. Edwards, Philip Ragan |date=October 2006 |isbn=978-1-4303-0006-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to the fact that space elevators would have a limited throughput as only a few payloads could climb the tether at any one time, the launch price may be subject to market forces.

==Funding of capital costs==
According to a paper presented at the 55th International Astronautical Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

For comparison, in potentially the same time frame as the elevator, the [[Reaction Engines Skylon|Skylon]], a 12,000&amp;nbsp;kg cargo capacity single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane (not a conventional rocket) is estimated to have an R&amp;D and production cost of about $15 billion.&lt;ref name=ch11 /&gt; The vehicle has about $3,000/kg price tag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21559">A '''superlattice''' is a periodic structure of layers of two (or more) materials. Typically, the thickness of one layer is several [[nanometer]]s. It can also refer to a lower-dimensional structure such as an array of [[quantum dots]] or [[quantum wires]].

== Discovery ==

Superlattices were discovered early in 1925 by Johansson and Linde &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|last2=Linde|title=The X-ray determination of the atomic arrangement in the mixed-crystal series gold-copper and palladium-copper|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1925|volume=78|issue=21|page=439|doi=10.1002/andp.19253832104|bibcode=1925AnP...383..439J}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the studies on gold-copper and palladium-copper systems through their special X-ray diffraction patterns. Further experimental observations and theoretical modifications on the field were done by Bradley and Jay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|last2=Jay|title=The formation of Superlattices in Alloys if Iron and Aluminium|journal=Proc.

== Mechanical properties ==

J.S. Koehler theoretically predicted &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koehler | first1 = J. | title = Attempt to Design a Strong Solid | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.2.547 | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 547–551 | year = 1970 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1970PhRvB...2..547K }}&lt;/ref&gt; that by using alternate (nano-)layers of materials with high and low elastic constants, shearing resistance is improved by up to 100 times as the [[Frank–Read Source|Frank–Read source]] of [[dislocation]]s cannot operate in the nanolayers.

The increased mechanical [[hardness]] of such superlattice materials was confirmed firstly by Lehoczky in 1978 on Al-Cu and Al-Ag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehoczky|first1=S. L.|title=Retardation of dislocation generation and motion in thin-layered metal laminates|journal=Acta Metallurgica|date=1973|volume=41|issue=26|page=1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on by several others, e.g. Barnett and Sproul &lt;ref&gt;P. Yashar, S. A. Barnett, J. Rechner and W. D. Sproul, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A16 (1998) 2913&lt;/ref&gt; on hard [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD]] coatings.

== Semiconductor properties ==

If the superlattice is made of two semiconductor materials with different [[band gap]]s, each [[quantum well]] sets up new [[selection rules]] that affect the conditions for charges to flow through the structure. The two different semiconductor materials are deposited alternately on each other to form a periodic structure in the growth direction. Since the 1970 proposal of synthetic superlattices by [[Leo Esaki|Esaki]] and [[Raphael Tsu|Tsu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Esaki | first1 = L. | last2 = Tsu | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1147/rd.141.0061 | title = Superlattice and Negative Differential Conductivity in Semiconductors | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development | volume = 14 | pages = 61–65 | year = 1970 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; advances in the physics of such ultra-fine semiconductors, presently called quantum structures, have been made. The concept of [[quantum confinement]] has led to the observation of quantum size effects in isolated quantum well heterostructures and is closely related to superlattices through the tunneling phenomena. Therefore, these two ideas are often discussed on the same physical basis, but each has different physics useful for applications in electric and optical devices.

== Semiconductor superlattice types ==

Superlattice miniband structures depend on the [[Heterojunction|heterostructure]] type, either ''type I'', ''type II'' or ''type III''. For type I the bottom of the [[conduction band]] and the top of the valence subband are formed in the same semiconductor layer. In type II the conduction and valence subbands are staggered in both real and [[reciprocal space]], so that electrons and holes are confined in different layers. Type III superlattices involve [[semimetal]] material, such as HgTe/[[CdTe]]. Although the bottom of the conduction subband and the top of the valence subband are formed in the same semiconductor layer in Type III superlattice, which is similar with Type I superlattice, the band gap of Type III superlattices can be continuously adjusted from semiconductor to zero band gap material and to semimetal with negative band gap.

Another class of quasiperiodic superlattices is named after [[Fibonacci]]. A Fibonacci superlattice can be viewed as a one-dimensional [[quasicrystal]], where either electron hopping transfer or on-site energy takes two values arranged in a [[Fibonacci sequence]].

== Semiconductor materials ==

[[File:GaAs-AlAs SL.JPG|300px|left|thumb|GaAs/AlAs superlattice and potential profile of conduction and valence bands along the growth direction (z).]]Semiconductor materials, which are used to fabricate the superlattice structures, may be divided by the element groups, IV, III-V and II-VI. While group III-V semiconductors (especially GaAs/Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As) have been extensively studied, group IV heterostructures such as the Si&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt; system are much more difficult to realize because of the large lattice mismatch. Nevertheless, the strain modification of the subband structures is interesting in these quantum structures and has attracted much attention.

In the GaAs/AlAs system both  the difference in lattice constant between GaAs and AlAs and the difference of their thermal expansion coefficient are small. Thus, the remaining strain at room temperature can be minimized after cooling from [[epitaxial growth]] temperatures. The first compositional superlattice was realized using the GaAs/Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As material system.

A [[graphene]]/[[boron nitride]] system forms a semiconductor&amp;nbsp;superlattice&amp;nbsp;once the two crystals are aligned. Its charge carriers move perpendicular to the electric field, with little energy dissipation. h-BN has a [[hexagonal]] structure similar to graphene's. The superlattice has broken [[inversion symmetry]]. Locally, topological currents are comparable in strength to the applied current, indicating large valley-Hall angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1254966| title = Detecting topological currents in graphene superlattices| journal = Science| year = 2014| last1 = Gorbachev | first1 = R.

===Production===
Superlattices can be produced using various techniques, but the most common are [[molecular-beam epitaxy]] (MBE) and [[sputtering]]. With these methods, layers can be produced with thicknesses of only a few atomic spacings. An example of specifying a superlattice is [{{chem|Fe|20|V|30}}]&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. It describes a bi-layer of 20Å of Iron (Fe) and 30Å of Vanadium (V) repeated 20 times, thus yielding a total thickness of 1000Å or 100&amp;nbsp;nm. The MBE technology as a means of fabricating semiconductor superlattices is of primary importance. In addition to the MBE technology, [[Metal organic chemical vapor deposition|metal-organic chemical vapor deposition]] (MO-CVD) has contributed to the development of superconductor superlattices, which are composed of quaternary III-V compound semiconductors like InGaAsP alloys. Newer techniques include a combination of gas source handling with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) technologies such as metal-organic molecules as source materials and gas-source MBE using hybrid gases such as arsine ({{chem|AsH|3}}) and phosphine ({{chem|PH|3}}) have been developed.

Generally speaking MBE is a method of using three temperatures in binary systems, e.g., the substrate temperature, the source material temperature of the group III and the group V elements in the case of III-V compounds.

The structural quality of the produced superlattices can be verified by means of [[X-ray diffraction]] or [[neutron diffraction]] spectra which contain characteristic satellite peaks. Other effects associated with the alternating layering are: [[giant magnetoresistance]], tunable reflectivity for X-ray and neutron mirrors, neutron [[spin polarization]], and changes in elastic and acoustic properties. Depending on the nature of its components, a superlattice may be called ''magnetic'', ''optical'' or ''semiconducting''.

[[File:Fe20v30.png|300px|right|thumb|X-ray and neutron scattering from the  [Fe&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; superlattice.]]

== Miniband structure ==

The schematic structure of a periodic superlattice is shown below, where A and B are two semiconductor materials of respective layer thickness ''a'' and ''b'' (period: &lt;math&gt;d=a+b&lt;/math&gt;). When ''a'' and ''b'' are not too small compared with the interatomic spacing, an adequate approximation is obtained by replacing these fast varying potentials by an effective potential derived from the band structure of the original bulk semiconductors. It is straightforward to solve 1D Schrödinger equations in each of the individual layers, whose solutions &lt;math&gt; \psi&lt;/math&gt; are linear combinations of real or imaginary exponentials.

For a large barrier thickness, tunneling is a weak perturbation with regard to the uncoupled dispersionless states, which are fully confined as well. In this case the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt; E_z(k_z) &lt;/math&gt;, periodic over &lt;math&gt;2 \pi /d &lt;/math&gt; with over &lt;math&gt; d=a+b &lt;/math&gt; by virtue of the Bloch theorem, is fully sinusoidal:

:&lt;math&gt;\ E_z(k_z)=\frac{\Delta}{2}(1-\cos(k_z d))&lt;/math&gt;

and the effective mass changes sign for &lt;math&gt; 2\pi /d&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ {m^* = \frac{\hbar^2}{\partial^2 E / \partial k^2}}|_{k=0}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of minibands, this sinusoidal character is no longer preserved. Only high up in the miniband (for wavevectors well beyond &lt;math&gt;2 \pi /d&lt;/math&gt;) is the top actually 'sensed' and does the effective mass change sign. The shape of the miniband dispersion influences miniband transport profoundly and accurate dispersion relation calculations are required given wide minibands. The condition for observing single miniband transport is the absence of interminiband transfer by any process. The thermal quantum ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'' should be much smaller than the energy difference &lt;math&gt; E_2-E_1&lt;/math&gt; between the first and second miniband, even in the presence of the applied electric field.

== Bloch states ==
For an ideal superlattice a complete set of [[eigenstates]] states can be constructed by products of plane waves &lt;math&gt; e^{ i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} }/ 2\pi &lt;/math&gt; and a ''z''-dependent function &lt;math&gt;f_k (z)&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the eigenvalue equation

:&lt;math&gt; \left( E_c(z) - \frac{\partial }{\partial z} \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_c (z)}  \frac{\partial }{\partial z} + \frac {\hbar^2 \mathbf{k} ^2}{2m_c (z)} \right) f_k (z) = E f_k (z) &lt;/math&gt;.

As &lt;math&gt; E_c (z) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m_c(z) &lt;/math&gt; are periodic functions with the superlattice period ''d'', the eigenstates are [[Bloch state]] &lt;math&gt; f_k (z)= \phi _{q, \mathbf{k}}(z)&lt;/math&gt; with energy &lt;math&gt;E^\nu (q, \mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt;. Within first-order [[perturbation theory]] in '''k'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, one obtains the energy

:&lt;math&gt; E^ \nu (q, \mathbf{k}) \approx E^ \nu(q, \mathbf{0}) +  \langle \phi _{q, \mathbf{k}} \mid \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}^2}{2m_c (z)} \mid \phi _{q, \mathbf{k}} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

Now, &lt;math&gt; \phi _{q, \mathbf{0}} (z) &lt;/math&gt; will exhibit a larger probability in the well, so that it seems reasonable to replace the second term by

:&lt;math&gt; E_k = \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}^2}{2m_w} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_w&lt;/math&gt; is the effective mass of the quantum well.

== Wannier functions ==

By definition the [[Bloch wave|Bloch functions]] are delocalized over the whole superlattice. This may provide difficulties if electric fields are applied or effects due to the superlattice's finite length are considered. Therefore, it is often helpful to use different sets of basis states that are better localized. A tempting choice would be the use of eigenstates of single quantum wells. Nevertheless, such a choice has a severe shortcoming: the corresponding states are solutions of two different [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, each neglecting the presence of the other well. Thus these states are not orthogonal, creating complications. Typically, the coupling is estimated by the transfer Hamiltonian within this approach. For these reasons, it is more convenient to use the set of [[Wannier functions]].

== Wannier–Stark ladder ==

Applying an electric field ''F''  to the superlattice structure causes the Hamiltonian to exhibit an additional scalar potential ''eφ''(''z'') = −''eFz'' that destroys the translational invariance. In this case, given an eigenstate with wavefunction &lt;math&gt; \Phi_0 (z) &lt;/math&gt; and energy &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;, then the set of states corresponding to wavefunctions &lt;math&gt;\Phi_j (z)= \Phi_0 (z-jd) &lt;/math&gt; are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with energies ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''jeFd''. These states are equally spaced both in energy and real space and form the so-called ''Wannier–Stark ladder''. The potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi_0 (z)&lt;/math&gt; is not bounded for the infinite crystal, which implies a continuous energy spectrum. Nevertheless, the characteristic energy spectrum of these Wannier–Stark ladders could be resolved experimentally.

== Transport ==

[[File:Sltransport.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Overview of the different standard approaches for superlattice transport.]]
The motion of charge carriers in a superlattice is different from that in the individual layers: [[Electron mobility|mobility]] of charge carriers can be enhanced, which is beneficial for high-frequency devices, and specific optical properties are used in [[Laser|semiconductor laser]]s.

If an external bias is applied to a conductor, such as a metal or a semiconductor, typically an electric current is generated. The magnitude of this current is determined by the band structure of the material, scattering processes, the applied field strength and the equilibrium carrier distribution of the conductor.

A particular case of superlattices called [[superstripes]] are made of superconducting units separated by spacers. In each miniband the superconducting order parameter, called the superconducting gap, takes different values, producing a multi-gap, or two-gap or multiband superconductivity.

== Other dimensionalities ==

Soon after two-dimensional electron gases ([[2DEG]]) had become commonly available for experiments, research groups attempted to create structures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heitmann | first1 = D. | last2 = Kotthaus | first2 = J. R. P. | doi = 10.1063/1.881355 | title = The Spectroscopy of Quantum Dot Arrays | journal = Physics Today | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 56 | year = 1993 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1993PhT....46f..56H }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could be called 2D artificial crystals. The idea is to subject the electrons confined to an [[Heterojunction|interface between two semiconductors]] (i.e. along ''z''-direction) to an additional modulation potential ''V''(''x'',''y''). Contrary to the classical superlattices (1D/3D, that is 1D modulation of electrons in 3D bulk) described above, this is typically achieved by treating the heterostructure surface: depositing a suitably patterned metallic gate or etching. If the amplitude of ''V''(''x'',''y'') is large (take &lt;math&gt;V(x,y)=-V_0(\cos 2\pi x/a+\cos 2\pi y/a), V_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as an example) compared to the Fermi level, &lt;math&gt;|V_0|\gg E_f&lt;/math&gt;, the electrons in the superlattice should behave similarly to electrons in an atomic crystal with square lattice (in the example, these "atoms" would be located at positions (''na'',''ma'') where ''n'',''m'' are integers).

The difference is in the length and energy scales. Lattice constants of atomic crystals are of the order of 1Å while those of superlattices (''a'') are several hundreds or thousands larger as dictated by technological limits (e.g. electron-beam lithography used for the patterning of the heterostructure surface). Energies are correspondingly smaller in superlattices. Using the simple quantum-mechanically [[Particle in a box|confined-particle]] model suggests &lt;math&gt;E\propto 1/a^2&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is only a rough guide and actual calculations with currently topical [[graphene]] (a natural atomic crystal) and artificial graphene&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kato | first1 = Y. | last2 = Endo | first2 = A. | last3 = Katsumoto | first3 = S. | last4 = Iye | first4 = Y. | title = Geometric resonances in the magnetoresistance of hexagonal lateral superlattices | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235315 | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 86 | issue = 23 | pages = 235315 | year = 2353 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 1208.4480 |bibcode = 2012PhRvB..86w5315K }}&lt;/ref&gt; (superlattice) show that characteristic band widths are of the order of 1 eV and 10 meV, respectively. In the regime of weak modulation (&lt;math&gt;|V_0|\ll E_f&lt;/math&gt;), phenomena like commensurability oscillations or fractal energy spectra ([[Hofstadter's butterfly|Hofstadter butterfly]]) occur.

Artificial two-dimensional crystals can be viewed as a 2D/2D case (2D modulation of a 2D system) and other combinations are experimentally available: an array of quantum wires (1D/2D) or 3D/3D [[photonic crystal]]s.

A '''surgically implanted improvised explosive device''' (SIIED) is an explosive device hidden inside the body of a person in order to commit a [[suicide attack]].  This type of terrorist weapon, more commonly known as '''Body Cavity Bomb''' (BCB),&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013"/&gt; is only known to have been used once, in a failed assassination attempt.

== 2009 attack on Prince Muhammad bin Nayef ==
In August 2009 [[Abdullah al-Asiri]], the younger brother of [[Ibrahim al-Asiri]] ([[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]'s chief bomb-maker), tried to assassinate a Saudi prince [[Muhammad bin Nayef]] with a bomb, later identified as a 'Body Cavity Bomb' (BCB).&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013"/&gt; Al-Asiri absorbed most of the blast, which killed him instantly. Bin Nayef escaped with only minor injuries.

== Media speculation ==
In May 2012, various reporters leaked their acquisition of documents describing the preparation and use of such devices.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast2012-05-14&gt;

According to ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], security officials at [[MI-6]] asserted that female bombers could  travel undetected carrying the explosive chemicals in otherwise standard [[breast implant]]s.&lt;ref name=TheMirror2012-05-14&gt;

== Concept ==
The concept of a surgically implanted improvised explosive device (SIIED) is derived from the Body Cavity Bomb (BCB) concept enunciated by [[Robert J. Bunker]], a research associate at the [[Terrorism Research Center]]. Bunker's work for the last few years, has been on assessing the potential use of body cavity bombs (BCB) or body cavity suicide bombs (BCSB) as a variation of suicide bombing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robert J. Bunker. (2011) The Projected Al Qaeda Use of Body Cavity Suicide Bombs Against High Value Targets. http://www.homelandsecurity.com/2011/04/11/the-projected-al-qaeda-use-of-body-cavity-suicide-bombs-against-high-value-targets/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homelandsecurity.com/category/other/originalanalysis/&lt;/ref&gt;

The term SIIED was used in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article in May 2012&lt;ref name="DailyBeast2012-05-14" /&gt; which described it as an "explosive device hidden inside the body of a person in order to commit a suicide attack." However, it should be noted that, currently the [[United States Department of Defense]] Dictionary of Military Terms, only recognizes the acronym 'IED (improvised explosive device)'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/?zoom_query=ied&amp;zoom_sort=0&amp;zoom_per_page=10&amp;zoom_and=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunker's 2011 report&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; largely originated with the 2005 International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) training keys on Suicide (Homicide) Bombers: “No recorded use of cavity bombs (i.e., in the stomach, rectum, or vagina) exists, but this tactic represents a potential threat.”&lt;ref&gt;Bunker, R.J. (2005) Training Keys #581 &amp; 582: Suicide (Homicide) Bombers.Alexandria, VA: International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The author recognized early on the iterated offensive and defensive dynamic of suicide bomber and security force countermeasures and saw the offensive potentials inherent in an explosive device carried by a suicide bomber secreted inside of the human body.&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013"&gt;Bunker, R.J. Flaherty, C. (2013) Body Cavity Bombers: The NewMartyrs. A Terrorism Research Center Book. iUniverse, Inc. Bloomington, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a non-public disclosure series of presentations on projected BCB employment that took place between September 2006 and August 2008 in the United States and later in the United Kingdom. These presentations were resumed between October 2009 and February 2010 as a by-product of the first recorded use of a BCB device by Al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula in August 2009.&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013"/&gt; This was the attack, on 28 August, where a suicide bomber blew himself up in Jeddah during a Ramadan gathering that included Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, head of the security services. It was the first attempt on the life of a royal since the murder of King Faisal in 1975. The prince was treated at a hospital and released. This incident was the subject of two specific studies:
* Europol. (2010) The Concealment of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Rectal Cavities. SC5 - Counter Terrorism Unit. The Hague, 18 September 2010 ( EDOC#418506_v4).
* Bunker, R.J. (2011) The Projected Al Qaeda Use of Body Cavity Suicide Bombs Against High Value Targets. GroupIntel Occasional Paper (March 2011).

=== 2010 Europol analysis ===
The 27 August 2009 suicide bomber attack on the Assistant Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia, Prince [[Muhammad bin Nayef]], used a BCB type-weapon. This was an IED inserted into the bomber’s rectum. Activated, once the bomber was close to the Prince Muhammad, the prince was nevertheless only ‘lightly-injured’ in this attack. The aftermath of the Nayef attack seems to confirm that the blast event is largely contained by the attacker’s own body (who was later identified as al-Asiri).
Europol have assessed the possible use of the BCB, and made the following findings:&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;
* It would be possible to explode a device concealed in the rectum.
* Activation by radio-frequency seems to be likely.
* Concealing an IED in the rectum would limit the amount of explosive available.
Europol found as well—"should there be conclusive proof that the attack took place with an IED concealed inside the perpetrator’s body", it would definitely have an impact in aviation safety and the current standard operational procedures in place should be reviewed.

=== Tactical critiques and post-analysis  ===
The BCB is an explosive device inserted within a human being or an animal,&lt;ref name="Bunker. R.J. 2011"&gt;Bunker. R.J. (2011) The Projected Al Qaeda Use of Body Cavity Suicide Bombs Against High Value Targets. GroupIntel Occasional Paper (March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; with the view to hiding it from detection. It involves "new tactics, techniques or procedures (TTPs)." Concerning the BCB tactical evolution:
"Suicide bombings (human- and vehicle-borne) have been a staple of terrorist strategy and tactics. They provide a means of low-cost precision targeting that amplifies casualties and ensures the attacks are noticed. As countermeasures (weapons screening, searches, etc.) become more effective, a shift in targeting and/or TTPs is a likely terrorist adaptation."&lt;ref name="Bunker. R.J. 2011"/&gt;

Tactically speaking, the use and employment of the BCB falls into a category of tactics known as ‘in-situ’ attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2009) 2D Verses 3D Tactical Supremacy in Urban Operations. Journal of Information Warfare. (8)2: 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. Green, A.R. (2011) 15 Meters/11 Seconds. Journal of Information Warfare. (10)2: 22-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The factors which could thwart the effective use of the BCB, are:
* By its very nature, as a weapon it is intended for closed-in attacks (the attacker carrying the device has to be in direct contact with the target);
* This is because the blast yield, has been shown to be low, to negligible.&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;
* The attacker, to be successful, has to enact an ‘in situ’ attack, physically placing their body against the target, and initiating the device.
The other constraint is that this weapon likely decreases in effect if used outdoors, as indoors closed environments offer the best physical possible properties, where blast-reflection is a factor in confinement. Thus, as can be seen, the very factors that make the BCB effective are also highly limiting.

=== 2012–2013 post-analysis research ===
The 2012–2013 post-analysis research has enunciated tactical propositions that limit the effect of the BCB, and its "tactical use of the BCB is limited to a specific set of circumstances".&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;
* This is dictated by its extremely low blast capacity as a consequence of the limited yield of these weapons, namely size and concealment constraints; as well as,
* The likely lack of fragmentation from ‘hard’ casings (again a consequence of the need for greater concealment).
The likely employment of the BCB will be in circumstances where the attacker will attempt a one-on-one attack, specifically on an individual or object (such as an airplane’s critical control system), in a ‘close-in’ attack, requiring physical contact with the victim/target.&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt; However, "the BCB may also ultimately develop into a purely terror, or a ‘protest horror’ weapon; the impact of which has less to do with its overall effectiveness, and more to do with its grotesqueness—a weapon designed to invite horror and revulsion."&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;

=== Airport security scanning methods ===
A summary of body scanning techniques for airport security reveals that the BCB can evade most of the commonly used sensor strategies. For instance, the current operational methods are:&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;
* Metal Detector: The detectability of a BCB is subject to the sensitivity of the detector and metal content of the BCB. High sensitivity leads to high false alarm rates, making detection problematic. Security personnel need to be aware of the BCB threat, in order to interpret the signal from a handheld metal detector correctly.
* Millimeter Wave Scanner, or ‘mmW-scanner’: These are unable to penetrate skin, and cannot detect a BCB. They could eventually detect a device used to ignite a BCB, if interpreted correctly.
* X-ray Transmission Scanners: These have a very high detection probability. However, the scan is carcinogenic, therefore it is not being used in airport security. These machines exist in some U.S. prisons and proved their capability to detect objects hidden in body cavities.
* [[Puffer machine]] (explosives trace detection machine): This could detect explosives in rectal, vaginal, and oral cavities, but not implanted explosives. It can detect traces of explosives, if the terrorist has been in contact with them before implantation. At least two different detection mechanisms exist: (i) ion mobility spectrometry and (ii) mass spectrometry.
* [[Backscatter X-ray]]: This gives a much lower radiation dose than transmission scanners and penetrates skin slightly but not sufficiently to detect a BCB reliably. Possible health effects are still being debated.

=== Future detection strategies ===
In the case of sensor strategies under development, such as the [[Radiometric Scanner]], these are unable to penetrate skin and cannot detect a BCB. These could eventually detect a device used to ignite one, if interpreted correctly. Several other methods can also be considered and for example include:&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;
* Thermal Scanner ([[Passive infrared sensor|passive infrared]]): The BCB would most likely obstruct heat transfer to the body surface and could therefore be detected by a thermal scanner. However, for some reason, this technique does not seem to be discussed for airport security screening, but is only applied in medical imaging.
* Active Infrared Scanner: Currently under development as a stand-off scanner for U.S. Police, it is unable to penetrate skin, and cannot detect a BCB.
* [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]]: This would detect a BCB with very high probability. However, it is too-time consuming for a primary scan. Therefore, it is only used in medical imaging.
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Tomography]]: Would detect a BCB with very high probability. High magnetic fields would dislocate or even pull out iron parts of the BCB or painfully heat up any other metal. The same holds true for any other metallic implant. Even more time consuming than ultrasonography, it is therefore, only used in medical imaging.

==== Canine detection====
Dogs may be able to detect explosives in rectal, vaginal, or oral cavities, but not implanted explosives. Dogs can also detect traces of explosives if the terrorist has been in contact with them before implantation. However, they are subject to exhaustion. Additionally, issues exist concerning canine training procedures, as most bomb dogs are trained to ‘alert’ on items and not on individuals for detecting explosive material residues.

==== Physical detection====
Physical examinations can detect a BCB with a medium-high probability. In practical terms, this is time consuming for a primary scan. This method is more than likely to be challenged by privacy groups, in particular, the issue of violation of a potentially pregnant woman.

==== Future technology detection capacity  ====
It has also been speculated that there appears to be a partial overlap between mm wave radar and terahertz radar. Some of the public source information suggests that there are some possibilities for terahertz radar, which lies between mm wave radar and long infra-red in the electromagnetic spectrum. Namely, there is at least some penetration with terahertz radar as it is used for thickness and density measurement and biomedical scanning, and is suggested for detecting weapons under clothing. It can detect specific chemicals, including explosives, in vapour phase by the adsorption spectra. This should be able to detect explosives vapours inside a sealed package, provided there is some air void in the package when sealed. Some prototypes for area security scanning have been tested in the field, but the results as not publicly known. The capabilities appear to be better than given for mm wave radar. Ideally, a fully developed terahertz radar system might have the sensitivity of ultrasonic scanning, positive identification of explosives chemicals, and non-contact scanning as well as reducing the inconvenience to travellers. However, such a development may be far in the future.

===Factors affecting surgically implanted device deployment===
The BCB primarily involves a device inserted into a body opening.&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt; As well, the idea of creating a surgically implanted IED (improvised explosive device), placed within a body, with the explosives detonated by injecting a chemical trigger, has been frequently discussed in news reporting, including media claims, that such a medical procedure to place a BCB inside a person or an animal, has been perfected.&lt;ref name=TheMirror2012-05-14 /&gt; However, this possibility has been extensively reviewed in research literature on terrorism TTPs, which has concluded, that while this may give a much higher blast yield capability; such a procedure nevertheless:&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;
* Involves a complex medical procedure (which may not be successful).
* Likely need for recuperation time (weeks in some cases, in particular time to allow surgical scarring to fade).
* Requires highly developed medical facilities, including a substantial medico-logistical support capability.
* High likelihood of the patient dying, as a result of the procedure.
* As well, medical complications where the container to hold everything together, as well as provide a barrier to the carrier’s body from the toxic exposure to the explosives used, breaches.

== In popular culture ==
The BCB has a long history in science fiction writing and film history. Notwithstanding, in conventional security thinking, it has been noted, that: "placing bombs inside live human beings was still definitely not on the radar", prior to 2009.&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The concept of the BCB has been regularly used as a theatrical–plot device in many popular TV shows and movies since at least the late 1960s (and perhaps earlier), and a number of popular U.S. films and television series episodes have featured the BCB, "ironically illustrating many of the key tactical concepts herein—that is, it is hidden in the human body, camouflaged from intelligence sensors, and used for attacks on specific targets".&lt;ref name="Bunker, R.J. Flaherty 2013" /&gt; For example:
* The U.S. film, ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', a 1975 cult action film, in which one of the characters called ‘Frankenstein’ intends to assassinate the president by planning to shake his hand, detonating a grenade which has been implanted in the perpetrator’s prosthetic right hand (who calls it his ‘hand grenade’).
* The 1990 science fiction television episode ‘Reunion’—the 81st in the series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (original air date of 5 November 1990)—features a BCB, used in an attempted assassination. The plot involves a dramatized discovery by medical staff that one of those killed after the detonation of the bomb actually had a powerful micro explosive hidden in his arm, sufficiently powerful to kill another person present in the room at the time of the explosion. The elements of the plot involved a BCB hidden and undetected (from security sensors) inside a person’s arm, requiring them to stand close to their intended target.
* The 2001 U.S. science fiction movie ''[[Impostor (film)|Impostor]]'' features the use of BCBs. Set in the year 2079, the film’s plot revolves around human 'replicants', created by hostile aliens, which are perfect biological copies of existing humans, complete with transplanted memories. This allows the 'replicants' to approach their targets camouflaged from detection. Each has a small, organic nuclear bomb in place of a heart, programmed to detonate when they are in proximity to their target.
* The British television series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' features in its season 3 finale a woman carrying a chemical BCB in an attempt to murder the prime minister, the bomb contained in her stomach to avoid discovery.
* Denzel Washington's 2004 movie ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]'' from features a BCB used to torture a victim. Washington plays a character who, in one particular scene, traps a corrupt police officer (Fuentes), and rectally inserts a five-minute timed bomb into him while he is restrained face down. This is done to terrorize Fuentes into giving information. After he gets this information, the protagonist walks away and leaves the bomb inside Fuentes to detonate.
* The 2008 Batman film, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', also featured a BCB. In that film, a fictional scenario was portrayed where the Joker blew up a police station by means of a cell-phone activated bomb sewn into an unwilling victim's stomach.
* The novel ''[[Eve of Destruction (novel)|Eve of Destruction]]'' by [[Sylvia Day]] features several female protagonists who have been implanted with BCB devices.
*The 2009 war film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' features a BCB when a young Iraqi boy is found to have been surgically implanted with an unexploded bomb.

The show is set in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and parodies [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and [[Society of the United States|society]], television, and the [[human condition]].

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour [[prime time]] show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–90).

Since its debut on December 17, 1989, [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{:The Simpsons}} episodes]]&lt;!-- The episode number is updated in the infobox. Please do not update it directly here. --&gt; of ''The Simpsons'' have been broadcast. It is the [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series in terms of seasons and number of episodes. ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. Then on October 30, 2007, [[The Simpsons Game|a video game]] was released. Currently, ''The Simpsons'' is on its thirtieth season, which aired September 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Porter|first=Rick|title='The Simpsons' is forever: Series renewed through Season 30 on FOX|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/more-tv-news/the-simpsons-is-forever-series-renewed-through-season-30-on-fox/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=November 4, 2016|accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|title='Family Guy and 'Bob's Burgers' Renewed by Fox|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/family-guy-bobs-burgers-renewed-fox-1202800400|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 12, 2018|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' will be renewed for a thirty-first season, with Al Jean completing a [[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]] XXIX script, though the date has yet to be announced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/AlJean/status/908428292545318912 @TheSimpsons THOH XXIX is a go!

''The Simpsons'' received acclaim throughout its first nine&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcclassic/&gt; or ten&lt;ref name=empirereview/&gt;&lt;ref name="LucidWorks"/&gt; seasons, which are generally considered its "Golden Age". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named it the 20th century's best television series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993039,00.html|title=The Best of the Century|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Erik Adams of ''[[The A.V.

Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 30 [[Annie Award]]s, and a [[Peabody Award]]. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase "[[D'oh!]]" has been adopted into the English language, while ''The Simpsons'' has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms.&lt;!--The impending Futurama/Family Guy crossovers are mentioned in the 'Influence on TV' section. They do not need to be mentioned here.--&gt; However, it has also been criticized for a perceived decline in quality over the years.

==Premise==
===Characters===
{{Main article|List of The Simpsons characters}}
''The Simpsons'' is known for its wide ensemble of main and supporting characters. 

The main characters are the Simpson family, who live in a fictional "[[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]" town of Springfield.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=28}} [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], the father, works as a safety inspector at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], a position at odds with his careless, [[jester|buffoonish]] personality. He is married to [[Marge Simpson|Marge Bouvier]], a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] American [[Homemaking|housewife]] and mother. They have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], a precocious eight-year-old activist; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a [[pacifier]]. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer's dad [[Grampa Simpson]] lives in the Springfield Retirement Home after Homer forced his dad to sell his house so that his family could buy theirs. Grampa Simpson has had starring roles in several episodes.

The family also owns a dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], and a cat, [[Simpson family#Snowball V (Snowball II)|Snowball V]], renamed [[Snowball II]] in "[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot |episodelink=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot |series=The Simpsons |network=Fox |airdate=2004-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.

[[File:Simpsons cast.png|thumb|left|upright=2|''The Simpsons'' sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters.]]
The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters, which include Homer's co-workers (also friends) [[Lenny Leonard]] and [[Carl Carlson]], the school principal [[Seymour Skinner]] and teachers [[Edna Krabappel]] and [[Elizabeth Hoover]], friends [[Barney Gumble]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[Moe Szyslak]], [[Milhouse Van Houten]], and [[Nelson Muntz]], extended relatives [[Patty and Selma Bouvier]], townspeople such as [[Mayor Quimby]], Chief [[Clancy Wiggum]], tycoon [[Charles Montgomery Burns]] and his executive assistant [[Waylon Smithers]], and local celebrities [[Krusty the Clown]] and news reporter [[Kent Brockman]].

The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.&lt;ref name="avclub1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |title=Matt Groening: Interview |accessdate=October 22, 2006 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=April 26, 2006 |publisher=The A.V. Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuity and the floating timeline===
Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a [[floating timeline]] in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, in the 1991 episode "[[I Married Marge]]", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 1981. But in the 1995 episode "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old) appears to be born in 1993 or 1994.

A canon of the show does exist, as ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes and any fictional story told within the series are typically non-canon. However, continuity is inconsistent and limited in ''The Simpsons'', as with most other comedy-focused television shows. For example, [[Krusty the Clown]] may be able to read in one episode, but may not be able to read in another. Lessons learned by the family in one episode may be forgotten in the next. Some examples of limited continuity include Sideshow Bob's appearances where Bart and Lisa flashback at all the crimes he committed in Springfield or when the characters try to remember things that happened in previous episodes.

===Development===
{{Main article|History of The Simpsons|The Simpsons shorts}}
[[File:Jameslbrooks.jpg|thumb|[[James L. Brooks]] (''pictured'') asked [[Matt Groening]] to create a series of animated shorts for ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''.]]
When producer [[James L. Brooks]] was working on the television variety show ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist [[Matt Groening]]'s ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his ''Life in Hell'' series.&lt;ref name="americasfirstfamily"&gt;{{cite video |year=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family |medium=television documentary |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Groening later realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a [[dysfunctional family]] that became the Simpsons.&lt;ref name="americasfirstfamily"/&gt;&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite interview |last=Groening |first=Matt |subjectlink=Matt Groening |interviewer=David Bianculli |title=Fresh Air |work=[[NPR]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008 |location=Philadelphia |date=February 14, 2003 |accessdate=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name, adopting an [[anagram]] of the word "brat".&lt;ref name="americasfirstfamily"/&gt;

The Simpson family first appeared as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' on April 19, 1987.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |p=14}} Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts.&lt;ref name="americasfirstfamily"/&gt; The animation was produced domestically at [[Klasky Csupo]],&lt;ref name="animation"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Harvey |last=Deneroff |title=Matt Groening's Baby Turns 10 |journal=Animation |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=January 2000 |pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Beck|2005 |p=239}} with [[Wes Archer]], [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and [[Bill Kopp]] being animators for the first season.&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt; Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt;

In 1989, a team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&amp;IssueNum=32 |title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer' |accessdate=September 1, 2006 |last=Kuipers |first=Dean |date=April 15, 2004 |publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&amp;IssueNum=32 |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.&lt;ref name="toonterrific"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Tucker |title=Toon Terrific |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 12, 1993 |page=48(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]".&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-1_episode-1 |title=Simpsons Roasting on and Open Fire |publisher=The Simpsons.com |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Tracey Ullman]] filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success. The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of ''The Simpsons''&lt;ref name="ullman"&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Spotnitz |title=Eat my shorts! |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |page=8(1) |date=October 23, 1992 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312110,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a claim rejected by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/1992/biz/news/ullman-loses-simpsons-suit-101001/ |title=Ullman loses 'Simpsons' suit |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=August 24, 2011 |date=October 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice actors===
{{Main article|List of The Simpsons cast members|List of The Simpsons guest stars|Non-English versions of The Simpsons}}
''The Simpsons'' has six main cast members: [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]] and [[Harry Shearer]]. Castellaneta voices [[Homer Simpson]], [[Grampa Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]], [[Barney Gumble]] and other adult, male characters.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}} [[Julie Kavner]] voices [[Marge Simpson]] and [[Patty and Selma]], as well as several minor characters.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}} Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html |title=D'oh, you're the voice |accessdate=August 18, 2007 |date=February 27, 2003 |author=Lee, Luaine |work=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright voices [[Bart Simpson]], [[Nelson Muntz]], [[Ralph Wiggum]] and other children.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}} Smith, the voice of [[Lisa Simpson]], is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character, although she occasionally plays other episodic characters.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}} The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa.

With one exception, episode credits list only the [[Voice acting|voice actors]], and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; James L. Brooks, David Silverman |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode "[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]", because the producers said the voice actors should receive credit for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Jay Kogen, Wallace Wolodarsky, Al Jean, David Silverman |date=2002 |title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Old Money" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the cast appeared in an episode of ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', doing live performances of their characters' voices.

The six main actors were paid [[United States dollar|$]]30,000 per episode until 1998, when they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but series creator Groening supported the actors in their action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Doherty |title=Matt Groening |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=March–April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode.

In addition to the main cast, [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Marcia Wallace]], [[Maggie Roswell]], and [[Russi Taylor]] voice supporting characters.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}} From 1999 to 2002, Roswell's characters were voiced by [[Marcia Mitzman Gaven]].

Episodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. [[Tony Bennett]] was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode "[[Dancin' Homer]]".{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=393}} ''The Simpsons'' holds the [[Guinness World Records|world record]] for "Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series".&lt;ref name="Foxflash"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z175z13z3 |title=THE SIMPSONS&amp;nbsp;— Season 19 (2007–2008) |accessdate=October 21, 2007 |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|FoxFlash]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217121947/http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z175z13z3 |archivedate=December 17, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Simpsons'' has been dubbed into [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|several other languages]], including Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese.

===Animation===

Several different U.S. and international studios animate ''The Simpsons''. Throughout the run of the animated shorts on ''The Tracey Ullman Show,'' the animation was produced domestically at [[Klasky Csupo]].&lt;ref name="animation"/&gt; With the debut of the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to several local and foreign studios.&lt;ref name="animation"/&gt; These are [[AKOM]],&lt;ref&gt;First episode credit in production order: {{cite episode |title=Some Enchanted Evening |episodelink=Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons) |series=The Simpsons |credits=Groening, Matt; Sam Simon, David Silverman, Kent Butterworth |network=Fox |airdate=1990-05-13 |season=1 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anivision]],&lt;ref&gt;First episode credit in production order: {{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror II |episodelink=Treehouse of Horror II |series=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Mike Reiss, Jeff Martin, George Meyer, Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder, Jim Reardon |network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-31 |season=3 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rough Draft Studios]],&lt;ref&gt;First episode credit in production order: {{cite episode |title=Homer the Heretic |episodelink=Homer the Heretic |series=The Simpsons |credits=Meyer, George;Jim Reardon |network=Fox |airdate=1992-10-08 |season=4 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[USAnimation]],&lt;ref&gt;First episode credit in production order: {{cite episode |title=Radioactive Man |episodelink=Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode) |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Susie Dietter |network=Fox |airdate=1995-09-24 |season=7 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toonzone Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;First episode credit in production order: {{cite episode |title=The Fat and the Furriest |episodelink=The Fat and the Furriest |series=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, Joel H.; Matthew Nastuk |network=Fox |airdate=2003-11-30 |season=15 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated ''The Simpsons'' in the United States. In 1992, the show's production company, Gracie Films, switched domestic production to [[Film Roman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bernstein, Sharon |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-21/business/fi-739_1_bart-simpson |title='The Simpsons' Producer Changes Animation Firms |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 21, 1992 |page=18 |accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who continued to animate the show until 2016. In [[The Simpsons (season 14)|Season 14]], production switched from traditional [[Traditional animation#Traditional ink-and-paint and camera|cel animation]] to [[digital ink and paint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Jeffrey Lynch, Mike Reiss, David Silverman |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Whacking Day]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode to experiment with [[Digital ink and paint|digital coloring]] was "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|season 12]] episode "[[Tennis the Menace]]", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed "Tennis the Menace" was broadcast as made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.license-europe.com/licensemag/data/articlestandard//licensemag/192007/425752/article.pdf |title=A Salute to the Simpsons |last=Grala |first=Alyson |page=14 |work=License! |accessdate=August 11, 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925213323/http://www.license-europe.com/licensemag/data/articlestandard//licensemag/192007/425752/article.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production staff at the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws [[storyboard]]s, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become [[animatic]]s to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the [[Inbetweening|inbetweens]], [[Traditional animation|ink and paint]], and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TV's 'The Simpsons' Goes Global |date=August 5, 2001 |agency=Associated Press |author=Elber, Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began [[high-definition television|high-definition]] production in Season 20; the first episode, "[[Take My Life, Please]]", aired February 15, 2009.

''The Simpsons'' uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=28}} serving as a [[satire|satirical]] parody of a [[American middle class|middle class]] [[American way|American lifestyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Simpsons: Culture, Class and Popular TV |author=Flew, Terry |work=Metro |issue=97 |date=March 3, 1994 |url=http://www.metromagazine.com.au/magazine/backisues.asp?keywords=cultu&amp;whichpage=12&amp;pagesize=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its animated nature, ''The Simpsons''{{'}} scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=55}} Through Bart and Lisa's days at [[Springfield Elementary School]], the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=388}}

Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=221–222}} [[Al Jean]] acknowledged in an interview that "We [the show] are of liberal bent."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=223}} The writers often evince an appreciation for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal ideals]], but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=224}} The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=223}} Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In ''The Simpsons'', politicians are corrupt, ministers such as [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=56}} Religion also figures as a recurring theme.&lt;ref name="literacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4555717/Biblical_Literacy_and_the_Simpsons |title=Biblical Literacy and the Simpsons|last=Myles|first=Robert|year=2015|publisher=Rethinking Biblical Literacy|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark I |last=Pinsky |title=The Gospel According to Homer |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=August 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard opening has gone through three iterations (a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season, and a brand new sequence when the show switched to high-definition in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4682314/The-Simpsons-opening-sequence-changes.html |title='The Simpsons' opening sequence changes |last=Leonard |first=Tom |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=March 2, 2009 |date=February 17, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each has the same basic sequence of events: the camera zooms through [[cumulus cloud]]s, through the show's title towards the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and was the first task he did when production began on the show.&lt;ref name=silverinter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page4.shtml |title=Top titles |accessdate=August 1, 2007 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' distinctive [[The Simpsons Theme|theme song]] was [[composer|composed]] by musician [[Danny Elfman]] in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.&lt;ref name="elfman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001024519/http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html |archivedate=October 1, 2011 |title=Danny Elfman in the L.A.

One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard,&lt;ref name=silverinter/&gt; Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=90–91}}

===Halloween episodes===
{{Main article|Treehouse of Horror}}
[[File:Bart Night Gallery.jpg|thumb|Bart Simpson introducing a segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" in the manner of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'']]
The special [[Halloween]] episode has become an annual tradition. "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]" first broadcast in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode.&lt;ref name="BBCI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml |title=The Simpsons Halloween Special |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |last=Martyn |first=Adrian |last2=Wood |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces usually involve the family in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=31}} They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the ''Treehouse'' series is meant to be seen on Halloween, this changed by the 2000s, when new installments have premiered after Halloween due to [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]'s current [[MLB on Fox|contract]] with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII |last=Ryan |first=Andrew |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=November 4, 2006 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, since 2011, every ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode has aired in October.

===Humor===
The show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from [[movies]], television, [[music]], literature, [[science]], and history.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=63–65}} The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, [[newspapers]], [[billboards]], and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=62}} Kristin Thompson argues that ''The Simpsons'' uses a "flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show."{{sfn|King|2002}}

One of Bart's early [[hallmark]]s was his prank calls to [[Moe's Tavern]] owner [[Moe Szyslak]] in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a [[gag name]]. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the [[Tube Bar prank calls|Tube Bar recordings]], though Groening has denied any causal connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-03/news/vw-42985_1_prank-calls Telephone Trespassing : Think only kids make prank calls? Now grown-ups are dialing, baiting their prey and taping what follows. And thousands collect the recordings.] Mark Ehrman. Los Angeles Times. June 3, 1993. Accessed April 20, 2015. "'Simpsons' creator Matt Groening confesses to being a fan of prank tapes. The New Saigon calls, he says, are his favorites—although he prefers to characterize the similarity between the Moe's Tavern calls and the Tube Bar tapes as 'creative synchronicity.'"&lt;/ref&gt;
Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner [[Louis "Red" Deutsch]], whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&amp;BRD=1291&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=523586&amp;rfi=6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218105842/http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&amp;BRD=1291&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=523586&amp;rfi=6 |archivedate=December 18, 2007 |title=Joke on 'Simpsons' started in JC |accessdate=October 30, 2008 |date=August 10, 2005 |work=[[Hudson Reporter]] |author=Kaulessar, Ricardo |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season.&lt;ref name="Some"&gt;[[James L.

Commentary for "[[Moaning Lisa]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' also often includes [[Meta-reference|self-referential]] humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doh!

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=60}} Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", Mr. Burns' "Excellent" and [[Nelson Muntz]]'s "''Ha''-ha!" Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as "''[[¡Ay, caramba!]]''", "[[Don't have a cow]], man!" and "Eat my shorts!" appeared on T-shirts in the show's early days.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=25}} However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the [[merchandising]]. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode "[[Bart Gets Famous]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the ''Krusty the Clown Show'' solely for saying "I didn't do it."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=61}}

====Foreshadowing of actual events====
''The Simpsons'' has gained notoriety for including jokes that would eventually become reality. Perhaps the most famous example comes from the episode "[[Bart to the Future]]", which mentions billionaire [[Donald Trump]] having been [[President of the United States]] at one time and leaving the nation broke. The episode first aired in 2000, sixteen years before Trump would successfully run for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Simpsons predicted a Donald Trump presidency 16 years ago |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-simpsons-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-2016-11?r=UK&amp;IR=T |work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=December 31, 2017 |date=November 9, 2016 |author=Clark, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another episode, "[[When You Dish Upon a Star]]", lampooned 20th Century Fox as a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Nineteen years later, Disney indeed made a deal to [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|purchase the studio]] from [[Rupert Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosario|first1=David|title=The Disney-Fox Deal Was Predicted By ‘The Simpsons’ Nearly 20 Years Ago|url=https://heroichollywood.com/disney-fox-deal-predicted-simpsons-20-years-ago/|website=heroichollywood.com|accessdate=December 14, 2017|date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of ''The Simpsons'' predicting the future with accuracy include the introduction of the [[Smartwatch]] and [[autocorrection]] technology, and even [[Lady Gaga]]'s acrobatic performance at the [[Super Bowl LI]] halftime show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hancock|first1=Edith|last2=Henning Santiago|first2=Amanda|title=15 times 'The Simpsons' accurately predicted the future|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-simpsons-is-good-at-predicting-the-future-2016-11/#15-nobel-prize-winner-season-22-episode-1-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=December 31, 2017|date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Simpsons'' was the first successful animated program in American prime time since ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'' in the 1970s.{{sfn|Alberti|2003 |p=xii}} During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. ''The Simpsons'' changed this perception,&lt;ref name="animation"/&gt; initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like ''[[Capitol Critters]]'', ''[[Fish Police (TV series)|Fish Police]]'', and ''[[Family Dog (TV series)|Family Dog]]'', which were expensive and unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-28/entertainment/ca-2993_1_prime-time-programs|title='Fish Police' on Endangered Species List |author=Daniel Cerone|date=February 28, 1992|work=[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons''{{'}} use of Korean animation studios for [[inbetweening|tweening]], coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of ''The Simpsons'' and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other adult animated series.&lt;ref name="animation"/&gt; This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows for adults, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'' and ''[[The Critic]]''.&lt;ref name="animation"/&gt; For ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], "''The Simpsons'' created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years&amp;nbsp;... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/simpsons200708 |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |date=August 2007 |title=Simpson Family Values |first=John |last=Ortved |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Simpsons'' has had crossovers with four other shows.

Bart's rebellious, bad boy nature, which underlies his misbehavior and rarely leads to any punishment, led some people to characterize him as a poor [[role model]] for children.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=131}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6252856.stm |title=Is The Simpsons still subversive? |accessdate=August 6, 2007 |date=June 29, 2007 |author=Rosenbaum, Martin |publisher=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a "threat to learning" because of his "underachiever and proud of it" attitude and negative attitude regarding his education.&lt;ref name="BartaBrat"&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Bart a brat?

Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in "[[Bart vs. Australia]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1995) and Brazil in "[[Blame It on Lisa]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 13)|season 13]], 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries.&lt;ref name="iT2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0317/1224242946443.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017062621/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0317/1224242946443.html |archivedate=October 17, 2012 |work=The Irish Times |title=Cartoon family get animated on first Irish visit |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=April 15, 2009 |author=Carroll, Steven |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board—which claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations—went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1931551.stm |title=Simpsons apologize to Rio |date=April 15, 2002 |accessdate=March 17, 2009 |publisher=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode "[[A Star Is Burns]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1995) which featured a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] with ''[[The Critic]]''. He felt that it was just an advertisement for ''The Critic'', and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode "violates the Simpsons' universe." In response, Brooks said, "I am furious with Matt,&amp;nbsp;... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far.&amp;nbsp;... his behavior right now is rotten."&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Matt Groening's Reaction to The Critic's First Appearance on The Simpsons |author=Brennan, Judy |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=The Times Mirror Company |date=March 3, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Groening's point well-taken, but probably best made privately |author=Richmond, Ray |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=March 4, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]], 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by [[Harry Shearer]], who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, "That's &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/shearer-delight/Content?oid=1065334 |title=Shearer Delight |author=Wilonsky, Robert |date=April 27, 2001 |accessdate=April 15, 2009 |work=[[East Bay Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics' reviews of early ''Simpsons'' episodes praised the show for its sassy humor, wit, realism, and intelligence.&lt;ref name="toonterrific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calgary"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Remington |title=It's The Simpsons, Man |publisher=TV Times (''[[Calgary Herald]]'') |page=10 |date=October 26, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the late 1990s, around the airing of season 10, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show "tired".&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2003/02/the_simpsons.html |title=Who turned America's best TV show into a cartoon? |accessdate=July 3, 2006 |author=Suellentrop, Chris |date=February 12, 2003 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show, and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/01/24/simpsons_2/ |title=Worst Episode Ever |accessdate=July 3, 2006 |author=Weinman, Jaime J. |date=January 24, 2000 |publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/647zrWxCS?url=http://www.salon.com/2000/01/24/simpsons_2/ |archivedate=December 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.today.com/id/3341530 |title='The Simpsons' has lost its cool |accessdate=January 27, 2008 |author=Bonné, Jon |date=September 2, 2000 |publisher=[[NBCNews.com|msnbc.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnndecline/&gt; Jim Schembri of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' attributed the decline in quality to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favor of and overuse of celebrity [[cameo appearance]]s and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote: "The central tragedy of ''The Simpsons'' is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention-seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue."&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/pop-spoofs-no-longer-the-main-draw-20111109-1n614.html#ixzz1dHgzL7xF |title=Pop spoofs no longer the main draw |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=November 10, 2011 |date=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Scully]], who was showrunner during seasons nine through [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelve]], has been the subject of criticism.&lt;ref name="Scully"/&gt;{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=42}} Chris Suellentrop of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote that "under Scully's tenure, ''The Simpsons'' became, well, a cartoon&amp;nbsp;... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck.

[[Al Jean]], showrunner since season thirteen, has also been the subject of criticism, with some arguing that the show has continued to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is "on auto-pilot", "too sentimental", and the episodes are "just being cranked out." Some critics believe that the show has "entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ortved|2009 |p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Ortved, author of ''[[The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History]]'', characterized the Jean era as "toothless",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ortved|2009 |p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ortved|2009 |pp=227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean responded: "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.

In 2004, [[Harry Shearer]] criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: "I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Leggett |title=Harry Shearer |publisher=UK Teletext |date=August 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Castellaneta]] responded: "I don't agree,&amp;nbsp;... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129665,00.html |title=D'oh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan |publisher=Fox News |date=August 23, 2004 |author=Elber, Lynn |accessdate=April 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703090128/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C129665%2C00.html# |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004 author [[Douglas Coupland]] described claims of declining quality in the series as "hogwash", saying "''The Simpsons'' hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=xiii}} In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: "I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome&amp;nbsp;... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit."&lt;ref name="avclub3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/|title=Matt Groening interview with The A.V.

In 2016, popular culture writer Anna Leszkiewicz suggested that even though ''The Simpsons'' still holds cultural relevance, contemporary appeal is only for the first ten seasons, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2016/04/smithers-question-why-do-we-keep-retrofitting-progressive-narratives-pop|title=The Smithers question: why do we keep retrofitting progressive narratives in pop culture?|publisher=|accessdate=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewing households per episode in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="season1ratings" /&gt; the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/full-series-rankings-for-the-2009-10-broadcast-season|title=Full Series Rankings For The 2009–10 Broadcast Season&amp;nbsp;–|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=May 27, 2010|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sepinwall]] and [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] argued in their 2016 book titled ''TV (The Book)'' that the peak of ''The Simpsons'' are "roughly seasons [three through twelve]", and that despite the decline, episodes from the later seasons such as "[[Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind]]" and "[[Holidays of Future Passed]]" could be considered on par with the earlier classic episodes, further stating that "even if you want to call the show today a thin shadow of its former self, think about how mind-boggingly great its former self had to be for so-diminished a version to be watchable at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sepinwall|first1=Alan|last2=Seitz|first2=Matt Zoller|title=[[TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time]]|date=September 6, 2016|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=978-1455588190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Matt Zoller Seitz|Seitz, Matt Zoller]]|author2=[[Alan Sepinwall|Sepinwall, Alan]]|title=Why ''The Simpsons'' Is the Best TV Show Ever|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/tv-the-book-simpsons-best-television-show.html|website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York Media, LLC]]|accessdate=October 17, 2016|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Apu controversy ====
{{Further|Apu Nahasapeemapetilon#Accusations of racial stereotyping}}
The stereotypical nature of the character [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]] has long been the subject of controversy. This was particularly highlighted by Indian-American comedian [[Hari Kondabolu]]'s 2017 documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]''. In the film, Kondabolu states that as a child he was a fan of The Simpsons and liked Apu, but he now finds the character's stereotypical nature troublesome. Defenders of the character responded that the show is built on comical stereotypes, with creator Matt Groening saying, "that's the nature of cartooning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/arts/television/simpsons-matt-groening-apu.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=mini-moth&amp;region=top-stories-below&amp;WT.nav=top-stories-below|work=New York Times|title=‘Simpsons’ Creator Matt Groening Says Debate Around Apu Is ‘Tainted’|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he was "proud of what we do on the show", and "it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/01/simpsons-creator-matt-groening-on-apu-controversy-people-love-to-pretend-theyre-offended.html|title='Simpsons' creator Matt Groening on Apu controversy: 'People love to pretend they're offended'|last=Lam|first=Katherine|date=2018-05-01|publisher=Fox News|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the controversy, Apu's voice actor, [[Hank Azaria]], said he was willing to step aside from his role as Apu: "The most important thing is to listen to South Asian people, Indian people in this country when they talk about what they feel and how they think about this character."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/25/entertainment/hank-azaria-apu/index.html |title=Hank Azaria willing to 'step aside' from playing Apu on 'The Simpsons'|author=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticisms were referenced in the Season 29 episode "[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]", when Lisa breaks the [[fourth wall]] and addresses the audience by saying, "Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?" to which Marge replies, "Some things will be addressed at a later date." Lisa adds, "If at all." This reference was clarified by the fact that there was a framed photo of Apu with the caption on the photo saying "Don't have a cow, Apu", a play on Bart's catchphrase "Don't have a cow, man," as well as the fact that [[Hindus]] do not eat cows as they are considered sacred. In October 2018, it was reported that Apu would be written out of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/the-simpsons-indian-character-apu-axed-after-racial-controversy-11537982|title=The Simpsons Indian character Apu 'axed' after racial controversy |publisher=Sky News|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndication and streaming availability==
The [[cable television|cable]] television network [[FXX]] has [[broadcast syndication|exclusive cable and digital syndication]] rights for ''The Simpsons.'' Original contracts had previously stated that syndication rights for ''The Simpsons'' would not be sold to cable until the series conclusion, at a time when cable syndication deals were highly rare. The series has been syndicated to local broadcast stations in nearly all markets throughout the United States since September 1993.&lt;ref name=Simpsons&gt;[http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/fxx-lands-the-simpsons-in-the-biggest-off-network-deal-in-tv-history/#more-635800 FXX Lands 'The Simpsons' In Biggest Off-Network Deal In TV History] ''Deadline Hollywood'', November 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

FXX premiered ''The Simpsons'' on their network on August 21, 2014 by starting a twelve-day [[Marathon (television)|marathon]] which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including ''The Simpsons Movie'', which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. It was the longest continuous marathon in the history of television (until [[VH1 Classic]] aired a 433-hour, nineteen-day, marathon of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 2015; celebrating that program's 40th anniversary).&lt;ref name=EverySimpsonsEver&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Bill|title='The Simpsons' Launches On FXX With Longest Continuous Marathon Ever|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/simpsons-launches-on-fxx-longest-marathon_n_5120709.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VH1 Celebrates 40 Years of ‘Saturday Night Live’ with ‘SNL Rewind: 2015 – 1975′ Mega-Marathon|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/89273/vh1-saturday-night-live-rewind-marathon/|publisher=[[VH1]]|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled that those of regular prime time programming for FXX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kissell|first1=Rick|title='The Simpsons' Marathon More Than Triples Primetime Audience for FXX|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/the-simpsons-marathon-more-than-triples-primetime-audience-for-fxx-1201288542/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=FXX Paints Labor Day Weekend Yellow|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/08/28/fxx-paints-labor-day-weekend-yellow/297657/|publisher=[[TV By the Numbers]]|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchandise==

The popularity of ''The Simpsons'' has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry.&lt;ref name="mikescully"/&gt; The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. ''The Simpsons'' has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including [[Cluedo|Clue]], [[Scrabble]], [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], [[Operation (game)|Operation]], and [[The Game of Life]], as well as the [[trivia]] games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. Several card games such as [[Trump (card games)|trump cards]] and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial ''Simpsons'' books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Chappelles/2338 |title=Chapelle's Show—S1 DVD Passes ''The Simpsons'' As #1 All-Time TV-DVD; Celebrates by Announcing Season 2! |accessdate=July 3, 2006 |author=Lambert, David |date=September 19, 2004 |publisher=TVshowsonDVD.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20060704235733/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Chappelles/2338 |archivedate=July 4, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, seasons one through seventeen have been released on DVD in the U.S. ([[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]), Europe ([[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America ([[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]).

'''Trimethylolethane trinitrate''' ('''TMETN'''), also known as '''metriol trinitrate''' ('''METN''', '''MTN''', '''METRTN''') or '''nitropentaglycerin''', is a [[nitrate ester]]. It is a [[high explosive]] similar to [[nitroglycerin]]. It is a transparent oily liquid, colorless to light brown. It is odorless. It is used in some [[solid propellant]]s and [[smokeless powder]]s as a [[plasticizer]]. Its chemical formula is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

TMETN was first prepared and patented in Italy under name '''Metriolo'''. Germans began producing it before World War II when it was demonstrated to be an erosion and flash reducing agent in smokeless powders. It is a liquid explosive with properties similar to nitroglycerin but more stable to heat. It is prepared by [[nitration]] of [[trimethylolethane]] (metriol). It does not induce headaches.

TMETN can be initiated by friction, impact, and electrostatic discharge. It can be used as a high viscosity plasticizer-binder together with [[nitrocellulose]], but its poor coloiding properties made such use rare; long-term milling can however assist here; success can also be achieved by adding an inert plasticizer and a volatile solvent/colloiding agent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3943017.html Explosive composition comprising HMX, RDX, or PETN and a high viscosity nitrocellulose binder plasticized with TMETN - The United States of America as represented by the Secre...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

TMETN is miscible with ether and acetone. It is insoluble in 95% sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_273950.html Trimethylolethane Trinitrate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used as a plasticizer together, or as an alternative to, [[triethyleneglycol dinitrate]] (TEGDN).It can also be used as a [[monopropellant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3634158.html Liquid Nitrate Ester Monopropellant Composition - Camp, Albert T&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in fact [[Triethylene glycol dinitrate]], [[diethylene glycol dinitrate]], and trimethyloleate trinitrate are being considered as replacements for nitroglycerin in propellants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormingmedia.us/cat/sub/subcat20-57.html Guns and Ordnance: Ammunition and Explosives - Storming Media&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal receiver''' is generally a radio receiver that is able to work with different standard transmitters.

In case of home automations, this identify a radio receiver that works with almost any [[remote control]] in the market normally, used to open gates, [[garage door]]s, traffic barriers, entrance doors, etcetera. 
In other words, the universal receiver is able to recognize the code transmitted by other standard and not-standard remote controls, and is suitable to replace existing receiver permitting to add new and different remote controls on the automation system.

The company is associated with the [[Jet Propulsion Lab]] (JPL) and the [[California Institute of Technology]] through its CEO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen (the former Director of the Center for Space Microelectronics Technology (CSMT) and Manager of Supercomputing at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_Feb_18/ai_53899496/|title=Completion of $11.4M Private Placement Financing to Advance APS Technology | work= Business Wire |publisher=Findarticles.com|date=1999-02-18|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Viaspace was founded in 1998 as a Caltech/NASA [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]]. The company began with the objective of transforming space and defense technologies that were originally developed at JPL into commercial products.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1998, Viaspace signed a memorandum of understanding with RGC to commercialize a [[Quantum well infrared photodetector]]. This led to a joint venture partnership between the two companies called QWIP Technologies (QWIPTECH), which was incorporated in December 1998.&lt;ref name="bw50246785"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-50246785.html|title=Omicron Technologies Signs Memorandum of Understanding with ViaSpace Technologies LLC. - Business Wire | via = HighBeam Research |date=1998-08-14|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CEO of Viaspace, served as initial CEO of QWIP Technologies until RGC acquired 100% of QWIPTECH in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61398393.html|title=Rainbow Group Hires QWIP Inventor From Jet Propulsion Laboratory; HighBeam Research - FREE Article|publisher=Highbeam.com|date=2000-04-07|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66572789.html|title=Rainbow to Acquire Remaining 60% of the QWIP Technology Rights - FREE Article|publisher=Highbeam.com|date=2000-11-01|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66697490.html|title=Rainbow's QWIPTECH Appoints New Chief Operations Officer - FREE Article|publisher=Highbeam.com|date=2000-11-08|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since RGC's QWIPTECH acquisition, Viaspace has had no stake in QWIPTECH nor holds any Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/123/123189.html|title=QWIP Systems Inc.

In the summer of 1998, Viaspace also signed a memorandum of understanding with Omicron Technologies to form a joint venture for the commercialization of applications of a technology known as [[Active Pixel Sensor]]s (APS).&lt;ref name="bw50246785"/&gt; It was anticipated at the time of the joint venture that APS technology would be a strong competitor in its field and ultimately have a chance of replacing the widely used Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) used in imaging technology.&lt;ref name="bw50246785"/&gt; However, in 2000, Omicron announced that it had dropped out of the project due to financial issues.&lt;ref name="highbeam1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61791383.html|title=Omicron Technologies Drops APS Technology. | work= Business Wire | via = HighBeam Research | date=2000-04-28|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viaspace decided to discontinue commercialization efforts for APS technology because it would be too costly.&lt;ref name="highbeam1"/&gt; Commercialization of the APS technology by Omicron and Viaspace never materialized; however, Viaspace reacquired three patents from the failed Omicron partnership. These three patents are not associated with the imaging technology, but rather, in the field of radio satellite technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64486122.html|title=eCARmerce Inc., Acquires Radio Satellite Technology from Omicron Technologies. |work= Business Wire | via=HighBeam Research  |date=2000-08-23|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three radio satellite technology patents reacquired through the failed Omicron/ViaSpace Joint Venture are being applied toward Viaspace's inactive eCARmerce Inc. subsidiary, although there are no plans to further develop the eCARmerce subsidiary toward commercialization at this time.

In 1999, a company called [[Spectrasensors Inc]] acquired exclusive patent rights from NASA and Caltech to commercialize gas sensor technology. SpectraSensors became a Viaspace subsidiary in which Dr. Carl Kukkonen was CEO. In 2001 a company called Tunable Photonics was spun off from SpectraSensors. Dr. Carl Kukkonen served as CEO of ViaSpace, SpectraSensors, and Tunable Photonics during 2001. In 2002, a company called FiberSpace acquired Tunable Photonics. In 2003, SpectraSensors reacquired the remaining intellectual property from Tunable Photonics. Presently, SpectraSensors is a profitable company separate from Viaspace.

On August 14, 2000, Viaspace and [[Hewlett Packard]] announced a strategic alliance in which HP would provide [[United States Dollar|US$]]10 million to Viaspace for commercialization of new technologies.&lt;ref name="highbeam2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64153126.html|title=HP and ViaSpace Technologies Announce Strategic Alliance to Commercialize Innovative New Technologies; HP to Provide up to $10 Million in Financing. - Business Wire | via =HighBeam Research |date=2000-08-14|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five million of HP's {{Nowrap|$10 million}} went to the development of Viachange.com, which Viaspace no longer operates.&lt;ref name="highbeam2"/&gt;

In 2002, a new company, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (DMFCC) was formed. DMFCC, Caltech and USC signed a letter of intent for DMFCC to acquire rights to {{Nowrap|22 issued}} and over {{Nowrap|40 pending}} U.S. and foreign patents. These include the original and fundamental patent for using [[methanol]] dissolved in water as the fuel for [[Direct Methanol Fuel Cells]]. In exchange, Caltech and USC became equity shareholders in DMFCC and receive a royalty on sales. Dr. Carl Kukkonen was and continues to operate as CEO of DMFCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewire.com/display.cfm/Wire_ID/995|title=Caltech and University of Southern California Fuel Cell Technology to be Commercialized|publisher=Ewire.com|date=2002-02-27|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Viaspace became a public company through a merger between ViaSpace and Global Wide Production. The name ViaSpace was changed to Viaspace (all caps). Dr. Carl Kukkonen remained CEO, Mr. Amjad Abdallat took the position of vice president and chief operating officer, and Mr. Stephen Muzi became the chief financial officer, Secretary, and Treasurer of Viaspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133417045.html|title=Global Wide Publication Ltd. complete merger. - PR Newswire | via =HighBeam Research |date=2005-06-21|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2006, DMFCC exercised an option for a worldwide license to {{Nowrap|50 issued}} and {{Nowrap|50 pending}} fuel cell patents from Caltech and USC.&lt;ref name="highbeam3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-141253888.html|title=Viaspace Subsidiary Exercises Option for 100 Caltech and University of Southern California Technology Patents, Enabling Company to Offer Patent Protection to OEMs That Will Use Viaspace's Fuel Cell Cartridges. - PR Newswire | via =HighBeam Research |date=2006-01-25|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMFCC currently owns {{Nowrap|65 issued}} and {{Nowrap|33 pending}} patents related to fuel cells.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viaspace.com/ae_ip.php|title=Intellectual Property|publisher=Viaspace|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Viaspace's wholly owned security and homeland defense subsidiary, Arroyo Sciences Inc., was renamed Viaspace Security Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156022444.html|title=Viaspace Announces Name Change of Subsidiary to Viaspace Security Inc. - PR Newswire | via =HighBeam Research |date=2006-12-18|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Viaspace Security's expert system software, "[[SHINE Expert System]]", licensed from Caltech, was awarded the NASA Space Act Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157756757.html|title=JPL Shine expert system software, licensed by Viaspace from Caltech, is recipient of NASA Space Act award. - M2 Presswire | via =HighBeam Research |date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, Viaspace established a new subsidiary Viaspace Energy.&lt;ref name="highbeam4"&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-162900443.html|title=Viaspace Expands Focus on Energy Products Including New Opportunities in Clean Energy Sector. - PR Newswire | via=HighBeam Research |date=2007-05-02|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Viaspace entered the biofuels market with the announcement of the acquisition of Inter-Pacific Arts Corp (IPA), a company with a license to grow a fast-growing grass.&lt;ref name="highbeam5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-187890496.html|title=Viaspace Completes Acquisition of Inter-Pacific Which Adds $5 Million in Revenue. - PR Newswire | via=HighBeam Research |date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPA also sells framed art.&lt;ref name="highbeam5"/&gt; The framed art business of IPA is Viaspace's only non-high-technology business unit and is being used to fund the growth of the grass segment of the business.&lt;ref name="highbeam5"/&gt; Viaspace sold its humidity sensor line in April 2008 in order to focus on near term projects.&lt;ref name="highbeam5"/&gt;

Viaspace created Viaspace Green Energy in 2009 as its alternative energy subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-200706087.html|title=Viaspace Launches New Website. - PR Newswire | via=HighBeam Research: Online Press Releases|publisher=Highbeam.com|date=2009-05-28|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viaspace is currently seeking or already has undisclosed contracts for DMFCC products and Giant King Grass products. In 2010 Viaspace announced the launch of its first product, Green Logs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-227292977.html|title=Viaspace Introduces First Green-Energy Product. - PR Newswire | via=HighBeam Research |date=2010-05-25|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a month later, Viaspace Green Energy announced its first power plant MOU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://viaspace.com/press_article.php?id=1312|title=Viaspace Ssigns agreement with German biogas producer Ruba Energie GmbH|publisher=Viaspace|date=2010-06-14|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, two of the three Viaspace business units (the alternative energy and chemical sensing units) are based on exclusive technologies developed by JPL and funded by NASA and the DOD. The renewable energy business unit is based on a worldwide license granted by China Gate to grow Giant King Grass, a non-genetically modified hybrid grass.

== Subsidiaries ==

=== Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation ===
For the alternative energy market, Viaspace subsidiary Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation develops and manufactures disposable fuel cartridges for [[fuel cell]] powered electronic devices such as notebook computers, mobile phones and military systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viaspace.com/ae_dmfcc.php|title=Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (DMFCC) - Alternative Energy|publisher=Viaspace|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/online/news/articles/2006-01/Viaspace-Subsidiary-Direct-Metha|title=Viaspace Subsidiary Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation to Begin Sampling Cartridge Product|publisher=Fuel Cell Today|date=2006-01-11|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech and USC are equity shareholders in DMFCC and will receive royalties on any sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83328648.html|title=Caltech and University of Southern California Fuel Cell Technology to be Commercialized. - Business Wire | via=HighBeam Research |date=2002-02-27|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMFCC currently owns 65 issued and 33 pending patents related to fuel cells.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property"/&gt;

Laws forbidding methanol and other fuels onboard aircraft has deterred large OEMs from proceeding with commercialization of fuel cell powered devices. The regulation and safety standards of fuel cells is one cause of the long delay for the roll out of Direct Methanol Fuel Cell powered devices. The decisions to allow Direct Methanol Fuel Cells onboard aircraft will enhance the future prospect of Viaspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-178664157.html|title=U.S. Department of Transportation Rule Allows Passengers to Carry Methanol Fuel Cells and Cartridges Onboard Aircraft. - PR Newswire | via=HighBeam Research |date=2008-05-06|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-169067545.html|title=Approval for Methanol Fuel Cells and Cartridges on Airplanes Proposed by US Department of Transportation. - PR Newswire | via=HighBeam Research |date=2007-09-25|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viaspace Green Energy ===
For the renewable energy markets, its subsidiary, Viaspace Green Energy, is cultivating Giant King Grass, a proprietary, fast-growing perennial grass for the production of liquid biofuels for transportation, and as a renewable substitute or replacement for coal as the heat source in stationary electricity generating power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viaspace.com/re_about.php|title=Green Energy (VGE) - Renewable Energy|publisher=Viaspace|date=2009-03-27|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biofueldaily.com/reports/Viaspace_To_Trademark_Giant_King_Grass_999.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20091114112851/http://www.biofueldaily.com/reports/Viaspace_To_Trademark_Giant_King_Grass_999.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-11-14|title=Viaspace To Trademark Giant King Grass|publisher=Biofueldaily.com|accessdate=2010-06-25}} &lt;/ref&gt; By June 2010, the company had {{convert|279|acre}} of land under cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-228418941.html|title=Viaspace Increases Giant King(TM) Grass Production Capacity. - PR Newswire | via=HighBeam Research |date=2010-06-09|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">The '''W42''' was an [[United States|American]] nuclear [[fission weapon]] developed in 1957.

In December 1957 the [[Army]] requested the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] to develop a nuclear warhead for the [[Hawk missile|HAWK low- to medium-altitude surface-to-air missile]]. In July 1958 the military characteristics were approved for the new warhead and the design released. Two months later the requirement for a HAWK with a nuclear warhead was cancelled.

It equipped the [[AIM-47 Falcon]] long-range air-to-air missile; the design of the [[AAM-N-10 Eagle]] missile also allowed for carriage of the W42.&lt;ref&gt;Parsch 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimensions of the warhead were 13-14in wide by 18.5in long. It weighed 75-92 pounds and used a [[proximity fuze]].

The project was cancelled in June 1961.

'''Women of Uganda Network''' ('''WOUGNET''') is [[Uganda]]n [[non-governmental organization]] dedicated to aiding women and women's organizations in the use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs). WOUGNET is a member of the [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC).

==History==

WOUGNET was set up in May 2000 by women's organisations from [[Uganda]]. Its mailing lists are hosted by [[Kabissa]]. WOUGNET's mission is "to promote and support the use of [[information and communication technologies]] by women organisations as well as individuals, so as to improve the conditions of life for Ugandan women, by enhancing their capacities and opportunities for exchange, collaboration and information sharing." The director is [[Dorothy Okello]].

==Tools==

Primarily, WOUGNET focuses on using mobile phones, e-mail and the web, and is interested in the integration of "traditional means" such as [[radio]], [[video]], and [[Printing|print]] in a way that it enables wider outreach. Subscriptions to the WOUGNET's mailing lists, drawn from a global audience, have grown from 50 in the year 2000 to 1,292 (spread out across two lists, the WOUGNET mailing list and the WOUGNET update newsletter) by December 2006.

[[File:Panoramic-windshield.JPG|right|thumb|Panoramic (wrap-around) windshield on a 1959 [[Edsel Corsair]]]]
The '''windshield''' ([[North America]]) or '''windscreen''' ([[Commonwealth]] English) of an [[aircraft]], [[car]], [[bus]], [[motorbike]] or [[tram]] is the front [[window]]. Modern windshields are generally made of [[Laminated glass|laminated safety glass]], a type of treated glass, which consists of two (typically) curved sheets of [[glass]] with a [[plastic]] layer [[laminate]]d between them for safety, and are bonded into the window frame. Motorbike windshields are often made of high-impact [[polycarbonate]] or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] plastic.

==Usage==
[[File: Raked windshield 1952 DeSoto.jpg|thumb|Split and raked windshield on a 1952 DeSoto. Note the panes of glass are flat.]]
Windshields protect the vehicle's occupants from wind and flying debris such as dust, insects, and rocks, and provide an aerodynamically formed window towards the front. UV coating [[Windshield sun shades|may be applied]] to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation. However, this is usually unnecessary since most auto windshields are made from [[Laminated glass|laminated safety glass]].  The majority of UV-B is absorbed by the glass itself, and any remaining UV-B together with most of the UV-A is absorbed by the PVB bonding layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuchinda|first=Chanisada|author2=Sabong Srivannaboon |author3=Henry W Lim |title=Photoprotection by window glass, automobile glass, and sunglasses|journal=J Am Acad Dermatol|year=2006|volume=54|pages=845–854|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.05.014|url=http://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622%2805%2904624-4/abstract|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On motorbikes their main function is to shield the rider from wind, though not as completely as in a car, whereas on sports and racing motorcycles the main function is reducing drag when the rider assumes the optimal aerodynamic configuration with his or her body in unison with the machine and does not shield the rider from wind when sitting upright.

==Safety==
[[File:Windshield-spiderweb.jpg|thumb|left|Automobile windshield displaying "spiderweb" cracking typical of laminated safety glass.]]
Early windshields were made of ordinary window glass, but that could lead to serious injuries in the event of a crash. A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields. The most notable example of this is the ''Pane vs. Ford'' case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through [[reckless driving]].{{citation needed |date=November 2015}} They were replaced with windshields made of [[toughened glass]] and were fitted in the frame using a [[rubber]] or [[neoprene]] [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]]. The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke. These windshields, however, could shatter from a simple stone chip. In 1919, [[Henry Ford]] solved the problem of flying debris by using the new French technology of [[laminated glass|glass laminating]]. Windshields made using this process were two layers of glass with a cellulose inner layer. This inner layer held the glass together when it fractured. Between 1919 and 1929, Ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.glass.org/consumer/a_windshield.htm|title= Your Windshield is Not Just a "Wind-Shield" Any More|date= |website= |publisher= National Glass Association|deadurl= yes|archivedate= 2 August 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802145330/http://www.glass.org/consumer/a_windshield.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern, glued-in windshields contribute to the vehicle's rigidity, but the main force for innovation has historically been the need to prevent injury from sharp glass fragments. Almost all nations now require windshields to stay in one piece even if broken, except if pierced by a strong force. Properly installed automobile windshields are also essential to safety; along with the roof of the car, they provide protection to the vehicle's occupants in the case of a roll-over accident {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

Today’s windshields are a safety device just like seatbelts and airbags. The installation of the auto glass is done with an automotive grade urethane designed specifically for automobiles. The adhesive creates a molecular bond between the glass and the vehicle. If the adhesive bond fails at any point on the glass it can reduce the effectiveness of the airbag and substantially compromise the structural integrity of the roof.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  The urethane sealant is protected from UV in sunlight by a band of dark dots around the edge of the windshield.  The darkened edge transitions to the clear windshield with smaller dots to minimize thermal stress in manufacturing.  The same band of darkened dots is often expanded around the rearview mirror to act as a sunshade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=David|title=Here's What Those Little Dots Are On The Edges Of Your Car Windows|url=http://jalopnik.com/heres-what-those-little-dots-are-on-the-edges-of-your-c-1791075995|website=Jalopnik|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other aspects==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
In many places, laws restrict the use of heavily [[Window tinting|tinted glass]] in vehicle windshields; generally, laws specify the maximum level of tint permitted. Some vehicles have noticeably more tint in the uppermost part of the windshield to block [[light pollution#Glare|sunglare]].

In aircraft windshields, an electric current is applied through a conducting layer of [[tin dioxide|tin(IV) oxide]] to generate [[heat]] to prevent [[frost|icing]]. A similar system for automobile windshields, introduced on [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] vehicles as "[[Quickclear]]" in Europe ("InstaClear" in North America) in the 1980s and through the early 1990s, used this conductive metallic coating applied to the inboard side of the outer layer of glass. Other glass manufacturers utilize a grid of micro-thin wires to conduct the heat especially on the later European Ford Transit vans. These systems are more typically utilized by European auto manufacturers such as [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and [[Porsche]].

The use of thermal glass prevents some [[Automotive navigation system|navigation systems]] from functioning correctly, as the embedded metal blocks the satellite signal.The RF signal tends to flow along the metal wires or layer so very little radiation can pass. This can be resolved by using an external antenna. Mobile telephones can also have problems; thermal glass typically allows only 0.0001 (1‰, or one per mille or 1 ppt) of the signal to pass, whereas a concrete wall with rebars allows up to 0.0100 (10%, or 100‰) of the signal to pass.

==Terminology==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
[[File:BB1 aeroscreen.JPG|thumb|Singled aero screen on [[Bentley Blower No.1]]]]
The term ''windshield'' is used generally throughout North America. The term ''windscreen'' is the usual term in the [[British Isles]] and [[Australasia]] for all vehicles. In the US ''windscreen'' refers to the mesh or foam placed over a [[microphone]] to minimize wind noise, while a ''windshield'' refers to the front window of a car. 
In the UK, the terms are reversed, although generally, the foam screen is referred to as a microphone shield, and not a windshield.

Sports or racing cars would sometimes have '''aero screens''', which were  small semi-circular or rectangular windshields.  These were often mounted in pairs behind a foldable flat windshield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Beattie|first= Ian|title= The Complete Book of Automobile Body Design|year= 1977|publisher= The Haynes Publishing Group|location= Yeovil, UK|isbn= 0854292179|ref= harv|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aero screens are usually less than {{convert|8|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} in height. They are  known as aero screens because they only deflect the wind. The twin aeroscreen setup (often called [[Brooklands]]) was popular among older sports and modern cars in vintage style.

A ''wiperless windshield'' is a windshield that uses a mechanism other than [[windshield wiper|wiper]]s to remove snow and rain from the windshield. The concept car [[Acura TL]] features a wiperless windshield using a series of jet [[nozzle]]s in the [[cowling|cowl]] to blow [[Pressure|pressurized air]] onto the windshield. Also several glass manufacturers have experimented with nano type coatings designed to repel external contaminants with varying degrees of success but to date none of these have made it to commercial applications.

==Repair of stone-chip and crack damage==
According to the US National Windshield Repair Association, many types of [[stone damage]] can be successfully repaired. Whether the windshield can be repaired always depends upon four factors: the size, type, depth and location of the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carwindshields.info/is-your-windshield-repairable | title=Is Your Windshield Repairable? | publisher=Car Windshield Info | accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size and depth===
Repair of cracks up to {{convert|2.4|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} is within permissible limits; automobile glass with more severe damage needs to be replaced. However, this is dependent on local laws. If a crack extends to the edge of the panel then this would compromise the structural integrity of the windshield. Aircraft windshields are designed in such a way that even if a crack were to extend all the way across the panel, the structural integrity is maintained via multiple failsafe methods in both frame and the glass plies. A sacrificial outer layer that cracks rather than devitrifies is the first failsafe.

===Type===
Circular bullseyes, linear cracks, crack chips, dings, pits and star-shaped breaks can be repaired without removing the glass, eliminating the risk of leaking or bonding problems sometimes associated with replacement.

===Location===

Some damages are very difficult to repair, or cannot be repaired: 
* on inside of the windshield 
* deep damage on both layers of glass 
* damage over rain sensor or internal radio antenna 
* complex multiple cracks 
* very long cracks (i.e. over {{convert|18|-|24|in|cm|}} long) 
* contaminated cracks 
* edge cracks

In cracked windshield repair, air is removed from the damaged area on the windshield with a specified vacuum injection pump. Then using the injection pump, the clear adhesive resin is injected to replace the air in the windshield crack. The resin is then cured with an ultraviolet light. When done properly, the damaged area’s strength is restored, as is 90–95% of the clarity.

==Replacement{{anchor|Windshield replacement}}==

Windshields that cannot be repaired have to be replaced. Replacement of a windshield typically takes less than an hour. To ensure the vehicle is safe to drive, time values called the [[Safe drive away time|Safe Drive Away Time]] have been established. Windshields which have been replaced must cure or bond sufficiently until they are able to withstand the forces of a crash. Knowing the minimum time needed to cure the glass bonding adhesives is therefore important. This '''safe drive away time''' (SDAT) or '''minimum drive away time''' (MDAT) refers to the time required until a windshield installation or glass replacement is considered safe to drive again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cognard | first1 = Philippe | title = Handbook of Adhesives and Sealants | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0080447087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criteria are specified in [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] 212/208 (see [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|FMVSS]]) to ensure the reliability of adhesive systems.  Typically the SDAT is verified with [[crash test]]s as well as with high-speed laboratory test methods.

Consumers may be unaware that the MDAT or SDAT time is focused on safety and not necessarily on the quality, durability, or warranty of the installation. Care must be taken not to drive the vehicle prior to the SDAT/MDAT. If a vehicle is released to be driven before the SDAT and the adhesive used to set the new windshield has not had appropriate cure time, the occupants will not be properly protected in the event of a collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libertyautoglass.us/critical-safety-procedures-for-the-replacement-of-auto-glass-retained-by-bonding/|title=Critical Safety Procedures For The Replacement of Auto Glass Retained By Bonding|website=Liberty AutoGlass|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airbag]]s deploy at speeds up to {{convert|200|mph|km/h m/s|abbr=on}} and in some cases exert tremendous force on the windshield. Occupants can impact the airbag just 50&amp;nbsp; ms after initial deployment.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Stenzel: Determining SDAT, AGRR Magazine, March/April 2012, page 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on vehicle design, airbag deployment and/or occupant impact into the airbag may increase forces on the windshield, dramatically in some cases.
Forces of occupants on the airbags - and hence the potential forces on the windshield - are lower for belted occupants.&lt;ref&gt;Exposing Industry Shortcuts to SDAT Recommendations,  [https://www.glass.net/blog/tips/volkswagen-recall-is-a-reminder-of-auto-glass-importance/ Volkswagen Recall is a Reminder of Auto Glass Importance]&lt;/ref&gt; As consequence, [[adhesive]] suppliers usually inform their customers about the level of security achieved:

1)  Example: Security exceeding FMVSS 212/208 belted

2)  Example: Security exceeding FMVSS 212/208 unbelted&lt;ref&gt;Premium Adhesive Systems, AGRR Magazine, March/April 2012, Page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of quick-cure adhesives, mobile windshield replacements have become more prevalent.  Often the temperature and humidity cannot be controlled for mobile installations. For most common glass adhesives the ideal environment is {{convert|70|°F|°C}} and 50% [[humidity]]. Variations from the ideal curing environment can increase the time needed for a sufficiently safe bond to form. Because of the variables and difficulties involved in mobile windshield replacement, many vehicle manufacturers do not recommend this method of installation.

==Disposal==
[[Waste disposal]] of [[laminated glass]] is no longer permitted in a landfill in most European countries as the [[End of Life Vehicles Directive]] (ELV) is implemented. A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.surrey.ac.uk/CHAMP/documents/pilk.pdf|title= Laminated Car Windscreen Recycling|author=&lt;!--Staff writer, no author credit--&gt; |format= pdf|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031083149/http://www.surrey.ac.uk/CHAMP/documents/pilk.pdf|archivedate= 2008-10-31|deadurl= yes|accessdate= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Surrey University]] and [[Pilkington Glass]] proposes that waste laminated glass be placed into a separating device such as a rolling mill where the glass is fragmented and the larger [[cullet]] is mechanically detached from the inner film. The application of heat then melts the laminating plastic, usually, Polyvinyl Butyral  "PVB" enabling both the glass and the interior film to be recycled. The PVB recycling process is a simple procedure of melting and reshaping it.
One possible method of recycling of simple automotive laminated windshields could involve heating the windshield to above the melting point of the PVB interlayer and then separating the glass plies. This depends chiefly on the differential melting points of PVB and glass and is not suitable for other interlayer materials such as silicone based materials.
