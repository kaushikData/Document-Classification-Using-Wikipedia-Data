More generally, a polynomial defined over a field ''K'' is absolutely irreducible if it is irreducible over every algebraic extension of ''K'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Arithmetic of Algebraic Curves|series=Monographs in Contemporary Mathematics|first=Serguei A.|last=Stepanov|publisher=Springer|year=1994|isbn=9780306110368|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PI66sVXDp7UC&amp;pg=PA53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[affine algebraic set]] defined by equations with coefficients in a field ''K'' is absolutely irreducible if it is not the union of two algebraic sets defined by equations in an [[algebraically closed extension]] of ''K''. In other words, an absolutely irreducible algebraic set is a synonym of an [[algebraic variety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebraic Geometry in Coding Theory and Cryptography|first1=Harald|last1=Niederreiter|author1-link = Harald Niederreiter |first2=Chaoping|last2=Xing|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=9781400831302|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utDJWUVogZ4C&amp;pg=PA47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasizes that the coefficients of the defining equations may not belong to an algebraically closed field.

'''Absolutely irreducible''' is also applied, with the same meaning to [[linear representation]]s of [[algebraic group]]s.

In all cases, being absolutely irreducible is the same as being irreducible over the [[algebraic closure]] of the ground field.

== Examples ==
* An univariate polynomial of degree greater or equal to 2 is never absolutely irreducible.
* The irreducible two-dimensional representation of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of order 6, originally defined over the field of [[rational number]]s, is absolutely irreducible.
* The representation of the [[circle group]] by rotations in the plane is irreducible (over the field of real numbers), but is not absolutely irreducible. After extending the field to complex numbers, it splits into two irreducible components. This is to be expected, since the circle group is [[commutative]] and it is known that all irreducible representations of commutative groups over an algebraically closed field are one-dimensional.
* The real algebraic variety defined by the equation

:: &lt;math&gt; x^2 + y^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:is absolutely irreducible.&lt;ref name="tucker"/&gt; It is the ordinary [[circle]] over the reals and remains an irreducible [[conic section]] over the field of complex numbers. Absolute irreducibility more generally holds over any field not of [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] two. In characteristic two, the equation is equivalent to (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;−1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. Hence it defines the double line ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=1, which is a [[reduced ring|non-reduced]] [[scheme (algebraic geometry)|scheme]].

* The algebraic variety given by the equation

:: &lt;math&gt; x^2 + y^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:is not absolutely irreducible. Indeed, the left hand side can be factored as

:: &lt;math&gt; x^2 + y^2 = (x+yi)(x-yi), &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is a square root of −1.

:Therefore, this algebraic variety consists of two lines intersecting at the origin and is not absolutely irreducible. This holds either already over the ground field, if −1 is a square, or over the quadratic extension obtained by adjoining ''i''.

A '''binary symmetric channel''' (or BSC) is a common [[communications channel]] model used in [[coding theory]] and [[information theory]]. In this model, a transmitter wishes to send a [[bit]] (a zero or a one), and the receiver receives a bit. It is assumed that the bit is ''usually'' [[data transmission|transmitted]] correctly, but that it will be "flipped" with a small [[probability]] (the "crossover probability"). This channel is used frequently in information theory because it is one of the simplest channels to analyze.

== Description ==
[[Image:Binary symmetric channel (en).svg|600px|center]]
The BSC is a ''binary channel''; that is, it can transmit only one of two symbols (usually called 0 and 1). (A non-binary channel would be capable of transmitting more than 2 symbols, possibly even an infinite number of choices.) The transmission is not perfect, and occasionally the receiver gets the wrong bit.

This channel is often used by theorists because it is one of the simplest [[Signal noise|noisy]] channels to analyze. Many problems in [[communication theory]] can be [[Reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to a BSC. Conversely, being able to transmit effectively over the BSC can give rise to solutions for more complicated channels.

== Definition ==
A '''binary symmetric channel with crossover probability''' &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; denoted by '''BSC&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''', is a channel with binary input and binary output and probability of error &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;; that is, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the transmitted [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; the received variable, then the channel is characterized by the [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 0 | X = 0 ] &amp;= 1 - p \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 0 | X = 1 ] &amp;= p \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 1 | X = 0 ] &amp;= p \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 1 | X = 1 ] &amp;= 1 - p
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is assumed that &lt;math&gt;0 \le p \le 1/2&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;p &gt; 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, then the receiver can swap the output (interpret 1 when it sees 0, and vice versa) and obtain an equivalent channel with crossover probability &lt;math&gt;1 - p \le 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Capacity of BSC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ===
The [[channel capacity]] of the binary symmetric channel is 
:&lt;math&gt;\ C_{\text{BSC}} = 1 - \operatorname H_\text{b}(p), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname H_\text{b}(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binary entropy function]].

'''Proof:''' The capacity is defined as the maximum [[mutual entropy]] between input and output for all possible input distributions &lt;math&gt;p_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; C = \max_{p_X(x)} \left \{\, I(X;Y)\, \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

The mutual information can be reformulated as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I(X;Y) &amp;= H(Y) - H(Y|X) \\
       &amp;= H(Y) - \sum_{x \in \{0,1\} }{p_X(x) H(Y|X=x)} \\
       &amp;= H(Y) - \sum_{x \in \{0,1\} }{p_X(x)} \operatorname H_\text{b}(p) \\
       &amp;= H(Y) - \operatorname H_\text{b}(p),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the first and second step follows from the definition of mutual information and [[conditional entropy]] respectively. The entropy at the output for a given and fixed input symbol (&lt;math&gt;H(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt;) equals the binary entropy function, which leads to the third line and this can be further simplified.

In the last line, only the first term &lt;math&gt;H(Y)&lt;/math&gt; depends on the input distribution &lt;math&gt;p_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;. And one knows, that the entropy of a binary variable is at maximum one, and reaches this only if its probability distribution is uniform. This case (uniform distribution of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;) can only be reached by a uniform distribution at the input &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, which is because of the symmetry of the channel. So one finally gets &lt;math&gt;C_{\text{BSC}}=1-\operatorname H_\text{b}(p)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Shannon's channel capacity theorem for BSC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ==
Shannon's noisy coding theorem is general for all kinds of  channels. We consider a special case of this theorem for a binary symmetric channel with an error probability p.

=== Noisy coding theorem for BSC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ===
The noise &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; that characterizes &lt;math&gt;BSC_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[random variable]] consisting of n independent random bits (n is defined below) where each random bit is a &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;. We indicate this by writing "&lt;math&gt;e \in BSC_{p}&lt;/math&gt;".

:'''Theorem 1.''' For all &lt;math&gt;p&lt; \tfrac{1}{2},&lt;/math&gt; all &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; \tfrac{1}{2} - p&lt;/math&gt;, all sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (depending on &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;), and all &lt;math&gt;k\leq\lfloor (1 - H(p + \epsilon))n\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a pair of [[Code|encoding]] and [[Code|decoding]] functions &lt;math&gt;E: \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; respectively,  such that every message &lt;math&gt;m\in\{0,1\}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; has the following property: 
::&lt;math&gt;\Pr_{e \in BSC_p}[D(E(m) + e) \neq m] \leq 2^{-{\delta}n}&lt;/math&gt;.

What this theorem actually implies is, a message when picked from &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, encoded with a random encoding function &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and sent across a noisy &lt;math&gt;BSC_{p}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a very high probability of recovering the original message by decoding, if &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; or in effect the rate of the channel is bounded by the quantity stated in the theorem. The decoding error probability is exponentially small.

'''Proof of Theorem 1.''' First we describe the encoding function and decoding functions used in the theorem. We will use the [[probabilistic method]] to prove this theorem. Shannon's theorem was one of the earliest applications of this method.

'''[[Code|Encoding function:]]''' Consider an encoding function &lt;math&gt;E: \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; that is selected at random. This means that for each message &lt;math&gt;m \in \{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, the value &lt;math&gt;E(m) \in \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is selected at random (with equal probabilities).

'''[[Code|Decoding function:]]''' For a given encoding function &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, the decoding function &lt;math&gt;D:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; is specified as follows: given any received codeword &lt;math&gt;y \in \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, we find the message &lt;math&gt;m\in\{0,1\}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[Hamming distance]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta(y, E(m))&lt;/math&gt; is as small as possible (with ties broken arbitrarily). This kind of a decoding function is called a ''[[decoding methods#maximum likelihood decoding|maximum likelihood decoding (MLD)]]'' function.

Ultimately, we will show (by integrating the probabilities) that at least one such choice &lt;math&gt;(E,D)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the conclusion of theorem; that is what is meant by the probabilistic method.

The proof runs as follows. Suppose &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are fixed. First we show, for a fixed &lt;math&gt;m \in \{0,1\}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; chosen randomly, the probability of failure over &lt;math&gt;BSC_p&lt;/math&gt; noise is exponentially small in ''n''. At this point, the proof works for a fixed message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  Next we extend this result to work for ''all'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. We achieve this by eliminating half of the codewords from the code with the argument that the proof for the decoding error probability holds for at least half of the codewords. The latter method is called expurgation. This gives the total process the name ''random coding with expurgation''.

'''A high level proof:''' Fix &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Given a fixed message &lt;math&gt;m \in \{0,1\}^{k}&lt;/math&gt;, we need to estimate the [[expected value]] of the [[probability]] of the received codeword along with the noise does not give back &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; on decoding. That is to say, we need to estimate:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_{E} \left [\Pr_{e \in BSC_p}[D(E(m) + e) \neq m] \right ].&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be the received codeword. In order for the decoded codeword &lt;math&gt;D(y)&lt;/math&gt; not to be equal to the message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, one of the following events must occur:

* &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; does not lie within the Hamming ball of radius &lt;math&gt;(p+\epsilon)n&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;E(m)&lt;/math&gt;. This condition is mainly used to make the calculations easier.
* There is another message &lt;math&gt;m' \in \{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Delta(y, E(m')) \leqslant \Delta(y, E(m))&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the errors due to noise take the transmitted codeword closer to another encoded message.

We can apply [[Chernoff bound]] to ensure the non occurrence of the first event. By applying [[Chernoff bound]] we have,

:&lt;math&gt;Pr_{e \in BSC_p} [\Delta(y, E(m)) &gt; (p+\epsilon)n] \leqslant 2^{-{\epsilon^2}n}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is exponentially small for large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (recall that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is fixed).

As for the second event, we note that the probability that &lt;math&gt;E(m') \in B(y,(p+\epsilon)n)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\text{Vol}(B(y,(p+\epsilon)n)/2^n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;B(x, r)&lt;/math&gt; is the Hamming ball of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; centered at vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Vol}(B(x, r))&lt;/math&gt; is its volume. Using approximation to estimate the number of codewords in the Hamming ball, we have &lt;math&gt;\text{Vol}(B(y,(p+\epsilon)n)) \approx 2^{H(p)n}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the above probability amounts to &lt;math&gt;2^{H(p)n}/2^n = 2^{H(p)n-n}&lt;/math&gt;. Now using [[union bound]], we can upper bound the existence of such an &lt;math&gt;m' \in \{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\le 2^{k +H(p)n-n}&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;2^{-\Omega(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, as desired by the choice of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

'''A detailed proof:''' From the above analysis, we calculate the probability of the event that the decoded codeword plus the channel noise is not the same as the original message sent. We shall introduce some symbols here. Let &lt;math&gt;p(y|E(m))&lt;/math&gt; denote the probability of receiving codeword &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; given that codeword &lt;math&gt;E(m)&lt;/math&gt; was sent. Let &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;B(E(m),(p+\epsilon)n).&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr_{e \in BSC_p}[D(E(m) + e) \neq m] &amp;= \sum_{y \in \{0,1\}^{n}} p(y|E(m))\cdot 1_{D(y)\neq m} \\
&amp;\leqslant \sum_{y \notin B_0} p(y|E(m)) \cdot 1_{D(y)\neq m} + \sum_{y \in B_0} p(y|E(m))\cdot 1_{D(y)\neq m} \\
&amp;\leqslant 2^{-{\epsilon^2}n} + \sum_{y \in B_0} p(y|E(m)) \cdot 1_{D(y)\neq m}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We get the last inequality by our analysis using the [[Chernoff bound]] above. Now taking expectation on both sides we have,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}_E \left [\Pr_{e \in BSC_p} [D(E(m) + e) \neq m] \right ] &amp;\leqslant 2^{-{\epsilon^2}n} + \sum_{y \in B_0} p(y|E(m)) \mathbb{E}[1_{D(y)\neq m}] \\
&amp;\leqslant 2^{-{\epsilon^2}n} + \sum_{y \in B_0} \mathbb{E}[1_{D(y)\neq m}]  &amp;&amp; \sum_{y \in B_0} p(y|E(m)) \leqslant 1 \\
&amp;\leqslant 2^{-{\epsilon^2}n} + 2^{k +H(p + \epsilon)n-n} &amp;&amp; \mathbb{E}[1_{D(y)\neq m}] \leqslant 2^{k +H(p + \epsilon)n-n} \text{ (see above)} \\
&amp;\leqslant 2^{-\delta n}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

by appropriately choosing the value of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Since the above bound holds for '''each''' message, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_m \left [\mathbb{E}_E \left [\Pr_{e \in BSC_p} \left [D(E(m) + e) \right ] \neq m \right ] \right ] \leqslant 2^{-\delta n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can change the order of summation in the expectation with respect to the message and the choice of the encoding function &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_E \left [\mathbb{E}_m \left [\Pr_{e \in BSC_p} \left [D(E(m) + e) \right ] \neq m \right ] \right ] \leqslant 2^{-\delta n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence in conclusion, by probabilistic method, we have some encoding function &lt;math&gt;E^{*}&lt;/math&gt; and a corresponding decoding function &lt;math&gt;D^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_m \left [\Pr_{e \in BSC_p} \left [D^{*}(E^{*}(m) + e)\neq m \right ] \right ] \leqslant 2^{-\delta n}.&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, the proof works for a fixed message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. But we need to make sure that the above bound holds for '''all''' the messages &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; '''simultaneously'''. For that, let us sort the &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; messages by their decoding error probabilities. Now by applying [[Markov's inequality]], we can show the decoding error probability for the first &lt;math&gt;2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; messages to be at most &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2^{-\delta n}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus in order to confirm that the above bound to hold for '''every''' message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, we could just trim off the last &lt;math&gt;2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; messages from the sorted order. This essentially gives us another encoding function &lt;math&gt;E'&lt;/math&gt; with a corresponding decoding function &lt;math&gt;D'&lt;/math&gt; with a decoding error probability of at most &lt;math&gt;2^{-\delta n + 1}&lt;/math&gt; with the same rate. Taking &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt; to be equal to &lt;math&gt;\delta - \tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; we bound the decoding error probability to &lt;math&gt;2^{-\delta'n}&lt;/math&gt;. This expurgation process completes the proof of Theorem 1.

== Converse of Shannon's capacity theorem ==

The converse of the capacity theorem essentially states that &lt;math&gt;1 - H(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the best rate one can achieve over a binary symmetric channel. Formally the theorem states:

'''Theorem 2'''
If &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lceil&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(1 - H(p + \epsilon)n)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rceil&lt;/math&gt; then the following is true for every [[Code|encoding]] and [[Code|decoding]] function &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; respectively: &lt;math&gt;Pr_{e \in BSC_p}&lt;/math&gt;[&lt;math&gt;D(E(m) + e)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\neq&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;m]&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a detailed proof of this theorem, the reader is asked to refer to the bibliography. The intuition behind the proof is however showing the number of errors to grow rapidly as the rate grows beyond the channel capacity. The idea is the sender generates messages of dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, while the channel &lt;math&gt;BSC_p&lt;/math&gt; introduces transmission errors. When the capacity of the channel is &lt;math&gt;H(p)&lt;/math&gt;, the number of errors is typically &lt;math&gt;2^{H(p + \epsilon)n}&lt;/math&gt; for a code of block length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The maximum number of messages is &lt;math&gt;2^{k}&lt;/math&gt;. The output of the channel on the other hand has &lt;math&gt;2^{n}&lt;/math&gt; possible values. If there is any confusion between any two messages, it is likely that &lt;math&gt;2^{k}2^{H(p + \epsilon)n} \ge 2^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we would have &lt;math&gt;k \geq \lceil (1 - H(p + \epsilon)n) \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, a case we would like to avoid to keep the decoding error probability exponentially small.

== Codes for BSC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ==
Very recently, a lot of work has been done and is also being done to design explicit error-correcting codes to achieve the capacities of several standard communication channels. The motivation behind designing such codes is to relate the rate of the code with the fraction of errors which it can correct.

The approach behind the design of codes which meet the channel capacities of &lt;math&gt;BSC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BEC&lt;/math&gt; have been to correct a lesser number of errors with a high probability, and to achieve the highest possible rate. Shannon's theorem gives us the best rate which could be achieved over a &lt;math&gt;BSC_{p}&lt;/math&gt;, but it does not give us an idea of any explicit codes which achieve that rate.  In fact such codes are typically constructed to correct only a small fraction of errors with a high probability, but achieve a very good rate. The first such code was due to George D. Forney in 1966. The code is a concatenated code by concatenating two different kinds of codes. We shall discuss the construction Forney's code for the Binary Symmetric Channel and analyze its rate and decoding error probability briefly here. Various explicit codes for achieving the capacity of the [[binary erasure channel]] have also come up recently.

== Forney's code for BSC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ==

Forney constructed a [[concatenated code]] &lt;math&gt;C^{*} = C_\text{out} \circ C_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; to achieve the capacity of Theorem 1 for &lt;math&gt;BSC_p&lt;/math&gt;. In his code,

* The outer code &lt;math&gt;C_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; is a code of block length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and rate &lt;math&gt;1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt; over the field &lt;math&gt;F_{2^k}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k = O(log N)&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally, we have a [[Code|decoding]] algorithm &lt;math&gt;D_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;C_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; which can correct up to &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; fraction of worst case errors and runs in &lt;math&gt;t_\text{out}(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.
* The inner code &lt;math&gt;C_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; is a code of block length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and a rate of &lt;math&gt;1 - H(p) - \frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.   Additionally, we have a decoding algorithm &lt;math&gt;D_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;C_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Code|decoding]] error probability of at most &lt;math&gt;\frac{\gamma}{2}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;BSC_p&lt;/math&gt; and runs in &lt;math&gt;t_\text{in}(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. 
 
For the outer code &lt;math&gt;C_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt;, a Reed-Solomon code would have been the first code to have come in mind. However, we would see that the construction of such a code cannot be done in polynomial time. This is why a [[binary linear code]] is used for &lt;math&gt;C_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the inner code &lt;math&gt;C_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; we find a [[linear code]] by exhaustively searching from the [[linear code]]  of block length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, whose rate meets the capacity of &lt;math&gt;BSC_p&lt;/math&gt;, by Theorem 1.

The rate &lt;math&gt;R(C^{*}) = R(C_\text{in}) \times R(C_\text{out}) = (1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}) ( 1 - H(p) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} ) \geq 1 - H(p)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; which almost meets the &lt;math&gt;BSC_p&lt;/math&gt; capacity. We further note that the encoding and decoding of  &lt;math&gt;C^{*}&lt;/math&gt; can be done in polynomial time with respect to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. As a matter of fact,  encoding &lt;math&gt;C^{*}&lt;/math&gt; takes time &lt;math&gt;O(N^{2})+O(Nk^{2}) = O(N^{2})&lt;/math&gt;. Further, the decoding algorithm described takes time &lt;math&gt;Nt_\text{in}(k) + t_\text{out}(N) = N^{O(1)} &lt;/math&gt; as long as &lt;math&gt;t_\text{out}(N) = N^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;t_\text{in}(k) = 2^{O(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Decoding error probability for ''C''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ===

A natural decoding algorithm for  &lt;math&gt;C^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is to:

* Assume &lt;math&gt;y_{i}^{\prime} = D_\text{in}(y_i), \quad i \in (0, N)&lt;/math&gt; 
* Execute &lt;math&gt;D_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime} = (y_1^{\prime} \ldots y_N^{\prime})&lt;/math&gt;

Note that each block of code for &lt;math&gt;C_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; is considered a symbol for &lt;math&gt;C_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt;. Now since the probability of error at any index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;D_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\gamma}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the errors in &lt;math&gt;BSC_p&lt;/math&gt; are independent, the expected number of errors for &lt;math&gt;D_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\gamma N}{2}&lt;/math&gt; by linearity of expectation. Now applying [[Chernoff bound]], we have bound error probability of more than &lt;math&gt;\gamma N&lt;/math&gt; errors occurring to be &lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-\gamma N}{6}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the outer code &lt;math&gt;C_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; can correct at most &lt;math&gt;\gamma N&lt;/math&gt; errors, this is the [[Code|decoding]] error probability of &lt;math&gt;C^{*}&lt;/math&gt;. This when expressed in asymptotic terms, gives us an error probability of &lt;math&gt;2^{-\Omega(\gamma N)}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the achieved decoding error probability of &lt;math&gt;C^{*}&lt;/math&gt;  is exponentially small as Theorem 1.

We have given a general technique to construct &lt;math&gt;C^{*}&lt;/math&gt;. For more detailed descriptions on &lt;math&gt;C_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C{out}&lt;/math&gt; please read the following references. Recently  a few other codes have also been constructed for achieving the capacities. [[LDPC]] codes have been considered for this purpose for their faster decoding time.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Urbanke&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''C-Thru Ruler Company''' is an [[United States|American]] maker of measuring devices and specialized products for drafting, designing and drawing. The company was formed in 1939 in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sliderulemuseum.com/MiscUSA.htm |title=Overview OEMs Rulers |publisher=sliderulemuseum.com}} Retrieved on December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; by Jennie R. Zachs, a schoolteacher, who saw the need for transparent measuring tools such as [[ruler]]s, [[triangle (drawing tool)|triangle]]s, [[curve (drawing tool)|curve]]s and [[protractor]]s.  

During the 1990s, the company expanded into the [[paper craft]]ing and [[scrapbooking]] fields under the Little Yellow Bicycle and Déjà Views brands.

In June 2012, [[Acme United Corporation]] bought the ruler, lettering and drafting portions of C-Thru Ruler. The scrap booking part of the business, continues to be managed by the Zachs family under the Little Yellow Bicycle Inc. name.

==History==

===Jennie Zachs===
Jennie R. Zachs, born in 1898, was the daughter of Benjamin and Julia Zachs who emigrated from [[Russia]] to the [[United States]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/hartfordcourant/obituary.aspx?n=jennie-r-zachs&amp;pid=712998&amp;fhid=4131 |title=Jennie R. Zachs - Obituary |publisher=legacy.com}} Retrieved on December 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from high school in [[Hartford, CT]]. A few years later, she graduated from college and became a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

While teaching, she developed the idea that when students would be able to see through their rulers, it would make the tool much more useful in the classroom. As a result, Ms. Zachs started the development of two transparent rulers made out of [[plastic]].

In 1939, she founded C-Thru Ruler Company in Bloomfield, Connecticut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/hartfordcourant/obituary.aspx?n=jennie-r-zachs&amp;pid=712998&amp;fhid=4131 |title=Jennie R. Zachs – Obituary |publisher=legacy.com}} Retrieved on December 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and designed a whole family of transparent measuring tools like [[ruler]]s, [[triangle (drawing tool)|triangle]]s, [[curve (drawing tool)|curve]]s and [[protractor]]s. Shortly after, she engaged a supplier to [[Milling machine|mill]] the tools out of plastic sheet and began to attend different [[trade show]]s and conventions for [[blue printer]]s and art materials dealers to sell the products. She noticed that the transparent measuring tools could effectively replace wood and metal measuring devices for many applications in drafting, designing and drawing.

===1940–1969===
Only one year after founding the company, Jennie Zachs took in two [[partner (business)|partner]]s to handle the expansion of C-Thru. Edward Zachs, her brother, joined C-Thru and Anna Zachs, her sister, became an investor.  On October 14, 1946, C-Thru Ruler Company was formally incorporated in Connecticut.

In 1957, Edward’s son, Ted also started working at the Company. The following years, [[sales representative]]s were hired and the products line was significantly expanded through a distribution arrangement with [[Letraset]], a manufacturer of dry transfer, rub on lettering and lettering tapes.

===1970–1989===
In 1970, Letraset decided to start selling its own line of transparent tools. In response thereto, C-Thru [[acquiration|acquire]]d a small manufacturer of dry transfer lettering products and started offering its own line of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] lettering. One year later, Ted Zachs bought out the other family members and became the sole shareholder of C-Thru.

In 1983, Jed Zachs, the son of Ted, joined the business and in 1985 another small acquisition was completed, which expanded the line of [[adhesive]] backed vinyl letters and [[stencil]]s for signage purposes.

===1990–2012===
In 1993, Ross Zachs, Ted Zachs’ younger son also became part of the company. Jed oversaw manufacturing and related operations, while Ross played a key role in the creative and marketing sides of the business.

The following year, C-Thru’s owners saw that scrapbooking was growing rapidly and decided to enter that market with a line of stencils, templates and rulers. In the same year, it also created the Deja Views brand and began to sell to hobby and craft dealers, primarily small independent stores and a few chains, including [[Michaels]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; which only had a handful of stores at that time.

To expand the design and paper crafting business, a new brand called Little Yellow Bicycle was launched in 2008 with a differentiated line for independent retailers.

In June 2012, the non-scrapbooking part of the business was sold to Acme United Corporation. Acme United purchased the [[inventory]], [[Tool management|tooling]], [[brand]]s, and other [[intellectual property]] for approximately $1.47 million. In 2011, revenues for the C-Thru Ruler part of the business reached about $2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120607006469/en/Acme-United-Corporation-Acquires-Assets-C-Thru-Ruler |title=Acme United Corporation Acquires Assets of the C-Thru Ruler Company |publisher=businesswire.com}} Retrieved on December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zachs family continued to focus on the design and paper crafting business under the Little Yellow Bicycle Inc. name with Ted Zachs as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littleyellowbicycle.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/06/an-announcement-from-little-yellow-bicycle.html |title=The C-Thru Ruler Company Sells Ruler, Lettering, and Drafting Business |publisher=littleyellowbicycle.typepad.com}} Retrieved on December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==C-Thru Ruler as Acme United Brand==
After the acquisition, the C-Thru products were gradually integrated into Acme United’s Westcott product family, which mainly consists of rulers, scissors and other school and office products. So, the identity of C-Thru in most cases has become Westcott.

The '''causal sets''' program is an approach to [[quantum gravity]]. Its founding principles are that [[spacetime]] is fundamentally discrete (a collection of discrete spacetime points, called the elements of the causal set) and that spacetime events are related by a [[partial order]]. This partial order has the physical meaning of the [[causality relation]]s between spacetime events.

The program is based on a theorem&lt;ref name="Malament"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malament|first1=David B.|title=The class of continuous timelike curves determines the topology of spacetime|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|date=July 1977|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1399–1404|doi=10.1063/1.523436|bibcode=1977JMP....18.1399M}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[David Malament]] that states that if there is a [[bijection|bijective]] map between two [[past and future distinguishing]] space times that preserves their [[causal structure]] then the map is a [[Conformal map|conformal isomorphism]]. The conformal factor that is left undetermined is related to the volume of regions in the spacetime. This volume factor can be recovered by specifying a volume element for each space time point. The volume of a space time region could then be found by counting the number of points in that region.

Causal sets was initiated by [[Rafael Sorkin]] who continues to be the main proponent of the program. He has coined the slogan "Order + Number = Geometry" to characterize the above argument. The program provides a theory in which space time is fundamentally discrete while retaining local [[Lorentz invariance]].

== Definition ==
A '''causal set''' (or '''causet''') is a set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with a [[partial order]] [[binary relation|relation]] &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; that is
* [[Reflexive relation|Reflexive]]: For all &lt;math&gt;x \in C&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; x \preceq x &lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Antisymmetric relation|Antisymmetric]]: For all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in C&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \preceq x&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Transitive relation|Transitive]]: For all &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in C&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \preceq z &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; x \preceq z &lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Locally finite poset|Locally finite]]: For all &lt;math&gt;x, z \in C&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|\{y \in C | x \preceq y \preceq z\}| &lt; \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.

We'll write &lt;math&gt;x \prec y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt;.

The set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of [[Event (relativity)|spacetime event]]s and the order relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; represents the causal relationship between events (see [[causal structure]] for the analogous idea in a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian manifold]]).

Although this definition uses the reflexive convention we could have chosen the irreflexive convention in which the order relation is [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]]. The [[causal relation]] of a [[Lorentzian manifold]] (without closed [[causal curve]]s) satisfies the first three conditions. It is the local finiteness condition that introduces spacetime discreteness.

== Comparison to the continuum ==

Given a causal set we may ask whether it can be [[embedding|embedded]] into a [[Lorentzian manifold]]. An embedding would be a map taking elements of the causal set into points in the manifold such that the order relation of the causal set matches the causal ordering of the manifold. A further criterion is needed however before the embedding is suitable. If, on average, the number of causal set elements mapped into a region of the manifold is proportional to the volume of the region then the embedding is said to be ''faithful''. In this case we can consider the causal set to be 'manifold-like'

A central conjecture to the causal set program is that the same causal set cannot be faithfully embedded into two spacetimes that are not similar on large scales. This is called the ''[[Hauptvermutung]]'', meaning 'fundamental conjecture'. It is difficult to define this conjecture precisely because it is difficult to decide when two spacetimes are 'similar on large scales'.

Modelling spacetime as a causal set would require us to restrict attention to those causal sets that are 'manifold-like'. Given a causal set this is a difficult property to determine.

=== Sprinkling ===

[[File:CausalSet(1000Points).png|right|thumb|A plot of 1000 sprinkled points in 1+1 dimensions]]
The difficulty of determining whether a causal set can be embedded into a manifold can be approached from the other direction. We can create a causal set by sprinkling points into a Lorentzian manifold. By sprinkling points in proportion to the volume of the spacetime regions and using the causal order relations in the manifold to induce order relations between the sprinkled points, we can produce a causal set that (by construction) can be faithfully embedded into the manifold.

To maintain Lorentz invariance this sprinkling of points must be done randomly using a [[Poisson process]]. Thus the probability of sprinkling &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points into a region of volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;P(n) = \frac{(\rho V)^n e^{-\rho V}}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the sprinkling.

Sprinkling points as a regular lattice would not keep the number of points proportional to the region volume.

== Geometry ==

Some geometrical constructions in manifolds carry over to causal sets. When defining these we must remember to rely only on the causal set itself, not on any background spacetime into which it might be embedded. For an overview of these constructions, see.&lt;ref name=Brightwell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brightwell |first1=Graham |last2=Gregory |first2=Ruth |title=Structure of random discrete spacetime |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=21 January 1991 |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=260–263 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.260|pmid=10043761 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..66..260B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodesics ===

[[File:CausalSet180Geodesic.png|right|thumb|A plot of geodesics between two points in a 180-point causal set made by sprinkling into 1+1 dimensions]]

A ''link'' in a causal set is a pair of elements &lt;math&gt;x, y \in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \prec y&lt;/math&gt; but with no &lt;math&gt;z \in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \prec z \prec y&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''chain'' is a sequence of elements &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i \prec x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=0,\ldots,n-1&lt;/math&gt;. The length of a chain is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
If every &lt;math&gt;x_i, x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; in the chain form a link, then the chain is called a ''path''.

We can use this to define the notion of a [[geodesic]] between two causal set elements, provided they are order comparable, that is, causally connected (physically, this means they are time-like).  A geodesic between two elements &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y \in C&lt;/math&gt; is a chain consisting only of links such that
# &lt;math&gt;x_0 = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n = y&lt;/math&gt;
# The length of the chain, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is maximal over all chains from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
In general there can be more than one geodesic between two comparable elements.

Myrheim&lt;ref name='Myrhiem'&gt;J. Myrheim, [http://doc.cern.ch//archive/electronic/kek-scan//197808143.pdf CERN preprint] TH-2538 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; first suggested that the length of such a geodesic should be directly proportional to the proper time along a timelike geodesic joining the two spacetime points. Tests of this conjecture have been made using causal sets generated from sprinklings into flat spacetimes. The proportionality has been shown to hold and is conjectured to hold for sprinklings in curved spacetimes too.

=== Dimension estimators ===

Much work has been done in estimating the manifold [[dimension]] of a causal set. This involves algorithms using the causal set aiming to give the dimension of the manifold into which it can be faithfully embedded. The algorithms developed so far are based on finding the dimension of a [[Minkowski spacetime]] into which the causal set can be faithfully embedded.

*'''Myrheim-Meyer dimension'''
This approach relies on estimating the number of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-length chains present in a sprinkling into &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Counting the number of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-length chains in the causal set then allows an estimate for &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to be made.

*'''Midpoint-scaling dimension'''
This approach relies on the relationship between the proper time between two points in Minkowski spacetime and the volume of the [[Spacetime#Spacetime intervals|spacetime interval]] between them. By computing the maximal chain length (to estimate the proper time) between two points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and counting the number of elements &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \prec z \prec y&lt;/math&gt; (to estimate the volume of the spacetime interval) the dimension of the spacetime can be calculated.

These estimators should give the correct dimension for causal sets generated by high-density sprinklings into &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Tests in conformally-flat spacetimes&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reid |first1=David D. |title=Manifold dimension of a causal set: Tests in conformally flat spacetimes |journal=Physical Review D |date=30 January 2003 |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=024034 |arxiv=gr-qc/0207103 |bibcode= 2003PhRvD..67b4034R|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.67.024034}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown these two methods to be accurate.

== Dynamics ==

An ongoing task is to develop the correct [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] for causal sets. These would provide a set of rules that determine which causal sets correspond to physically realistic [[spacetime]]s. The most popular approach to developing causal set dynamics is based on the ''[[sum-over-histories]]'' version of [[quantum mechanics]]. This approach would perform a "sum-over-causal sets" by ''growing'' a causal set one element at a time. Elements would be added according to quantum mechanical rules and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] would ensure a large manifold-like spacetime would dominate the contributions. The best model for dynamics at the moment is a classical model in which elements are added according to probabilities. This model, due to David Rideout and [[Rafael Sorkin]], is known as ''classical sequential growth'' (CSG) dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rideout |first1=D. P. |last2=Sorkin |first2=R. D. |title=Classical sequential growth dynamics for causal sets |journal=Physical Review D |date=13 December 1999 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=024002 |arxiv=gr-qc/9904062 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.61.024002|bibcode=2000PhRvD..61b4002R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical sequential growth model is a way to generate causal sets by adding new elements one after another. Rules for how new elements are added are specified and, depending on the parameters in the model, different causal sets result.

In analogy to the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics, one approach to developing a quantum dynamics for causal sets has been to apply an [[action principle]] in the sum-over-causal sets approach. Sorkin has proposed a discrete analogue for the [[d'Alembertian]], which can in turn be used to define the [[Ricci curvature scalar]] and thereby the ''Benincasa-Dowker action'' on a causal set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last=Sorkin |first=D. P. |title=Does Locality Fail at Intermediate Length-Scales  |date=20 March 2007 |eprint=gr-qc/0703099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benincasa |first1=D. M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">[[File:Matrix symmetry qtl4.svg|thumb|Symmetry pattern of a centrosymmetric 5×5 matrix]]
In [[mathematics]], especially in [[linear algebra]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]], a '''centrosymmetric matrix''' is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which is symmetric about its center. More precisely, an ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''A'' = [ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; ] is centrosymmetric when its entries satisfy

:''A''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n−i+1,n−j+1&lt;/sub&gt; for 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n.

If ''J'' denotes the ''n'' × ''n'' matrix with 1 on the counterdiagonal and 0 elsewhere (that is, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;i,n+1-i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1; ''J''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 if j ≠ n+1-i), then a matrix ''A'' is centrosymmetric if and only if ''AJ = JA''.  The matrix ''J'' is sometimes referred to as the [[exchange matrix]].

==Examples==

* All 2×2 centrosymmetric matrices have the form
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ b &amp; a \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

* All 3×3 centrosymmetric matrices have the form
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; d \\ c &amp; b &amp; a \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

* [[Symmetric matrix|Symmetric]] [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz]] matrices are centrosymmetric.

==Algebraic structure==
If ''A'' and ''B'' are centrosymmetric matrices over a given [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', then so are ''A+B'' and ''cA'' for any ''c'' in ''K''. In addition, the [[matrix product]] ''AB'' is centrosymmetric, since ''JAB = AJB = ABJ''. Since the [[identity matrix]] is also centrosymmetric, it follows that the set of ''n × n'' centrosymmetric matrices over ''K'' is a subalgebra of the [[associative algebra]] of all ''n × n'' matrices.

==Related structures==
An ''n × n'' matrix ''A'' is said to be ''skew-centrosymmetric'' if its entries satisfy ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; = -''A''&lt;sub&gt;n−i+1,n−j+1&lt;/sub&gt; for 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n. Equivalently, ''A'' is skew-centrosymmetric if ''AJ = -JA'', where ''J'' is the exchange matrix defined above.

The centrosymmetric relation ''AJ = JA'' lends itself to a natural generalization, where ''J'' is replaced with an [[involutory matrix]] ''K'' (i.e., ''K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = I'')&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0024-3795(73)90049-9|first=A. |last=Andrew|title= Eigenvectors of certain matrices|journal= Linear Algebra Appl.| volume= 7 |year=1973|issue=2|pages=151–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symmetric matrix|Symmetric]] centrosymmetric matrices are sometimes called [[bisymmetric matrix|bisymmetric matrices]].  When the [[Field (mathematics)|ground field]] is the field of [[real numbers]], it has been shown that bisymmetric matrices are precisely those symmetric matrices whose [[eigenvalues]] are the same up to sign after pre or post multiplication by the exchange matrix.&lt;ref name = "simax0"/&gt;  A similar result holds for Hermitian centrosymmetric and skew-centrosymmetric matrices.&lt;ref name="simax1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yasuda | first = M. | title = A Spectral Characterization of Hermitian Centrosymmetric and Hermitian Skew-Centrosymmetric K-Matrices | journal = SIAM J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5449">A '''conditional event algebra''' ('''CEA''') is an [[algebraic structure]] whose domain consists of logical objects described by statements of forms such as "If ''A'', then ''B''", "''B'', given ''A''", and "''B'', in case ''A''". Unlike the standard [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of events, a CEA allows the defining of a [[probability function]], ''P'', which satisfies the equation ''P''(If ''A'' then ''B'') = ''P''(''A'' and ''B'') / ''P''(''A'') over a usefully broad range of conditions.

In [[probability theory|standard probability theory]], one begins with a set, Ω, of outcomes (or, in alternate terminology, a set of [[possible worlds]]) and a set, ''F'', of some (not necessarily all) subsets of Ω, such that ''F'' is closed under the [[Countable|countably infinite]] versions of the operations of [[Set (mathematics)|basic set theory]]: union (∪), intersection (∩), and complementation ( &amp;prime;). A member of ''F'' is called an event (or, alternatively, a [[Propositional calculus|proposition]]), and ''F'', the set of events, is the domain of the algebra. Ω is, necessarily, a member of ''F'', namely the trivial event "Some outcome occurs."

A probability function ''P'' assigns to each member of ''F'' a real number, in such a way as to satisfy the following [[probability axioms|axioms]]:

: For any event ''E'', ''P''(''E'') ≥ 0.

: ''P''(Ω) = 1

: For any [[countable]] sequence ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... of pairwise disjoint events (meaning that each event is disjoint with every other event), ''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ...) = ''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ....

It follows that ''P''(''E'') is always less than or equal to 1. The probability function is the basis for statements like ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B''&amp;prime;) = 0.73, which means, "The probability that ''A'' but not ''B'' is 73%."

==Conditional probabilities and probabilities of conditionals==

The statement "The probability that if ''A'', then ''B'', is 24%." means (put intuitively) that event ''B'' occurs in 24% of the outcomes where event ''A'' occurs. The standard formal expression of this is ''P''(''B''|''A'') = 0.24, where the [[conditional probability]] ''P''(''B''|''A'') equals, by definition, ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') / ''P''(''A'').

It is tempting to write, instead, ''P''(''A'' → ''B'') = 0.24, where ''A'' → ''B'' is the conditional event "If ''A'', then ''B''". That is, given events ''A'' and ''B'', one might posit an event, ''A'' → ''B'', such that ''P''(''A'' → ''B'') could be counted on to equal ''P''(''B''|''A''). One benefit of being able to refer to conditional events would be the opportunity to nest conditional event descriptions within larger constructions. Then, for instance, one could write ''P''(''A'' ∪ (''B'' → ''C'')) = 0.51, meaning, "The probability that either ''A'', or else if ''B'', then ''C'', is 51%".

Unfortunately, philosopher [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] showed that in orthodox probability theory, only certain trivial Boolean algebras with very few elements contain, for any given ''A'' and ''B'', an event ''X'' such that ''P''(''X'') = ''P''(''B''|''A'') is true for any probability function ''P''. Later extended by others, this result stands as a major obstacle to any talk about logical objects that can be the bearers of conditional probabilities.

==The construction of conditional event algebras==

The classification of an algebra makes no reference to the nature of the objects in the domain, being entirely a matter of the formal behavior of the operations on the domain. However, investigation of the properties of an algebra often proceeds by assuming the objects to have a particular character. Thus, the canonical Boolean algebra is, as described above, an algebra of subsets of a universe set. What Lewis in effect showed is what can and cannot be done with an algebra whose members behave like members of such a set of subsets.

Conditional event algebras circumvent the obstacle identified by Lewis by using a nonstandard domain of objects. Instead of being members of a set ''F'' of subsets of some universe set Ω, the canonical objects are normally higher-level constructions of members of ''F.'' The most natural construction, and historically the first, uses ordered pairs of members of ''F.'' Other constructions use sets of members of ''F'' or infinite sequences of members of ''F''.

Specific types of CEA include the following (listed in order of discovery):

: Shay algebras
: Calabrese algebras
: [[Goodman-Nguyen-van Fraassen algebra]]s
: Goodman-Nguyen-Walker algebras

CEAs differ in their formal properties, so that they cannot be considered a single, axiomatically characterized class of algebra. Goodman-Nguyen-van Frassen algebras, for example, are Boolean while Calabrese algebras are non-[[Distributive lattice|distributive]]. The latter, however, support the intuitively appealing identity ''A'' → (''B'' → ''C'') = (''A'' ∩ ''B'') → ''C'', while the former do not.

In [[conformal geometry]], the '''conformal Killing equation''' on a [[manifold]] of space-[[dimension]] ''n'' with [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; describes those vector fields &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which preserve &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; up to scale, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{X}g = \lambda g&lt;/math&gt;
for some function &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]]). Vector fields that satisfy the conformal Killing equation are exactly those vector fields whose [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] preserves the conformal structure of the manifold.  The name Killing refers to [[Wilhelm Killing]], who first investigated the [[Killing equation]] for vector fields that preserve a Riemannian metric.

By taking the trace we find that necessarily &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{2}{n}\mathrm{div}X&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we can write the conformal Killing equation as
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathcal{L}_X - \frac{2\, \mathrm{div}\, X}{n}\right)g=0.&lt;/math&gt;
In abstract indices,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{(a}X_{b)} -\frac{2}{n}g_{ab}\nabla_{c}X^{c}=0,&lt;/math&gt;
where the round brackets denote symmetrization.

For any {{mvar|n}} but 2, there is a finite number of solutions, specifying the [[conformal symmetry]] of that space, but in two dimensions, there is an [[Conformal_field_theory#Two_dimensions|infinity of solutions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16556">{{about||contraposition in the field of traditional logic|Contraposition (traditional logic)|contraposition in the field of symbolic logic|Transposition (logic)}}

In [[logic]], '''contraposition''' is an [[inference]] that says that a [[Conditional sentence|conditional statement]] is [[logically equivalent]] to its '''contrapositive'''. The contrapositive of the statement has its  [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[consequent]] [[Inverse (logic)|inverted]] and [[Conversion (logic)|flipped]]: the contrapositive of &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is thus &lt;math&gt; \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P &lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the proposition "''All cats are mammals''" can be restated as the conditional "''If something is a cat, then it is a mammal''". The law of contraposition says that statement is identical to the contrapositive "''If something is not a mammal, then it is not a cat''."

The contrapositive can be compared with three other relationships between conditional statements:

;'''[[Inverse (logic)|Inversion]]''' (the '''inverse'''),  &lt;math&gt;\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q&lt;/math&gt;: "''If something is not a cat, then it is not a mammal''." Unlike the contrapositive, the inverse's [[truth value]] is not at all dependent on whether or not the original proposition was true, as evidenced here. The inverse here is clearly not true.
;'''[[Converse (logic)|Conversion]]''' (the '''converse'''), &lt;math&gt;Q \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;: "''If something is a mammal, then it is a cat''." The converse is actually the contrapositive of the inverse and so always has the same truth value as the inverse, which is not necessarily the same as that of the original proposition.
;'''[[Negation]]''', &lt;math&gt;\neg (P \rightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt;: "''There exists a cat that is not a mammal''. " If the negation is true, the original proposition (and by extension the contrapositive) is false. Here, of course, the negation is false.

Note that if &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is true and we are given that ''Q'' is false, &lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;, it can logically be concluded that ''P'' must be false, &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;. This is often called the ''law of contrapositive'', or the ''[[modus tollens]]'' [[rule of inference]].

==Intuitive explanation==

[[File:Venn A subset B.svg|thumb|right|]]

Consider the [[Euler diagram]] shown. According to this diagram, if something is in A, it must be in B as well. So we can interpret "all of A is in B" as:

:&lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;

It is also clear that anything that is '''not''' within B (the blue region) '''cannot''' be within A, either. This statement,

:&lt;math&gt;\neg B \to \neg A&lt;/math&gt;

is the contrapositive. Therefore, we can say that

:&lt;math&gt;(A \to B) \to (\neg B \to \neg A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Practically speaking, this makes trying to prove something easier. For example, if we want to prove that every girl in the United States (A) has brown hair (B), we can try to directly prove &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt; by checking all girls in the United States to see if they all have brown hair. Alternatively, we can try to prove &lt;math&gt;\neg B \to \neg A&lt;/math&gt; by checking all girls without brown hair to see if they are all outside the US. This means that if we find at least one girl without brown hair within the US, we will have disproved &lt;math&gt;\neg B \to \neg A&lt;/math&gt;, and equivalently &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;.

To conclude, for any statement where A implies B, then ''not B'' always implies ''not A''. Proving or disproving either one of these statements automatically proves or disproves the other. They are fully equivalent.

==Formal definition==

A proposition ''Q'' is implicated by a proposition ''P'' when the following relationship holds:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \to Q)&lt;/math&gt;

This states that, "if ''P'', then ''Q''", or, "if ''Socrates is a man'', then ''Socrates is human''." In a conditional such as this, ''P'' is the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]], and ''Q'' is the [[consequent]]. One statement is the '''contrapositive''' of the other only when its antecedent is the [[Negation|negated]] consequent of the other, and vice versa. The contrapositive of the example is

:&lt;math&gt;(\neg Q \to \neg P)&lt;/math&gt;.

That is, "If not-''Q'', then not-''P''", or, more clearly, "If ''Q'' is not the case, then ''P'' is not the case." Using our example, this is rendered "If ''Socrates is not human'', then ''Socrates is not a man''." This statement is said to be ''contraposed'' to the original and is logically equivalent to it. Due to their logical equivalence, stating one effectively states the other; when one is [[Truth value|true]], the other is also true. Likewise with falsity.

Strictly speaking, a contraposition can only exist in two simple conditionals. However, a contraposition may also exist in two complex conditionals, if they are similar. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\forall{x}(P{x} \to Q{x})&lt;/math&gt;, or "All ''P''s are ''Q''s," is contraposed to &lt;math&gt;\forall{x}(\neg Q{x} \to \neg P{x})&lt;/math&gt;, or "All non-''Q''s are non-''P''s."

==Simple proof by definition of a conditional==

In [[first-order logic]], the conditional is defined as: 

:&lt;math&gt;A \to B \iff \neg A \lor B&lt;/math&gt;

We have:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\neg A \lor B &amp;\iff B \lor \neg A \\
             &amp;\iff \neg B \to \neg A
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple proof by contradiction==

Let:

:&lt;math&gt;(A \to B)\land \neg B&lt;/math&gt;

It is given that, if A is true, then B is true, and it is also given that B is not true. We can then show that A must not be true by contradiction. For, if A were true, then B would have to also be true (given). However, it is given that B is not true, so we have a contradiction. Therefore, A is not true (assuming that we are dealing with concrete statements that are either true or not true):

:&lt;math&gt;(A \to B) \to (\neg B \to \neg A)&lt;/math&gt;

We can apply the same process the other way round:

:&lt;math&gt;(\neg B \to \neg A)\land A&lt;/math&gt;

We also know that B is either true or not true. If B is not true, then A is also not true. However, it is given that A is true; so, the assumption that B is not true leads to contradiction and must be false. Therefore, B must be true:

:&lt;math&gt;(\neg B \to \neg A) \to (A \to B)&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the two proved statements makes them logically equivalent:

:&lt;math&gt;(A \to B) \iff (\neg B \to \neg A)&lt;/math&gt;

==More rigorous proof of the equivalence of contrapositives==

Logical equivalence between two propositions means that they are true together or false together. To prove that contrapositives are [[logically equivalent]], we need to understand when material implication is true or false.

:&lt;math&gt;(P \to Q)&lt;/math&gt;

This is only false when ''P'' is true and ''Q'' is false. Therefore, we can reduce this proposition to the statement "False when ''P'' and not-''Q''" (i.e. "True when it is not the case that ''P'' and not-''Q''"):

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] can be reversed with no effect (by [[commutativity]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(\neg Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;

We define &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as equal to "&lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;", and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as equal to &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (from this, &lt;math&gt;\neg S&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg P&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to just &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(R \land \neg S)&lt;/math&gt;

This reads "It is not the case that (''R'' is true and ''S'' is false)", which is the definition of a material conditional. We can then make this substitution:

:&lt;math&gt;(R \to S)&lt;/math&gt;

When we swap our definitions of ''R'' and ''S'', we arrive at the following:

:&lt;math&gt;(\neg Q \to \neg P)&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===
Take the statement "''All red objects have color.''" This can be equivalently expressed as "''If an object is red, then it has color.''"

* The '''contrapositive''' is "''If an object does not have color, then it is not red.''" This follows logically from our initial statement and, like it, it is evidently true.
* The '''inverse''' is "''If an object is not red, then it does not have color.''" An object which is blue is not red, and still has color. Therefore, in this case the inverse is false.
* The '''converse''' is "''If an object has color, then it is red.''" Objects can have other colors, of course, so, the converse of our statement is false.
* The '''negation''' is "''There exists a red object that does not have color.''" This statement is false because the initial statement which it negates is true.

In other words, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to a given [[Material conditional|conditional]] statement, though not sufficient for a [[biconditional]].

Similarly, take the statement "''All [[quadrilaterals]] have four sides,''" or equivalently expressed "''If a polygon is a quadrilateral, then it has four sides.''"
* The '''contrapositive''' is "''If a polygon does not have four sides, then it is not a quadrilateral.''" This follows logically, and as a rule, contrapositives share the [[truth value]] of their conditional.
* The '''inverse''' is "''If a polygon is not a quadrilateral, then it does not have four sides.''" In this case, unlike the last example, the inverse of the argument is true.
* The '''converse''' is "''If a polygon has four sides, then it is a quadrilateral.''" Again, in this case, unlike the last example, the converse of the argument is true.
* The '''negation''' is "''There is at least one quadrilateral that does not have four sides.''" This statement is clearly false.

Since the statement and the converse are both true, it is called a [[biconditional]], and can be expressed as "'''A polygon is a quadrilateral ''if, and only if,'' it has four sides.'''" (The phrase ''if and only if'' is sometimes abbreviated ''iff''.) That is, having four sides is both necessary to be a quadrilateral, and alone sufficient to deem it a quadrilateral.

===Truth===
* If a statement is true, then its contrapositive is true (and vice versa).
* If a statement is false, then its contrapositive is false (and vice versa).
* If a statement's inverse is true, then its converse is true (and vice versa).
* If a statement's inverse is false, then its converse is false (and vice versa).
* If a statement's negation is false, then the statement is true (and vice versa).
* If a statement (or its contrapositive) and the inverse (or the converse) are both true or both false, it is known as a [[logical biconditional]].

==Application==
Because the '''contrapositive''' of a statement always has the same truth value (truth or falsity) as the statement itself, it can be a powerful tool for proving mathematical [[theorem]]s. A [[Proof by contrapositive|proof by contraposition (contrapositive)]] is a [[direct proof]] of the contrapositive of a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Douglas|last1=Smith|first2=Maurice|last2=Eggen|first3=Richard|last3=St. Andre|title=A Transition to Advanced Mathematics|year=2001|publisher=Brooks/Cole|edition=5th|isbn=0-534-38214-2|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, indirect methods such as [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]] can also be used with contraposition, as, for example, in the proof of the irrationality of the [[square root of 2]]. By the definition of a [[rational number]], the statement can be made that "''If &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is rational, then it can be expressed as an [[irreducible fraction]]''". This statement is '''true''' because it is a restatement of a definition. The contrapositive of this statement is "''If &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed as an irreducible fraction, then it is not rational''". This contrapositive, like the original statement, is also '''true'''. Therefore, if it can be proven that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed as an irreducible fraction, then it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not a rational number. The latter can be proved by contradiction.

The previous example employed the contrapositive of a definition to prove a theorem. One can also prove a theorem by proving the contrapositive of the theorem's statement. To prove that ''if a positive integer ''N'' is a [[square number|non-square number]], its square root is irrational'', we can equivalently prove its contrapositive, that ''if a positive integer ''N'' has a square root that is rational, then ''N'' is a square number.'' This can be shown by setting {{radic|''N''}} equal to the rational expression ''a/b'' with ''a'' and ''b'' being positive integers with no common prime factor, and squaring to obtain ''N'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and noting that since ''N'' is a positive integer ''b''=1 so that ''N'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a square number.

==Correspondence to other mathematical frameworks==
===Probability calculus===
''Contraposition'' represents an instance of [[Bayes' theorem]] which in a specific form can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\lnot P\mid \lnot Q) = \frac{\Pr(\lnot Q \mid \lnot P)\,a(\lnot P)}{\Pr(\lnot Q\mid \lnot P)\,a(\lnot P)+\Pr(\lnot Q\mid P)\,a(P)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the equation above the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;\Pr(\lnot Q\mid P)&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the logical statement &lt;math&gt;P \to \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. in addition to assigning TRUE or FALSE we can also assign any probability to the statement. The term &lt;math&gt;a(P)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[base rate]] (aka. the [[prior probability]]) of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\Pr(\lnot Q \mid P) = 1&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;P\to \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt; being TRUE, and that &lt;math&gt;\Pr(\lnot Q \mid P) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;P \to \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt; being FALSE.  It is then easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\Pr(\lnot P \mid \lnot Q) = 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\Pr(Q\mid P) = 1&lt;/math&gt; i.e. when &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt; is TRUE. This is because &lt;math&gt;\Pr(\lnot Q\mid P) = 1 - \Pr(Q\mid P) = 0&lt;/math&gt; so that the fraction on the right-hand side of the equation above is equal to 1, and hence &lt;math&gt;\Pr(\lnot P\mid \lnot Q) = 1&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to  &lt;math&gt;\lnot Q \to \lnot P&lt;/math&gt; being TRUE. Hence, [[Bayes' theorem]] represents a generalization of ''contraposition'' &lt;ref&gt;Audun Jøsang 2016:2&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Subjective logic===
''Contraposition'' represents an instance of the subjective Bayes' theorem in [[subjective logic]] expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;(\omega^{A}_{P\tilde{|}Q},\omega^{A}_{P\tilde{|}\lnot Q}) = (\omega^{A}_{Q|P},\omega^{A}_{Q|\lnot P})\,\widetilde{\phi\,}\, a_{P}\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;(\omega^{A}_{Q|P},\omega^{A}_{Q|\lnot P})&lt;/math&gt; denotes a pair of binomial conditional opinions, as expressed by source &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;a_{P}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[base rate]] (aka. the [[prior probability]]) of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. The pair of inverted conditional opinions is denoted &lt;math&gt;(\omega^{A}_{P\tilde{|}Q},\omega^{A}_{P\tilde{|}\lnot Q})&lt;/math&gt;. The conditional opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega^{A}_{Q|P}&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the logical statement &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. in addition to assigning TRUE or FALSE the source &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can assign any subjective opinion to the statement. The case where &lt;math&gt;\omega^{A}_{Q\mid P}&lt;/math&gt; is an absolute TRUE opinion is equivalent to source &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; saying that &lt;math&gt;P\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is TRUE, and the case where &lt;math&gt;\omega^{A}_{Q\mid P}&lt;/math&gt; is an absolute FALSE opinion is equivalent to source &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; saying that &lt;math&gt;P\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is FALSE.  In the case when the conditional opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega^{A}_{Q|P}&lt;/math&gt; is absolute TRUE the subjective Bayes' theorem operator &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\phi\,}&lt;/math&gt; of [[subjective logic]] produces an absolute FALSE conditional opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega^{A}_{P\widetilde{|}\lnot Q}&lt;/math&gt; and thereby an absolute TRUE conditional opinion &lt;math&gt;\omega^{A}_{\lnot P\widetilde{|}\lnot Q}&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lnot Q \to \lnot P&lt;/math&gt; being TRUE. Hence, the subjective Bayes' theorem represents a generalization of both ''contraposition'' and [[Bayes' theorem]] &lt;ref&gt;Audun Jøsang 2016:92&lt;/ref&gt;.

Scott: ''Group Theory'', Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; states that if  &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normal subgroup]] of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a [[bijection]] from the set of all [[subgroups]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, onto the set of all subgroups of the [[quotient group]] &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt;.  The structure of the subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt; is exactly the same as the structure of the subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; collapsed to the [[identity element]].

Specifically, if 
:''G'' is a group, 
:''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'', 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all subgroups ''A'' of ''G'' such that &lt;math&gt;N\subseteq A\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;, and 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all subgroups of ''G/N'', 
then there is a bijective map &lt;math&gt;\phi:\mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(A)=A/N&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal{G}.&lt;/math&gt;

One further has that if ''A'' and ''B'' are in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, and ''A' = A/N'' and ''B' = B/N'', then
*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A' \subseteq B'&lt;/math&gt;;
*if &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|B:A| = |B':A'|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;|B:A|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[index (group theory)|index]] of ''A'' in ''B'' (the number of [[coset]]s ''bA'' of ''A'' in ''B'');
*&lt;math&gt;\langle A,B\rangle / N = \langle A',B' \rangle,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\langle A,B \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by  &lt;math&gt;A\cup B;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(A\cap B)/N = A' \cap B'&lt;/math&gt;, and 
* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt;.

This list is far from exhaustive. In fact, most properties of subgroups are preserved in their images under the bijection onto subgroups of a quotient group.

More generally, there is a [[Galois_connection|monotone Galois connection]] &lt;math&gt;(f^*,f_*)&lt;/math&gt; between the [[lattice of subgroups]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily containing &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) and the lattice of subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt;: the lower adjoint of a subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;f^*(H)=HN/N&lt;/math&gt; and the upper adjoint of a subgroup &lt;math&gt;K/N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt; is a given by &lt;math&gt;f_*(K/N)=K&lt;/math&gt;. The associated [[closure operator]] on subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\bar H = HN&lt;/math&gt;; the associated [[kernel operator]] on subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt; is the identity.

&lt;!-- This needs to be expanded to include rings, etc. --&gt;
Similar results hold for [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]].

In [[cryptography]], '''DEAL''' ('''Data Encryption Algorithm with Larger blocks''') is a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric]] [[block cipher]] derived from the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES). The design was proposed in a report by [[Lars Knudsen]] in 1998, and was submitted to the [[AES contest]] by [[Richard Outerbridge]] (who notes that Knudsen had presented the design at the [[Selected Areas in Cryptography|SAC]] conference in 1997).

DEAL is a [[Feistel network]] which uses [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] as the round function. It has a 128-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] and a variable [[key size]] of either 128, 192, or 256 bits. For key sizes of 128 and 192 bits, the cipher uses 6 rounds, increasing to 8 for the 256-bits size. The scheme has a comparable performance to [[Triple DES]], and was relatively slow compared to many other AES candidates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7511">A quantum cryptographic protocol is '''device-independent''' if its security does not rely on trusting that the quantum devices used are truthful.
Thus the security analysis of such a protocol needs to consider scenarios of imperfect or even malicious devices. Several important problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols. A closely related topic (that is not discussed in this article) is measurement-device independent quantum key distribution.

==Overview and History==
Mayers and Yao&lt;ref name="MayersYao"/&gt; proposed the idea of designing quantum protocols using "self-testing" quantum apparatus, the internal operations of which can be uniquely determined by their input-output statistics. Subsequently, Roger Colbeck in his Thesis&lt;ref name="Colbeck-Thesis"/&gt; proposed the use of [[Bell tests]] for checking the honesty of the devices. Since then, several problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols, even when the actual devices performing the Bell test are substantially "noisy," i.e., far from being ideal. These problems include
[[quantum key distribution]],&lt;ref name="VV-QKD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MillerShi"/&gt;  [[randomness expansion]],&lt;ref name="MillerShi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MillerShi-Universal"/&gt; and [[randomness amplification]].&lt;ref name="ChungShiWu"/&gt;

==Device-independent quantum key distribution==
{{Expand section|1=significant works between the Colbeck thesis and the full security proofs|date=February 2015}}

The goal of [[quantum key distribution]] is for two parties, Alice and Bob, to share a common secret string through communications over public channels. This was a problem of central interest in quantum cryptography. It was also the motivating problem in Mayers and Yao's paper.&lt;ref name="MayersYao"/&gt; A long sequence of works aim to prove unconditional security with robustness.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Vazirani and Vidick&lt;ref name="VV-QKD"/&gt; were the first to reach this goal. Subsequently, Miller and Shi&lt;ref name="MillerShi"/&gt; proved a similar result using a different approach.

==Randomness expansion==
{{Expand section|1=unbounded expansion|date=February 2015}}

The goal of '''randomness expansion''' is to generate a longer private random string starting from a uniform input string and using untrusted quantum devices. The idea of using [[Bell test]] to achieve this goal was first proposed by Roger Colbeck in his Ph.D. Thesis.&lt;ref name="Colbeck-Thesis"/&gt; Subsequent works have aimed to prove unconditional security with robustness and the increase the rate of expansion. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Vazrani and Vidick were the first to prove full quantum security for an exponentially expanding protocol.&lt;ref name="VV-expansion"/&gt;
Miller and Shi&lt;ref name="MillerShi"/&gt; achieved several additional features, including cryptographic level security, robustness, and a single-qubit requirement on the quantum memory. 
The approach was subsequently extended by the same authors to show that the noise level can approach the obvious upper bound, when the output may become deterministic.&lt;ref name="MillerShi-Universal"/&gt;

==Randomness amplification==
{{Expand section|1=physical interpretations|date=February 2015}}

The goal of '''randomness amplification''' is to generate near-perfect randomness (approximating a fair coin toss) starting from a single source of weak randomness (a coin each of whose tosses is somewhat unpredictable, though it may be biased and correlated with previous tosses). This is known to be impossible classically.&lt;ref name=santha-vazirani&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by using quantum devices, it becomes possible even if the devices are untrusted. Roger Colbeck and Renato Renner were motivated by physics considerations to ask the question first.&lt;ref name="ColbeckRenner"/&gt; Their construction and the subsequent improvement by Gallego et al.&lt;ref name="Gallego+"/&gt; are secure against a [[non-signalling]] adversary, and have significant physical interpretations.
The first construction that does not require any structural assumptions on the weak source is due to Chung, Shi, and Wu.&lt;ref name="ChungShiWu"/&gt;

'''Discount points''', also called '''mortgage points''' or simply '''points''', are a form of pre-paid [[interest]] available in the United States when arranging a [[mortgage]]. One point equals one percent of the [[loan]] amount. By charging a borrower points, a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the amount of the stated [[interest rate]].  Borrowers can offer to pay a lender points as a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan, thus obtaining a lower monthly payment in exchange for this up-front payment. For each point purchased, the loan rate is typically reduced by anywhere from 1/8% (0.125%) to 1/4% (0.25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ginniemae.gov/4_home/closing_cost.asp?section=YPTH |title=Ginnie Mae: Your Path to Homeownership |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtgprofessor.com/A%20-%20Points/questions_about_points.htm |title=Questions About Mortgage Points |publisher=Mortgage Professor |date=2008-11-15 |accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling the property or refinancing prior to this break-even point will result in a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer.  The longer you keep the property financed under the loan with purchased points, the more the money spent on the points will pay off.  Accordingly, if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion, paying points is actually going to end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher interest rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/discount-points/ |title=What Are Discount Points? |author=Anisha Sekar |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |publisher=nerdwallet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/home-ownership/buying-mortgage-points-lower-rate |title=What are mortgage points? |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |publisher=Better Money Habits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Points may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of qualifying for a loan.  Loan qualification based on monthly income versus the monthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly payment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate, thereby reducing the monthly loan payment.

Discount points may be different from [[origination fee]], [[mortgage arrangement fee]] or [[mortgage broker|broker fee]]. Discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates, while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate. Origination fee and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the [[HUD-1 Settlement Statement]].

The difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a benefit to the borrower.  If you intend to stay in your home for an extended period of time, it may be worthwhile to pay additional points in order to obtain a lower interest rate.  Any significant changes in fees should be re-disclosed in the final [[good faith estimate]] (GFE).

Also directly related to points is the concept of the '[[no closing cost loan]]', in which the consumer accepts a higher interest rate in return for the lender paying the loan's closing costs up front.  In some cases a purchaser can negotiate with the seller to get them to pay [[seller's points]] which can be used to pay mortgage points.

===Three Comprehensive Categories of Knowledge===
[[Image:Universal Categories.jpg|right|thumb|The Three Peircean Categories]]
Using the [[trikonic]] categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness developed by American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Earthscore splits knowledge into three modes of being: firstness (positive quality), secondness (actual fact), and thirdness (laws that will govern facts in the future), and defines these categories as "a theory of everything".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Three Person Solution: Creating Sustainable Collaborative Relationships|author=Ryan, P.|date=2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=9781557535047|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EQk8oG7wFPUC|page=60|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earthscore3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/earthscore_eco/earthscore_notational_system.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002102039/http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/earthscore_eco/earthscore_notational_system.html |archive-date=2006-10-02 |dead-url=yes|title=The Earthscore Notational System|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstness is positive quality in the realm of spontaneity, freshness, possibility, and freedom. Earthscore defines firstness as being "as is", without regard for any other. Examples include: the taste of banana, warmth, redness, and feeling gloomy.&lt;ref name="experimentaltvcenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/history/people/pview.php3?id=42|title=People &amp;#124; The History Project|publisher=experimentaltvcenter.org|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondness is a two-sided consciousness of effort and resistance engendered by being up against brute facts. Earthscore defines secondness as the "facticity", or "thisness", of something, as it exists, here and now, without rhyme or reason. Examples include: pushing against an unlocked door and meeting silent, unseen resistance.&lt;ref name="stichting-mai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stichting-mai.de/hwg/amb/aai/art_as_inquiry_13.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716215839/http://www.stichting-mai.de/hwg/amb/aai/art_as_inquiry_13.htm|archive-date=2004-07-16|dead-url=yes|title=M.J.Bijvoet - Art As Inquiry|author=Marga Bijvoet|accessdate=2015-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdness mediates between secondness and firstness, between fact and possibility. ''Earthscore'' defines thirdness as the realm of habit and laws that will govern facts in the future, and posits that a knowledge of thirdness can allow predictions of how certain future events will turn out. It is an 'if...then' sort of knowledge. Thirdness consists in the reality that future facts of secondness will conform to general laws.&lt;ref name="earthscore3"/&gt;

===The Relational Circuit===

The relational circuit is a self-penetrating, tubular continuum with six unambiguous positions which attempts to supply a [[Continuum (topology)|topological continuum]] to the [[trikonic]] categories. The circuit organizes differences in terms of firstness, secondness, and thirdness, and three "in-between" positions that connect them within the continuum. The relational circuit is to the Earthscore System what the staff and bars are to classical music notation, and is the basis of the third component, threeing.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/leonardo/v039/39.3ryan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthscore.org/articles/ed_creating_curriculum_two.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electricity-tool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricity-tool.com/doc/216963-Component-Two:-The-Relational-Circuit/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710181115/http://www.electricity-tool.com/doc/216963-Component-Two%3A-The-Relational-Circuit/|archive-date=2011-07-10|dead-url=yes|title=Component Two: The Relational Circuit-Electricity Tool &amp;#124; electricity tool|accessdate=2015-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threeing===

Threeing is a practice in which three people take turns playing three different roles; initiator, respondent and mediator, in an attempt to solve relational confusion. The roles correspond to the categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness. Through role playing, the three individuals interact with each other spontaneously and recursively, following the relational circuit.&lt;ref name="earthscore4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/Curriculae/threeing_curriculum.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002102108/http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/Curriculae/threeing_curriculum.html |archive-date=2006-10-02 |dead-url=yes|title=Threeing Relationships|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Threeing is further broken down into ten different subsections:&lt;ref name="earthscore5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/threeing/threeing_lesson_intro.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002102709/http://www.earthscore.org/New%20Format/article%20pages/threeing/threeing_lesson_intro.html |archive-date=2006-10-02 |dead-url=yes|title=Introduction to Lessons in Verbal Threeing|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Firstness of Thirdness===

Earthscore utilizes the Firstness of Thirdness as a means of creativity, in an attempt to imagine an ecologically sustainable life before living it. By incorporating pure firstness as the realm of spontaneity, Earthscore uses the disciplines of [[Zen]], [[yoga]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] to cultivate the human capacity to be comfortable in pure firstness and yield new insights and visions.

===The Semiotic System for Interpretation===

Earthscore approaches knowledge as a process of generating signs, and incorporates the semiotic system of Charles Sanders Peirce consistent with the trikonic categories: A sign (firstness) representing an object (secondness) for an interpretant (thirdness). Earthscore exfoliates the threefold division into  a sixty-six-fold classification of signs that is inclusive of everything in nature, in order to systematize both interdisciplinary and multimedia representations of ecosystems.

The [[hyperbola]] is sometimes referred to as the 'Markowitz Bullet', and its upward sloped portion is the efficient frontier if no risk-free asset is available.

In [[modern portfolio theory]], the '''efficient frontier''' (or '''portfolio frontier''') is an investment [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] which occupies the 'efficient' parts of the [[risk-return spectrum]]. Formally, it is the set of portfolios which satisfy the condition that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected [[return (finance)|return]] but with the same [[standard deviation]] of return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficient Frontier|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp|website=[[Investopedia]]|publisher=investopedia.com|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Markowitz efficient frontier|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/m/markowitz-efficient-frontier|website=[[NASDAQ]]|publisher=nasdaq.com|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficient frontier was first formulated by [[Harry Markowitz]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="markowitz1952"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Markowitz, H.M. |title=Portfolio Selection |journal=The Journal of Finance |date=March 1952 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–91 |doi=10.2307/2975974 |jstor=2975974|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
A combination of assets, i.e. a portfolio, is referred to as "efficient" if it has the best possible [[expected value|expected]] level of return for its level of [[financial risk|risk]] (which is represented by the standard deviation of the portfolio's return).&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, every possible combination of risky assets can be plotted in risk–expected return space, and the collection of all such possible portfolios defines a region in this space. In the absence of the opportunity to hold a [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free asset]], this region is the opportunity set (the [[feasible set]]). The positively sloped (upward-sloped) top boundary of this  region is a portion of a [[hyperbola]]&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Robert. "An analytic derivation of the efficient portfolio frontier," ''[[Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis]]'' 7, September 1972, 1851-1872.&lt;/ref&gt; and is called the "efficient frontier."  

If a risk-free asset is also available, the opportunity set is larger, and its upper boundary, the efficient frontier, is a straight line segment emanating from the vertical axis at the value of the risk-free asset's return and tangent to the risky-assets-only opportunity set. All portfolios between the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio are portfolios composed of risk-free assets and the tangency portfolio, while all portfolios on the linear frontier above and to the right of the tangency portfolio are generated by borrowing at the risk-free rate and investing the proceeds into the tangency portfolio.

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[commutative algebra]], the '''elementary symmetric polynomials''' are one type of basic building block for [[symmetric polynomial]]s, in the sense that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in elementary symmetric polynomials.  That is, any symmetric polynomial {{math|''P''}} is given by an expression involving only additions and multiplication of constants and elementary symmetric polynomials.  There is one elementary symmetric polynomial of degree {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''n''}} variables for each nonnegative integer {{math|''d'' ≤ ''n''}}, and it is formed by adding together all distinct products of {{math|''d''}} distinct variables.

==Definition==

The elementary symmetric polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, written {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0, 1, …, ''n''}}, are defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e_0 (X_1, X_2, \dots,X_n) &amp;= 1,\\[10pt]
  e_1 (X_1, X_2, \dots,X_n) &amp;= \sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} X_j,\\
  e_2 (X_1, X_2, \dots,X_n) &amp;= \sum_{1 \leq j &lt; k \leq n} X_j X_k,\\
  e_3 (X_1, X_2, \dots,X_n) &amp;= \sum_{1 \leq j &lt; k &lt; l \leq n} X_j X_k X_l,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so forth, ending with
:&lt;math&gt; e_n (X_1, X_2, \dots,X_n) = X_1 X_2 \cdots X_n.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, for {{math|''k'' ≥ 0}} we define
: &lt;math&gt; e_k (X_1 , \ldots , X_n )=\sum_{1\le  j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k \le n} X_{j_1} \dotsm X_{j_k},&lt;/math&gt;
so that {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} 0}} if {{math|''k'' &gt; ''n''}}.

Thus, for each non-negative integer {{mvar|''k''}} less than or equal to {{mvar|''n''}} there exists exactly one elementary symmetric polynomial of degree {{mvar|''k''}} in {{mvar|''n''}} variables.  To form the one that has degree {{mvar|''k''}}, we take the sum of all products of {{mvar|''k''}}-subsets of the {{mvar|''n''}} variables.  (By contrast, if one performs the same operation using ''multisets'' of variables, that is, taking variables with repetition, one arrives at the [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]]s.)

Given an [[integer partition]] (that is, a finite decreasing sequence of positive integers) {{math|''λ'' {{=}} (''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, one defines the symmetric polynomial {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, also called an elementary symmetric polynomial, by
: &lt;math&gt;e_\lambda (X_1, \dots,X_n) = e_{\lambda_1}(X_1, \dots, X_n) \cdot e_{\lambda_2}(X_1, \dots, X_n) \cdots e_{\lambda_m}(X_1, \dots, X_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Sometimes the notation {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used instead of {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

==Examples==
The following lists the {{math|''n''}} elementary symmetric polynomials for the first four positive values of&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}}.  (In every case, {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} is also one of the polynomials.)

For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}:
:&lt;math&gt;e_1(X_1) = X_1.&lt;/math&gt;

For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 e_1(X_1,X_2)  &amp;= X_1 + X_2,\\  
 e_2(X_1,X_2) &amp;= X_1X_2.\,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 3}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 e_1(X_1,X_2,X_3) &amp;= X_1 + X_2 + X_3,\\ 
 e_2(X_1,X_2,X_3) &amp;= X_1X_2 + X_1X_3 + X_2X_3,\\
 e_3(X_1,X_2,X_3) &amp;= X_1X_2X_3.\,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 e_1(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &amp;= X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4,\\
 e_2(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &amp;= X_1X_2 + X_1X_3 + X_1X_4 + X_2X_3 + X_2X_4 + X_3X_4,\\
 e_3(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &amp;= X_1X_2X_3 + X_1X_2X_4 + X_1X_3X_4 + X_2X_3X_4,\\
 e_4(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &amp;= X_1X_2X_3X_4.\,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

The elementary symmetric polynomials appear when we expand a linear factorization of a monic polynomial: we have the identity 
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{j=1}^n ( \lambda - X_j)=\lambda^n - e_1(X_1,\ldots,X_n)\lambda^{n-1} + e_2(X_1,\ldots,X_n)\lambda^{n-2} + \cdots +(-1)^n e_n(X_1,\ldots,X_n).&lt;/math&gt;
That is, when we substitute numerical values for the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, we obtain the monic [[univariate polynomial]] (with variable {{math|''λ''}}) whose roots are the values substituted for {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and whose coefficients are [[up to]] their sign the elementary symmetric polynomials. These relations between the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial are called [[Vieta's formulas]].

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of a [[square matrix]] is an example of application of Vieta's formulas. The roots of this polynomial are the [[eigenvalues]] of the matrix.  When we substitute these eigenvalues into the elementary symmetric polynomials, we obtain, up to their sign, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, which are [[invariant theory|invariants]] of the matrix. In particular, the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] (the sum of the elements of the diagonal) is the value of {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and thus the sum of the eigenvalues. Similarly, the [[determinant]] is, up to the sign, the constant term of the characteristic polynomial; more precisely the determinant is the value of {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Thus the determinant of a square matrix is the product of the eigenvalues.

The set of elementary symmetric polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables [[generator (mathematics)|generates]] the [[polynomial ring|ring]] of [[symmetric polynomial]]s in {{math|''n''}} variables.  More specifically, the ring of symmetric polynomials with integer coefficients equals the integral polynomial ring {{math|'''ℤ'''[''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), …, ''e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)]}}. (See below for a more general statement and proof.) This fact is one of the foundations of [[invariant theory]].  For other systems of symmetric polynomials with a similar property see [[power sum symmetric polynomial]]s and [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]]s.

== Fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials ==&lt;!-- [[Fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]] redirects to this section. --&gt;

For any commutative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] {{math|''A''}}, denote the ring of symmetric polynomials in the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with coefficients in {{math|''A''}} by {{math|''A''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is a polynomial ring in the ''n'' elementary symmetric polynomials {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n''}}. (Note that {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not among these polynomials; since {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}}, it cannot be member of ''any'' set of algebraically independent elements.)

This means that every symmetric polynomial {{math|''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') ∈ ''A''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt;}} has a unique representation
:&lt;math&gt; P(X_1,\ldots, X_n)=Q\big(e_1(X_1 , \ldots ,X_n), \ldots, e_n(X_1 , \ldots ,X_n)\big) &lt;/math&gt;
for some polynomial {{math|''Q'' ∈ ''A''[''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}}. Another way of saying the same thing is that {{math|''A''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is isomorphic to the polynomial ring {{math|''A''[''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} through an isomorphism that sends {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1, …, ''n''}}.

=== Proof sketch ===
The theorem may be proved for symmetric [[homogeneous polynomial]]s by a double [[mathematical induction]] with respect to the number of variables {{math|''n''}} and, for fixed {{math|''n''}}, with respect to the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of the homogeneous polynomial. The general case then follows by splitting an arbitrary symmetric polynomial into its homogeneous components (which are again symmetric). 

In the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the result is obvious because every polynomial in one variable is automatically symmetric.

Assume now that the theorem has been proved for all polynomials for {{math|''m'' &lt; ''n''}} variables and all symmetric polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables with degree {{math|&lt; ''d''}}. Every homogeneous symmetric polynomial {{math|''P''}} in {{math|''A''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be decomposed as a sum of homogeneous symmetric polynomials
:&lt;math&gt; P(X_1,\ldots,X_n)= P_{\text{lacunary}} (X_1,\ldots,X_n)  + X_1 \cdots X_n \cdot Q(X_1,\ldots,X_n). &lt;/math&gt;
Here the "lacunary part" {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;lacunary&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined as the sum of all monomials in {{math|''P''}} which contain only a proper subset of the {{math|''n''}} variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e., where at least one variable {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is missing. 

Because {{math|''P''}} is symmetric, the lacunary part is determined by its terms containing only the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e., which do not contain {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. More precisely: If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are two homogeneous symmetric polynomials in {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} having the same degree, and if the coefficient of {{math|''A''}} before each monomial which contains only the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} equals the corresponding coefficient of {{math|''B''}}, then {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} have equal lacunary parts. (This is because every monomial which can appear in a lacunary part must lack at least one variable, and thus can be transformed by a permutation of the variables into a monomial which contains only the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.)

But the terms of {{math|''P''}} which contain only the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} are precisely the terms that survive the operation of setting {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to&amp;nbsp;0, so their sum equals {{math|''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;n − 1&lt;/sub&gt;, 0)}}, which is a symmetric polynomial in the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} that we shall denote by {{math|''P̃''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. By the inductive assumption, this polynomial can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{P}(X_1, \ldots, X_{n-1})=\tilde{Q}(\sigma_{1,n-1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1,n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
for some {{math|''Q̃''}}. Here the doubly indexed {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the elementary symmetric polynomials in {{math|''n'' − 1}} variables. 

Consider now the polynomial 
:&lt;math&gt; R(X_1, \ldots, X_{n}):= \tilde{Q}(\sigma_{1,n}, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1,n}) \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Then {{math|''R''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a symmetric polynomial in {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, of the same degree as {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;lacunary&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;R(X_1, \ldots, X_{n-1},0) = \tilde{Q}(\sigma_{1,n-1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1,n-1}) = P(X_1, \ldots,X_{n-1},0)&lt;/math&gt;
(the first equality holds because setting {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to&amp;nbsp;0 in {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} gives {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for all {{math|''j'' &lt; ''n''}}). In other words, the coefficient of {{math|''R''}} before each monomial which contains only the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} equals the corresponding coefficient of {{math|''P''}}. As we know, this shows that the lacunary part of {{math|''R''}} coincides with that of the original polynomial {{math|''P''}}. Therefore the difference {{math|''P'' − ''R''}} has no lacunary part, and is therefore divisible by the product {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;···''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of all variables, which equals the elementary symmetric polynomial {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then writing {{math|''P'' − ''R'' {{=}} ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''Q''}}, the quotient {{math|''Q''}} is a homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree less than {{math|''d''}} (in fact degree at most {{math|''d'' − ''n''}}) which by the inductive assumption can be expressed as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions. Combining the representations for {{math|''P'' − ''R''}} and {{math|''R''}} one finds a polynomial representation for {{math|''P''}}. 

The uniqueness of the representation can be proved inductively in a similar way. (It is equivalent to the fact that the {{math|''n''}} polynomials {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are [[algebraically independent]] over the ring {{math|''A''}}.) The fact that the polynomial representation is unique implies that {{math|''A''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is isomorphic to {{math|''A''[''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}}.

=== Alternative proof ===

The following proof is also inductive, but does not involve other polynomials than those symmetric in {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and also leads to a fairly direct procedure to effectively write a symmetric polynomial as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric ones. Assume the symmetric polynomial to be homogeneous of degree {{mvar|''d''}}; different homogeneous components can be decomposed separately. Order the [[monomial]]s in the variables {{mvar|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} [[lexicographic order|lexicographically]], where the individual variables are ordered {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; … &gt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, in other words the dominant term of a polynomial is one with the highest occurring power of {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and among those the one with the highest power of {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, etc. Furthermore parametrize all products of elementary symmetric polynomials that have degree {{math|''d''}} (they are in fact homogeneous) as follows by [[integer partition|partitions]] of {{math|''d''}}. Order the individual elementary symmetric polynomials {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in the product so that those with larger indices {{mvar|''i''}} come first, then build for each such factor a column of {{mvar|''i''}} boxes, and arrange those columns from left to right to form a [[Young diagram]] containing {{mvar|''d''}} boxes in all. The shape of this diagram is a partition of {{mvar|''d''}}, and each partition {{mvar|''λ''}} of {{math|''d''}} arises for exactly one product of elementary symmetric polynomials, which we shall denote by {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}) (the {{math|''t''}} is present only because traditionally this product is associated to the transpose partition of {{mvar|''λ''}}). The essential ingredient of the proof is the following simple property, which uses [[monomial#Notation|multi-index notation]] for monomials in the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

'''Lemma'''. The leading term of {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is {{math|''X'' &lt;sup&gt;''λ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

:''Proof''. The leading term of the product is the product of the leading terms of each factor (this is true whenever one uses a [[monomial order]], like the lexicographic order used here), and the leading term of the factor {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is clearly {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;···''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. To count the occurrences of the individual variables in the resulting monomial, fill the column of the Young diagram corresponding to the factor concerned with the numbers {{math|1, …, ''i''}} of the variables, then all boxes in the first row contain 1, those in the second row 2, and so forth, which means the leading term is {{math|''X'' &lt;sup&gt;''λ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Now one proves by induction on the leading monomial in lexicographic order, that any nonzero homogeneous symmetric polynomial {{mvar|''P''}} of degree {{mvar|''d''}} can be written as polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials. Since {{mvar|''P''}} is symmetric, its leading monomial has weakly decreasing exponents, so it is some {{math|''X'' &lt;sup&gt;''λ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{mvar|''λ''}} a partition of {{math|''d''}}. Let the coefficient of this term be {{mvar|''c''}}, then {{math|''P'' − ''ce''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is either zero or a symmetric polynomial with a strictly smaller leading monomial. Writing this difference inductively as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials, and adding back {{math|''ce''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} to it, one obtains the sought for polynomial expression for {{math|''P''}}.

The fact that this expression is unique, or equivalently that all the products (monomials) {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of elementary symmetric polynomials are linearly independent, is also easily proved. The lemma shows that all these products have different leading monomials, and this suffices: if a nontrivial linear combination of the {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} were zero, one focuses on the contribution in the linear combination with nonzero coefficient and with (as polynomial in the variables {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}) the largest leading monomial; the leading term of this contribution cannot be cancelled by any other contribution of the linear combination, which gives a contradiction.

In the mathematics of [[convergent series|convergent]] and [[divergent series]], '''Euler summation''' is a summability method. That is, it is a method for assigning a value to a series, different from the conventional method of taking limits of partial sums. Given a series ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if its [[Euler transform]] converges to a sum, then that sum is called the '''Euler sum''' of the original series. As well as being used to define values for divergent series, Euler summation can be used to speed the convergence of series.

Euler summation can be generalized into a family of methods denoted (E, ''q''), where ''q'' ≥ 0. The (E, 1) sum is the ordinary Euler sum. All of these methods are strictly weaker than [[Borel summation]]; for ''q'' &gt; 0 they are incomparable with [[Abel summation]].

==Definition==
For some value ''y'' we may define the Euler sum (if it converges for that value of ''y'') corresponding to a particular formal summation as:

:&lt;math&gt; _{E_y}\, \sum_{j=0}^\infty  a_j := \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(1+y)^{i+1}} \sum_{j=0}^i \binom{i}{j} y^{j+1} a_j .&lt;/math&gt;

If the formal sum actually converges, an Euler sum will equal it. But Euler summation is particularly used to [[series acceleration|accelerate the convergence]] of alternating series and sometimes it can give a useful meaning to divergent sums.

To justify the approach notice that for interchanged sum, Euler's summation reduces to the initial series, because
:&lt;math&gt;y^{j+1}\sum_{i=j}^\infty \binom{i}{j} \frac{1}{(1+y)^{i+1}}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

This method itself cannot be improved by iterated application, as 
:&lt;math&gt; _{E_{y_1}} {}_{E_{y_2}}\sum = \, _{E_{\frac{y_1 y_2}{1+y_1+y_2}}} \sum.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

* Using ''y'' = 1 for the formal sum
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^\infty (-1)^j P_k(j)&lt;/math&gt;
:we get
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \sum_{j=0}^i \binom{i}{j} (-1)^j P_k(j),&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a polynomial of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] ''k''. Note that the inner sum would be zero for {{math|''i'' &gt; ''k''}}, so in this case Euler summation reduces an infinite series to a finite sum.
* The particular choice
::&lt;math&gt;P_k(j):= (j+1)^k&lt;/math&gt;
:provides an explicit representation of the [[Bernoulli numbers]], since
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_{k+1}}{k+1}=-\zeta(-k)&lt;/math&gt;
:(the [[Riemann zeta function]]). Indeed, the formal sum in this case diverges since ''k'' is positive, but applying Euler summation to the zeta function (or rather, to the related [[Dirichlet eta function]]) yields
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-2^{k+1}}\sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \sum_{j=0}^i \binom{i}{j} (-1)^j (j+1)^k &lt;/math&gt;
:which is of [[closed-form expression|closed form]].
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^\infty z^j= \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(1+y)^{i+1}} \sum_{j=0}^i \binom{i}{j} y^{j+1} z^j = \frac{y}{1+y} \sum_{i=0}^\infty \left( \frac{1+yz}{1+y} \right)^i&lt;/math&gt;
:With an appropriate choice of ''y'' (i.e. equal to or close to −{{sfrac|1|''z''}}) this series converges to {{sfrac|1|1 − ''z''}}.

In [[mathematics]], the notion of '''expansivity''' formalizes the notion of points moving away from one another under the action of an [[iterated function]]. The idea of expansivity is fairly [[rigidity (mathematics)|rigid]], as the definition of positive expansivity, below, as well as the [[Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem]] demonstrate.

==Definition==
If &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]], a [[homeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''expansive''' if there is a constant 

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

called the '''expansivity constant''', such that for every pair of points &lt;math&gt;x\neq y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; there is  an integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^n(x),f^n(y))\geq\varepsilon_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this definition, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be positive or negative, and so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may be expansive in the forward or backward directions.

The space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is often assumed to be [[compact space|compact]], since under that assumption expansivity is a topological property; i.e. if &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; is any other metric generating the same topology as &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is expansive in &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is expansive in &lt;math&gt;(X,d')&lt;/math&gt; (possibly with a different expansivity constant).

If  

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to X&lt;/math&gt; 

is a continuous map, we say that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is '''positively expansive''' (or '''forward expansive''') if there is a 

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; 

such that, for any &lt;math&gt;x\neq y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;d(f^n(x),f^n(y))\geq \varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem of uniform expansivity==
Given ''f'' an expansive homeomorphism of a compact metric space, the theorem of uniform expansivity states that for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there is an &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for each pair &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; of points of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there is an &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\vert n\vert\leq N&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^n(x),f^n(y)) &gt; c-\delta,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the expansivity constant of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ([http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;amp;from=objects&amp;amp;id=4678 proof]).

==Discussion==
Positive expansivity is much stronger than expansivity. In fact, one can prove that if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a positively
expansive homeomorphism, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite ([http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;amp;from=objects&amp;amp;id=4677 proof]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20753">In [[mathematics]], a '''finite set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that has a [[wikt:finite|finite]] number of [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s.  Informally, a finite set is a set which one could in principle count and finish counting. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\{2,4,6,8,10\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a finite set with five elements. The number of elements of a finite set is a [[natural number]] (a [[non-negative]] [[integer]]) and is called the [[cardinality]] of the set. A set that is not finite is called '''[[infinite set|infinite]]'''. For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite:
:&lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,\ldots\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Finite sets are particularly important in [[combinatorics]], the mathematical study of [[counting]]. Many arguments involving finite sets rely on the [[pigeonhole principle]], which states that there cannot exist an [[injective function]] from a larger finite set to a smaller finite set.

== Definition and terminology ==

Formally, a set {{mvar|''S''}} is called '''finite''' if there exists a [[bijection]]
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon S\rightarrow\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;
for some natural number {{mvar|''n''}}.  The number {{mvar|''n''}} is the set's cardinality, denoted as |{{mvar|''S''}}|.  The [[empty set]] {} or Ø is considered finite, with cardinality zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Apostol|1974|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cohn|1981|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Labarre|1968|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rudin|1976|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a set is finite, its elements may be written — in many ways — in a [[sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \quad (x_i \in S,  1 \le i \le n).&lt;/math&gt;
In [[combinatorics]], a finite set with {{mvar|''n''}} elements is sometimes called an ''{{mvar|n}}-set'' and a subset with {{mvar|''k''}} elements is called a ''{{mvar|k}}-subset''.  For example, the set {5,6,7} is a 3-set&amp;nbsp;– a finite set with three elements&amp;nbsp;– and {6,7} is a 2-subset of it.

(Those familiar with the definition of the natural numbers themselves as conventional in set theory, the so-called [[Natural number#Von Neumann construction|von Neumann construction]], may prefer to use the existence of the bijection &lt;math&gt;f\colon S\rightarrow n&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent.)

== Basic properties ==

Any proper [[subset]] of a finite set ''S'' is finite and has fewer elements than ''S'' itself.  As a consequence, there cannot exist a [[bijection]] between a finite set ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S''.  Any set with this property is called [[Dedekind-finite]].  Using the standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] axioms for [[set theory]], every Dedekind-finite set is also finite, but this implication cannot be proved in ZF (Zermelo Fraenkel axioms with the [[axiom of choice]] removed) alone.  
The [[axiom of countable choice]], a weak version of the axiom of choice, is sufficient to prove this equivalence.

Any injective function between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also a [[surjective function]] (a surjection). Similarly, any surjection between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also an injection.

The [[union (set theory)|union]] of two finite sets is finite, with
:&lt;math&gt;|S\cup T| \le |S| + |T|.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact:
:&lt;math&gt;|S\cup T| = |S| + |T| - |S\cap T|.&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of any finite number of finite sets is finite.  The [[Cartesian product]] of finite sets is also finite, with:
:&lt;math&gt;|S\times T| = |S|\times|T|.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the Cartesian product of finitely many finite sets is finite. A finite set with ''n'' elements has 2{{sup|''n''}} distinct subsets.  That is, the
[[power set]] of a finite set is finite, with cardinality 2{{sup|''n''}}.

Any subset of a finite set is finite. The set of values of a function when applied to elements of a finite set is finite.

All finite sets are [[countable]], but not all countable sets are finite. (Some authors, however, use "countable" to mean "countably infinite", so do not consider finite sets to be countable.)

The [[free semilattice]] over a finite set is the set of its non-empty subsets, with the [[Join and meet|join operation]] being given by set union.

== Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness ==

In [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice (ZF), the following conditions are all equivalent:{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

# ''S'' is a finite set. That is, ''S'' can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of those natural numbers less than some specific natural number.
# ([[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]) ''S'' has all properties which can be proved by mathematical induction beginning with the empty set and adding one new element at a time. (See [[#Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness|below]] for the set-theoretical formulation of Kuratowski finiteness.)
# ([[Paul Stäckel]]) ''S'' can be given a total ordering which is [[well-order]]ed both forwards and backwards. That is, every non-empty subset of ''S'' has both a least and a greatest element in the subset.
# Every one-to-one function from ''P''(''P''(''S'')) into itself is [[onto]]. That is, the [[powerset]] of the powerset of ''S'' is Dedekind-finite (see below).&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence of the standard numerical definition of finite sets to the Dedekind-finiteness of the power set of the power set was shown in 1912 by {{harvnb|Whitehead|Russell|2009|p=288}}. This Whitehead/Russell theorem is described in more modern language by {{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=73–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Every surjective function from ''P''(''P''(''S'')) onto itself is one-to-one.
# ([[Alfred Tarski]]) Every non-empty family of subsets of ''S'' has a [[minimal element]] with respect to inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=48–58}}, demonstrated that his definition (which is also known as I-finite) is equivalent to Kuratowski's set-theoretical definition, which he then noted is equivalent to the standard numerical definition via the proof by {{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Equivalently, every non-empty family of subsets of ''S'' has a [[maximal element]] with respect to inclusion.)
# ''S'' can be well-ordered and any two well-orderings on it are [[order isomorphic]]. In other words, the well-orderings on ''S'' have exactly one [[order type]].

If the [[axiom of choice]] is also assumed (the [[axiom of countable choice]] is sufficient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=kkQAXtqb534C&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=If+the+axiom+of+choice+is+also+assumed+(the+axiom+of+countable+choice+is+sufficient%5B&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ClBSj8_AMl&amp;sig=fkJDTRruKBg003olsDDh-Tf-nG0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNvJzjz8zYAhVL6Y8KHQosCjYQ6AEIYDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20the%20axiom%20of%20choice%20is%20also%20assumed%20(the%20axiom%20of%20countable%20choice%20is%20sufficient%5B&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Differential Equations: Ordinary Differential Equations|last=Canada|first=A.|last2=Drabek|first2=P.|last3=Fonda|first3=A.|date=2005-09-02|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080461083|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}), then the following conditions are all equivalent:

# ''S'' is a finite set.
# ([[Richard Dedekind]]) Every one-to-one function from ''S'' into itself is onto.
# Every surjective function from ''S'' onto itself is one-to-one.
# ''S'' is empty or every [[partial order]]ing of ''S'' contains a [[maximal element]].

== Foundational issues ==

[[Georg Cantor]] initiated his theory of sets in order to provide a mathematical treatment of infinite sets. Thus the distinction between the finite and the infinite lies at the core of set theory. Certain foundationalists, the [[Finitism|strict finitists]], reject the existence of infinite sets and thus recommend a mathematics based solely on finite sets. Mainstream mathematicians consider strict finitism too confining, but acknowledge its relative consistency: the universe of [[hereditarily finite set]]s constitutes a model of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation.

Even for those mathematicians who embrace infinite sets, in certain important contexts, the formal distinction between the finite and the infinite can remain a delicate matter.   The difficulty stems from [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. One can interpret the theory of hereditarily finite sets within [[Peano arithmetic]] (and certainly also vice versa), so the incompleteness of the theory of Peano arithmetic implies that of the theory of hereditarily finite sets. In particular, there exists a plethora of so-called [[non-standard models]] of both theories. A seeming paradox, non-standard models of the theory of hereditarily finite sets contain infinite sets --- but these infinite sets look finite from within the model. (This can happen when the model lacks the sets or functions necessary to witness the infinitude of these sets.) On account of the incompleteness theorems, no first-order predicate, nor even any recursive scheme of first-order predicates, can characterize the standard part of all such models.  So, at least from the point of view of first-order logic, one can only hope to describe finiteness approximately.

More generally, informal notions like set, and particularly finite set, may receive interpretations across a range of [[formal system]]s varying in their axiomatics and logical apparatus. The best known axiomatic set theories include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG), [[Non-well-founded set theory]], [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Type theory]] and all the theories of their various models. One may also choose among classical first-order logic, various higher-order logics and [[intuitionistic logic]].

A [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] might see the meaning{{fact|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--sure that formalists might attribute meanings to mathematical notions???--&gt; of ''set'' varying from system to system. Some kinds of [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonist]]s might view particular formal systems as approximating an underlying reality.

== Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness ==
&lt;!--Linked from [[#Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness]] above--&gt;

In contexts where the notion of [[natural number]] sits logically prior to any notion of set, one can define a set ''S'' as finite if ''S'' admits a [[bijection]] to some set of [[natural numbers]] of the form &lt;math&gt;\{x|x&lt;n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Mathematicians more typically choose to ground notions of number in [[set theory]], for example they might model natural numbers by the order types of finite [[well-ordered]] sets. Such an approach requires a structural definition of finiteness that does not depend on natural numbers.

Various properties that single out the finite sets among all sets in the theory ZFC turn out logically inequivalent in weaker systems such as ZF or intuitionistic set theories. Two definitions feature prominently in the literature, one due to [[Richard Dedekind]], the other to [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]. (Kuratowski's is the definition used above.)

A set ''S'' is called [[Dedekind infinite]] if there exists an injective, non-surjective function &lt;math&gt;f:S \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;. Such a function exhibits a bijection between ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S'', namely the image of ''f''.  Given a Dedekind infinite set ''S'', a function ''f'', and an element ''x'' that is not in the image of ''f'', we can form an infinite sequence of distinct elements of ''S'', namely &lt;math&gt;x,f(x),f(f(x)),...&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, given a sequence in ''S'' consisting of distinct elements &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3, ...&lt;/math&gt;, we can define a function ''f'' such that on elements in the sequence &lt;math&gt;f(x_i) = x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; and ''f'' behaves like the identity function otherwise.  Thus Dedekind infinite sets contain subsets that correspond bijectively with the natural numbers. Dedekind finite naturally means that every injective self-map is also surjective.

{{anchor|Kuratowski finite}} Kuratowski finiteness is defined as follows. Given any set ''S'', the binary operation of union endows the [[powerset]] ''P''(''S'') with the structure of a [[semi-lattice]].  Writing ''K''(''S'') for the sub-semi-lattice generated by the [[empty set]] and the singletons, call set ''S'' Kuratowski finite if ''S'' itself belongs to ''K''(''S'').&lt;ref&gt;The original paper by {{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920}} defined a set ''S'' to be finite when
: ''P''(''S'')∖{∅} = ⋂{''X'' ∈ ''P''(''P''(''S'')∖{∅}); (∀''x''∈''S'', {''x''}∈''X'') and (∀''A'',''B''∈''X'', ''A''∪''B''∈''X'')}.
In other words, ''S'' is finite when the set of all non-empty subsets of ''S'' is equal to the intersection of all classes ''X'' which satisfy:
* all elements of ''X'' are non-empty subsets of ''S'',
* the set {''x''} is an element of ''X'' for all ''x'' in ''S'',
* ''X'' is closed under pairwise unions.
Kuratowski showed that this is equivalent to the numerical definition of a finite set.&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, ''K''(''S'') consists of the finite subsets of ''S''. Crucially, one does not need induction, recursion or a definition of natural numbers to define ''generated by'' since one may obtain ''K''(''S'') simply by taking the intersection of all sub-semi-lattices containing the empty set and the [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]].

Readers unfamiliar with semi-lattices and other notions of abstract algebra may prefer an entirely elementary formulation. Kuratowski finite means ''S'' lies in the set ''K''(''S''), constructed as follows. Write ''M'' for the set of all subsets ''X'' of ''P''(''S'') such that:
* ''X'' contains the empty set;
* For every set ''T'' in ''P''(''S''), if ''X'' contains ''T'' then ''X'' also contains the union of ''T'' with any singleton.
Then ''K''(''S'') may be defined as the intersection of ''M''.

In ZF, Kuratowski finite implies Dedekind finite, but not vice versa. In the parlance of a popular pedagogical formulation, when the axiom of choice fails badly, one may have an infinite family of socks with no way to choose one sock from more than finitely many of the pairs. That would make the set of such socks Dedekind finite: there can be no infinite sequence of socks, because such a sequence would allow a choice of one sock for infinitely many pairs by choosing the first sock in the sequence. However, Kuratowski finiteness would fail for the same set of socks.

=== Other concepts of finiteness ===

In ZF set theory without the axiom of choice, the following concepts of finiteness for a set ''S'' are distinct. They are arranged in strictly decreasing order of strength. In other words, if a set ''S'' meets one of the criteria in this list, it meets all of the criteria which follow that one. In the absence of the axiom of choice, the reverse implications are all unprovable. If the axiom of choice is assumed, then all of these concepts are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;This list of 8 finiteness concepts is presented with this numbering scheme by both {{harvnb|Howard|Rubin|1998|pp=278–280}}, and {{harvnb|Lévy|1958|pp=2–3}}, although the details of the presentation of the definitions differ in some respects which do not affect the meanings of the concepts.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that none of these definitions need the set of finite ordinal numbers to be defined first. They are all pure "set-theoretic" definitions in terms of the equality and element-of relations, not involving ω.)

* '''I-finite'''. Every non-empty set of subsets of ''S'' has a ⊆-maximal element. (This is equivalent to requiring the existence of a ⊆-minimal element. It is also equivalent to the standard numerical concept of finiteness.)
* '''Ia-finite'''. For every partition of ''S'' into two sets, at least one of the two sets is I-finite.
* '''II-finite'''. Every non-empty ⊆-monotone set of subsets of ''S'' has a ⊆-maximal element.
* '''III-finite'''. The power set ''P''(''S'') is Dedekind finite.
* '''IV-finite'''. ''S'' is Dedekind finite.
* '''V-finite'''.  ∣''S''∣ = 0 or 2⋅∣''S''∣ &gt; ∣''S''|.
* '''VI-finite'''. ∣''S''∣ = 0 or ∣''S''∣ = 1 or ∣''S''∣&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ∣''S''∣.
* '''VII-finite'''. ''S'' is I-finite or not well-orderable.

The forward implications (from strong to weak) are theorems within ZF. Counter-examples to the reverse implications (from weak to strong) are found using [[model theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lévy|1958}} found counter-examples to each of the reverse implications in Mostowski models. Lévy attributes most of the results to earlier papers by Mostowski and Lindenbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these finiteness definitions and their names are attributed to {{harvnb|Tarski|1954}} by {{harvnb|Howard|Rubin|1998|p=278}}. However, definitions I, II, III, IV and V were presented in {{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=49, 93}}, together with proofs (or references to proofs) for the forward implications. At that time, model theory was not sufficiently advanced to find the counter-examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">In [[category theory]] in [[mathematics]] a '''family of generators''' (or '''family of separators''') of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; is a collection &lt;math&gt;\{G_i\in Ob(\mathcal C)|i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of objects, indexed by some set ''I'', such that for any two morphisms &lt;math&gt;f, g: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f\neq g&lt;/math&gt; then there is some ''i∈I'' and morphism &lt;math&gt;h : G_i \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, such that the compositions &lt;math&gt;f \circ h \neq g \circ h&lt;/math&gt;. If the family consists of a single object ''G'', we say it is a '''generator''' (or '''separator'''). 

Generators are central to the definition of [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]].

The [[dual (category theory)|dual]] concept is called a '''cogenerator''' or '''coseparator'''.

==Examples==
* In the category of [[abelian groups]], the group of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z&lt;/math&gt; is a generator: If ''f'' and ''g'' are different, then there is an element &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \neq g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z \rightarrow X,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;n \mapsto n \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; suffices.
* Similarly, the one-point [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a generator for the [[category of sets]]. In fact, any nonempty set is a generator.
* In the category of sets, any set with at least two objects is a cogenerator.
* In the category of modules over a ring R, a generator in a finite direct sum with itself contains an isomorphic copy of R as a direct summand.  Consequently, a generator module is faithful, i.e. has zero [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]].

'''KHOPCA''' is an adaptive [[clustering algorithm]] originally developed for dynamic networks. KHOPCA (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clustering algorithm) provides a fully [[Distributed computing|distributed]] and localized approach to group elements such as nodes in a network according to their distance from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brust|first=Matthias R.|last2=Frey|first2=Hannes|last3=Rothkugel|first3=Steffen|date=2007-01-01|title=Adaptive Multi-hop Clustering in Mobile Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1378063.1378086|journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications, and Systems and the 1st International Symposium on Computer Human Interaction in Mobile Technology|series=Mobility '07|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=132–138|doi=10.1145/1378063.1378086|isbn=9781595938190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brust|first=Matthias R.|last2=Frey|first2=Hannes|last3=Rothkugel|first3=Steffen|date=2008-01-01|title=Dynamic Multi-hop Clustering for Mobile Hybrid Wireless Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1352793.1352820|journal=Proceedings of the 2Nd International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication|series=ICUIMC '08|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=130–135|doi=10.1145/1352793.1352820|isbn=9781595939937}}&lt;/ref&gt; KHOPCA  operates proactively through a simple set of rules that defines clusters, which are optimal with respect to the applied distance function.

KHOPCA's clustering process explicitly supports joining and leaving of nodes, which makes KHOPCA suitable for highly dynamic networks. However, it has been demonstrated that KHOPCA also performs in static networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Besides applications in ad hoc and [[wireless sensor network]]s, KHOPCA can be used in localization and navigation problems, networked [[Swarm intelligence|swarming]], and real-time [[Cluster analysis|data clustering and analysis]].

== Algorithm description ==
KHOPCA (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clustering algorithm) operates proactively through a simple set of rules that defines clusters with variable &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hops. A set of local rules describes the state transition between nodes. A node's weight is determined only depending on the current state of its neighbors in communication range. Each node of the network is continuously involved in this process. As result, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clusters are formed and maintained in static as well as dynamic networks.

KHOPCA does not require any predetermined initial configuration. Therefore, a node can potentially choose any weight (between &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt;). However, the choice of the initial configuration does influence the convergence time.

=== Initialization ===
The prerequisites in the start configuration for the application of the rules are the following.
* &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt; is the network with nodes and links, whereby each node has a weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
* Each node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt; node stores the same positive values &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN &lt; MAX&lt;/math&gt;.
* A node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n=MAX&lt;/math&gt; is called cluster center.
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and represents the maximum size a cluster can have from the most outer node to the cluster center. The cluster diameter is therefore &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k\cdot2-1&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Nu(n)&lt;/math&gt; returns the direct neighbors of node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W(\Nu)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of weights of all nodes of &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt;.
The following rules describe the state transition for a node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n&lt;/math&gt;. These rules have to be executed on each node in the order described here.

=== Rule 1 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 1.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 1]]
The first rule has the function of constructing an order within the cluster. This happens through a node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; detects the direct neighbor with the highest weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, which is higher than the node's own weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n&lt;/math&gt;. If such a direct neighbor is detected, the node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; changes its own weight to be the weight of the highest weight within the neighborhood subtracted by 1. Applied iteratively, this process creates a top-to-down hierarchical cluster structure.&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n))) &gt; w_n
    w_n = max(W(N(n))) - 1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 2 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 2 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 2]]
The second rule deals with the situation where nodes in a neighborhood are on the minimum weight level. This situation can happen if, for instance, the initial configuration assigns the minimum weight to all nodes. If there is a neighborhood with all nodes having the minimum weight level, the node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; declares itself as cluster center. Even if coincidently all nodes declare themselves as cluster centers, the conflict situation will be resolved by one of the other rules.&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n)) == MIN &amp; w_n == MIN
    w_n = MAX;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 3 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 3 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 3]]
The third rule describes situations where nodes with leveraged weight values, which are not cluster centers, attract surrounding nodes with lower weights. This behavior can lead to fragmented clusters without a cluster center. In order to avoid fragmented clusters, the node with higher weight value is supposed to successively decrease its own weight with the objective to correct the fragmentation by allowing the other nodes to reconfigure according to the rules. &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n))) &lt;= w_n &amp;&amp; w_n != MAX
    w_n = w_n - 1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 4 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 4 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 4]]
The fourth rule resolves the situation where two cluster centers connect in 1-hop neighborhood and need to decide which cluster center should continue its role as cluster center. Given any specific criterion (e.g., device ID, battery power), one cluster center remains while the other cluster center is hierarchized in 1-hop neighborhood to that new cluster center. The choice of the specific criterion to resolve the decision-making depends on the used application scenario and on the available information. &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n)) == MAX &amp;&amp; w_n == MAX
    w_n = apply criterion to select a node from set (max(W(N(n)),w_n);
    w_n = w_n - 1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Examples ==

=== 1-D ===
An exemplary sequence of state transitions applying the described four rules is illustrated below.

=== 2-D ===

KHOPCA also works in a dynamic 3-D environment. The cluster connections are illustrated with bold lines.

'''Learning with errors''' ('''LWE''') is a problem in [[machine learning]] that is conjectured to be hard to solve. Introduced&lt;ref name="regev05" /&gt; by [[Oded Regev (computer scientist)|Oded Regev]] in 2005 (who won the 2018 [[Gödel Prize]] for this work), it is a generalization of the [[parity learning]] problem. Regev showed, furthermore, that the LWE problem is as hard to solve as several worst-case [[lattice problems]]. The LWE problem has recently&lt;ref name="regev05"&gt;Oded Regev, “On lattices, learning with errors, random linear codes, and cryptography,” in Proceedings of the thirty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (Baltimore, MD, USA: ACM, 2005), 84-93, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1060590.1060603.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peikert09"&gt;Chris Peikert, “Public-key cryptosystems from the worst-case shortest vector problem: extended abstract,” in Proceedings of the 41st annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (Bethesda, MD, USA: ACM, 2009), 333-342, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1536414.1536461.&lt;/ref&gt; been used as a [[Computational hardness assumption|hardness assumption]] to create [[Public-key cryptography|public-key cryptosystems]], such as the [[ring learning with errors key exchange]] by Peikert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lattice Cryptography for the Internet|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11659-4_12|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2014-10-01|isbn = 978-3-319-11658-7|pages = 197–219|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Chris|last = Peikert|editor-first = Michele|editor-last = Mosca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An algorithm is said to solve the LWE problem if, when given access to samples &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; (a [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; integers [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{Z}_q&lt;/math&gt;, with the assurance, for some fixed [[linear function]] &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{Z}_q^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q,&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with high probability and deviates from it according to some known noise model, the algorithm can recreate &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; or some close approximation of it with high probability.

== Definition ==
Denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; the additive group on reals modulo one. Denote by &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s},\phi}&lt;/math&gt; the distribution on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_q^n \times \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; obtained by choosing a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in \mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, choosing a number &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; according to a probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;  on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; and outputting &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a},\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{s} \rangle /q + e)&lt;/math&gt; for some fixed vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{s} \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i s_i&lt;/math&gt; is the standard inner product &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z}_q^n \times \mathbb{Z}_q^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q &lt;/math&gt;, the division is done in the [[field of reals]] (or more formally, this "division by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;" is notation for the group homomorphism &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z}_q \longrightarrow \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; mapping &lt;math&gt; 1 \in \mathbb{Z}_q &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; 1/q + \mathbb{Z} \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;), and the final addition is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''learning with errors problem''' &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is to find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;, given access to polynomially many samples of choice from &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s},\phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

For every &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, denote by &lt;math&gt;D_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; the one-dimensional [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] with density function &lt;math&gt;D_\alpha(x)=\rho_\alpha(x)/\alpha&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\rho_\alpha(x)=e^{-\pi(|x|/\alpha)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\Psi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be the distribution on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; obtained by considering &lt;math&gt;D_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; modulo one.  The version of LWE considered in most of the results would be &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\Psi_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

== Decision version ==

The '''LWE''' problem described above is the ''search'' version of the problem. In the ''decision'' version ('''DLWE'''), the goal is to distinguish between noisy inner products and uniformly random samples from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_q^n \times \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; (practically, some discretized version of it). Regev&lt;ref name="regev05" /&gt; showed that the ''decision'' and ''search'' versions are equivalent when &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a prime bounded by some polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Solving decision assuming search ===
Intuitively, if we have a procedure for the search problem, the decision version can be solved easily: just feed the input samples for the decision problem to the solver for the search problem. Denote the given samples by &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{a_i},\mathbf{b_i})\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n_q \times \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. If the solver returns a candidate &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, calculate &lt;math&gt;\{\langle \mathbf{a_i}, \mathbf{s} \rangle - \mathbf{b_i} \} &lt;/math&gt;.  If the samples are from an LWE distribution, then the results of this calculation will be distributed according &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, but if the samples are uniformly random, these quantities will be distributed uniformly as well.

=== Solving search assuming decision ===
For the other direction, given a solver for the decision problem, the search version can be solved as follows: Recover &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; one coordinate at a time. To obtain the first coordinate, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_1&lt;/math&gt;, make a guess &lt;math&gt;k \in Z_q&lt;/math&gt;, and do the following. Choose a number &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbb{Z}_q&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random. Transform the given samples &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{a_i},\mathbf{b_i})\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n_q \times \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; as follows. Calculate &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{a_i}+(r,0,\ldots,0),\mathbf{b_i}+(r k)/q)\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Send the transformed samples to the decision solver.

If the guess &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; was correct, the transformation takes the distribution &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s},\chi}&lt;/math&gt; to itself, and otherwise, since &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is prime, it takes it to the uniform distribution. So, given a polynomial-time solver for the decision problem that errs with very small probability, since &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by some polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, it only takes polynomial time to guess every possible value for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and use the solver to see which one is correct.

After obtaining &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_1&lt;/math&gt;, we follow an analogous procedure for each other coordinate &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_j&lt;/math&gt;.  Namely, we transform our &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b_i}&lt;/math&gt; samples the same way, and transform our &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_i}&lt;/math&gt; samples by calculating &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_i} + (0, \ldots, r, \ldots, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is in the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; coordinate.&lt;ref name="regev05" /&gt;

Peikert&lt;ref name="peikert09" /&gt; showed that this reduction, with a small modification, works for any &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; that is a product of distinct, small (polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) primes.  The main idea is if &lt;math&gt;q = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_t&lt;/math&gt;, for each &lt;math&gt;q_{\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, guess and check to see if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_j&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to &lt;math&gt;0 \mod q_{\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, and then use the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] to recover &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_j&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Average case hardness ===
Regev&lt;ref name="regev05" /&gt; showed the [[random self-reducibility]] of the '''LWE''' and '''DLWE''' problems for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;.  Given samples &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{a_i},\mathbf{b_i})\}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s},\chi}&lt;/math&gt;, it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{a_i},\mathbf{b_i} + \langle \mathbf{a_i}, \mathbf{t} \rangle)/q\}&lt;/math&gt; are samples from &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s} + \mathbf{t},\chi}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, suppose there was some set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} \subset \mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{S}|/|\mathbb{Z}_q^n| = 1/\operatorname{poly}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and for distributions &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s'},\chi}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s'} \leftarrow \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, '''DLWE''' was easy.

Then there would be some distinguisher &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, who, given samples &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{a_i},\mathbf{b_i}) \}&lt;/math&gt;, could tell whether they were uniformly random or from &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s'},\chi}&lt;/math&gt;.  If we need to distinguish uniformly random samples from &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathbf{s},\chi}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen uniformly at random from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;, we could simply try different values &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t} &lt;/math&gt; sampled uniformly at random from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;, calculate &lt;math&gt;\{(\mathbf{a_i},\mathbf{b_i} + \langle \mathbf{a_i}, \mathbf{t} \rangle)/q\}&lt;/math&gt; and feed these samples to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; comprises a large fraction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_q^n&lt;/math&gt;, with high probability, if we choose a polynomial number of values for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}&lt;/math&gt;, we will find one such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} + \mathbf{t} \in \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; will successfully distinguish the samples.

Thus, no such &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; can exist, meaning '''LWE''' and '''DLWE''' are (up to a polynomial factor) as hard in the average case as they are in the worst case.

== Hardness results ==

=== Regev's result ===
For a n-dimensional lattice &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, let ''smoothing parameter'' &lt;math&gt;\eta_\varepsilon(L)&lt;/math&gt; denote the smallest &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\rho_{1/s}(L^*\setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}) \leq \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; is the dual of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_\alpha(x)=e^{-\pi(|x|/\alpha)^2}&lt;/math&gt; is extended to sets by summing over function values at each element in the set. Let &lt;math&gt;D_{L,r}&lt;/math&gt; denote the discrete Gaussian distribution on &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of width &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; for a lattice &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and real &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The probability of each &lt;math&gt;x \in L&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\rho_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''discrete Gaussian sampling problem''(DGS) is defined as follows: An instance of &lt;math&gt;DGS_\phi&lt;/math&gt; is given by an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional lattice &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and a number &lt;math&gt;r \geq \phi(L)&lt;/math&gt;. The goal is to output a sample from &lt;math&gt;D_{L,r}&lt;/math&gt;. Regev shows that there is a reduction from &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GapSVP}_{100\sqrt{n}\gamma(n)}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;DGS_{\sqrt{n}\gamma(n)/\lambda(L^*)}&lt;/math&gt; for any function &lt;math&gt;\gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Regev then shows that there exists an efficient quantum algorithm for &lt;math&gt;DGS_{\sqrt{2n}\eta_\varepsilon(L)/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; given access to an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\Psi_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for integer &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha q &gt; 2\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This implies the hardness for LWE. Although the proof of this assertion works for any &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, for creating a cryptosystem, the &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; has to be polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Peikert's result ===

Peikert proves&lt;ref name="peikert09" /&gt; that there is a probabilistic polynomial time reduction from the [[Lattice problems#GapSVP|&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GapSVP}_{\zeta,\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;]] problem in the worst case to solving &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\Psi_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{poly}(n)&lt;/math&gt; samples for parameters &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma(n)\geq n/(\alpha \sqrt{\log n})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\zeta(n) \geq \gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q \geq (\zeta/\sqrt{n}) \omega \sqrt{\log n})&lt;/math&gt;.

== Use in cryptography ==

The '''LWE''' problem serves as a versatile problem used in construction of several&lt;ref name="regev05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="peikert09" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Peikert and Brent Waters, “Lossy trapdoor functions and their applications,” in Proceedings of the 40th annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada: ACM, 2008), 187-196, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1374406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Gentry, Chris Peikert, and Vinod Vaikuntanathan, “Trapdoors for hard lattices and new cryptographic constructions,” in Proceedings of the 40th annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada: ACM, 2008), 197-206, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1374407.&lt;/ref&gt; cryptosystems. In 2005, Regev&lt;ref name="regev05" /&gt; showed that the decision version of LWE is hard assuming quantum hardness of the [[lattice problems]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GapSVP}_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; as above) and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SIVP}_t&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; t=O(n/\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;). In 2009, Peikert&lt;ref name="peikert09" /&gt; proved a similar result assuming only the classical hardness of the related problem [[Lattice problems#GapSVP|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GapSVP}_{\zeta,\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;]]. The disadvantage of Peikert's result is that it bases itself on a non-standard version of an easier (when compared to SIVP) problem GapSVP.

=== Public-key cryptosystem ===
Regev&lt;ref name="regev05" /&gt; proposed a [[public-key cryptosystem]] based on the hardness of the '''LWE''' problem. The cryptosystem as well as the proof of security and correctness are completely classical. The system is characterized by &lt;math&gt;m,q&lt;/math&gt; and a probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. The setting of the parameters used in proofs of correctness and security is
* &lt;math&gt;q \geq 2 &lt;/math&gt;, a prime number between &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2n^2&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;m=(1+\varepsilon)(n+1) \log q&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary constant &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\chi=\Psi_{\alpha(n)}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha(n) \in o(1/\sqrt{n}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;

The cryptosystem is then defined by:
* ''Private Key'': Private key is an &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}\in \mathbb{Z}^n_q&lt;/math&gt; chosen uniformly at random.
* ''Public Key'': Choose &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; vectors &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_m \in  \mathbb{Z}^n_q&lt;/math&gt; uniformly and independently. Choose error offsets &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots,e_m \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; independently according to &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;. The public key consists of &lt;math&gt;(a_i,b_i=\langle a_i,\mathbf{s} \rangle/q + e_i)^m_{i=1}&lt;/math&gt;
* ''Encryption'': The encryption of a bit &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is done by choosing a random subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[m]&lt;/math&gt; and then defining &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Enc}(x)&lt;/math&gt; as
:: &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{i \in S} a_i, \frac x 2 + \sum_{i \in S} b_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;
* ''Decryption'': The decryption of &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;b-\langle a, \mathbf{s} \rangle/q&lt;/math&gt; is closer to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; than to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

The proof of correctness follows from choice of parameters and some probability analysis. The proof of security is by reduction to the decision version of '''LWE''': an algorithm for distinguishing between encryptions (with above parameters) of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; can be used to distinguish between &lt;math&gt;A_{s,\chi}&lt;/math&gt; and the uniform distribution over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n_q \times \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;

=== CCA-secure cryptosystem ===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Peikert&lt;ref name="peikert09" /&gt; proposed a system that is secure even against any [[chosen-ciphertext attack]].

=== Key exchange ===
The idea of using LWE and Ring LWE for key exchange was proposed and filed at the University of Cincinnati in 2011 by Jintai Ding. The idea comes from the associativity of matrix multiplications, and the errors are used to provide the security. The paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Jintai Ding, Xiang Xie, Xiaodong|date=2012-01-01|title=A Simple Provably Secure Key Exchange Scheme Based on the Learning with Errors Problem|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/688}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in 2012 after a provisional patent application was filed in 2012.

The security of the protocol is proven based on the hardness of solving the LWE problem. In 2014, Peikert presented a key-transport scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peikert|first=Chris|date=2014-01-01|title=Lattice Cryptography for the Internet|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/070}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the same basic idea of Ding's, where the new idea of sending an additional 1-bit signal for rounding in Ding's construction is also used. The "new hope" implementation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alkim|first=Erdem|last2=Ducas|first2=Léo|last3=Pöppelmann|first3=Thomas|last4=Schwabe|first4=Peter|date=2015-01-01|title=Post-quantum key exchange - a new hope|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1092}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected for Google's post-quantum experiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html|title=Experimenting with Post-Quantum Cryptography|newspaper=Google Online Security Blog|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses Peikert's scheme with variation in the error distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">[[File:Puntos fijos.svg|thumb|150px|The function ''f''(''x'')=''x''²-4 has two fixed points, shown as the intersection with the blue line; its least one is at 1/2-{{sqrt|17}}/2.]]
In [[order theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''least fixed point''' ('''lfp''' or '''LFP''', sometimes also '''smallest fixed point''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from a [[partially ordered set]] to itself is the [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] which is less than each other fixed point, according to the set's order. A function need not have a least fixed point, and cannot have more than one.

For example, with the usual order on the real numbers, the least fixed point of the real function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''² is ''x'' = 0 (since the only other fixed point is 1 and 0 &amp;lt; 1). In contrast, ''f''(''x'') = ''x''+1 has no fixed point at all, let alone a least one, and ''f''(''x'')=''x'' has infinitely many fixed points, but no least one.

==Applications==
Many [[fixed-point theorem]]s yield algorithms for locating the least fixed point. Least fixed points often have desirable properties that arbitrary fixed points do not.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], the least fixed point is related to making [[Recursion|recursive]] definitions (see [[domain theory]] and/or [[denotational semantics]] for details).

[[Neil Immerman|Immerman]] &lt;ref&gt;N. Immerman, Relational queries computable in polynomial time, Information and Control 68 (1–3) (1986) 86–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Immerman | first = Neil | title = Relational Queries Computable in Polynomial Time | booktitle = STOC '82: Proceedings of the fourteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing | year = 1982 | pages = 147–152 | doi = 10.1145/800070.802187}}  Revised version in ''Information and Control'', 68 (1986), 86–104.&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Moshe Y. Vardi|Vardi]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Vardi | first = Moshe Y. | title = The Complexity of Relational Query Languages | booktitle = STOC '82: Proceedings of the fourteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing | year = 1982 | pages = 137–146 | doi = 10.1145/800070.802186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
independently showed the [[descriptive complexity]] result that the [[P (complexity)|polynomial-time computable properties]] of linearly ordered structures are definable in [[FO(LFP)]], i.e. in [[first-order logic]] with a least fixed point operator. However, FO(LFP) is too weak to express all polynomial-time properties of unordered structures (for instance that a structure has even size).

==Examples==
Let ''G=(V,A)'' be a [[directed graph]] and ''v'' be a vertex. The set of nodes accessible from ''v'' can be defined as the set ''S'' which is the least fixed-point for the property: ''v'' belongs to ''S'' and if ''w'' belongs to ''S'' and there is an edge from ''w'' to ''x'', then ''x'' belongs to ''S''.
The set of nodes which are co-accessible from ''v'' is defined by a similar least fix-point. On the one hand the [[strongly connected component]] of ''v'' is the intersection of those two least fixed-point.

Let ''G'' be a proper [[context-free grammar]]. The set ''E'' of symbols which produces the emptyword is defined as the least fixed-point which contains the symbols ''S'' such that &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, or such that  &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow S^0,\dots,S^n&lt;/math&gt; where all symbols &lt;math&gt;S^i&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''E''.

==Greatest fixed points==
Greatest fixed points can also be determined, but they are less commonly used than least fixed points.  However, in [[computer science]] they, analogously to the least fixed point, give rise to [[Corecursion|corecursion and codata]].

==T-alike and T-opposite edges==
For any [[depth-first search]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'', the [[graph theory|edges]]
encountered when discovering a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] for the first time define a depth-first search tree ''T'' of ''G''. This is a [[Trémaux tree]], meaning that the remaining edges (the '''cotree''') each connect a pair of vertices that are related to each other as an ancestor and descendant in&amp;nbsp;''T''. Three types of patterns can be used to define two relations between pairs of cotree edges, named the '''''T''-alike''' and '''''T''-opposite''' relations.

In the following figures, simple circle nodes represent vertices, double circle nodes represent subtrees, twisted segments represent tree paths, and curved arcs represent cotree edges. The root of each tree is shown at the bottom of the figure. In the first figure, the edges labeled &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are ''T''-alike, meaning that, at the endpoints nearest the root of the tree, they will both be on the same side of the tree in every planar drawing. In the next two figures, the edges with the same labels are ''T''-opposite, meaning that they will be on different sides of the tree in every planar drawing.

{| cellpadding="12"
|[[Image:leftright1.png|thumb|&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are T-alike]]||[[Image:leftright2.png|thumb|&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are T-opposite]]||[[Image:leftright3.png|thumb|&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are T-opposite]]
|}

==The characterization==
Let ''G'' be a graph and let ''T'' be a Trémaux tree of ''G''. The graph ''G'' is planar if and only if there exists a partition of the cotree edges of ''G'' into two classes so that any two edges belong to a same class if they are ''T''-alike and any two edges belong to different classes if they are ''T''-opposite.

This characterization immediately leads to an (inefficient) planarity test: determine for all pairs of edges whether they are ''T''-alike or ''T''-opposite, form an auxiliary graph that has a vertex for each
[[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of  ''T''-alike edges and an edge for each pair of  ''T''-opposite edges, and check whether this auxiliary graph is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]]. Making this algorithm efficient involves finding a subset of the  ''T''-alike and ''T''-opposite pairs that is sufficient to carry out this method without determining the relation between all edge pairs in the input graph.

{{redirect|Mathematical formalism|the philosophical view|Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)}}
'''Mathematical logic''' is a subfield of [[mathematics]] exploring the applications of formal [[logic]] to mathematics.  It bears close connections to [[metamathematics]], the [[foundations of mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;Undergraduate texts include Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey [[#CITEREFBoolosBurgessJeffrey2002|(2002)]], [[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]] [[#CITEREFEnderton2001|(2001)]], and Mendelson [[#CITEREFMendelson1997|(1997)]]. A classic graduate text by Shoenfield [[#CITEREFShoenfield2001|(2001)]] first appeared in 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of [[formal system]]s and the [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] power of formal [[Mathematical proof|proof]] systems.
 
Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of [[set theory]], [[model theory]], [[recursion theory]], and [[proof theory]].  These areas share basic results on logic, particularly [[first-order logic]], and [[definable set|definability]]. In computer science (particularly in the [[ACM Computing Classification System|ACM Classification]]) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see [[Logic in computer science]] for those.

Since its inception, mathematical logic has both contributed to, and has been motivated by, the study of [[foundations of mathematics]]. This study began in the late 19th century with the development of [[axiom]]atic frameworks for [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], and [[analysis]]. In the early 20th century it was shaped by [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert's program|program]] to prove the consistency of foundational theories. Results of [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Gerhard Gentzen]], and others provided partial resolution to the program, and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency. Work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets, although there are some theorems that cannot be proven in common axiom systems for set theory. Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems (as in [[reverse mathematics]]) rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed.

==Subfields and scope==

The ''Handbook of Mathematical Logic'' {{harv|Barwise|1989}} makes a rough division of contemporary mathematical logic into four areas:
#[[set theory]]
#[[model theory]]
#[[recursion theory]], and
#[[proof theory]] and [[constructive mathematics]] (considered as parts of a single area).
Each area has a distinct focus, although many techniques and results are shared among multiple areas. The borderlines amongst these fields, and the lines separating mathematical logic and other fields of mathematics, are not always sharp.  [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] marks not only a milestone in recursion theory and proof theory, but has also led to [[Löb's theorem]] in modal logic. The method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] is employed in set theory, model theory, and recursion theory, as well as in the study of intuitionistic mathematics.

The mathematical field of [[category theory]] uses many formal axiomatic methods, and includes the study of [[categorical logic]], but category theory is not ordinarily considered a subfield of mathematical logic. Because of its applicability in diverse fields of mathematics, mathematicians including [[Saunders Mac Lane]] have proposed category theory as a foundational system for mathematics, independent of set theory. These foundations use [[topos]]es, which resemble generalized models of set theory that may employ classical or nonclassical logic.

==History==
Mathematical logic emerged in the mid-19th century as a subfield of mathematics, reflecting the confluence of two traditions: formal philosophical logic and mathematics ([[#CITEREFFerreirós2001|Ferreirós 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;443).  "Mathematical logic, also called  'logistic', 'symbolic logic', the '[[Boolean algebra|algebra of logic]]', and, more recently, simply 'formal logic', is the set of logical theories elaborated in the course of the last [nineteenth] century with the aid of an artificial notation and a rigorously deductive method."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jozef Maria Bochenski]], ''A Precis of Mathematical Logic'' (1959), rev. and trans., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, Dordrecht, South Holland:  Reidel, Sec. 0.1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this emergence, logic was studied with [[rhetoric]], with ''calculationes'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swineshead]] (1498), ''Calculationes Suiseth Anglici'', Papie: Per Franciscum Gyrardengum.&lt;/ref&gt; through the [[syllogism]], and with [[philosophy]].  The first half of the 20th century saw an explosion of fundamental results, accompanied by vigorous debate over the foundations of mathematics.

=== Early history ===
{{Further|History of logic}}
Theories of logic were developed in many cultures in history, including [[Logic in China|China]], [[Logic in India|India]], [[Logic in Greece|Greece]] and the [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic world]]. In 18th-century Europe, attempts to treat the operations of formal logic in a symbolic or algebraic way had been made by philosophical mathematicians including [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert|Lambert]], but their labors remained isolated and little known.

=== 19th century ===

&lt;!-- symbolic logic --&gt;
In the middle of the nineteenth century, [[George Boole]] and then [[Augustus De Morgan]] presented systematic mathematical treatments of logic.  Their work, building on work by algebraists such as [[George Peacock]], extended the traditional Aristotelian doctrine of logic into a sufficient framework for the study of [[foundations of mathematics]]&amp;nbsp;([[#CITEREFKatz1998|Katz 1998]], p.&amp;nbsp;686).

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] built upon the work of Boole to develop a logical system for relations and quantifiers, which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885.
[[Gottlob Frege]] presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', published in 1879, a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic. Frege's work remained obscure, however, until [[Bertrand Russell]] began to promote it near the turn of the century.  The two-dimensional notation Frege developed was never widely adopted and is unused in contemporary texts.

From 1890 to 1905, [[Ernst Schröder]] published ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik'' in three volumes. This work summarized and extended the work of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce, and was a comprehensive reference to symbolic logic as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.

==== Foundational theories ====

Concerns that mathematics had not been built on a proper foundation led to the development of axiomatic systems for fundamental areas of mathematics such as arithmetic, analysis, and geometry.

&lt;!-- arithmetic --&gt;
In logic, the term ''arithmetic'' refers to the theory of the [[natural number]]s. [[Giuseppe Peano]] ([[#CITEREFPeano1889|1889]]) published a set of axioms for arithmetic that came to bear his name ([[Peano axioms]]), using a variation of the logical system of Boole and Schröder but adding quantifiers. Peano was unaware of Frege's work at the time. Around the same time [[Richard Dedekind]] showed that the natural numbers are uniquely characterized by their [[mathematical induction|induction]] properties. Dedekind ([[#CITEREFDedekind1888|1888]]) proposed a different characterization, which lacked the formal logical character of Peano's axioms. Dedekind's work, however, proved theorems inaccessible in Peano's system, including the uniqueness of the set of natural numbers (up to isomorphism) and the  recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the [[successor function]] and mathematical induction.

&lt;!-- geometry --&gt;
In the mid-19th century, flaws in Euclid's axioms for geometry became known ([[#CITEREFKatz1998|Katz 1998]], p.&amp;nbsp;774).  In addition to the independence of the [[parallel postulate]], established by [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] in 1826 ([[#CITEREFLobachevsky1840|Lobachevsky 1840]]), mathematicians discovered that certain theorems taken for granted by Euclid were not in fact provable from his axioms. Among these is the theorem that a line contains at least two points, or that circles of the same radius whose centers are separated by that radius must intersect. Hilbert ([[#CITEREFHilbert1899|1899]]) developed a complete set of [[Hilbert's axioms|axioms for geometry]], building on [[Pasch's axiom|previous work]] by Pasch ([[#CITEREFPasch1882|1882]]).  The success in axiomatizing geometry motivated Hilbert to seek complete axiomatizations of other areas of mathematics, such as the natural numbers and the [[real line]].  This would prove to be a major area of research in the first half of the 20th century.

The 19th century saw great advances in the theory of [[real analysis]], including theories of convergence of functions and [[Fourier series]]. Mathematicians such as [[Karl Weierstrass]] began to construct functions that stretched intuition, such as [[Continuous, nowhere differentiable function|nowhere-differentiable continuous functions]]. Previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation, or a smooth graph, were no longer adequate.  Weierstrass began to advocate the [[arithmetization of analysis]], which sought to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers. The modern [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[continuous function]]s was already developed by [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] in 1817 ([[#CITEREFFelscher2000|Felscher 2000]]), but remained relatively unknown.
[[Cauchy]] in 1821 defined continuity in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s (see Cours d'Analyse, page 34).  In 1858, Dedekind proposed a definition of the real numbers in terms of [[Dedekind cuts]] of rational numbers [[#CITEREFDedekind1872|(Dedekind 1872)]], a definition still employed in contemporary texts.

[[Georg Cantor]] developed the fundamental concepts of infinite set theory. His early results developed the theory of [[cardinality]] and [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|proved]] that the reals and the natural numbers have different cardinalities (Cantor 1874). Over the next twenty years, Cantor developed a theory of [[transfinite number]]s in a series of publications. In 1891, he published a new proof of the uncountability of the real numbers that introduced the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], and used this method to prove [[Cantor's theorem]] that no set can have the same cardinality as its [[powerset]]. Cantor believed that every set could be [[well-ordered]], but was unable to produce a proof for this result, leaving it as an open problem in 1895 ([[#CITEREFKatz1998|Katz 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;807]]).

=== 20th century ===
In the early decades of the 20th century, the main areas of study were set theory and formal logic. The discovery of paradoxes in informal set theory caused some to wonder whether mathematics itself is inconsistent, and to look for proofs of consistency.

In 1900, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] posed a famous list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 problems]] for the next century. The first two of these were to resolve the [[continuum hypothesis]] and prove the consistency of elementary arithmetic, respectively; the tenth was to produce a method that could decide whether a multivariate polynomial equation over the [[integer]]s has a solution. Subsequent work to resolve these problems shaped the direction of mathematical logic, as did the effort to resolve Hilbert's ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', posed in 1928. This problem asked for a procedure that would decide, given a formalized mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false.

==== Set theory and paradoxes ====

[[Ernst Zermelo]] ([[#CITEREFZermelo1904|1904]]) gave a proof that every set could be well-ordered, a result [[Georg Cantor]] had been unable to obtain. To achieve the proof, Zermelo introduced the [[axiom of choice]], which drew heated debate and research among mathematicians and the pioneers of set theory. The immediate criticism of the method led Zermelo to publish a second exposition of his result, directly addressing criticisms of his proof ([[#CITEREFZermelo1908a|Zermelo 1908a]]). This paper led to the general acceptance of the axiom of choice in the mathematics community.

Skepticism about the axiom of choice was reinforced by recently discovered paradoxes in naive set theory. [[Cesare Burali-Forti]] ([[#CITEREFBurali-Forti1897|1897]]) was the first to state a paradox: the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] shows that the collection of all [[ordinal number]]s cannot form a set. Very soon thereafter, [[Bertrand Russell]] discovered [[Russell's paradox]] in 1901, and [[Jules Richard]] ([[#CITEREFRichard1905|1905]]) discovered [[Richard's paradox]].

Zermelo ([[#CITEREFZermelo1908b|1908b]]) provided the first set of axioms for set theory. These axioms, together with the additional [[axiom of replacement]] proposed by [[Abraham Fraenkel]], are now called [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF). Zermelo's axioms incorporated the principle of [[limitation of size]] to avoid Russell's paradox.

In 1910, the first volume of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] was published. This seminal work developed the theory of functions and cardinality in a completely formal framework of [[type theory]], which Russell and Whitehead developed in an effort to avoid the paradoxes. ''Principia Mathematica'' is considered one of the most influential works of the 20th century, although the framework of type theory did not prove popular as a foundational theory for mathematics ([[#CITEREFFerreirós2001|Ferreirós 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;445).

Fraenkel ([[#CITEREFFraenkel1922|1922]]) proved that the axiom of choice cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo's set theory with [[urelements]]. Later work by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] ([[#CITEREFCohen1966|1966]]) showed that the addition of urelements is not needed, and the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF. Cohen's proof developed the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], which is now an important tool for establishing [[independence result]]s in set theory.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvnb|Cohen|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Symbolic logic ====

[[Leopold Löwenheim]] ([[#CITEREFLöwenheim1915|1915]]) and [[Thoralf Skolem]] ([[#CITEREFSkolem1920|1920]]) obtained the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which says that [[first-order logic]] cannot control the cardinalities of infinite structures. Skolem realized that this theorem would apply to first-order formalizations of set theory, and that it implies any such formalization has a [[countable]] [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]]. This counterintuitive fact became known as [[Skolem's paradox]].

In his doctoral thesis, [[Kurt Gödel]] ([[#CITEREFGödel1929|1929]]) proved the [[completeness theorem]], which establishes a correspondence between syntax and semantics in first-order logic. Gödel used the completeness theorem to prove the [[compactness theorem]], demonstrating the finitary nature of first-order [[logical consequence]]. These results helped establish first-order logic as the dominant logic used by mathematicians.

In 1931, Gödel published ''[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems]]'', which proved the incompleteness (in a different meaning of the word) of all sufficiently strong, effective first-order theories. This result, known as [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], establishes severe limitations on axiomatic foundations for mathematics, striking a strong blow to Hilbert's program. It showed the impossibility of providing a consistency proof of arithmetic within any formal theory of arithmetic.  Hilbert, however, did not acknowledge the importance of the incompleteness theorem for some time.&lt;ref&gt;In the foreword to the 1934 first edition of "[[Grundlagen der Mathematik]]" {{harv|Hilbert|Bernays|1934}}, Bernays wrote the following, which is reminiscent of the famous note by [[Gottlob Frege#Work as a logician|Frege]] when informed of Russell's paradox.&lt;blockquote style="margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;"Die Ausführung dieses Vorhabens hat eine wesentliche Verzögerung dadurch erfahren, daß in einem Stadium, in dem die Darstellung schon ihrem Abschuß nahe war, durch das Erscheinen der Arbeiten von Herbrand und von Gödel eine veränderte Situation im Gebiet der Beweistheorie entstand, welche die Berücksichtigung neuer Einsichten zur Aufgabe machte. Dabei ist der Umfang des Buches angewachsen, so daß eine Teilung in zwei Bände angezeigt erschien."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Translation: &lt;blockquote style="margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;"Carrying out this plan [by Hilbert for an exposition on proof theory for mathematical logic] has experienced an essential delay because, at the stage at which the exposition was already near to its conclusion, there occurred an altered situation in the area of proof theory due to the appearance of works by Herbrand and Gödel, which necessitated the consideration of new insights. Thus the scope of this book has grown, so that a division into two volumes seemed advisable."&lt;/blockquote&gt; So certainly Hilbert was aware of the importance of Gödel's work by 1934. The second volume in 1939 included a form of Gentzen's consistency proof for arithmetic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gödel's theorem shows that a consistency proof of any sufficiently strong, effective axiom system cannot be obtained in the system itself, if the system is consistent, nor in any weaker system. This leaves open the possibility of consistency proofs that cannot be formalized within the system they consider. Gentzen ([[#CITEREFGentzen1936|1936]]) proved the consistency of arithmetic using a finitistic system together with a principle of [[transfinite induction]]. Gentzen's result introduced the ideas of [[cut elimination]] and [[proof-theoretic ordinal]]s, which became key tools in proof theory.  Gödel ([[#CITEREFGödel1958|1958]]) gave a different consistency proof, which reduces the consistency of classical arithmetic to that of intuitionistic arithmetic in higher types.

====Beginnings of the other branches====

[[Alfred Tarski]] developed the basics of [[model theory]].

Beginning in 1935, a group of prominent mathematicians collaborated under the pseudonym [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] to publish a series of encyclopedic mathematics texts. These texts, written in an austere and axiomatic style, emphasized rigorous presentation and set-theoretic foundations. Terminology coined by these texts, such as the words [[bijection, injection, and surjection|''bijection'', ''injection'', and ''surjection'']], and the set-theoretic foundations the texts employed, were widely adopted throughout mathematics.

The study of computability came to be known as recursion theory, because early formalizations by Gödel and Kleene relied on recursive definitions of functions.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed study of this terminology is given by Soare ([[#CITEREFSoare1996|1996]]).&lt;/ref&gt; When these definitions were shown equivalent to Turing's formalization involving Turing machines, it became clear that a new concept &amp;ndash; the [[computable function]] &amp;ndash; had been discovered, and that this definition was robust enough to admit numerous independent characterizations. In his work on the incompleteness theorems in 1931, Gödel lacked a rigorous concept of an effective formal system; he immediately realized that the new definitions of computability could be used for this purpose, allowing him to state the incompleteness theorems in generality that could only be implied in the original paper.

Numerous results in recursion theory were obtained in the 1940s by [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] and [[Emil Leon Post]]. Kleene ([[#CITEREFKleene1943|1943]]) introduced the concepts of relative computability, foreshadowed by Turing ([[#CITEREFTuring1939|1939]]), and the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]. Kleene later generalized recursion theory to higher-order functionals. Kleene and Kreisel studied formal versions of intuitionistic mathematics, particularly in the context of proof theory.
&lt;!-- Perhaps it is better to stop this history around 1950 --&gt;

== Formal logical systems {{anchor|Formal logic}} ==

At its core, mathematical logic deals with mathematical concepts expressed using formal [[logical system]]s. These systems, though they differ in many details, share the common property of considering only expressions in a fixed formal language.  The systems of [[propositional logic]] and [[first-order logic]] are the most widely studied today, because of their applicability to [[foundations of mathematics]] and because of their desirable proof-theoretic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreirós ([[#CITEREFFerreirós2001|2001]]) surveys the rise of first-order logic over other formal logics in the early 20th century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stronger classical logics such as [[second-order logic]] or [[infinitary logic]] are also studied, along with nonclassical logics such as [[intuitionistic logic]].

=== First-order logic ===
{{Main|First-order logic}}
'''First-order logic''' is a particular [[logical system|formal system of logic]]. Its [[syntax]] involves only finite expressions as well-formed formulas, while its [[semantics]] are characterized by the limitation of all [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] to a fixed [[domain of discourse]].

Early results from formal logic established limitations of first-order logic. The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] (1919) showed that if a set of sentences in a countable first-order language has an infinite model then it has at least one model of each infinite cardinality. This shows that it is impossible for a set of first-order axioms to characterize the natural numbers, the real numbers, or any other infinite structure up to [[isomorphism]]. As the goal of early foundational studies was to produce axiomatic theories for all parts of mathematics, this limitation was particularly stark.

[[Gödel's completeness theorem]] ([[#CITEREFGödel1929|Gödel 1929]]) established the equivalence between semantic and syntactic definitions of [[logical consequence]] in first-order logic. It shows that if a particular sentence is true in every model that satisfies a particular set of axioms, then there must be a finite deduction of the sentence from the axioms. The [[compactness theorem]] first appeared as a lemma in Gödel's proof of the completeness theorem, and it took many years before logicians grasped its significance and began to apply it routinely. It says that a set of sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset has a model, or in other words that an inconsistent set of formulas must have a finite inconsistent subset. The completeness and compactness theorems allow for sophisticated analysis of logical consequence in first-order logic and the development of [[model theory]], and they are a key reason for the prominence of first-order logic in mathematics.

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] ([[#CITEREFGödel1931|Gödel 1931]]) establish additional limits on first-order axiomatizations. The '''first incompleteness theorem''' states that for any consistent, effectively given (defined below) logical system that is capable of interpreting arithmetic, there exists a statement that is true (in the sense that it holds for the natural numbers) but not provable within that logical system (and which indeed may fail in some [[non-standard model of arithmetic|non-standard models of arithmetic]] which may be consistent with the logical system). For example, in every logical system capable of expressing the [[Peano axioms]], the Gödel sentence holds for the natural numbers but cannot be proved.

Here a logical system is said to be effectively given if it is possible to decide, given any formula in the language of the system, whether the formula is an axiom, and one which can express the Peano axioms is called "sufficiently strong." When applied to first-order logic, the first incompleteness theorem implies that any sufficiently strong, consistent, effective first-order theory has models that are not [[elementary substructure|elementarily equivalent]], a stronger limitation than the one established by the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem. The '''second incompleteness theorem''' states that no sufficiently strong, consistent, effective axiom system for arithmetic can prove its own consistency, which has been interpreted to show that Hilbert's program cannot be completed.

=== Other classical logics ===

Many logics besides first-order logic are studied.  These include [[infinitary logics]], which allow for formulas to provide an infinite amount of information, and [[higher-order logic]]s, which include a portion of set theory directly in their semantics.

The most well studied infinitary logic is &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1,\omega}&lt;/math&gt;. In this logic, quantifiers may only be nested to finite depths, as in first-order logic, but formulas may have finite or countably infinite conjunctions and disjunctions within them. Thus, for example, it is possible to say that an object is a whole number using a formula of &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1,\omega}&lt;/math&gt; such as
:&lt;math&gt;(x = 0) \lor (x = 1) \lor (x = 2) \lor \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Higher-order logics allow for quantification not only of elements of the domain of discourse, but subsets of the domain of discourse, sets of such subsets, and other objects of higher type. The semantics are defined so that, rather than having a separate domain for each higher-type quantifier to range over, the quantifiers instead range over all objects of the appropriate type.  The logics studied before the development of first-order logic, for example Frege's logic, had similar set-theoretic aspects. Although higher-order logics are more expressive, allowing complete axiomatizations of structures such as the natural numbers, they do not satisfy analogues of the completeness and compactness theorems from first-order logic, and are thus less amenable to proof-theoretic analysis.

Another type of logics are {{vanchor|fixed-point logic}}s that allow [[inductive definition]]s, like one writes for [[primitive recursive function]]s.

One can formally define an extension of first-order logic &amp;mdash; a notion which encompasses all logics in this section because they behave like first-order logic in certain fundamental ways, but does not encompass all logics in general, e.g. it does not encompass intuitionistic, modal or [[fuzzy logic]]. [[Lindström's theorem]] implies that the only extension of first-order logic satisfying both the [[compactness theorem]] and the Downward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] is first-order logic.

=== Nonclassical and modal logic ===

[[Modal logic]]s include additional modal operators, such as an operator which states that a particular formula is not only true, but necessarily true. Although modal logic is not often used to axiomatize mathematics, it has been used to study the properties of first-order provability ([[#CITEREFSolovay1976|Solovay 1976]]) and set-theoretic forcing ([[#CITEREFHamkinsLöwe|Hamkins and Löwe 2007]]).

[[Intuitionistic logic]] was developed by Heyting to study Brouwer's program of intuitionism, in which Brouwer himself avoided formalization. Intuitionistic logic specifically does not include the [[law of the excluded middle]], which states that each sentence is either true or its negation is true.  Kleene's work with the proof theory of intuitionistic logic showed that constructive information can be recovered from intuitionistic proofs. For example, any provably total function in intuitionistic arithmetic is [[computable]]; this is not true in classical theories of arithmetic such as [[Peano arithmetic]].

=== Algebraic logic ===

[[Algebraic logic]] uses the methods of [[abstract algebra]] to study the semantics of formal logics. A fundamental example is the use of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] to represent [[truth value]]s in classical propositional logic, and the use of [[Heyting algebra]]s to represent truth values in intuitionistic propositional logic. Stronger logics, such as first-order logic and higher-order logic, are studied using more complicated algebraic structures such as [[cylindric algebra]]s.

== Set theory ==
{{Main|Set theory}}

'''[[Set theory]]''' is the study of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], which are abstract collections of objects. Many of the basic notions, such as ordinal and cardinal numbers, were developed informally by Cantor before formal axiomatizations of set theory were developed. The [[Zermelo set theory|first such axiomatization]], due to Zermelo ([[#CITEREFZermelo1908b|1908b]]), was extended slightly to become [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF), which is now the most widely used foundational theory for mathematics.

Other formalizations of set theory have been proposed, including [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG), [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] (MK), and [[New Foundations]] (NF).  Of these, ZF, NBG, and MK are similar in describing a [[cumulative hierarchy]] of sets. New Foundations takes a different approach; it allows objects such as the set of all sets at the cost of restrictions on its set-existence axioms. The system of [[Kripke–Platek set theory]] is closely related to generalized recursion theory.

Two famous statements in set theory are the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[continuum hypothesis]]. The axiom of choice, first stated by Zermelo ([[#CITEREFZermelo1904|1904]]), was proved independent of ZF by Fraenkel ([[#CITEREFFraenkel1922|1922]]), but has come to be widely accepted by mathematicians.  It states that given a collection of nonempty sets there is a single set ''C'' that contains exactly one element from each set in the collection. The set ''C'' is said to "choose" one element from each set in the collection. While the ability to make such a choice is considered obvious by some, since each set in the collection is nonempty, the lack of a general, concrete rule by which the choice can be made renders the axiom nonconstructive. [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Alfred Tarski]] (1924) showed that the axiom of choice can be used to decompose a solid ball into a finite number of pieces which can then be rearranged, with no scaling, to make two solid balls of the original size. This theorem, known as the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]], is one of many counterintuitive results of the axiom of choice.

The continuum hypothesis, first proposed as a conjecture by Cantor, was listed by [[David Hilbert]] as one of his 23 problems in 1900. Gödel showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be disproven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice), by developing the [[constructible universe]] of set theory in which the continuum hypothesis must hold. In 1963, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be proven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ([[#CITEREFCohen1966|Cohen 1966]]). This independence result did not completely settle Hilbert's question, however, as it is possible that new axioms for set theory could resolve the hypothesis. Recent work along these lines has been conducted by [[W. Hugh Woodin]], although its importance is not yet clear ([[#CITEREFWoodin2001|Woodin 2001]]).

Contemporary research in set theory includes the study of [[large cardinal]]s and [[determinacy]].  Large cardinals are [[cardinal numbers]] with particular properties so strong that the existence of such cardinals cannot be proved in ZFC. The existence of the smallest large cardinal typically studied, an [[inaccessible cardinal]], already implies the consistency of ZFC.  Despite the fact that large cardinals have extremely high [[cardinality]], their existence has many ramifications for the structure of the real line.  ''Determinacy'' refers to the possible existence of winning strategies for certain two-player games (the games are said to be ''determined''). The existence of these strategies implies structural properties of the real line and other [[Polish space]]s.

== Model theory ==
{{Main|Model theory}}

'''[[Model theory]]''' studies the models of various formal theories.  Here a [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is a set of formulas in a particular formal logic and [[signature (logic)|signature]], while a [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]] is a structure that gives a concrete interpretation of the theory. Model theory is closely related to [[universal algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]], although the methods of model theory focus more on logical considerations than those fields.

The set of all models of a particular theory is called an [[elementary class]]; classical model theory seeks to determine the properties of models in a particular elementary class, or determine whether certain classes of structures form elementary classes.

The method of [[quantifier elimination]] can be used to show that definable sets in particular theories cannot be too complicated.  Tarski ([[#CITEREFTarski1948|1948]]) established quantifier elimination for [[real-closed field]]s, a result which also shows the theory of the field of real numbers is [[decidable set|decidable]]. (He also noted that his methods were equally applicable to algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic.) A modern subfield developing from this is concerned with [[o-minimal theory|o-minimal structure]]s.

[[Morley's categoricity theorem]], proved by [[Michael D. Morley]] (1965), states that if a first-order theory in a countable language is categorical in some uncountable cardinality, i.e. all models of this cardinality are isomorphic, then it is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities.

A trivial consequence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] is that a complete theory with less than continuum many nonisomorphic countable models can have only countably many. [[Vaught conjecture|Vaught's conjecture]], named after [[Robert Lawson Vaught]], says that this is true even independently of the continuum hypothesis.  Many special cases of this conjecture have been established.

== Recursion theory ==
{{Main|Recursion theory}}

'''[[Recursion theory]]''', also called '''computability theory''', studies the properties of [[computable function]]s and the [[Turing degree]]s, which divide the uncomputable functions into sets that have the same level of uncomputability.  Recursion theory also includes the study of generalized computability and definability.  Recursion theory grew from the work of [[Rózsa Péter]], [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] in the 1930s, which was greatly extended by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] and [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soare|first1=Robert Irving|title=Computability Theory and Applications: The Art of Classical Computability|url=http://www.people.cs.uchicago.edu/~soare/Turing/frontice.pdf|website=Department of Mathematics|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=23 August 2017|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical recursion theory focuses on the computability of functions from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. The fundamental results establish a robust, canonical class of computable functions with numerous independent, equivalent characterizations using [[Turing machine]]s, [[lambda calculus|&amp;lambda; calculus]], and other systems.  More advanced results concern the structure of the Turing degrees and the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of [[recursively enumerable set]]s.

Generalized recursion theory extends the ideas of recursion theory to computations that are no longer necessarily finite. It includes the study of computability in higher types as well as areas such as [[hyperarithmetical theory]] and [[alpha recursion theory|&amp;alpha;-recursion theory]].

Contemporary research in recursion theory includes the study of applications such as [[algorithmic randomness]], [[computable model theory]], and [[reverse mathematics]], as well as new results in pure recursion theory.

=== Algorithmically unsolvable problems ===

An important subfield of recursion theory studies algorithmic unsolvability; a [[decision problem]] or [[function problem]] is '''algorithmically unsolvable''' if there is no possible computable algorithm that returns the correct answer for all legal inputs to the problem. The first results about unsolvability, obtained independently by Church and Turing in 1936, showed that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is algorithmically unsolvable. Turing proved this by establishing the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]], a result with far-ranging implications in both recursion theory and computer science.

There are many known examples of undecidable problems from ordinary mathematics. The [[word problem for groups]] was proved algorithmically unsolvable by [[Pyotr Novikov]] in 1955 and independently by W. Boone in 1959.  The [[busy beaver]] problem, developed by [[Tibor Radó]] in 1962, is another well-known example.

[[Hilbert's tenth problem]] asked for an algorithm to determine whether a multivariate polynomial equation with integer coefficients has a solution in the integers. Partial progress was made by [[Julia Robinson]], [[Martin Davis]] and [[Hilary Putnam]]. The algorithmic unsolvability of the problem was proved by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] in 1970 (Davis 1973).

== Proof theory and constructive mathematics ==
{{Main|Proof theory}}

'''[[Proof theory]]''' is the study of formal proofs in various logical deduction systems. These proofs are represented as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques.  Several deduction systems are commonly considered, including [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s, systems of [[natural deduction]], and the [[sequent calculus]] developed by Gentzen.

The study of '''constructive mathematics''', in the context of mathematical logic, includes the study of systems in non-classical logic such as intuitionistic logic, as well as the study of [[Impredicativity|predicative]] systems.  An early proponent of predicativism was [[Hermann Weyl]], who showed it is possible to develop a large part of real analysis using only predicative methods (Weyl 1918).

Because proofs are entirely finitary, whereas truth in a structure is not, it is common for work in constructive mathematics to emphasize provability.   The relationship between provability in classical (or nonconstructive) systems and provability in intuitionistic (or constructive, respectively) systems is of particular interest.  Results such as the [[Gödel–Gentzen negative translation]] show that it is possible to embed (or ''translate'') classical logic into intuitionistic logic, allowing some properties about intuitionistic proofs to be transferred back to classical proofs.

Recent developments in proof theory include the study of [[proof mining]] by [[Ulrich Kohlenbach]] and the study of [[proof-theoretic ordinal]]s by [[Michael Rathjen]].

==Applications==  
"Mathematical logic has been successfully applied not only to mathematics and its foundations ([[Gottlob Frege|G. Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|B. Russell]], [[David Hilbert|D. Hilbert]], [[Paul Bernays|P. Bernays]], [[Heinrich Scholz|H. Scholz]], [[Rudolf Carnap|R. Carnap]], [[Stanislaw Lesniewski|S. Lesniewski]], [[Thoralf Skolem|T. Skolem]]), but also to physics (R. Carnap, A. Dittrich, B. Russell, [[Claude Shannon|C. E. Shannon]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]], [[Hans Reichenbach|H. Reichenbach]], P. Fevrier), to biology ([[Joseph Henry Woodger|J. H. Woodger]], [[Alfred Tarski|A. Tarski]]), to psychology ([[Frederic Fitch|F. B. Fitch]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel|C. G. Hempel]]), to law and morals ([[Karl Menger|K. Menger]], U. Klug, P. Oppenheim), to economics ([[John von Neumann|J. Neumann]], [[Oskar Morgenstern|O. Morgenstern]]), to practical questions ([[Edmund Berkeley|E. C. Berkeley]], E. Stamm), and even to metaphysics (J. [Jan] Salamucha,&lt;ref&gt;"Jan Salamucha", http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Salamucha .&lt;/ref&gt; H. Scholz, [[Jozef Maria Bochenski|J. M. Bochenski]]).  Its applications to the history of logic have proven extremely fruitful ([[Jan Lukasiewicz|J. Lukasiewicz]], H. Scholz, [[Benson Mates|B. Mates]], A. Becker, [[Ernest Addison Moody|E. Moody]], J.

Drewnowski, J. Salamucha, I.

==Connections with computer science==
{{Main|Logic in computer science}}
The study of [[computability theory (computer science)|computability theory in computer science]] is closely related to the study of computability in mathematical logic.  There is a difference of emphasis, however.  [[Computer science|Computer scientists]] often focus on concrete programming languages and [[feasible computability]], while researchers in mathematical logic often focus on computability as a theoretical concept and on noncomputability.

The theory of [[Program semantics|semantics of programming languages]] is related to [[model theory]], as is [[program verification]] (in particular, [[model checking]]). The [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]] between proofs and programs relates to [[proof theory]], especially [[intuitionistic logic]]. Formal calculi such as the [[lambda calculus]] and [[combinatory logic]] are now studied as idealized [[programming languages]].

Computer science also contributes to mathematics by developing techniques for the automatic checking or even finding of proofs, such as [[automated theorem proving]] and [[logic programming]].

[[Descriptive complexity theory]] relates logics to [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]. The first significant result in this area, [[Fagin's theorem]] (1974) established that [[NP (complexity)|NP]] is precisely the set of languages expressible by sentences of existential [[second-order logic]].

== Foundations of mathematics ==
{{Main|Foundations of mathematics}}

In the 19th century, mathematicians became aware of logical gaps and inconsistencies in their field. It was shown that [[Euclid]]'s axioms for geometry, which had been taught for centuries as an example of the axiomatic method, were incomplete. The use of [[infinitesimal]]s, and the very definition of [[Function (mathematics)|function]], came into question in analysis, as pathological examples such as Weierstrass' nowhere-[[Differentiable function|differentiable]] continuous function were discovered.

Cantor's study of arbitrary infinite sets also drew criticism. [[Leopold Kronecker]] famously stated "God made the integers; all else is the work of man," endorsing a return to the study of finite, concrete objects in mathematics. Although Kronecker's argument was carried forward by constructivists in the 20th century, the mathematical community as a whole rejected them. [[David Hilbert]] argued in favor of the study of the infinite, saying "No one shall expel us from the Paradise that Cantor has created."

Mathematicians began to search for axiom systems that could be used to formalize large parts of mathematics. In addition to removing ambiguity from previously naive terms such as function, it was hoped that this axiomatization would allow for consistency proofs.  In the 19th century, the main method of proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it. Thus, for example, [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can be proved consistent by defining ''point'' to mean a point on a fixed sphere and ''line'' to mean a [[great circle]] on the sphere. The resulting structure, a model of [[elliptic geometry]], satisfies the axioms of plane geometry except the parallel postulate.

With the development of formal logic, Hilbert asked whether it would be possible to prove that an axiom system is consistent by analyzing the structure of possible proofs in the system, and showing through this analysis that it is impossible to prove a contradiction. This idea led to the study of [[proof theory]]. Moreover, Hilbert proposed that the analysis should be entirely concrete, using the term ''finitary'' to refer to the methods he would allow but not precisely defining them. This project, known as [[Hilbert's program]], was seriously affected by Gödel's incompleteness theorems, which show that the consistency of formal theories of arithmetic cannot be established using methods formalizable in those theories. Gentzen showed that it is possible to produce a proof of the consistency of arithmetic in a finitary system augmented with axioms of [[transfinite induction]], and the techniques he developed to do so were seminal in proof theory.

A second thread in the history of foundations of mathematics involves [[nonclassical logic]]s and [[constructive mathematics]]. The study of constructive mathematics includes many different programs with various definitions of ''constructive''. At the most accommodating end, proofs in ZF set theory that do not use the axiom of choice are called constructive by many mathematicians. More limited versions of constructivism limit themselves to [[natural numbers]], [[number-theoretic function]]s, and sets of natural numbers (which can be used to represent real numbers, facilitating the study of [[mathematical analysis]]). A common idea is that a concrete means of computing the values of the function must be known before the function itself can be said to exist. &lt;!-- ref "Varieties of constructive mathematics" --&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] founded [[intuitionism]] as a philosophy of mathematics. This philosophy, poorly understood at first, stated that in order for a mathematical statement to be true to a mathematician, that person must be able to ''intuit'' the statement, to not only believe its truth but understand the reason for its truth. A consequence of this definition of truth was the rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]], for there are statements that, according to Brouwer, could not be claimed to be true while their negations also could not be claimed true.  Brouwer's philosophy was influential, and the cause of bitter disputes among prominent mathematicians. Later, Kleene and Kreisel would study formalized versions of intuitionistic logic (Brouwer rejected formalization, and presented his work in unformalized natural language). With the advent of the [[BHK interpretation]] and [[Kripke model]]s, intuitionism became easier to reconcile with classical mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7141">The '''maximum theorem''' provides conditions for the [[continuous function|continuity]] of an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]] function and the set of its maximizers as a parameter changes. The statement was first proven by [[Claude Berge]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Ok, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem is primarily used in [[mathematical economics]].

==Statement of theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; be metric spaces, &lt;math&gt;f:X\times\Theta\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a function jointly continuous in its two arguments, and &lt;math&gt;C:\Theta\twoheadrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a compact-valued [[Multivalued function|correspondence]].

For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, let
: &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)=\max\{f(x,\theta)|x\in C(\theta)\}&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)=\mathrm{arg}\max\{f(x,\theta)|x\in C(\theta)\}=\{x\in C(\theta)\,|\,f(x,\theta)=f^*(\theta)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is continuous (i.e. both upper and lower [[hemicontinuity|hemicontinuous]]) at some &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, compact-valued, and upper hemicontinuous at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Interpretation==
The theorem is typically interpreted as providing conditions for a parametric optimization problem to have continuous solutions with regard to the parameter. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter space, &lt;math&gt;f(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the function to be maximized, and &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; gives the constraint set that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is maximized over. Then, &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the maximized value of the function and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points that maximize &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

The result is that if the elements of an optimization problem are sufficiently continuous, then some, but not all, of that continuity is preserved in the solutions.

==Proof==
The proof relies primarily on the sequential definitions of upper and lower [[hemicontinuity]].

Because &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is compact-valued and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, the [[extreme value theorem]] guarantees the constrained maximum of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty for all &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then, let &lt;math&gt;\theta_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence converging to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n \in C^*(\theta_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is upper hemicontinuous, there exists a convergent subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_{n_k}\to x \in C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. 

If it is shown that &lt;math&gt;x \in C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, then
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty} f^*(\theta_{n_k}) = \lim_{k \to \infty} f(x_{n_k},\theta_{n_k}) = f(x,\theta) = f^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
which would simultaneously prove the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; and the upper hemicontinuity of &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose to the contrary that &lt;math&gt;x \not\in C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. there exists an &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\in C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(\hat{x},\theta) &gt; f(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is lower hemicontinuous, there is a further subsequence of &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_{n_j} \in C(\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_{n_j} \to \hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;. By the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the contradiction hypothesis,
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} f(\hat{x}_{n_j},\theta_{n_j}) = f(\hat{x},\theta) &gt; f(x,\theta) = \lim_{j \to \infty} f(x_{n_j},\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt;.
But this implies that for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;f(\hat{x}_{n_j},\theta_{n_j}) &gt; f(x_{n_j},\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt;
which would mean &lt;math&gt;x_{n_j}&lt;/math&gt; is not a maximizer, a contradiction of &lt;math&gt;x_n \in C^*(\theta_n)&lt;/math&gt;. This establishes the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; and the upper hemicontinuity of &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Because &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta) \subset C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is compact, it is sufficient to show &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is closed-valued for it to be compact-valued. This can be done by contradiction using sequences similar to above.

==Variants and generalizations==
If in addition to the conditions above, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[quasiconcave]] in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is also convex-valued. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly quasiconcave in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is single-valued, and thus is a continuous function rather than a correspondence.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Concave function|concave]] and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Convex set|convex]] graph, then &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is concave and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued. Similarly to above, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly concave, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function.&lt;ref&gt;Sundaram, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to generalize Berge's theorem to non-compact set-valued correspondences if the objective function is K-inf-compact.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Zadoianchuk, Kasyanov, Theorem 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Consider a [[utility maximization problem]] where a consumer makes a choice from their budget set. Translating from the notation above to the standard consumer theory notation,
* &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}_+^l&lt;/math&gt; is the space of all bundles of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; commodities,
* &lt;math&gt;\Theta=\mathbb{R}_{++}^l \times \mathbb{R}_{++}&lt;/math&gt; represents the price vector of the commodities &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the consumer's wealth &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;f(x,\theta)=u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the consumer's [[utility function]], and
* &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)=B(p,w)=\{x \,|\, px \leq w\}&lt;/math&gt; is the consumer's [[budget set]].

Then, 
* &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)=v(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indirect utility function]] and
* &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)=x(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Marshallian demand]].

Proofs in [[general equilibrium theory]] often apply the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Brouwer]] or [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]]s to the consumer's demand, which require compactness and continuity, and the maximum theorem provides the sufficient conditions to do so.

'''Michel Floréal Chasles''' (15 November 1793 – 18 December 1880) was a French [[mathematician]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Épernon]] in France and studied at the [[École Polytechnique]] in [[Paris]] under [[Siméon Denis Poisson]]. In the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] he was drafted to fight in the defence of Paris in 1814. After the war, he gave up on a career as an engineer or stockbroker in order to pursue his mathematical studies.

In 1837 he published his ''Historical view of the origin and development of methods in geometry'', a study of the method of reciprocal [[Pole and polar|polars]] in [[projective geometry]]. The work gained him considerable fame and respect and he was appointed Professor at the École Polytechnique in 1841, then he was awarded a chair at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1846. A second edition of his book was published in 1875, and [[Leonhard Sohncke]] translated the work into German.

[[Jakob Steiner]] had proposed [[Steiner's conic problem]] of enumerating the number of conic sections tangent to each of five given conics, and had answered it incorrectly. Chasles developed a theory of characteristics that enabled the correct enumeration of the conics (there are 3264) (see [[enumerative geometry]]). He established several important theorems (all called [[Chasles's theorem (disambiguation)|Chasles's theorem]]). In [[kinematics]], Chasles's description of a Euclidean motion in space [[Chasles's theorem (kinematics)|as screw displacement]] was seminal to the development of the theories of [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of [[rigid bodies]].

Chasles was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1864.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]].

As described in ''A Treasury of Deception'', by Michael Farquhar (Peguin Books, 2005), between 1861 and 1869 Chasles purchased some of the 27,000 forged letters from Frenchman [[Denis Vrain-Lucas]].  Included in this trove were letters from [[Alexander the Great]] to [[Aristotle]], from [[Cleopatra]] to [[Julius Caesar]], and from [[Mary Magdalene]] to a revived [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], all in a fake medieval French. In 2004, the journal ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' published a recently "discovered" 1871 letter written by Vrain-Lucas (from prison) to Chasles, conveying Vrain-Lucas's perspective on these events,&lt;ref&gt;Ken Alder, "[http://www.kenalder.com/other/Alder.CritInquiry.Forger1.pdf History's Greatest Forger: Science, Fiction, and Fraud Along the Seine]," ''Critical Inquiry'' 30 (Summer 2004): 704–716.&lt;/ref&gt; itself an invention.&lt;ref&gt;Anne H. Stevens, ''[https://archive.is/20120719022005/http://unlv.academia.edu/AnneStevens/Papers/1202832/Forging_Literary_History Forging Literary History: Historical Fiction and Literary Forgery in Eighteenth-Century Britain]'', Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture: Volume 37, Johns Hopkins University Press, Mar 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Alexander Jones published a commentary on Book 7 of the ''Collection'' of [[Pappus of Alexandria]], which Chasles had referred to in his history of geometric methods. Jones makes these comments about Chasles, Pappus and Euclid:&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones (1986) ''Book 7 of the Collection'', part 1: introduction, text, translation {{ISBN|0-387-96257-3}}, part 2: commentary, index, figures {{ISBN|3-540-96257-3}}, [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Chasles's contribution to our comprehension of the ''Porisms'' tends to be obscured by the inherent unreasonableness of his claim to have restored substantially the contents of Euclid's book on the basis of the meagre data of Pappus and Proclus...one still turns to Chasles for the first appreciation of the interest in the ''Porisms'' from the point of view of modern geometry. Above all, he was the first to notice the recurrence of [[cross-ratio]]s and harmonic ratios in the lemmas, and because these concepts suffuse most of his restoration, it is probable that many of his inventions coincide with some of [[Euclid]]'s, even if we cannot now tell which they are.

Chasles's name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

The ''z''-axis is vertical, and the foci are at&amp;nbsp;±2.  The red oblate spheroid (flattened sphere) corresponds to ''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, whereas the blue half-hyperboloid corresponds to ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45°.  The azimuth ''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−60° measures the [[dihedral angle]] between the green ''x''-''z'' half-plane and the yellow half-plane that includes the point&amp;nbsp;'''P'''.  The [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of '''P''' are roughly (1.09,&amp;nbsp;−1.89,&amp;nbsp;1.66).]]

'''Oblate spheroidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] about the non-focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis that separates the foci. Thus, the two foci are transformed into a ring of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ''x''-''y'' plane.  (Rotation about the other axis produces [[prolate spheroidal coordinates]].)  Oblate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of [[ellipsoidal coordinates]] in which the two largest [[semi-axis|semi-axes]] are equal in length.

Oblate spheroidal coordinates are often useful in solving [[partial differential equation]]s when the boundary conditions are defined on an [[oblate spheroid]] or a [[hyperboloid|hyperboloid of revolution]].  For example, they played an important role in the calculation of the [[Perrin friction factors]], which contributed to the awarding of the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]].  These friction factors determine the [[rotational diffusion]] of molecules, which affects the feasibility of many techniques such as [[protein NMR]] and from which the hydrodynamic volume and shape of molecules can be inferred.  Oblate spheroidal coordinates are also useful in problems of electromagnetism (e.g., dielectric constant of charged oblate molecules), acoustics (e.g., scattering of sound through a circular hole), fluid dynamics  (e.g., the flow of water through a firehose nozzle) and the diffusion of materials and heat (e.g., cooling of a red-hot coin in a water bath)

==Definition (µ,ν,φ)==
[[File:OblateSpheroidCoord.png|thumb|350 px|right|Figure 2: Plot of the oblate spheroidal coordinates &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; in the ''x''-''z'' plane, where φ is zero and ''a'' equals one. The curves of constant ''&amp;mu;'' form red ellipses, whereas those of constant ''&amp;nu;'' form cyan half-hyperbolae in this plane. The ''z''-axis runs vertically and separates the foci; the coordinates ''z'' and ν always have the same sign. The surfaces of constant &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; in three dimensions are obtained by rotation about the ''z''-axis, and are the red and blue surfaces, respectively, in Figure 1.]]
The most common definition of oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu \ \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu \ \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \ \sinh \mu \ \sin \nu 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and the angle &lt;math&gt;\nu\in\left[-\pi/2,\pi/2\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  The azimuthal angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can fall anywhere on a full circle, between &lt;math&gt;\pm\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  These coordinates are favored over the alternatives below because they are not degenerate; the set of coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; describes a unique point in Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;. The reverse is also true, except on the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis and the disk in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane inside the focal ring.

===Coordinate surfaces===

The surfaces of constant μ form [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroids]], by the trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \cosh^{2} \mu} + 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \sinh^{2} \mu} = \cos^{2} \nu + \sin^{2} \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

since they are [[ellipse]]s rotated about the ''z''-axis, which separates their foci.   An ellipse in the ''x''-''z'' plane (Figure 2) has a [[semi-major axis|major semiaxis]] of length ''a'' cosh μ along the ''x''-axis, whereas its [[semi-minor axis|minor semiaxis]] has length ''a'' sinh μ along the ''z''-axis.  The foci of all the ellipses in the ''x''-''z'' plane are located on the ''x''-axis at ±''a''.

Similarly, the surfaces of constant ν form one-sheet half [[hyperboloid]]s of revolution by the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \cos^{2} \nu} - 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \sin^{2} \nu} = \cosh^{2} \mu - \sinh^{2} \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

For positive ν, the half-hyperboloid is above the ''x''-''y'' plane (i.e., has positive ''z'') whereas for negative ν, the half-hyperboloid is below the ''x''-''y'' plane (i.e., has negative ''z'').  Geometrically, the angle ν corresponds to the angle of the [[asymptote]]s of the hyperbola.  The foci of all the hyperbolae are likewise located on the ''x''-axis at ±''a''.

===Inverse transformation===

The (μ, ν, φ) coordinates may be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') as follows.  The azimuthal angle φ is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan \phi = \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The cylindrical radius ρ of the point P is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and its distances to the foci in the plane defined by φ is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{1}^{2} = (\rho + a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{2}^{2} = (\rho - a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The remaining coordinates μ and ν can be calculated from the equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\cosh \mu = \frac{d_{1} + d_{2}}{2a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos \nu = \frac{d_{1} - d_{2}}{2a}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the sign of μ is always non-negative, and the sign of ν is the same as that of ''z''.

Another method to compute the inverse transform is

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \operatorname{Re} \operatorname{arcosh} \frac{\rho + z i}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu = \operatorname{Im} \operatorname{arcosh} \frac{\rho + z i}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \arctan \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the coordinates μ and ν are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = h_{\nu} = a\sqrt{\sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\phi} = a \cosh\mu \ \cos\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{3} \cosh\mu \ \cos\nu \ 
\left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right) d\mu d\nu d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right)} 
\left[
\frac{1}{\cosh \mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} 
\left( \cosh \mu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} \right) + 
\frac{1}{\cos \nu} \frac{\partial}{\partial \nu}
\left( \cos \nu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu} \right)
\right] +
\frac{1}{a^{2} \cosh^{2}\mu \cos^{2}\nu}
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \phi^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates (μ, ν, φ) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

===Basis Vectors===

The orthonormal basis vectors for the &lt;math&gt;\mu,\nu,\phi&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu}}
\left( \sinh \mu \cos \nu \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} + \sinh \mu \cos \nu \sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}} + \cosh \mu \sin \nu \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\nu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu}}
\left(
-\cosh \mu \sin \nu \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} - \cosh \mu \sin \nu \sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}} + \sinh \mu \cos \nu \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\phi} = -\sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} + \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat{i}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{j}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}&lt;/math&gt; are the Cartesian unit vectors. Here, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the outward normal vector to the oblate spheroidal surface of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the same azimuthal unit vector from spherical coordinates, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; lies in the tangent plane to the oblate spheroid surface and completes the right-handed basis set.

==Definition (ζ, ξ, φ)==

Another set of oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\zeta,\xi,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used where &lt;math&gt;\zeta = \sinh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi = \sin \nu&lt;/math&gt; (Smythe 1968).  The curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; are oblate spheroids and the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; are the hyperboloids of revolution. The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is restricted by &lt;math&gt;0 \le \zeta &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is restricted by &lt;math&gt;-1 \le \xi &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The relationship to [[Cartesian coordinates]] is

:&lt;math&gt;x = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1-\xi^2)}\,\cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1-\xi^2)}\,\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z  = a \zeta \xi&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for &lt;math&gt;(\zeta, \xi, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\zeta} = a\sqrt{\frac{\zeta^2 + \xi^2}{1+\zeta^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\xi} = a\sqrt{\frac{\zeta^2 + \xi^2}{1 - \xi^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\phi} = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1 - \xi^2)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing the scale factors, various functions of the coordinates can be calculated by the general method outlined in the [[orthogonal coordinates]] article. The infinitesimal volume element is:

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{3} (\zeta^2+\xi^2)\,d\zeta\,d\xi\,d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla V = 
\frac{1}{h_{\zeta}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \zeta} \,\hat{\zeta}+
\frac{1}  {h_{\xi}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}   \,\hat{\xi}+
\frac{1} {h_{\phi}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi}  \,\hat{\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

The divergence is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{a(\zeta^2+\xi^2)}
\left\{
\frac{\partial}{\partial \zeta} \left(\sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\sqrt{\zeta^2+\xi^2}F_\zeta\right)        +
\frac{\partial}  {\partial \xi} \left(\sqrt{1-\xi^2}\sqrt{\zeta^2+\xi^2}F_\xi\right)
\right\}
+\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\sqrt{1-\xi^2}} \frac{\partial F_\phi}{\partial \phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} V = 
\frac{1}{a^2 \left( \zeta^2 + \xi^2 \right)}
\left\{
\frac{\partial}{\partial \zeta} \left[ 
\left(1+\zeta^2\right) \frac{\partial V}{\partial \zeta}
\right] + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi} \left[ 
\left( 1 - \xi^2 \right) \frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}
\right]
\right\}
+ \frac{1}{a^2 \left( 1+\zeta^2 \right) \left( 1 - \xi^{2} \right)}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Oblate spheroidal harmonics ===

: ''See also [[Oblate spheroidal wave function]].''

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]] and [[spherical harmonics]], Laplace's equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''oblate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate.

Following the technique of [[separation of variables]], a solution to Laplace's equation is written:

:&lt;math&gt;V=Z(\zeta)\,\Xi(\xi)\,\Phi(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

This yields three separate differential equations in each of the variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\zeta}\left[(1+\zeta^2)\frac{dZ  }{d\zeta}\right]+\frac{m^2Z  }{1+\zeta^2}-n(n+1)Z  =0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\xi  }\left[(1-\xi^2  )\frac{d\Xi}{d\xi  }\right]-\frac{m^2\Xi}{1-\xi^2  }+n(n+1)\Xi=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2}=-m^2\Phi&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is a constant which is an integer because the &amp;phi; variable is periodic with period 2&amp;pi;. ''n'' will then be an integer. The solution to these equations are:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{mn}   =A_1P_n^m(i\zeta)+A_2Q_n^m(i\zeta)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Xi_{mn} =A_3P_n^m(\xi)+A_4Q_n^m(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_m   =A_5e^{im\phi}+A_6e^{-im\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are constants and &lt;math&gt;P_n^m(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_n^m(z)&lt;/math&gt; are [[associated Legendre polynomial]]s of the first and second kind respectively. The product of the three solutions is called an ''oblate spheroidal harmonic'' and the general solution to Laplace's equation is written:

:&lt;math&gt;V=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^\infty\,Z_{mn}(\zeta)\,\Xi_{mn}(\xi)\,\Phi_m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

The constants will combine to yield only four independent constants for each harmonic.

==Definition (σ, τ, φ)==

[[File:Oblate spheroidal coordinates full hyperboloid.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 3: Coordinate isosurfaces for a point P (shown as a black sphere) in the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ). As before, the oblate spheroid corresponding to σ is shown in red, and φ measures the azimuthal angle between the green and yellow half-planes. However, the surface of constant τ is a full one-sheet hyperboloid, shown in blue. This produces a two-fold degeneracy, shown by the two black spheres located at (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'').]]

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ) are sometimes used, where σ = [[Cosh (mathematical function)|cosh]] μ and τ = [[cosine|cos]] ν.&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the coordinate σ must be greater than or equal to one, whereas τ must lie between ±1, inclusive.  The surfaces of constant σ are oblate spheroids, as were those of constant μ, whereas the curves of constant τ are full hyperboloids of revolution, including the half-hyperboloids corresponding to ±ν.  Thus, these coordinates are degenerate; ''two'' points in Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'') map to ''one'' set of coordinates (σ, τ, φ).  This two-fold degeneracy in the sign of ''z'' is evident from the equations transforming from oblate spheroidal coordinates to the [[Cartesian coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a\sigma\tau \cos \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a\sigma\tau \sin \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2}  = a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left(1 - \tau^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the focal ring.  For any point, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the focal ring equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the "far" distance to the focal ring is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the "near" distance is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Coordinate surfaces===

Similar to its counterpart μ, the surfaces of constant σ form [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroids]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \sigma^{2}} + 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \left(\sigma^{2} -1\right)} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the surfaces of constant τ form full one-sheet [[hyperboloid]]s of revolution

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \tau^{2}} - 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{\sigma^2 - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\tau = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor is &lt;math&gt;h_{\phi} = a \sigma \tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 \sigma \tau \frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{\sqrt{\left( \sigma^2 - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^2 \right)}} \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^2 \left( \sigma^2 - \tau^2 \right)}
\left\{
\frac{\sqrt{\sigma^2 -1}}{\sigma}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \left[ 
\left( \sigma\sqrt{\sigma^2 - 1} \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right] + 
\frac{\sqrt{1 - \tau^2}}{\tau}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \left[ 
\left( \tau\sqrt{1 - \tau^2} \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right]
\right\}
+ \frac{1}{a^2 \sigma^2 \tau^2 }
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \phi^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae  found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]], Laplaces equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''oblate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate (See Smythe, 1968).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13083">In [[geometry]], the '''Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem''' (or the '''PDN-theorem''') is a result concerning arbitrary [[plane (geometry)|planar]] [[polygon]]s. The theorem asserts that a certain [[algorithm|procedure]] when applied to an arbitrary polygon always yields a [[regular polygon]] having the same number of sides as the initial polygon. The theorem was first published by [[Karel Petr]] (1868–1950) of [[Prague]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=K. Petr|title=Ein Satz ¨uber Vielecke|journal=Arch. Math. Phys.|year=1908|volume=13|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; The theorem was independently rediscovered by [[Jesse Douglas]] (1897–1965) in 1940&lt;ref name=Douglas&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglas|first=Jesse|title=On linear polygon transformations|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|year=1946|volume=46|issue=6|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1940-46-06/S0002-9904-1940-07259-3/S0002-9904-1940-07259-3.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2012|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1940-07259-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by [[Bernhard Neumann|B H Neumann]] (1909–2002) in 1941.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=B H Neumann|title=Some remarks on polygons|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society |year=1941|volume=s1-16|issue=4 |pages=230–245|url=http://jlms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s1-16/4/230.extract|accessdate=7 May 2012|doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-16.4.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The naming of the theorem as ''Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem'', or as the ''PDN-theorem'' for short,  is due to Stephen B Gray.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; This theorem has also been called '''Douglas’s theorem''', the '''Douglas–Neumann theorem''', the '''Napoleon–Douglas–Neumann theorem'''  and '''Petr’s theorem'''.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;

The PDN-theorem is a [[generalisation]] of the [[Napoleon's theorem]] which is concerned about arbitrary [[triangle]]s and of the [[van Aubel's theorem]] which is related to arbitrary [[quadrilateral]]s.

==Statement of the theorem==
The Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem asserts the following.&lt;ref name=Douglas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=van Lamoen, Floor  |author2=Weisstein, Eric W.|title=Petr–Neumann–Douglas Theorem.|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Petr-Neumann-DouglasTheorem.html|publisher=From MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''If isosceles triangles with apex angles 2kπ/n are erected on the sides of an arbitrary n-gon A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and if this process is repeated with the n-gon formed by the free apices of the triangles, but with a different value of k, and so on until all values 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 2 have been used (in arbitrary order), then a regular n-gon A&lt;sub&gt;n−2&lt;/sub&gt; is formed whose centroid coincides with the centroid of A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Specialisation to triangles==

[[File:PDNTheoremForTriangle.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram illustrating the fact that Napoleon's theorem is a special case of Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem.]] 
In the case of triangles, the value of ''n'' is 3 and that of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 is 1. Hence there is only one possible value for ''k'', namely 1. The specialisation of the  theorem to triangles  asserts that the triangle A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a regular 3-gon, that is, an equilateral triangle.

A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is formed by the apices of the isosceles triangles with apex angle 2π/3 erected over the sides of the triangle A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The vertices of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the centers of equilateral triangles erected over the sides of triangle A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus the specialisation of the PDN theorem to a triangle can be formulated as follows:

:''If equilateral triangles are erected over the sides of any triangle, then the triangle formed by the centers of the three equilateral triangles is equilateral.''

The last statement is the assertion of the [[Napoleon's theorem]].

==Specialisation to quadrilaterals==

In the case of [[quadrilateral]]s, the value of ''n'' is 4 and that  of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 is&amp;nbsp;2. There are two possible values for ''k'', namely 1 and 2, and so two possible apex angles, namely:

:(2&amp;times;1&amp;times;&amp;pi;)/4 = π/2 = 90&amp;deg; ( corresponding to ''k'' = 1 )
:(2&amp;times;2&amp;times;&amp;pi;)/4 = π = 180&amp;deg; ( corresponding to ''k'' = 2 ).

According to the PDN-theorem the quadrilateral A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a regular 4-gon, that is, a [[Square (geometry)|square]]. The two-stage process yielding the square A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be carried out in two different ways. (The apex ''Z'' of an [[isosceles triangle]] with apex angle π erected over a line segment ''XY'' is  the [[midpoint]] of the line segment ''XY''.)

===Construct A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; using apex angle π/2 and then A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with apex angle π.===

In this case the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the free apices of [[isosceles triangle]]s with apex angles π/2 erected over the sides of the quadrilaetral A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The vertices of the quadrilateral A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[midpoint]]s of the sides of the quadrilateral A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. By the PDN theorem, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a square.

The vertices of the quadrilateral A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the centers of squares erected over the sides of the quadrilateral A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The assertion that quadrilateral A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a square is equivalent to the assertion that the [[diagonal]]s of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are equal and [[perpendicular]] to each other. The latter assertion is the content of [[van Aubel's theorem]].

Thus [[van Aubel's theorem]] is a special case of the PDN-theorem.

===Construct A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; using apex angle π and then A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with apex angle π/2.===

In this case the vertices of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[midpoint]]s of the sides of the quadrilateral A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  and those of A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the apices of the triangles with apex angles π/2 erected over the sides of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The PDN-theorem asserts that A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a square in this case also.

==Specialisation to pentagons==
[[File:PDN Theorem For Pentagon.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram illustrating Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem as applied to a pentagon. The pentagon ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is ''ABCDE''. ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ( = ''FGHIJ'' ) is constructed with apex angle 72&amp;deg;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ( = ''KLMNO'' ) with apex angle 144&amp;deg; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ( = ''PQRST'' ) with apex angle 216&amp;deg;.]]
In the case of [[pentagon]]s, we have ''n'' = 5 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 =&amp;nbsp;3. So there are three possible values for ''k'', namely 1, 2 and 3, and hence three possible apex angles for isosceles triangles:

:(2&amp;times;1&amp;times;&amp;pi;)/5 = 2&amp;pi;/5 = 72&amp;deg;
:(2&amp;times;2&amp;times;&amp;pi;)/5 = 4&amp;pi;/5 = 144&amp;deg;
:(2&amp;times;3&amp;times;&amp;pi;)/5 = 6&amp;pi;/5 = 216&amp;deg;

According to the PDN-theorem, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[regular pentagon]]. The three-stage process leading to the construction of the regular pentagon A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be performed in six different ways depending on the order in which the apex angles are selected for the construction of the isosceles triangles.

==Proof of the theorem==

The theorem can be proved using some elementary concepts from linear algebra.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephen B. Gray|title=Generalizing the Petr–Douglas–Neumann Theorem on ''n''-gons|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=110|issue=3|pages=210–227|url=http://www.experimentalmath.info/workshop2004/gray-article.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2012|doi=10.2307/3647935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Omar Antolín Camarena|title=The Petr–Neumann–Douglas theorem through linear algebra|url=http://www.matem.unam.mx/omar/notes/petr.html|accessdate=10 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof begins by encoding an ''n''-gon by a list complex numbers representing the vertices of the ''n''-gon. This list can be thought of as a vector in the ''n''-dimensional complex linear space C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.  Take an ''n''-gon ''A'' and  let it be represented by the complex vector

:''A'' = ( ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ).

Let the polygon  ''B'' be formed by the free vertices of similar triangles built on the sides of ''A'' and let it be represented by the complex vector

:''B'' = ( ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ).

Then we have

:&amp;alpha;( ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; )  =  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, where &amp;alpha; = exp( ''i'' &amp;theta; ) for some &amp;theta; (here ''i'' is the square root of&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1).

This yields the following expression to compute the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; ' s:

:''b''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = (1−α)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt; − α''a''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ).

In terms of the linear operator ''S'' : C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; → C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; that cyclically permutes the coordinates one place, we have 
:''B'' = (1−α)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;( ''S'' − α''I'' )''A'',  where ''I'' is the identity matrix.

This means that the polygon ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt; that we need to show is regular is obtained from ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by applying the composition of the following operators:

: ( 1 − ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;( ''S'' − ω&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ''I'' ) for ''k'' = 1, 2, ... , ''n'' − 2, where ω = exp( 2π''i''/''n'' ). (These commute because they are all polynomials in the same operator ''S''.)

A polygon ''P'' = ( ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is a regular ''n''-gon if each side of ''P''  is obtained from the next by rotating through an angle of 2π/''n'', that is, if 
: ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = ω( ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r'' + 2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; ).
This condition can be formulated in terms of S as follows:

:( ''S'' − ''I'' )( ''I'' − ω''S'' ) ''P'' = 0.

Or equivalently as

:( ''S'' − ''I'' )( ''S'' &amp;minus; ω&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''I'' ) ''P'' = 0, since ω&lt;sup&gt;''n&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.

Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem now follows from the following computations.

:( ''S'' − ''I'' )( ''S'' &amp;minus; ω&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''I'' ) ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sub&gt;
:: = ( ''S'' − ''I'' )( ''S'' &amp;minus; ω&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''I'' )  ( 1 − ω )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''S'' &amp;minus;  ω ''I'' ) ( 1 − ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''S'' &amp;minus;  ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''I'' ) ... ( 1 − ω&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''S'' &amp;minus;  ω&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt; ''I'' ) ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
:: = ( 1 − ω )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;( 1 − ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5909">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[commutative algebra]], the '''power sum symmetric polynomials''' are a type of basic building block for [[symmetric polynomial]]s, in the sense that every symmetric polynomial with rational coefficients can be expressed as a sum and difference of products of power sum symmetric polynomials with rational coefficients.  However, not every symmetric polynomial with integral coefficients is generated by integral combinations of products of power-sum polynomials: they are a generating set over the ''rationals,'' but not over the ''integers.''

==Definition==

The power sum symmetric polynomial of degree ''k'' in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, written ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., is the sum of all ''k''th [[Exponentiation|powers]] of the variables.  Formally,
:&lt;math&gt; p_k (x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^k \, .&lt;/math&gt;
The first few of these polynomials are 
:&lt;math&gt; p_0 (x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n) = n ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; p_1 (x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n) = x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; p_2 (x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; p_3 (x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n) = x_1^3 + x_2^3 + \cdots + x_n^3 \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, for each nonnegative integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, there exists exactly one power sum symmetric polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. 

The [[polynomial ring]] formed by taking all integral linear combinations of products of the power sum symmetric polynomials is a [[commutative ring]].

==Examples==
The following lists the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; power sum symmetric polynomials of positive degrees up to ''n'' for the first three positive values of &lt;math&gt;n.&lt;/math&gt;  In every case, &lt;math&gt;p_0 = n&lt;/math&gt; is one of the polynomials.  The list goes up to degree ''n'' because the power sum symmetric polynomials of degrees 1 to ''n'' are basic in the sense of the Main Theorem stated below.

For ''n'' = 1:
:&lt;math&gt;p_1 = x_1\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n'' = 2: 
:&lt;math&gt;p_1 = x_1 + x_2\,,&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;p_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n'' = 3:
:&lt;math&gt;p_1 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3\,,&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;p_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2\,,&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;p_3 = x_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3\,,&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

The set of power sum symmetric polynomials of degrees 1, 2, ..., ''n'' in ''n'' variables [[generator (mathematics)|generates]] the [[polynomial ring|ring]] of [[symmetric polynomial]]s in ''n'' variables.  More specifically: 

:'''Theorem'''.  The ring of symmetric polynomials with rational coefficients equals the rational polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q[p_1,\ldots,p_n].&lt;/math&gt;  The same is true if the coefficients are taken in any [[field (mathematics)|field]] whose characteristic is 0.  

However, this is not true if the coefficients must be integers.  For example, for ''n'' = 2, the symmetric polynomial 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x_1,x_2) = x_1^2 x_2 + x_1 x_2^2 + x_1x_2&lt;/math&gt; 
has the expression 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x_1,x_2) = \frac{p_1^3-p_1p_2}{2} + \frac{p_1^2-p_2}{2} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
which involves fractions.  According to the theorem this is the only way to represent &lt;math&gt;P(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Therefore, ''P'' does not belong to the integral polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z[p_1,\ldots,p_n].&lt;/math&gt;
For another example, the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, expressed as polynomials in the power sum polynomials, do not all have integral coefficients.  For instance,  
:&lt;math&gt;e_2 := \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq n} x_ix_j = \frac{p_1^2-p_2}{2} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem is also untrue if the field has characteristic different from 0.  For example, if the field ''F'' has characteristic 2, then &lt;math&gt;p_2 = p_1^2&lt;/math&gt;, so ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cannot generate ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Sketch of a partial proof of the theorem'':  By [[Newton's identities]] the power sums are functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials; this is implied by the following [[recurrence relation]], though the explicit function that gives the power sums in terms of the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is complicated:
:&lt;math&gt;p_n = \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{j-1} e_j p_{n-j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the same recurrence, one has the elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of the power sums (also implicitly, the explicit formula being complicated):
:&lt;math&gt; e_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{j-1} e_{n-j} p_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that the elementary polynomials are rational, though not integral, linear combinations of the power sum polynomials of degrees 1, ..., ''n''.  
Since the elementary symmetric polynomials are an algebraic basis for all symmetric polynomials with coefficients in a field, it follows that every symmetric polynomial in ''n'' variables is a polynomial function &lt;math&gt;f(p_1,\ldots,p_n)&lt;/math&gt; of the power sum symmetric polynomials ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  That is, the ring of symmetric polynomials is contained in the ring generated by the power sums, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q[p_1,\ldots,p_n].&lt;/math&gt;  Because every power sum polynomial is symmetric, the two rings are equal.

(This does not show how to prove the polynomial ''f'' is unique.)

For another system of symmetric polynomials with similar properties see [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]]s.

==Derivation of the normal equations==
Define the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th '''residual''' to be

:&lt;math&gt;r_i= y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{ij}\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten

:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_{i=1}^m r_i^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Given that ''S'' is convex, it is [[Maxima and minima|minimized]] when its gradient vector is zero (This follows by definition: if the gradient vector is not zero, there is a direction in which we can move to minimize it further – see [[maxima and minima]].) The elements of the gradient vector are the partial derivatives of ''S'' with respect to the parameters:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_j}=2\sum_{i = 1}^m r_i\frac{\partial r_i}{\partial \beta_j} \qquad (j=1,2,\dots, n).&lt;/math&gt;

The derivatives are

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial r_i}{\partial \beta_j}=-X_{ij}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the expressions for the residuals and the derivatives into the gradient equations gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_j} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( y_i-\sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{ik}\beta_k \right) (-X_{ij})\qquad (j=1,2,\dots, n).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus if &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt; minimizes ''S'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;2\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( y_i-\sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{ik}\hat \beta_k \right) (-X_{ij}) = 0\qquad (j=1,2,\dots, n).&lt;/math&gt;

Upon rearrangement, we obtain the '''normal equations''':

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{ij}X_{ik}\hat \beta_k=\sum_{i=1}^{m} X_{ij}y_i\qquad (j=1,2,\dots, n).&lt;/math&gt;

The normal equations are written in matrix notation as

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf X^\mathrm{T} \mathbf X) \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \mathbf X^\mathrm{T} \mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; (where ''X''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[matrix transpose]] of ''X'').

The solution of the normal equations yields the vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; of the optimal parameter values.

===Derivation directly in terms of matrices===

The normal equations can be derived directly from a matrix representation of the problem as follows. The objective is to minimize

:&lt;math&gt;S(\boldsymbol{\beta}) 
= \bigl\|\mathbf y - \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta \bigr\|^2 
= (\mathbf y-\mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta)^{\rm T}(\mathbf y-\mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta) 
= \mathbf y ^{\rm T} \mathbf y - \boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y - \mathbf y ^{\rm T} \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta + \boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta .&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;( \boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y ) ^{\rm T} = \mathbf y ^{\rm T} \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta&lt;/math&gt; has the dimension 1x1 (the number of columns of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt;), so it is a scalar and equal to its own transpose, hence &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y = \mathbf y ^{\rm T} \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta&lt;/math&gt;
and the quantity to minimize becomes

:&lt;math&gt;S(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \mathbf y ^{\rm T} \mathbf y - 2\boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y + \boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Matrix differentiation#Scalar-by-vector|Differentiating]] this with respect to &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \beta&lt;/math&gt; and equating to zero to satisfy the first-order conditions gives

:&lt;math&gt;- \mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf y+ (\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X ){\boldsymbol{\beta}} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the above-given normal equations. A sufficient condition for satisfaction of the second-order conditions for a minimum is that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; have full column rank, in which case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite]].

===Derivation without calculus===

When &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, the formula for the minimizing value of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol \beta &lt;/math&gt; can be derived without the use of derivatives. The quantity

:&lt;math&gt;S(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \mathbf y ^{\rm T} \mathbf y - 2\boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y + \boldsymbol \beta ^{\rm T} \mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta &lt;/math&gt;

can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \boldsymbol \beta, \boldsymbol \beta \rangle - 2\langle \boldsymbol \beta, (\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y \rangle + \langle(\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y,(\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y \rangle+ C, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt; \mathbf y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf X &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dot product|inner product]] defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \langle x, y \rangle = x ^{\rm T} (\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X) y. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt; S(\boldsymbol{\beta}) &lt;/math&gt; is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \boldsymbol \beta - (\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y,\boldsymbol \beta - (\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y \rangle+ C &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore minimized exactly when
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \beta - (\mathbf X^{\rm T} \mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X ^{\rm T} \mathbf y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Generalization for complex equations===

In general, the coefficients of the matrices &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \mathbf {X} } , {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} } &lt;/math&gt; can be complex. By using a [[Hermitian transpose]] instead of a simple transpose, it is possible to find a vector &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\hat {\beta }}}} &lt;/math&gt; which minimizes &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle S({\boldsymbol {\beta }})}&lt;/math&gt; , just as for the real matrix case. In order to get the normal equations we follow a similar path as in previous derivations:

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle S({\boldsymbol {\beta }})=\langle \mathbf {y} -\mathbf {X} {\boldsymbol {\beta }},\mathbf {y} -\mathbf {X} {\boldsymbol {\beta }}\rangle =\langle \mathbf {y} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle -{\overline {\langle \mathbf {X} {\boldsymbol {\beta }},\mathbf {y} \rangle }}-{\overline {\langle \mathbf {y} ,\mathbf {X} {\boldsymbol {\beta }}\rangle }}+\langle \mathbf {X} {\boldsymbol {\beta }},\mathbf {X} {\boldsymbol {\beta }}\rangle =\mathbf {y} ^{\rm {T}}{\overline {\mathbf {y} }}-{\boldsymbol {\beta }}^{\dagger }\mathbf {X} ^{\dagger }\mathbf {y} -\mathbf {y} ^{\dagger }\mathbf {X} {\boldsymbol {\beta }}+{\boldsymbol {\beta }}^{\rm {T}}\mathbf {X} ^{\rm {T}}{\overline {\mathbf {X} }}{\overline {\boldsymbol {\beta }}},} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \dagger }&lt;/math&gt;  stands for Hermitian transpose.

We should now take derivatives of &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle S({\boldsymbol {\beta }})} &lt;/math&gt; with respect to each of the coefficients &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \beta _{j}} &lt;/math&gt;, but first we separate real and imaginary parts to deal with the conjugate factors in above expression. For the &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \beta _{j}}&lt;/math&gt;  we have

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \beta _{j}=\beta _{j}^{R}+i\beta _{j}^{I}} &lt;/math&gt;

and the derivatives change into

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial S}{\partial \beta _{j}}}={\frac {\partial S}{\partial \beta _{j}^{R}}}{\frac {\partial \beta _{j}^{R}}{\partial \beta _{j}}}+{\frac {\partial S}{\partial \beta _{j}^{I}}}{\frac {\partial \beta _{j}^{I}}{\partial \beta _{j}}}={\frac {\partial S}{\partial \beta _{j}^{R}}}-i{\frac {\partial S}{\partial \beta _{j}^{I}}}\ \ (j=1,2,3,...,n).} &lt;/math&gt;

After rewriting &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle S({\boldsymbol {\beta }})} &lt;/math&gt; in the summation form and writing &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \beta _{j}}&lt;/math&gt;  explicitly, we can calculate both partial derivatives with result:

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial S}{\partial \beta _{j}^{R}}}=-\sum _{i=1}^{m}{\Big (}{\overline {X}}_{ij}y_{i}+{\overline {y}}_{i}X_{ij}{\Big )}+2\sum _{i=1}^{m}X_{ij}{\overline {X}}_{ij}\beta _{j}^{R}+\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{k\neq j}^{n}{\Big (}X_{ij}{\overline {X}}_{ik}{\overline {\beta }}_{k}+\beta _{k}X_{ik}{\overline {X}}_{ij}{\Big )},} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle -i{\frac {\partial S}{\partial \beta _{j}^{I}}}=\sum _{i=1}^{m}{\Big (}{\overline {X}}_{ij}y_{i}-{\overline {y}}_{i}X_{ij}{\Big )}-2i\sum _{i=1}^{m}X_{ij}{\overline {X}}_{ij}\beta _{j}^{I}+\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{k\neq j}^{n}{\Big (}X_{ij}{\overline {X}}_{ik}{\overline {\beta }}_{k}-\beta _{k}X_{ik}{\overline {X}}_{ij}{\Big )},} &lt;/math&gt;

which, after adding it together and comparing to zero (minimization condition for &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\hat {\beta }}}} &lt;/math&gt;) yields

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{m}X_{ij}{\overline {y}}_{i}=\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{k=1}^{n}X_{ij}{\overline {X}}_{ik}{\overline {\hat {\beta }}}_{k}\ \ (j=1,2,3,...,n).} &lt;/math&gt;

In matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle {\textbf {X}}^{\rm {T}}{\overline {\textbf {y}}}={\textbf {X}}^{\rm {T}}{\overline {{\big (}{\textbf {X}}{\boldsymbol {\hat {\beta }}}{\big )}}}\ \ \ {\text{or}}\ \ \ {\big (}{\textbf {X}}^{\dagger }{\textbf {X}}{\big )}{\boldsymbol {\hat {\beta }}}={\textbf {X}}^{\dagger }{\textbf {y}}.} &lt;/math&gt;

== Least squares estimator for ''β'' ==

Using matrix notation, the sum of squared residuals is given by

: &lt;math&gt;S(\beta) = (y-X\beta)^T(y-X\beta). &lt;/math&gt;

Since this is a quadratic expression, the vector which gives the global minimum may be found via [[Matrix calculus#Derivatives with vectors|matrix calculus]] by differentiating with respect to the vector&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (using denominator layout) and setting equal to zero:

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \frac{dS}{d\beta}(\hat\beta) = \frac{d}{d\beta}\bigg(y^Ty - \beta^TX^Ty - y^TX\beta + \beta^TX^TX\beta\bigg)\bigg|_{\beta=\hat\beta} = -2X^Ty + 2X^TX\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt;

By assumption matrix ''X'' has full column rank, and therefore ''X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;X'' is invertible and the least squares estimator for ''β'' is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty &lt;/math&gt;

== Unbiasedness and variance of &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; ==
Plug ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Xβ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ε'' into the formula for &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; and then use the [[Law of iterated expectation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}\operatorname{E}[\,\hat\beta] &amp;= \operatorname{E}\Big[(X^TX)^{-1}X^T(X\beta+\varepsilon)\Big] \\
&amp;= \beta + \operatorname{E}\Big[(X^TX)^{-1}X^T\varepsilon\Big] \\
&amp;= \beta + \operatorname{E}\Big[\operatorname{E}\Big[(X^TX)^{-1}X^T\varepsilon|X \Big]\Big] \\
&amp;= \beta + \operatorname{E}\Big[(X^TX)^{-1}X^T\operatorname{E}[\varepsilon|X]\Big]
&amp;= \beta,\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where E[''ε''|''X'']&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 by assumptions of the model.

For the variance, let the covariance matrix of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\,\varepsilon\varepsilon^T\,] = \sigma^2 I&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the identity &lt;math&gt;m\,\times\,m&lt;/math&gt; matrix).
Then,

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[\,(\hat\beta - \beta)(\hat\beta - \beta)^T] &amp;= \operatorname{E}\Big[ ((X^TX)^{-1}X^T\varepsilon)((X^TX)^{-1}X^T\varepsilon)^T \Big] \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E}\Big[ (X^TX)^{-1}X^T\varepsilon\varepsilon^TX(X^TX)^{-1} \Big] \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E}\Big[ (X^TX)^{-1}X^T\sigma^2X(X^TX)^{-1} \Big] \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E}\Big[ \sigma^2(X^TX)^{-1}X^TX(X^TX)^{-1} \Big] \\
&amp;= \sigma^2 (X^TX)^{-1},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where we used the fact that &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta} - \beta &lt;/math&gt; is just an affine transformation of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; by the matrix &lt;math&gt;(X^TX)^{-1}X^T&lt;/math&gt; ( see article on the [[multivariate normal distribution]] under the affine transformation section).

For a simple linear regression model, where &lt;math&gt;\beta = [\beta_0,\beta_1]^T&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; is the y-intercept and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; is the slope), one obtains

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \sigma^2 (X^TX)^{-1} &amp;=
 \sigma^2 \left( \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;1&amp;... \\x_1&amp;x_2&amp;...\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp; x_1\\1&amp; x_2\\...&amp;...\end{pmatrix} \right)^{-1}\\
&amp;=  \sigma^2 \left(\sum_{i=1}^m \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp; x_i\\x_i&amp; x_i^2\end{pmatrix} \right)^{-1}\\
&amp;=  \sigma^2 \begin{pmatrix} m&amp; \sum x_i\\\sum x_i&amp; \sum x_i^2\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\\
&amp;=  \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{1}{m\sum x_i^2-(\sum x_i)^2}\begin{pmatrix} \sum x_i^2&amp; -\sum x_i\\-\sum x_i&amp; m\end{pmatrix}\\
&amp;=  \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{1}{m\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}\begin{pmatrix} \sum x_i^2&amp; -\sum x_i\\-\sum x_i&amp; m\end{pmatrix}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
\operatorname{Var}(\beta_1) &amp;= \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - \bar{x})^2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Expected value of &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; ==
First we will plug in the expression for ''y'' into the estimator, and use the fact that ''X'M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''MX''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (matrix ''M'' projects onto the space orthogonal to ''X''):

: &lt;math&gt; \hat\sigma^2 = \tfrac{1}{n}y'My = \tfrac{1}{n} (X\beta+\varepsilon)'M(X\beta+\varepsilon) = \tfrac{1}{n} \varepsilon'M\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Now we can recognize ''ε'Mε'' as a 1×1 matrix, such matrix is equal to its own [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]]. This is useful because by properties of trace operator, '''tr'''(''AB'')='''tr'''(''BA''), and we can use this to separate disturbance ''ε'' from matrix ''M'' which is a function of regressors ''X'':

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}\,\hat\sigma^2
         = \tfrac{1}{n}\operatorname{E}\big[\operatorname{tr}(\varepsilon'M\varepsilon)\big] 
         = \tfrac{1}{n}\operatorname{tr}\big(\operatorname{E}[M\varepsilon\varepsilon']\big)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Law of iterated expectation]] this can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\,\hat\sigma^2
         = \tfrac{1}{n}\operatorname{tr}\Big(\operatorname{E}\big[M\,\operatorname{E}[\varepsilon\varepsilon'|X]\big]\Big)
         = \tfrac{1}{n}\operatorname{tr}\big(\operatorname{E}[\sigma^2MI]\big)
         = \tfrac{1}{n}\sigma^2\operatorname{E}\big[ \operatorname{tr}\,M \big] &lt;/math&gt;

Recall that ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''P'' where ''P'' is the projection onto linear space spanned by columns of matrix ''X''. By properties of a [[projection matrix]], it has ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;rank(''X'') eigenvalues equal to 1, and all other eigenvalues are equal to 0. Trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its characteristic values, thus tr(''P'')=''p'', and tr(''M'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''. Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\,\hat\sigma^2 = \frac{n-p}{n} \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;

Note: in the later section [[#Maximum_likelihood_approach|“Maximum likelihood”]] we show that under the additional assumption that errors are distributed normally, the estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to a chi-squared distribution with ''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''p'' degrees of freedom, from which the formula for expected value would immediately follow. However the result we have shown in this section is valid regardless of the distribution of the errors, and thus has importance on its own.

== Consistency and asymptotic normality of &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; ==
Estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta = \big(\tfrac{1}{n}X'X\big)^{-1}\tfrac{1}{n}X'y 
                  = \beta + \big(\tfrac{1}{n}X'X\big)^{-1}\tfrac{1}{n} X'\varepsilon 
                  = \beta\; + \;\bigg(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_ix'_i\bigg)^{\!\!-1} \bigg(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\varepsilon_i\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;
We can use the [[law of large numbers]] to establish that 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_ix'_i\ \xrightarrow{p}\ \operatorname{E}[x_ix_i']=\frac{Q_{xx}}{n}, \qquad 
        \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\varepsilon_i\ \xrightarrow{p}\ \operatorname{E}[x_i\varepsilon_i]=0&lt;/math&gt;
By [[Slutsky's theorem]] and [[continuous mapping theorem]] these results can be combined to establish consistency of estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta\ \xrightarrow{p}\ \beta + nQ_{xx}^{-1}\cdot 0 = \beta&lt;/math&gt;

The [[central limit theorem]] tells us that
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\varepsilon_i\ \xrightarrow{d}\ \mathcal{N}\big(0,\,V\big),&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;V = \operatorname{Var}[x_i\varepsilon_i] = \operatorname{E}[\,\varepsilon_i^2x_ix'_i\,] = \operatorname{E}\big[\,\operatorname{E}[\varepsilon_i^2\mid x_i]\;x_ix'_i\,\big] = \sigma^2 \frac{Q_{xx}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying [[Slutsky's theorem]] again we'll have
: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}(\hat\beta-\beta) = \bigg(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_ix'_i\bigg)^{\!\!-1} \bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\varepsilon_i\bigg)\ \xrightarrow{d}\ Q_{xx}^{-1}n\cdot\mathcal{N}\big(0, \sigma^2\frac{Q_{xx}}{n}\big) = \mathcal{N}\big(0,\sigma^2Q_{xx}^{-1}n\big)&lt;/math&gt;

== Maximum likelihood approach ==
[[Maximum likelihood estimation]] is a generic technique for estimating the unknown parameters in a statistical model by constructing a log-likelihood function corresponding to the joint distribution of the data, then maximizing this function over all possible parameter values. In order to apply this method, we have to make an assumption about the distribution of y given X so that the log-likelihood function can be constructed.  The connection of maximum likelihood estimation to OLS arises when this distribution is modeled as a [[Multivariate normal distribution|multivariate normal]].

Specifically, assume that the errors ε have multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and variance matrix ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''I''. Then the distribution of ''y'' conditionally on ''X'' is
: &lt;math&gt;y|X\ \sim\ \mathcal{N}(X\beta,\, \sigma^2I)&lt;/math&gt;
and the log-likelihood function of the data will be
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}(\beta,\sigma^2|X) 
    &amp;= \ln\bigg( \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}(\sigma^2)^{n/2}}e^{ -\frac{1}{2}(y-X\beta)'(\sigma^2I)^{-1}(y-X\beta) } \bigg) \\
    &amp;= -\frac{n}{2}\ln 2\pi - \frac{n}{2}\ln\sigma^2 - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-X\beta)'(y-X\beta)
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating this expression with respect to ''β'' and ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; we'll find the ML estimates of these parameters:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\beta'} = -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\Big(-2X'y + 2X'X\beta\Big)=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \hat\beta = (X'X)^{-1}X'y \\
  &amp; \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\sigma^2} = -\frac{n}{2}\frac{1}{\sigma^2} + \frac{1}{2\sigma^4}(y-X\beta)'(y-X\beta)=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \hat\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}(y-X\hat\beta)'(y-X\hat\beta) = \frac{1}{n}S(\hat\beta)
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
We can check that this is indeed a maximum by looking at the [[Hessian matrix]] of the log-likelihood function.

=== Finite-sample distribution ===
Since we have assumed in this section that the distribution of error terms is known to be normal, it becomes possible to derive the explicit expressions for the distributions of estimators &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta = (X'X)^{-1}X'y = (X'X)^{-1}X'(X\beta+\varepsilon) = \beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I)&lt;/math&gt;
so that by the [[Multivariate normal distribution#Affine transformation|affine transformation properties of multivariate normal distribution]]

: &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta|X\ \sim\ \mathcal{N}(\beta,\, \sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly the distribution of &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; follows from

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hat\sigma^2 &amp;= \tfrac{1}{n}(y-X(X'X)^{-1}X'y)'(y-X(X'X)^{-1}X'y) \\[5pt]
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{n}(My)'My \\[5pt]
&amp;=\tfrac{1}{n}(X\beta+\varepsilon)'M(X\beta+\varepsilon) \\[5pt]
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{n}\varepsilon'M\varepsilon,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M=I-X(X'X)^{-1}X'&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric [[projection matrix]] onto subspace orthogonal to ''X'', and thus ''MX = X'M = ''0. We have argued [[#Expected_value_of_.CF.83.CC.82.C2.B2|before]] that this matrix rank ''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''p'', and thus by properties of [[Chi-squared distribution#Related distributions and properties|chi-squared distribution]],
: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{n}{\sigma^2} \hat\sigma^2|X = (\varepsilon/\sigma)'M(\varepsilon/\sigma)\ \sim\ \chi^2_{n-p}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the estimators &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; turn out to be [[Independent random variables|independent]] (conditional on ''X''), a fact which is fundamental for construction of the classical t- and F-tests. The independence can be easily seen from following: the estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; represents coefficients of vector decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=X\hat\beta=Py=X\beta+P\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; by the basis of columns of ''X'', as such &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a function of ''Pε''. At the same time, the estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; is a norm of vector ''Mε'' divided by ''n'', and thus this estimator is a function of ''Mε''. Now, random variables (''Pε'', ''Mε'') are jointly normal as a linear transformation of ''ε'', and they are also uncorrelated because ''PM'' = 0. By properties of multivariate normal distribution, this means that ''Pε'' and ''Mε'' are independent, and therefore estimators &lt;math&gt;\hat\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; will be independent as well.

==Derivation of simple linear regression estimators==
{{further|Simple linear regression}}

We look for &lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE):
:&lt;math&gt;\min_{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}} \,\operatorname{SSE}\left(\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\right) \equiv \min_{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_{i} - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta}x_i\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

To find a minimum take partial derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                 &amp;\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{\alpha}} \left (\operatorname{SSE} \left(\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\right) \right ) = -2\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta}x_i\right) = 0 \\
  \Rightarrow {} &amp;\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta}x_i\right) = 0 \\
  \Rightarrow {} &amp;\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
  \Rightarrow {} &amp;\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = n\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
  \Rightarrow {} &amp;\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_{i} = \hat{\alpha} + \frac{1}{n} \hat{\beta}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
  \Rightarrow {} &amp;\bar{y} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}\bar{x}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Before taking partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, substitute the previous result for &lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n \left[y_i - \left(\bar{y} - \hat{\beta} \bar{x}\right) - \hat{\beta}x_{i}\right]^2 = \min_{\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n \left[\left(y_i - \bar{y}\right) - \hat{\beta}\left(x_i - \bar{x}\right) \right]^2&lt;/math&gt;

Now, take the derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
            &amp;\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{\beta}} \left (\operatorname{SSE} \left(\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\right) \right )= -2\sum_{i=1}^n \left[\left(y_{i} - \bar{y}\right) - \hat{\beta}\left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)\right]\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right) = 0 \\
  \Rightarrow {} &amp;\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i - \bar{y}\right)\left(x_i - \bar{x}\right) - \hat{\beta}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)^2 = 0 \\
  \Rightarrow {} &amp;\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_{i} - \bar{y}\right)\left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^2} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(x, y)}{\operatorname{Var}(x)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

And finally substitute &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; to determine &lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha} = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">In the mathematical discipline of [[set theory]], '''ramified forcing''' is the original form of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] introduced by  {{harvtxt|Cohen|1963}} to prove the [[independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] of the [[continuum hypothesis]] from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]. Ramified forcing starts with a model {{mvar|M}} of set theory in which the [[axiom of constructibility]], {{math|1=''V'' = ''L''}}, holds, and then builds up a larger model {{math|''M''[''G'']}} of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory by adding a generic subset {{mvar|G}} of a [[partially ordered set]] to {{mvar|M}}, imitating [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[constructible hierarchy]].

[[Dana Scott]] and [[Robert M. Solovay|Robert Solovay]] realized that the use of [[constructible universe|constructible set]]s was an unnecessary complication, and could be replaced by a simpler construction similar to [[John von Neumann]]'s construction of the universe as a union of sets {{math|''R''(α)}} for ordinals {{math|α}}. Their simplification was originally called "unramified forcing" {{harv|Shoenfield|1971}}, but is now usually just called "forcing". As a result, ramified forcing is only rarely used.

In [[information technology]] a '''reasoning system''' is a [[software system]] that generates conclusions from available [[knowledge]] using [[logic]]al techniques such as [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Reasoning systems play an important role in the implementation of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge-based systems]].

By the everyday usage definition of the phrase, all computer systems are reasoning systems in that they all automate some type of logic or decision. In typical use in the [[Information Technology]] field however, the phrase is usually reserved for systems that perform more complex kinds of reasoning. For example, not for systems that do fairly straightforward types of reasoning such as calculating a sales tax or customer discount but making logical inferences about a medical diagnosis or mathematical theorem. Reasoning systems come in two modes: interactive and batch processing. Interactive systems interface with the user to ask clarifying questions or otherwise allow the user to guide the reasoning process. Batch systems take in all the available information at once and generate the best answer possible without user feedback or guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wos|first1=Larry|last2=Owerbeek|first2=Ross|last3=Ewing|first3=Lusk|last4=Boyle|first4=Jim|title=Automated Reasoning: Introductions and Applications|date=1984|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-054453-1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasoning systems have a wide field of application that includes [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], [[Business rules approach|business rule processing]], [[problem solving]], [[complex event processing]], [[intrusion detection]], [[predictive analytics]], [[robotics]], [[computer vision]], and [[natural language processing]].

==History==
The first reasoning systems were theorem provers, systems that represent axioms and statements in First Order Logic and then use rules of logic such as [[modus ponens]] to infer new statements. Another early type of reasoning system were general problem solvers. These were systems such as the [[General Problem Solver]] designed by [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herb Simon|Simon]]. General problem solvers attempted to provide a generic planning engine that could represent and solve structured problems. They worked by decomposing problems into smaller more manageable sub-problems, solving each sub-problem and assembling the partial answers into one final answer. Another example general problem solver was the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|SOAR]] family of systems.

In practice these theorem provers and general problem solvers were seldom useful for practical applications and required specialized users with knowledge of logic to utilize. The first practical application of [[automated reasoning]] were [[expert system]]s. Expert systems focused on much more well defined domains than general problem solving such as medical diagnosis or analyzing faults in an aircraft. Expert systems also focused on more limited implementations of logic. Rather than attempting to implement the full range of logical expressions they typically focused on modus-ponens implemented via IF-THEN rules. Focusing on a specific domain and allowing only a restricted subset of logic improved the performance of such systems so that they were practical for use in the real world and not merely as research demonstrations as most previous automated reasoning systems had been. The engine used for automated reasoning in expert systems were typically called [[inference engine]]s. Those used for more general logical inferencing are typically called [[Automated theorem provers|theorem provers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=AddisonWesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas| last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise in popularity of expert systems many new types of automated reasoning were applied to diverse problems in government and industry. Some such as case-based reasoning were off shoots of expert systems research. Others such as constraint satisfaction algorithms were also influenced by fields such as decision technology and linear programming. Also, a completely different approach, one not based on symbolic reasoning but on a connectionist model has also been extremely productive. This latter type of automated reasoning is especially well suited to pattern matching and signal detection types of problems such as text searching and face matching.

==Use of logic==
The term reasoning system can be used to apply to just about any kind of sophisticated decision system as illustrated by the specific areas described below. However, the most common use of the term reasoning system implies the computer representation of logic.  Various implementations demonstrate significant variation in terms of [[Formal system|systems of logic]] and formality. Most reasoning systems implement variations of [[Propositional calculus|propositional]] and [[Symbolic logic|symbolic]] ([[Predicate logic|predicate]]) logic.  These variations may be mathematically precise representations of formal logic systems (e.g., [[First-order logic|FOL]]), or extended and [[Hybrid logic|hybrid]] versions of those systems (e.g., Courteous logic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin N. |last=Grosof |title=Courteous Logic Programs: Prioritized Conflict Handling For Rules |date=30 December 1997 |work=IBM Research Report |id=RC 20836 (92273) |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/iagents/paps/rc20836.ps |format=Postscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   Reasoning systems may explicitly implement additional logic types (e.g., [[Modal logic|modal]], [[Deontic logic|deontic]], [[Temporal logic|temporal]] logics).  However, many reasoning systems implement imprecise and semi-formal approximations to recognised logic systems.  These systems typically support a variety of procedural and semi-[[Declarative programming|declarative]] techniques in order to model different reasoning strategies.  They emphasise pragmatism over formality and may depend on custom extensions and attachments in order to solve real-world problems.

Many reasoning systems employ [[deductive reasoning]] to draw [[inference]]s from available knowledge.  These inference engines support forward reasoning or backward reasoning to infer conclusions via [[modus ponens]].   The [[Recursion|recursive]] reasoning methods they employ are termed ‘[[forward chaining]]’ and ‘[[backward chaining]]’, respectively. Although reasoning systems widely support deductive inference, some systems employ [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[Defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] and other types of reasoning. [[Heuristic]]s may also be employed to determine acceptable solutions to [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable problems]].

Reasoning systems may employ the [[closed world assumption]] (CWA) or [[open world assumption]] (OWA).  The OWA is often associated with [[Ontology|ontological]] knowledge representation and the [[Semantic Web]].   Different systems exhibit a variety of approaches to [[negation]].  As well as [[Logical complement|logical]] or [[bitwise complement]], systems may support existential forms of strong and weak negation including [[Negation as failure|negation-as-failure]] and ‘inflationary’ negation (negation of non-[[Ground expression|ground atoms]]).   Different reasoning systems may support [[Monotonic function#Monotonic logic|monotonic]] or [[Non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] reasoning, [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] and other logical techniques.

==Reasoning under uncertainty==

Many reasoning systems provide capabilities for reasoning under [[uncertainty]]. This is important when building [[situated]] [[Distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System|reasoning agents]] which must deal with uncertain representations of the world.  There are several common approaches to handling uncertainty.  These include the use of certainty factors, [[Probability|probabilistic]] methods such as [[Bayesian inference]] or [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], multi-valued (‘[[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]]’) logic and various [[Connectionism|connectionist]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Yoram |last1=Moses |first2=Moshe Y |last2=Vardi |first3=Ronald |last3=Fagin |first4=Joseph Y |last4=Halpern |title=Reasoning About Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHmlRamoszMC |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56200-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of reasoning system==

This section provides a non-exhaustive and informal categorisation of common types of reasoning system.  These categories are not absolute.  They overlap to a significant degree and share a number of techniques, methods and [[algorithm]]s.

===Constraint solvers===
Constraint solvers solve [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s (CSPs).  They support [[constraint programming]].  A [[Constraint (information theory)|constraint]] is a condition which must be met by any valid [[Problem solving|solution to a problem]].  Constraints are defined declaratively and applied to [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] within given domains.  Constraint solvers use [[Search algorithm|search]], [[backtracking]] and [[Local consistency|constraint propagation]] techniques to find solutions and determine optimal solutions.  They may employ forms of [[Linear programming|linear]] and [[nonlinear programming]].  They are often used to perform [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] within highly [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] problem spaces.  For example, they may be used to calculate optimal scheduling, design efficient [[integrated circuit]]s or maximise productivity in a manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Schalkoff |title=Intelligent Systems: Principles, Paradigms and Pragmatics: Principles, Paradigms and Pragmatics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80FXUtF5kRoC |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-8017-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorem provers===
[[Automated theorem proving|Theorem provers]] use [[automated reasoning]] techniques to determine [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] of mathematical theorems.  They may also be used to verify existing proofs.  In addition to academic use, typical applications of theorem provers include verification of the correctness of integrated circuits, software programs, engineering designs, etc.

===Logic programs===
[[Logic programming|Logic programs]] (LPs) are [[Computer program|software programs]] written using [[programming language]]s whose [[Language primitive|primitives]] and [[Expression (programming)|expressions]] provide direct representations of constructs drawn from mathematical logic.  An example of a general-purpose logic programming language is [[Prolog]].  LPs represent the direct application of logic programming to solve problems.   Logic programming is characterised by highly declarative approaches based on formal logic, and has wide application across many disciplines.

===Rule engines===
[[Business rules engine|Rule engines]] represent conditional logic as discrete rules.  Rule sets can be managed and applied separately to other functionality.  They have wide applicability across many domains.  Many rule engines implement reasoning capabilities.  A common approach is to implement [[Production system (computer science)|production system]]s to support forward or backward chaining.  Each rule (‘production’) binds a conjunction of [[Clause|predicate clauses]] to a list of executable actions.  At run-time, the rule engine matches productions against facts and executes (‘fires’) the associated action list for each match.  If those actions remove or modify any facts, or assert new facts, the engine immediately re-computes the set of matches.  Rule engines are widely used to model and apply [[business rule]]s, to control [[Decision making|decision-making]] in automated processes and to enforce business and technical policies.

===Deductive classifier===
[[Deductive classifier]]s arose slightly later than rule-based systems and were a component of a new type of artificial intelligence knowledge representation tool known as [[frame language]]s. A frame language describes the problem domain as a set of classes, subclasses, and relations among the classes. It is similar to the [[Object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented]] model. Unlike object-oriented models however, frame languages have a formal semantics based on first order logic. They utilize this semantics to provide input to the deductive classifier. The classifier in turn can analyze a given model (known as an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and determine if the various relations described in the model are consistent. If the ontology is not consistent the classifier will highlight the declarations that are inconsistent. If the ontology is consistent the classifier can then do further reasoning and draw additional conclusions about the relations of the objects in the ontology. For example, it may determine that an object is actually a subclass or instance of additional classes as those described by the user. Classifiers are an important technology in analyzing the ontologies used to describe models in the [[Semantic web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine learning systems===
[[Machine learning]] systems evolve their behavior over time based on [[experience]].   This may involve reasoning over observed events or example data provided for training purposes.  For example, machine learning systems may use [[inductive reasoning]] to generate [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] for observed facts.  Learning systems search for generalised rules or functions that yield results in line with observations and then use these generalisations to control future behavior.

===Case-based reasoning systems===
[[Case-based reasoning]] (CBR) systems provide solutions to problems by analysing similarities to other problems for which known solutions already exist.  They use [[Analogy|analogical]] reasoning to infer solutions based on case histories.  CBR systems are commonly used in customer/[[technical support]] and [[call centre]] scenarios and have applications in [[Manufacturing|industrial manufacture]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[law]] and many other areas.

===Procedural reasoning systems===
A [[Procedural Reasoning System|procedural reasoning system]] (PRS) uses reasoning techniques to select [[plan]]s from a [[procedural knowledge]] base.  Each plan represents a course of action for achievement of a given [[goal]].  The PRS implements a [[Belief-Desire-Intention software model|belief-desire-intention model]] by reasoning over facts (‘[[belief]]s’) to select appropriate plans (‘[[intention]]s’) for given goals (‘desires’).  Typical applications of PRS include management, monitoring and [[Fault detection and isolation|fault detection]] systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6389">'''Sergei Ivanovich Adian''', also '''Adyan''' ({{lang-hy|Սերգեյ Իվանովիչ Ադյան}}; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Ива́нович Адя́н}}, born 1 January 1931), is a [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n mathematician. He is a professor at the [[Moscow State University]] and is known for his work in [[group theory]], especially on the [[Burnside's problem|Burnside problem]].

==Biography==
Adian was born near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Elizavetpol]]. He grew up there in an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family. He studied at [[Yerevan]] and [[Moscow]] [[pedagogical]] institutes. His advisor was [[Pyotr Novikov]]. He has been working at Moscow State University (MSU) since 1965. [[Alexander Razborov]] was one of his students.

==Mathematical career==
In his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; of a real variable satisfying the functional equation &lt;math&gt;f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)&lt;/math&gt; and having discontinuities is dense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear functions.) This result was not published at the time. About 25 years later the American mathematician [[Edwin Hewitt]] from the [[University of Washington]] gave preprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which was devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much later.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2018}}

By the beginning of 1955, Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial invariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a fixed group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, for any group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. These results constituted his [[Ph.D.]] thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most remarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the [[Adian–Rabin theorem]]. What distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody has added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian’s result was immediately used by [[Andrey Markov]] in his proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic.

===Burnside problem===

About the Burnside problem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Very much like [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in number theory, Burnside’s
problem has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination exerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which then turns out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about it to the mind of the mathematician.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for &lt;math&gt;n \in {2, 3, 4, 6}&lt;/math&gt; and the matrix groups. However, this did not hinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The only question was
to find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief was too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came close to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which subtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact, there were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the
form &lt;math&gt;X^n = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

An approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by P. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete realization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence of Novikov and his wife [[Lyudmila Keldysh]], Adian settled down to work on the Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both
collaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper appeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 4381&lt;/math&gt;, and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well.

The solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding
and deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result
is one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction
used in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened
by 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by
the exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words
of Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more ‘penetrating’
than Adian.

In contrast to the Adian–Rabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way ‘closed’ the Burnside problem. Moreover,
over a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify
the method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other
fundamental problems in group theory.

By the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors
appeared who mastered the Novikov–Adian method, the theory already
represented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both
periodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.

'''Stationary-wave integrated Fourier transform spectrometry (SWIFTS)''' is an analytical technique used for measuring the distribution of light across an [[Visible spectrum|optical spectrum]]. SWIFTS technology is based on a [[Near-field optics|near-field]] [[Gabriel Lippmann|Lippmann]] architecture. An optical signal is injected into a [[waveguide]] and ended by a mirror (true Lippman configuration). The input signal interferes with the reflected signal, creating a [[stationary wave]]. 

In a counter-propagative architecture, the two optical signals are injected at the opposite ends of the waveguide. The [[evanescent wave]]s propagating within the waveguide are then sampled by optical probes. This results in an [[interferogram]]. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a [[Fourier transform]], is later used to give the [[spectrum]] of the light.

== History ==

In 1891, at the [[Académie des Sciences]] in Paris, [[Gabriel Lippmann]] presented a colour photograph of the Sun’s spectrum obtained with his new [[photographic plate]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Lippmann: Compte Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences (Paris) 112 (1891), 274&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1894, he published an article on how his plate was able to record colour information in the depth of photographic grainless [[gelatin]] and how the same plate after processing could restore the original colour image merely through light reflection.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lippmann: Compte Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences (Paris) (1894) 92&lt;/ref&gt; He was thus the inventor of true interferential [[Color photography|colour photography]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1908 for this breakthrough. Unfortunately, this principle was too complex to use. The method was abandoned a few years after its discovery. 

One aspect of the Lippmann concept that was ignored at that time relates to [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] applications. Early in 1933, Ives proposed to use a [[Photoelectric devices|photoelectric device]] to probe stationary waves to make spectrometric measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, H.E., Standing light waves, repetition of an experiment by Wiener, using a photoelectric probe surface , JOSA., 23, 73–83 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, P. Connes&lt;ref&gt;Connes, P., Le Coarer, E., 3-D Spectroscopy: The Historical and Logical viewpoint IAU Colloquium N 149, Marseille, 22–25 Mars, 38–49 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to use the emerging new technology of detectors for three-dimensional Lippmann-based spectrometry. Following this, a first realization of a very compact spectrometer based on a [[Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems|micro-opto-electromechanical system]] (MOEMS) was reported by Knipp et al. in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;D. Knipp, « Spectrometers shrink down », Nature Photonics (2007), 1, 8, 444–445&lt;/ref&gt; but it had a very limited spectral resolution. In 2004, two French researchers, Etienne Le Coarer from [[Joseph Fourier University]] and Pierre Benech from [[INP Grenoble]], coupled sensing elements to the evanescent part of [[standing wave|stationary waves]] within a single-mode [[waveguide]]. In 2007, those two researchers reported a [[Near-field optics|near-field]] method to probe the [[interferogram]] within a [[waveguide]].&lt;ref&gt;le Coarer, E., Blaize, S., Benech, P., Stefanon, I., Morand, A., Le Rondel, G., Leblond, G., Kern, P., Fedeli, J.-M., Royer, P., “Wavelength-scale stationary-wave integrated Fourier transform Spectrometry”, Nature Photonics (2007), 1, 8, 473 – 478&lt;/ref&gt; The first SWIFTS-based spectrometers appeared in 2011 based on a SWIFTS linear configuration.

== Technology principle ==

The technology works by probing an optical [[stationary wave]], or the sum of the [[standing waves]] in the case of polychromatic light, created by a light to be analyzed. In a SWIFTS linear configuration (true Lippman configuration), the [[stationary wave]] is created by a single-mode [[waveguide]] ended by a fixed mirror. The [[stationary wave]] is regularly sampled on one side of a [[waveguide]] using nano-scattering dots. These dots are located in the [[evanescent field]]. These nanodots are characterized by an [[Refractive index|optical index]] difference with the medium in which the evanescent field is located. The light is then scattered around an axis perpendicular to the [[waveguide]]. For each dot, this scattered light is detected by a pixel aligned with this axis. The intensity detected is therefore proportional to the intensity inside the [[waveguide]] at the exact location of the dot. This results in a linear image of the [[interferogram]]. No moving parts are used. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a [[Fourier transform]], is then applied to this linear image and gives the [[spectrum]] of the light.

It should be noted that the [[interferogram]] is truncated. Only the frequencies corresponding to the zero [[Optical path length|Optical Path Difference]] (OPD) at the mirror, up to the farthest dots are sampled. Higher frequencies are rejected. This [[interferogram]]’s truncation determines the [[spectral resolution]]. It is also to be noted that the [[interferogram]] is under-sampled. A consequence of this under-sampling is a limitation of the wavelength bandwidth to which the mathematical function is applied.

SWIFTS technology displays the [[Fellgett's advantage|Fellgett’s advantage]], which is derived from the fact that an [[interferometer]] measures wavelengths simultaneously with the same elements of the detector, whereas a dispersive spectrometer measures them successively. Fellgett’s advantage also states that when collecting a spectrum whose measurement noise is dominated by detector noise, a multiplex spectrometer such as a [[Fourier transform spectroscopy|Fourier Transform Spectrometer]] will produce a relative improvement in the [[signal-to-noise ratio]], with respect to an equivalent scanning [[monochromator]], that is approximately equal to the square root of the number of sample points comprising the [[spectrum]]. The Connes advantage states that the wavenumber scale of an [[interferometer]], derived from a [[Helium–neon laser|helium-neon (HeNe) laser]], is more accurate and boasts better long-term stability than the calibration of dispersive instruments.

In [[computational geometry]], the '''Theta graph''', or '''&lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph''', is a type of [[geometric spanner]] similar to a [[Yao graph]].  The basic method of construction involves partitioning the space around each vertex into a set of ''cones'', which themselves partition the remaining vertices of the graph. Like Yao Graphs, a &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph contains at most one edge per cone; where they differ is how that edge is selected. Whereas Yao Graphs will select the nearest vertex according to the [[metric space]] of the graph, the &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph defines a fixed ray contained within each cone (conventionally the bisector of the cone) and selects the nearest neighbour with respect to orthogonal projections to that ray. The resulting graph exhibits several good spanner properties

[[File:Theta-cone.svg|thumb|right|200px|Example cone of a &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph emanating from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; with orthogonal projection line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;]]

&lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graphs are specified with a few parameters which determine their construction.  The most obvious parameter is &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to the number of equal angle cones that partition the space around each vertex. In particular, for a vertex &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, a cone about &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be imagined as two infinite rays emanating from it with angle &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi/k&lt;/math&gt; between them. With respect to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we can label these cones as &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; in an counterclockwise pattern from &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;, which conventionally opens so that its bisector has angle 0 with respect to the plane.  As these cones partition the plane, they also partition the remaining vertex set of the graph (assuming [[general position]]) into the sets &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;V_k&lt;/math&gt;, again with respect to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Every vertex in the graph gets the same number of cones in the same orientation, and we can consider the set of vertices that fall into each.

Considering a single cone, we need to specify another ray emanating from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, which we will label &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.  For every vertex in &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;, we consider the orthogonal projection of each &lt;math&gt;v \in V_i&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the vertex with the closest such projection, then the edge &lt;math&gt;\{p,r\}&lt;/math&gt; is added to the graph.  This is the primary difference from Yao Graphs which always select the nearest vertex; in the example image, a Yao Graph would include the edge &lt;math&gt;\{p,q\}&lt;/math&gt; instead.

Construction of a &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph is possible with a [[sweepline|sweepline algorithm]] in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log{n})&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;ref name="gsgs" /&gt;

==Properties==
&lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graphs exhibit several good [[geometric spanner]] properties.

When the parameter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, the &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph is a sparse spanner. As each cone generates at most one edge per cone, most vertices will have small degree, and the overall graph will have at most &lt;math&gt;k \cdot n = O(n)&lt;/math&gt; edges.

The [[stretch factor]] between any pair of points in a spanner is defined as the ratio between their metric space distance, and their distance within the spanner (i.e. from following edges of the spanner). The stretch factor of the entire spanner is the maximum stretch factor over all pairs of points within it.  Recall from above that &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi/k&lt;/math&gt;, then when &lt;math&gt;k \geq 9&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph has a stretch factor of at most &lt;math&gt;1/(\cos\theta - \sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="gsgs" /&gt; If the orthogonal projection line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; in each cone is chosen to be the bisector, then for &lt;math&gt;k \geq 7&lt;/math&gt;, the spanning ratio is at most &lt;math&gt;1/(1 - 2\sin(\pi / k))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="ruppertseidel1991"&gt;Ruppert, J., &amp; Seidel, R. (1991). Approximating the ''d''-dimensional complete Euclidean graph. In Proc. 3rd Canad. Conf. Comput. Geom (pp. 207–210).&lt;/ref&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;-graph forms a [[nearest neighbour graph]]. For &lt;math&gt;k = 2&lt;/math&gt;, it is easy to see that the graph is connected, as each vertex will connect to something to its left, and something to its right, if they exist. For &lt;math&gt;k = 4&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

When &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an even number, we can create a variant of the &lt;math&gt;\Theta_k&lt;/math&gt;-graph known as the ''half-&lt;math&gt;\Theta_k&lt;/math&gt;-graph'', where the cones themselves are partitioned into ''even'' and ''odd'' sets in an alternating fashion, and edges are only considered in the even cones (or, only the odd cones). Half-&lt;math&gt;\Theta_k&lt;/math&gt;-graphs are known to have some very nice properties of their own. For example, the half-&lt;math&gt;\Theta_6&lt;/math&gt;-graph (and, consequently, the &lt;math&gt;\Theta_6&lt;/math&gt;-graph, which is just the union of two complimentary half-&lt;math&gt;\Theta_6&lt;/math&gt;-graphs) is known to be a 2-spanner.&lt;ref name="bonichon_etal" /&gt;

{{Trigonometry}}
[[File:Academ Base of trigonometry.svg|thumb|300px|upright=2|Basis of trigonometry: if two [[right triangle]]s have equal [[Types of angles|acute angles]], they are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]], so their side lengths [[Proportionality (mathematics)|are proportional]]. Proportionality [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s are written within the image: {{math|sin ''θ''}}, {{math|cos ''θ''}}, {{math|tan ''θ''}}, where {{mvar|θ}} is the common measure of five acute angles.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''trigonometric functions''' (also called '''circular functions''', '''angle functions''' or '''goniometric functions'''&lt;ref name="Klein_1924"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein_2004"/&gt;) are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of an [[angle]]. They relate the angles of a [[triangle]] to the lengths of its sides. Trigonometric functions are important in the study of triangles and modeling periodic phenomena, among many other applications.

The most familiar trigonometric functions are the [[sine]], [[#cosine|cosine]], and [[#tangent|tangent]]. In the context of the standard [[unit circle]] (a circle with [[radius]] 1 unit), where a triangle is formed by a ray starting at the origin and making some angle with the {{mvar|x}}-axis, the sine of the angle gives the  {{mvar|y}}-component (the opposite to the angle or the rise) of the triangle, the cosine gives the  {{mvar|x}}-component (the adjacent of the angle or the run), and the tangent function gives the slope ({{mvar|y}}-component divided by the {{mvar|x}}-component).  For angles less than a [[right angle]], trigonometric functions are commonly defined as [[ratio]]s of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle, and their values can be found in the lengths of various line segments around a unit circle.  Modern definitions express trigonometric functions as [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] or as solutions of certain [[differential equation]]s, allowing the extension of the arguments to the whole number line and to the [[complex number]]s.

Trigonometric functions have a wide range of uses including computing unknown lengths and angles in triangles (often right triangles).  In this use, trigonometric functions are used, for instance, in navigation, engineering, and physics. A common use in elementary physics is resolving a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] into [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] coordinates. The sine and cosine functions are also commonly used to model [[periodic function]] phenomena such as [[sound]] and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations through the year.

In modern usage, there are six basic trigonometric functions, tabulated here with equations that relate them to one another. Especially with the last four, these relations are often taken as the ''definitions'' of those functions, but one can define them equally well geometrically, or by other means, and then derive these relations.

==Right-angled triangle definitions==
[[File:Trigonometry triangle.svg|right|200px|A right triangle always includes a 90° ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians) angle, here labeled ''C''. Angles ''A'' and ''B'' may vary. Trigonometric functions specify the relationships among side lengths and interior angles of a right triangle.]]
[[File:Periodic sine.PNG|thumb|'''Top:''' Trigonometric function {{math|sin ''θ''}} for selected angles {{math|''θ''}}, {{math|π − ''θ''}}, {{math|π + ''θ''}}, and {{math|2π − ''θ''}} in the four quadrants.&lt;br&gt;'''Bottom:''' Graph of sine function versus angle. Angles from the top panel are identified.]]
[[File:TrigFunctionDiagram.svg|thumb|Plot of the six trigonometric functions and the unit circle for an angle of 0.7 radians.]]

The notion that there should be some standard correspondence between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the angles of the triangle comes as soon as one recognizes that [[similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]] maintain the same ratios between their sides. That is, for any similar triangle the ratio of the [[hypotenuse]] (for example) and another of the sides remains the same. If the hypotenuse is twice as long, so are the sides. It is these ratios that the trigonometric functions express.

To define the trigonometric functions for the angle ''A'', start with any right triangle that contains the angle ''A''. The three sides of the triangle are named as follows:
* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, in this case side ''h''. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.
* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle we are interested in (angle ''A''), in this case side ''a''.
* The ''adjacent side'' is the side having both the angles of interest (angle ''A'' and right-angle ''C''), in this case side ''b''.

In ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]], according to the [[triangle postulate]], the inside angles of every triangle total 180[[degree (angle)|°]] ({{pi}} [[radian]]s). Therefore, in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles total 90° ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians), so each of these angles must be in the range of {{math|(0, {{sfrac|{{Pi}}|2}})}} as expressed in interval notation. The following definitions apply to angles in this {{math|(0, {{sfrac|{{Pi}}|2}})}} range. They can be extended to the full set of real arguments by using the [[Unit circle#Trigonometric functions on the unit circle|unit circle]], or by requiring certain symmetries and that they be [[periodic function]]s. For example, the figure shows {{math|sin(''θ'')}} for angles {{mvar|θ}}, {{math|{{pi}} − ''θ''}}, {{math|{{pi}} + ''θ''}}, and {{math|2{{pi}} − ''θ''}} depicted on the unit circle (top) and as a graph (bottom). The value of the sine repeats itself apart from sign in all four quadrants, and if the range of {{mvar|θ}} is extended to additional rotations, this behavior repeats periodically with a period 2{{pi}}.

The trigonometric functions are summarized in the following table and described in more detail below. The angle {{mvar|θ}} is the angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent line&amp;nbsp;– the angle at ''A'' in the accompanying diagram.

===Sine, cosine, and tangent===
{{anchor|sine|sin}}The '''sine''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite [[Cathetus|side]] to the length of the hypotenuse. The word comes from the Latin ''sinus'' for gulf or bay,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, sine, ''n.''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; since, given a unit circle, it is the side of the triangle on which the angle ''opens''. In our case:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|right|thumb|An illustration of the relationship between sine and its out-of-[[phase (waves)|phase]] complement, cosine. Cosine is identical, but {{sfrac|{{Pi}}|2}} [[radians]] out of [[Phase (waves)|phase]] to the left; so {{math|cos ''A'' {{=}} sin(''A'' + {{sfrac|&amp;pi;|2}})}}.]]
{{anchor|cosine|cos}}The '''cosine''' (''sine complement'', Latin: ''cosinus'', ''sinus complementi'') of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse, so called because it is the sine of the complementary or co-angle, the other non-right angle.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, cosine, ''n.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[sum of angles of a triangle|angle sum of a triangle]] is {{Pi}} [[radian]]s, the co-angle {{math|''B''}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} − ''A''}}; so {{math|cos ''A'' {{=}} sin ''B'' {{=}} sin({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} − ''A'')}}. In our case:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos A = \frac {\textrm{adjacent}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}}&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|tangent|tan|Tangent}}The '''tangent''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side, so called because it can be represented as a line segment [[Tangent line|tangent]] to the circle, i.e. the line that touches the circle, from Latin ''linea tangens'' or touching line (cf. ''tangere'', to touch).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, tangent, ''adj. and n.''&lt;/ref&gt; In our case:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{adjacent}}&lt;/math&gt;

Tangent may also be represented in terms of sine and cosine. That is:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan A = \frac {\sin A} {\cos A} = \frac {\frac {\textrm{opposite}}{\textrm{hypotenuse}}}{\frac {\textrm{adjacent}}{\textrm{hypotenuse}}} = \frac {\textrm{opposite}}{\textrm{adjacent}}&lt;/math&gt;

These ratios do not depend on the size of the particular right triangle chosen, as long as the focus angle is equal, since all such triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]].

The acronyms "SOH-CAH-TOA" ("soak-a-toe", "sock-a-toa", "so-kah-toa") and "OHSAHCOAT" are commonly used [[Mnemonics in trigonometry|trigonometric mnemonics for these ratios]].

=== Secant, cosecant, and cotangent ===
The remaining three functions are best defined using the three functions above and can be considered their [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s.

{{anchor|secant|sec}}The '''secant''' of an angle is the reciprocal of its cosine, that is, the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent side, so called because it represents the [[secant line]] that ''cuts'' the circle (from Latin: ''secare'', to cut):&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, secant, ''adj.'' and ''n.''&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sec A = \frac {1}{\cos A} = \frac {\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\textrm{adjacent}} = \frac {h} {b}. &lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|cosecant|csc}}The '''cosecant''' (''secant complement'', Latin: ''cosecans'', ''secans complementi'') of an angle is the reciprocal of its sine, that is, the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the opposite side, so called because it is the secant of the complementary or co-angle:

:&lt;math&gt;\csc A = \frac {1}{\sin A} = \frac {\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\textrm{opposite}} = \frac {h} {a}. &lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|cotangent|cot}}The '''cotangent''' (''tangent complement'', Latin: ''cotangens'', ''tangens complementi'') of an angle is the reciprocal of its tangent, that is, the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the opposite side, so called because it is the tangent of the complementary or co-angle:

:&lt;math&gt;\cot A = \frac {1}{\tan A} = \frac {\textrm{adjacent}} {\textrm{opposite}} = \frac {b} {a}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Mnemonics===
Equivalent to the right-triangle definitions, the trigonometric functions can also be defined in terms of the ''rise'', ''run'', and ''[[slope]]'' of a line segment relative to horizontal. The slope is commonly taught as "rise over run" or {{sfrac|rise|run}}. The three main trigonometric functions are commonly taught in the order sine, cosine and tangent. With a line segment length of 1 (as in a [[unit circle]]), the following [[mnemonic device]]s show the correspondence of definitions:

# "Sine is first, rise is first" meaning that Sine takes the angle of the line segment and tells its vertical rise when the length of the line is 1.
# "Cosine is second, run is second" meaning that Cosine takes the angle of the line segment and tells its horizontal run when the length of the line is 1.
# "Tangent combines the rise and run" meaning that Tangent takes the angle of the line segment and tells its slope, or alternatively, tells the vertical rise when the line segment's horizontal run is 1.

This shows the main use of tangent and arctangent: converting between the two ways of telling the slant of a line, i.e. angles and slopes. (The arctangent or "inverse tangent" is not to be confused with the ''cotangent'', which is cosine divided by sine.)

While the length of the line segment makes no difference for the slope (the slope does not depend on the length of the slanted line), it does affect rise and run. To adjust and find the actual rise and run when the line does not have a length of 1, just multiply the sine and cosine by the line length. For instance, if the line segment has length 5, the run at an angle of 7° is 5cos(7°).

==Unit-circle definitions==
[[File:Unit Circle Definitions of Six Trigonometric Functions.png|thumb|300x300px|In this illustration, the six trigonometric functions of an arbitrary angle {{math|''θ''}} are represented as [[Cartesian coordinates]] of points related to the [[unit circle]]. The ordinates of {{math|A}}, {{math|B}} and {{math|D}} are {{math|sin ''θ''}}, {{math|tan ''θ''}} and {{math|csc ''θ''}}, respectively, while the abscissas of {{math|A}}, {{math|C}} and {{math|E}} are {{math|cos ''θ''}}, {{math|cot ''θ''}} and {{math|sec ''θ''}}, respectively.]]
[[File:trigonometric function quadrant sign.svg|thumb|Signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant. The mnemonic "'''all''' '''s'''cience '''t'''eachers (are) '''c'''razy" lists the functions which are positive from quadrants I to IV.&lt;ref name="Heng"/&gt; This is a variation on the mnemonic "[[All Students Take Calculus]]".]]

The six trigonometric functions can be defined as [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate values]] of points on the [[Euclidean plane]] that are related to the [[unit circle]], which is the [[circle]] of radius one centered at the origin {{math|O}} of this coordinate system. While [[#Right-angled triangle definitions|right-angled triangle definitions]] permit the definition of the trigonometric functions for angles between {{math|0}} and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; [[radian]] {{math|(90°),}} the unit circle definitions allow to extend the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of the trigonometric functions to all positive and negative real numbers.

Rotating a [[Line (geometry)#Ray|ray]] from the direction of the positive half of the ''x''-axis by an angle {{mvar|θ}} ([[counterclockwise]] for &lt;math&gt;\theta &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt; and  clockwise for &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;) yields intersection points of this ray (see the figure) with the unit {{nowrap|circle: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A} = (x_\mathrm{A},y_\mathrm{A})&lt;/math&gt;,}} and, by extending the ray to a line if necessary, with the {{nowrap|line &lt;math&gt; \text{“}x=1\text{”}:\;\mathrm{B} = (x_\mathrm{B},y_\mathrm{B}),&lt;/math&gt;}} and with the {{nowrap|line &lt;math&gt; \text{“}y=1\text{”}:\;\mathrm{C} = (x_\mathrm{C},y_\mathrm{C}).&lt;/math&gt;}} The tangent line to the unit circle in point {{math|A}}, which is orthogonal to this ray, intersects the ''y''- and ''x''-axis in points &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{D} = (0,y_\mathrm{D})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E} = (x_\mathrm{E},0)&lt;/math&gt;. The coordinate values of these points give all the existing values of the trigonometric functions for arbitrary real values of {{mvar|θ}} in the following manner.

The trigonometric functions {{math|cos}} and {{math|sin}} are defined, respectively, as the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinate values of point {{math|A}}, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = x_\mathrm{A} \quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad \sin(\theta) = y_\mathrm{A}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Trigonometric_functions|title=Trigonometric Functions|last=Bityutskov|first=V.I.|date=2011-02-07|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229231821/https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Trigonometric_functions|archive-date=2017-12-29|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the range &lt;math&gt;0 \le \theta \le \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; this definition coincides with the right-angled triangle definition by taking the right-angled triangle to have the unit radius {{math|OA}} as [[hypotenuse]], and since for all points &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} = (x,y)&lt;/math&gt; on the unit circle the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt; holds, this definition of cosine and sine also satisfies the '''Pythagorean identity''' 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta=1.&lt;/math&gt;

The other trigonometric functions can be found along the unit circle as 
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta) = y_\mathrm{B} \quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \quad\cot(\theta) = x_\mathrm{C},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\csc(\theta)\ = y_\mathrm{D} \quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \quad\sec(\theta) = x_\mathrm{E}.&lt;/math&gt;

By applying the Pythagorean identity and geometric proof methods, these definitions can readily be shown to coincide with the definitions of tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant in terms of sine and cosine, that is
: &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta =\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos\theta},\quad \cot\theta=\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta},\quad \sec\theta=\frac{1}{\cos\theta},\quad \csc\theta=\frac{1}{\sin\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a rotation of an angle of &lt;math&gt;\pm2\pi&lt;/math&gt; does not change the position or size of a shape, the points {{math|A}}, {{math|B}}, {{math|C}}, {{math|D}}, and {{math|E}} are the same for two angles whose difference is an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Thus trigonometric functions are [[Periodic function|periodic functions]] with period &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the equalities
: &lt;math&gt; \sin\theta = \sin\left(\theta + 2 k \pi \right)\quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad \cos\theta = \cos\left(\theta + 2 k \pi \right)&lt;/math&gt;
hold for any angle {{mvar|θ}} and any [[integer]] {{mvar|k}}. The same is true for the four other trigonometric functions. Observing the sign and the monotonicity of the functions sine, cosine, cosecant, and secant in the four quadrants, shows that {{math|2{{pi}}}} is the smallest value for which they are periodic, i.e., {{math|2{{pi}}}} is the [[periodic function|fundamental period]] of these functions. However, already after a rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; the points {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|C}} return to their original position, so that the tangent function and the cotangent function have a fundamental period of {{pi}}. That is, the equalities
: &lt;math&gt; \tan\theta = \tan(\theta + k\pi) \quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad \cot\theta = \cot(\theta + k\pi)&lt;/math&gt;
hold for any angle {{mvar|θ}} and any integer {{mvar|k}}.

==Algebraic values==
[[File:Unit circle angles color.svg|right|thumb|300px|The [[unit circle]], with some points labeled with their cosine and sine (in this order), and the corresponding angles in radians and degrees.]]
The [[algebraic expression]]s for {{math|sin(0°), sin(30°), sin(45°), sin(60°)}} and {{math|sin(90°)}} are

:&lt;math&gt;0, \quad \frac{1}{2},\quad \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\quad \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\quad 1,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

respectively. Writing the numerators as square roots of consecutive natural numbers (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\sqrt{0}}{2}, \tfrac{\sqrt{1}}{2}, \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \tfrac{\sqrt{4}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;) provides an easy way to remember the values.&lt;ref name="Larson_2013"/&gt;
Such simple expressions generally do not exist for other angles which are rational multiples of a straight angle.

For an angle which, measured in degrees, is a multiple of three, the sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of [[square root]]s, as shown below. These values of the sine and the cosine may thus be constructed by [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|ruler and compass]].

For an angle of an integer number of degrees, the sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of [[square root]]s and the [[cube root]] of a non-real [[complex number]]. [[Galois theory]] allows proof that, if the angle is not a multiple of 3°, non-real cube roots are unavoidable.

For an angle which, measured in degrees, is a [[rational number]], the sine and the cosine are [[algebraic number]]s, which may be expressed in terms of [[nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]]. This results from the fact that the [[Galois group]]s of the [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s are [[cyclic group|cyclic]].

For an angle which, measured in degrees, is not a rational number, then either the angle or both the sine and the cosine are [[transcendental number]]s. This is a corollary of [[Baker's theorem]], proved in 1966.

===Explicit values===
{{main article|Trigonometric constants expressed in real radicals}}
Algebraic expressions for 15°, 18°, 36°, 54°, 72° and 75° are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin 15^\circ = \cos 75^\circ = \frac{\sqrt6-\sqrt2}{4}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 18^\circ = \cos 72^\circ = \frac{\sqrt5-1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 36^\circ = \cos 54^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{10-2\sqrt{5}}}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 54^\circ = \cos 36^\circ = \frac{\sqrt5+1}{4}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 72^\circ = \cos 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{10+2\sqrt{5}}}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 75^\circ = \cos 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt6+\sqrt2}{4}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

From these, the algebraic expressions for all multiples of 3° can be computed. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin 3^\circ = \cos 87^\circ = \frac{2\left(1-\sqrt3\right)\sqrt{5+\sqrt5} + \left(1+\sqrt3\right)\left(\sqrt{10}-\sqrt2\right)}{16}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 6^\circ = \cos 84^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{30-6\sqrt{5}}-\sqrt5-1}{8}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 9^\circ = \cos 81^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{10}+\sqrt2-2\sqrt{5-\sqrt{5}}}{8}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 84^\circ = \cos 6^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{10-2\sqrt{5}}+\sqrt3+\sqrt{15}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 87^\circ = \cos 3^\circ = \frac{2\left(1+\sqrt3\right)\sqrt{5+\sqrt5}-\left(1-\sqrt3\right)\left(\sqrt{10}-\sqrt{2}\right)}{16}.&lt;/math&gt;

Algebraic expressions can be deduced for other angles of an integer number of degrees, for example,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 1^\circ = \frac{\sqrt[3]z - \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]z}}{2i},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a'' + ''ib''}}, and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are the above algebraic expressions for, respectively, {{math|cos 3°}} and {{math|sin 3°}}, and the [[Cube root#Complex numbers|principal cube root]] (that is, the cube root with the largest [[real part]]) is to be taken.

==Series definitions==
[[File:Taylorsine.svg|thumb|right|The sine function (blue) is closely approximated by its [[Taylor's theorem|Taylor polynomial]] of degree 7 (pink) for a full cycle centered on the origin.]]
[[File:Taylor cos.gif|thumb|Animation for the approximation of cosine via Taylor polynomials.]]

Trigonometric functions are [[analytic functions]]. Using only geometry and properties of [[limit of a function|limits]], it can be shown that the [[derivative]] of sine is cosine and the derivative of cosine is the negative of sine. One can then use the theory of [[Taylor series]] to show that the following identities hold for all [[real number]]s {{mvar|x}}.&lt;ref&gt;See Ahlfors, pages 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, and generally in [[calculus]], all angles are measured in [[radian]]s.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sin x &amp; = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \\
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cos x &amp; = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots \\
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]] appearing in these identities are [[convergent series|convergent]] in the whole [[complex plane]] and are often taken as the definitions of the sine and cosine functions of a complex variable. Another standard (and equivalent) definition of the sine and the cosine as functions of a complex variable is through their [[#Definitions via differential equations|differential equation]], below.

Other series can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz; Weisstein.&lt;/ref&gt; For the following trigonometric functions:
: {{mvar|U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the {{mvar|n}}th [[up/down number]],
: {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the {{mvar|n}}th [[Bernoulli number]], and
: {{mvar|E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} (below) is the {{mvar|n}}th [[Euler number]].
&lt;!-- ''It would be nice if someone adds how the infinite series expressions are deduced.'' --&gt;
&lt;!-- Yeah but those numbers are often _defined_ by the power series. --&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tan x &amp; {} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{U_{2n+1} x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} \\
&amp; {} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1} 2^{2n} (2^{2n}-1) B_{2n} x^{2n-1}}{(2n)!} \\
&amp; {} = x + \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{2}{15}x^5 + \frac{17}{315}x^7 + \cdots, \qquad \text{for } |x| &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\csc x &amp; {} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1} 2 (2^{2n-1}-1) B_{2n} x^{2n-1}}{(2n)!} \\
&amp; {} = x^{-1} + \frac{1}{6}x + \frac{7}{360}x^3 + \frac{31}{15120}x^5 + \cdots, \qquad \text{for } 0 &lt; |x| &lt; \pi.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sec x &amp; {} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{U_{2n} x^{2n}}{(2n)!}
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n E_{2n} x^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\
&amp; {} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{5}{24}x^4 + \frac{61}{720}x^6 + \cdots, \qquad \text{for } |x| &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cot x &amp; {} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n 2^{2n} B_{2n} x^{2n-1}}{(2n)!} \\
&amp; {} = x^{-1} - \frac{1}{3}x - \frac{1}{45}x^3 - \frac{2}{945}x^5 - \cdots, \qquad \text{for } 0 &lt; |x| &lt; \pi.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

When the series for the tangent and secant functions are expressed in a form in which the denominators are the corresponding factorials, the numerators, called the "tangent numbers" and "secant numbers" respectively, have a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] interpretation: they enumerate [[alternating permutation]]s of finite sets, of odd cardinality for the tangent series and even cardinality for the secant series.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol I., page 149&lt;/ref&gt; The series itself can be found by a [[power series solution of differential equations|power series solution]] of the aforementioned differential equation.

From a theorem in [[complex analysis]], there is a unique [[analytic continuation]] of this real function to the domain of complex numbers. They have the same Taylor series, and so the trigonometric functions are defined on the complex numbers using the Taylor series above.

There is a series representation as [[partial fraction expansion]] where just translated [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal function]]s are summed up, such that the [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s of the cotangent function and the reciprocal functions match:&lt;ref name="Aigner_2000"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\pi \cdot \cot(\pi x) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=-N}^N \frac{1}{x+n}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This identity can be proven with the [[Gustav Herglotz|Herglotz]] trick.&lt;ref name="Remmert_1991"/&gt;
Combining the {{math|(–''n'')}}th with the {{math|''n''}}th term lead to [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]] series:
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi \cdot \cot(\pi x) = \frac{1}{x} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2x}{x^2-n^2}\ , \quad \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi x)} = \frac{1}{x} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n\,2x}{x^2-n^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relationship to exponential function and complex numbers===
[[Image:Sine and Cosine fundamental relationship to Circle (and Helix).gif|thumb|420px|[[Euler's formula]] illustrated with the three dimensional [[helix]], starting with the 2D [[Projection (linear algebra)|orthogonal]] components of the [[unit circle]], [[sine wave|sine]] and cosine (using {{math|''&amp;theta;'' {{=}} ''t''}}).]]
[[File:Sinus und Kosinus am Einheitskreis 3.svg|thumb|&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; are the real and imaginary part of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm e^{\mathrm i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.]]
It can be shown from the series definitions&lt;ref&gt;For a demonstration, see [[Euler's formula#Using power series]]&lt;/ref&gt; that the sine and cosine functions are respectively the [[complex number|imaginary and real parts]] of the [[exponential function#On the complex plane|exponential function]] of a purely imaginary argument. That is, if {{mvar|x}} is real, we have 
: &lt;math&gt;\cos x = \operatorname{Re}(e^{i x}) \, , \qquad \sin x = \operatorname{Im}(e^{i x}) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; e^{ix}  = \cos x + i\sin x\, . &lt;/math&gt;

The latter identity, although primarily established for real {{mvar|x}}, remains valid for every complex {{mvar|x}}, and is called [[Euler's formula]].

Euler's formula can be used to derive most [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]] from the properties of the exponential function, by writing sine and cosine as:

: &lt;math&gt;\sin x = \frac{e^{i x} - e^{-i x}}{2i}\, , \qquad
\cos x = \frac{e^{i x} + e^{-i x}}{2}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

It is also sometimes useful to express the complex sine and cosine functions in terms of the real and imaginary parts of their arguments.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \sin(x + iy) &amp;= \sin x \cosh y + i \cos x \sinh y\, , \\
\cos(x + iy) &amp;= \cos x \cosh y - i \sin x \sinh y\, . \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This exhibits a deep relationship between the complex sine and cosine functions and their real (sin, cos) and hyperbolic real ([[hyperbolic sine|sinh]], [[hyperbolic cosine|cosh]]) counterparts.

==Definitions via differential equations==
Both the sine and cosine functions satisfy the [[linear differential equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt;y'' = -y\, .&lt;/math&gt;

That is to say, each is the additive inverse of its own second derivative. Within the 2-dimensional [[function space]] {{mvar|V}} consisting of all solutions of this equation,
* the sine function is the unique solution satisfying the initial condition &lt;math&gt;\left( y'(0), y(0) \right) = (1, 0)\,&lt;/math&gt; and
* the cosine function is the unique solution satisfying the initial condition &lt;math&gt;\left( y'(0), y(0) \right) = (0, 1)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the sine and cosine functions are linearly independent, together they form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of {{mvar|V}}. This method of defining the sine and cosine functions is essentially equivalent to using Euler's formula. (See [[linear differential equation]].) It turns out that this differential equation can be used not only to define the sine and cosine functions but also to prove the [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]] for the sine and cosine functions.

Further, the observation that sine and cosine satisfies {{math|''y''″ {{=}} −''y''}} means that they are [[eigenfunction]]s of the second-derivative operator.

The tangent function is the unique solution of the nonlinear differential equation
: &lt;math&gt;y' = 1 + y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying the initial condition {{math|''y''(0) {{=}} 0}}. There is a very interesting visual proof that the tangent function satisfies this differential equation.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

===The significance of radians===
Radians specify an angle by measuring the length around the path of the unit circle and constitute a special argument to the sine and cosine functions. In particular, only sines and cosines that map radians to ratios satisfy the differential equations that classically describe them. If an argument to sine or cosine in radians is scaled by frequency,

: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin(kx), \,&lt;/math&gt;

then the derivatives will scale by amplitude.

: &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = k\cos(kx). \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{mvar|k}} is a constant that represents a mapping between units. If {{mvar|x}} is in degrees, then

: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{\pi}{180^\circ}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the second derivative of a sine in degrees does not satisfy the differential equation

: &lt;math&gt;y'' = -y\,&lt;/math&gt;

but rather

: &lt;math&gt;y'' = -k^2 y.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The cosine's second derivative behaves similarly.

This means that these sines and cosines are different functions, and that the fourth derivative of sine will be sine again only if the argument is in radians.

==Identities==
{{Main article|List of trigonometric identities|Proofs of trigonometric identities}}
Many identities interrelate the trigonometric functions. Among the most frequently used is the '''Pythagorean identity''', which states that for any angle, the square of the sine plus the square of the cosine is 1. This is easy to see by studying a right triangle of hypotenuse 1 and applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. In symbolic form, the Pythagorean identity is written

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x  + \cos^2 x  = 1  &lt;/math&gt;

which is standard shorthand notation for

:&lt;math&gt;(\sin x)^2  + (\cos x)^2  = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;

Other key relationships are the '''sum and difference formulas''', which give the sine and cosine of the sum and difference of two angles in terms of sines and cosines of the angles themselves. These can be derived geometrically, using arguments that date to [[Ptolemy]]. One can also produce them algebraically using [[Euler's formula]].
; Sum
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin\left(x+y\right)&amp;=\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y,\\
\cos\left(x+y\right)&amp;=\cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
; Difference
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin\left(x-y\right)&amp;=\sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y, \\
\cos\left(x-y\right)&amp;=\cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y. 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These in turn lead to the following three-angle formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin\left(x+y+z\right)&amp;=\sin x \cos y \cos z + \sin y \cos z \cos x + \sin z \cos y \cos x - \sin x \sin y \sin z, \\
\cos\left(x+y+z\right)&amp;=\cos x \cos y \cos z - \cos x \sin y \sin z - \cos y \sin x \sin z - \cos z \sin x \sin y, 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When the two angles are equal, the sum formulas reduce to simpler equations known as the '''double-angle formulae'''.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin\left(2x\right) &amp;= 2 \sin x \cos x, \\
\cos\left(2x\right) &amp;= \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1 = 1 - 2 \sin^2 x. 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When three angles are equal, the three-angle formulae simplify to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin(3x) &amp;= 3 \sin x - 4 \sin^3 x . \\
\cos(3x) &amp;= 4 \cos^3 x - 3 \cos x . 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These identities can also be used to derive the [[product-to-sum identities]] that were used in antiquity to transform the product of two numbers into a sum of numbers and greatly speed operations, much like the [[logarithm|logarithm function]].

===Calculus===
For [[integral]]s and [[derivative]]s of trigonometric functions, see the relevant sections of [[Differentiation of trigonometric functions]], [[Lists of integrals]] and [[List of integrals of trigonometric functions]]. Below is the list of the derivatives and integrals of the six basic trigonometric functions. The number&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|C}} is a [[constant of integration]].

\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Definitions using functional equations===
In [[mathematical analysis]], one can define the trigonometric functions using [[functional equation]]s based on properties like the difference formula. Taking as given these formulas, one can prove that only two [[continuous function]]s satisfy those conditions. Formally, there exists exactly one pair of continuous functions—sin and cos—such that for all real numbers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, the following equation holds:&lt;ref name="Kannappan_2009"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\cos(x- y) = \cos x\cos y + \sin x\sin y\,&lt;/math&gt;

with the added condition that

: &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x\cos x &lt; \sin x &lt; x\quad\text{ for }\quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This may also be used for extending sine and cosine to the complex numbers. Other functional equations are also possible for defining trigonometric functions.

==Computation==
The computation of trigonometric functions is a complicated subject, which can today be avoided by most people because of the widespread availability of [[computer]]s and [[scientific calculator]]s that provide built-in trigonometric functions for any angle. This section, however, describes details of their computation in three important contexts: the historical use of trigonometric tables, the modern techniques used by computers, and a few "important" angles where simple exact values are easily found.

The first step in computing any trigonometric function is range reduction—reducing the given angle to a "reduced angle" inside a small range of angles, say 0 to {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, using the periodicity and symmetries of the trigonometric functions.

{{Main article|Generating trigonometric tables}}

Prior to computers, people typically evaluated trigonometric functions by [[interpolation|interpolating]] from a detailed table of their values, calculated to many [[significant figures]]. Such tables have been available for as long as trigonometric functions have been described (see [[#History|History]] below), and were typically generated by repeated application of the half-angle and angle-addition [[List of trigonometric identities|identities]] starting from a known value (such as sin({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1).

Modern computers use a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Kantabutra.&lt;/ref&gt; One common method, especially on higher-end processors with [[floating point]] units, is to combine a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function|rational]] [[approximation theory|approximation]] (such as [[Approximation theory|Chebyshev approximation]], best uniform approximation, and [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]], and typically for higher or variable precisions, [[Taylor series|Taylor]] and [[Laurent series]]) with range reduction and a [[lookup table|table lookup]]—they first look up the closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction.&lt;ref&gt;However, doing that while maintaining precision is nontrivial, and methods like [[Gal's accurate tables]], Cody and Waite reduction, and Payne and Hanek reduction algorithms can be used.&lt;/ref&gt; Devices that lack [[Arithmetic logic unit|hardware multipliers]] often use an algorithm called [[CORDIC]] (as well as related techniques), which uses only addition, subtraction, [[bitwise operation|bitshift]], and [[lookup table|table lookup]]. These methods are commonly implemented in [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] [[floating-point unit]]s for performance reasons.

For very high precision calculations, when series expansion convergence becomes too slow, trigonometric functions can be approximated by the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], which itself approximates the trigonometric function by the ([[complex number|complex]]) [[elliptic integral]].&lt;ref name="Brent_1976"/&gt;

{{Main article|Exact trigonometric constants}}

Finally, for some simple angles, the values can be easily computed by hand using the [[Pythagorean theorem]], as in the following examples. For example, the sine, cosine and tangent of any integer multiple of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|60}} [[radian]]s (3°) can be found [[Exact trigonometric constants|exactly by hand]].

Consider a right triangle where the two other angles are equal, and therefore are both {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} radians (45°). Then the length of side {{mvar|b}} and the length of side {{mvar|a}} are equal; we can choose {{math|1=''a'' = ''b'' = 1}}. The values of sine, cosine and tangent of an angle of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} radians (45°) can then be found using the Pythagorean theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt { a^2+b^2 } = \sqrt2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \sin 45^\circ = \cos \frac{\pi}{4}= \cos 45^\circ = {1 \over \sqrt2} = {\sqrt2 \over 2},\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\pi}{4} = \tan 45^\circ = { {\sin \frac{\pi}{4} } \over {\cos \frac{\pi}{4} } }= {1 \over \sqrt2} \cdot {\sqrt2 \over 1} = {\sqrt2 \over \sqrt2} = 1. \,&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Equiv triangle trig functions.svg|thumb|Computing trigonometric functions from an equilateral triangle]]
To determine the trigonometric functions for angles of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} radians (60°) and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}} radians (30°), we start with an equilateral triangle of side length 1. All its angles are {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} radians (60°). By dividing it into two, we obtain a right triangle with {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}} radians (30°) and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} radians (60°) angles. For this triangle, the shortest side is {{sfrac|1|2}}, the next largest side is {{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}|2}} and the hypotenuse is 1. This yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \frac{\pi}{6} = \sin 30^\circ = \cos \frac{\pi}{3} = \cos 60^\circ = {1 \over 2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \frac{\pi}{6} = \cos 30^\circ = \sin \frac{\pi}{3} = \sin 60^\circ = {\sqrt3 \over 2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\pi}{6} = \tan 30^\circ = \cot \frac{\pi}{3} = \cot 60^\circ = {1 \over \sqrt3} = {\sqrt3 \over 3}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Special values in trigonometric functions===

The symbol {{math|&amp;infin;}} here represents the [[point at infinity]] on the [[projectively extended real line]], the limit on the [[extended real line]] is {{math|+&amp;infin;}} on one side and {{math|-&amp;infin;}} on the other.

==Inverse functions==
{{Main article|Inverse trigonometric functions}}
The trigonometric functions are periodic, and hence not [[injective function|injective]], so strictly they do not have an [[inverse function]]. Therefore, to define an inverse function we must restrict their domains so that the trigonometric function is [[bijection|bijective]]. In the following, the functions on the left are ''defined'' by the equation on the right; these are not proved identities. The principal inverses are usually defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rrc}
 \text{Function} &amp; \text{Definition} &amp; \text{Value Field}
 \\
 \hline
 \arcsin x = y &amp;
 \sin y = x &amp;
 -\frac{\pi}{2} \le y \le \frac{\pi}{2} \\
 \arccos x = y &amp;
 \cos y = x &amp;
 0 \le y \le \pi \\
 \arctan x = y &amp;
 \tan y = x &amp;
 -\frac{\pi}{2} &lt; y &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} \\
 \arccot x = y &amp;
 \cot y = x &amp;
 0 &lt; y &lt; \pi \\
 \arcsec x = y &amp;
 \sec y = x &amp;
 0 \le y \le \pi,\, y \ne \frac{\pi}{2} \\
 \arccsc x = y &amp;
 \csc y = x &amp;
 -\frac{\pi}{2} \le y \le \frac{\pi}{2},\, y \ne 0
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The notations sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; are often used for arcsin and arccos, etc. When this notation is used, the inverse functions could be confused with the multiplicative inverses of the functions. The notation using the "arc-" prefix avoids such confusion, though "arcsec" for arcsecant can be confused with "[[arcsecond]]".

Just like the sine and cosine, the inverse trigonometric functions can also be defined in terms of infinite series. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;
\arcsin z = z + \left( \frac {1} {2} \right) \frac {z^3} {3} + \left( \frac {1 \cdot 3} {2 \cdot 4} \right) \frac {z^5} {5} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5} {2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 } \right) \frac{z^7} {7} + \cdots\,.&lt;/math&gt;
These functions may also be defined by proving that they are antiderivatives of other functions. The arcsine, for example, can be written as the following integral:

:&lt;math&gt;
\arcsin z =
\int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\,dx, \quad |z| &lt; 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Analogous formulas for the other functions can be found at [[inverse trigonometric functions]]. Using the [[complex logarithm]], one can generalize all these functions to complex arguments:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin z &amp;= -i \log \left( i z + \sqrt{1 - z^2} \right), \, \\
\arccos z &amp;= -i \log \left( z + \sqrt{z^2 - 1}\right), \, \\
\arctan z &amp;= \frac12i \log\left(\frac{1-iz}{1+iz}\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- (note: these should probably be presented as definite integrals, removing the ambiguity of the constant) --&gt;

===Connection to the inner product===
In an [[inner product space]], the angle between two non-zero vectors is defined to be
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{angle}(x,y) = \arccos \frac{\langle x, y \rangle}{\|x\| \cdot \|y\|}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties and applications==
{{Main article|Uses of trigonometry}}

The trigonometric functions, as the name suggests, are of crucial importance in [[trigonometry]], mainly because of the following two results.

===Law of sines===
The '''[[law of sines]]''' states that for an arbitrary triangle with sides {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} and angles opposite those sides {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|C}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c} = \frac{2\Delta}{abc},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Δ}} is the area of the triangle,
or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} = 2R,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|R}} is the triangle's [[circumscribed circle|circumradius]].

[[File:Lissajous curve 5by4.svg|thumb|right|A [[Lissajous curve]], a figure formed with a trigonometry-based function.]]

It can be proven by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the above definition of sine. The law of sines is useful for computing the lengths of the unknown sides in a triangle if two angles and one side are known. This is a common situation occurring in ''[[triangulation]]'', a technique to determine unknown distances by measuring two angles and an accessible enclosed distance.

===Law of cosines===
The '''[[law of cosines]]''' (also known as the cosine formula or cosine rule) is an extension of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C, \, &lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;\cos C=\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula the angle at {{mvar|C}} is opposite to the side&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|c}}. This theorem can be proven by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

The law of cosines can be used to determine a side of a triangle if two sides and the angle between them are known.  It can also be used to find the cosines of an angle (and consequently the angles themselves) if the lengths of all the sides are known.

===Law of tangents===
{{main article|Law of tangents}}
The following all form the law of tangents&lt;ref name="Allen_1976"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\tan \dfrac{A-B}{2 }}{\tan \dfrac{A+B}{2 } } = \frac{a-b}{a+b}\,; \qquad
\frac{\tan \dfrac{A-C}{2 }}{\tan \dfrac{A+C}{2 } } = \frac{a-c}{a+c}\,; \qquad
\frac{\tan \dfrac{B-C}{2 }}{\tan \dfrac{B+C}{2 } } = \frac{b-c}{b+c}&lt;/math&gt;

The explanation of the formulae in words would be cumbersome, but the patterns of sums and differences, for the lengths and corresponding opposite angles, are apparent in the theorem.

===Law of cotangents===
{{main article|Law of cotangents}}
If

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta = \sqrt{\frac{1}{s} (s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\ &lt;/math&gt; (the radius of the inscribed circle for the triangle)

and

: &lt;math&gt; s = \frac{a+b+c}{2 }\ &lt;/math&gt; (the semi-perimeter for the triangle),

then the following all form the law of cotangents&lt;ref name="Allen_1976"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\cot{ \frac{A}{2 }} = \frac{s-a}{\zeta }\,; \qquad
\cot{ \frac{B}{2 }} = \frac{s-b}{\zeta }\,; \qquad
\cot{ \frac{C}{2 }} = \frac{s-c}{\zeta }&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\cot \dfrac{A}{2}}{s-a} = \frac{\cot \dfrac{B}{2}}{s-b} = \frac{\cot \dfrac{C}{2}}{s-c}. &lt;/math&gt;

In words the theorem is: the cotangent of a half-angle equals the ratio of the semi-perimeter minus the opposite side to the said angle, to the inradius for the triangle.

===Periodic functions===
[[File:Synthesis square.gif|thumb|340px|right|An animation of the [[additive synthesis]] of a [[square wave]] with an increasing number of harmonics]]
[[File:Sawtooth Fourier Animation.gif|thumb|280px|Sinusoidal basis functions (bottom) can form a sawtooth wave (top) when added. All the basis functions have nodes at the nodes of the sawtooth, and all but the fundamental ({{math|1=''k'' = 1}}) have additional nodes. The oscillation seen about the sawtooth when {{mvar|k}} is large is called the [[Gibbs phenomenon]]]]

The trigonometric functions are also important in physics. The sine and the cosine functions, for example, are used to describe [[simple harmonic motion]], which models many natural phenomena, such as the movement of a mass attached to a spring and, for small angles, the pendular motion of a mass hanging by a string. The sine and cosine functions are one-dimensional projections of [[uniform circular motion]].

Trigonometric functions also prove to be useful in the study of general [[periodic function]]s. The characteristic wave patterns of periodic functions are useful for modeling recurring phenomena such as sound or light [[wave]]s.&lt;ref name="Farlow_1993"/&gt;

Under rather general conditions, a periodic function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} can be expressed as a sum of sine waves or cosine waves in a [[Fourier series]].&lt;ref name="Folland_1992"/&gt; Denoting the sine or cosine [[basis functions]] by {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the expansion of the periodic function {{math|''f''(''t'')}} takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sum _{k=1}^\infty c_k \varphi_k(t). &lt;/math&gt;

For example, the [[square wave]] can be written as the [[Fourier series]]

:&lt;math&gt; f_\text{square}(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\sin \big( (2k-1)t \big) \over 2k-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the animation of a square wave at top right it can be seen that just a few terms already produce a fairly good approximation. The superposition of several terms in the expansion of a [[sawtooth wave]] are shown underneath.

==History==
{{Main article|History of trigonometric functions}}
While the early study of trigonometry can be traced to antiquity, the trigonometric functions as they are in use today were developed in the medieval period. The [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] function was discovered by [[Hipparchus]] of [[İznik|Nicaea]] (180–125&amp;nbsp;BCE) and [[Ptolemy]] of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] (90–165&amp;nbsp;CE).

The functions sine and cosine can be traced to the [[Jyā, koti-jyā and utkrama-jyā|''jyā'' and ''koti-jyā'']] functions used in [[Gupta period]] [[Indian astronomy]] (''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin.&lt;ref name="Boyer_1991"/&gt;

All six trigonometric functions in current use were known in [[Islamic mathematics]] by the 9th century, as was the law of sines, used in [[solving triangles]].&lt;ref name="Gingerich_1986"/&gt; [[al-Khwārizmī]] produced tables of sines, cosines and tangents.
They were studied by authors including [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Bhāskara II]], [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] (14th century), [[Ulugh Beg]] (14th century), [[Regiomontanus]] (1464), [[Georg Joachim Rheticus|Rheticus]], and Rheticus' student [[Valentinus Otho]].

[[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] (c. 1400) made early strides in the [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] of trigonometric functions in terms of [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]].&lt;ref name="mact-biog"/&gt;

The terms ''tangent'' and ''secant'' were first introduced by the Danish mathematician [[Thomas Fincke]] in his book ''Geometria rotundi'' (1583).&lt;ref name="Fincke"/&gt;

The first published use of the abbreviations ''sin'', ''cos'', and ''tan'' is probably by the [[16th century]] French mathematician [[Albert Girard]].{{fact|date=April 2018}}

In a paper published in 1682, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] proved that {{math|sin ''x''}} is not an [[algebraic function]] of {{mvar|x}}.&lt;ref name="Bourbaki_1994"/&gt;

[[Leonhard Euler]]'s ''Introductio in analysin infinitorum'' (1748) was mostly responsible for establishing the analytic treatment of trigonometric functions in Europe, also defining them as infinite series and presenting "[[Euler's formula]]", as well as near-modern abbreviations (''sin.'', ''cos.'', ''tang.'', ''cot.'', ''sec.'', and ''cosec.'').&lt;ref name="Boyer_1991"/&gt;

A few functions were common historically, but are now seldom used, such as the [[chord (geometry)|chord]] ({{math|1=crd(''θ'') = 2 sin({{sfrac|''θ''|2}})}}), the [[versine]] ({{math|1=versin(''θ'') = 1 − cos(''θ'') = 2 sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;({{sfrac|''θ''|2}})}}) (which appeared in the earliest tables&lt;ref name="Boyer_1991"/&gt;), the [[coversine]] ({{math|1=coversin(''θ'') = 1 − sin(''θ'') = versin({{sfrac|π|2}}-''θ'')}}), the [[haversine]] ({{math|1=haversin(''θ'') = {{sfrac|1|2}}versin(''θ'') = sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;({{sfrac|''θ''|2}})}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nielsen|1966|pp=xxiii–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[exsecant]] ({{math|1=exsec(''θ'') = sec(''θ'') − 1}}), and the [[excosecant]] ({{math|1=excsc(''θ'') = exsec({{sfrac|π|2}} − ''θ'') = csc(''θ'') − 1}}). See [[List of trigonometric identities]] for more relations between these functions.

==Etymology==
The word ''sine'' derives&lt;ref&gt;The anglicized form is first recorded in 1593 in [[Thomas Fale]]'s ''Horologiographia, the Art of Dialling''.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:sinus|sinus]]'', meaning "bend; bay", and more specifically "the hanging fold of the upper part of a [[toga]]", "the bosom of a garment", which was chosen as the translation of what was interpreted as the Arabic word ''jaib'', meaning "pocket" or "fold" in the twelfth-century translations of works by [[Al-Battani]] and [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwārizmī]] into [[Medieval Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Various sources credit the first use of ''sinus'' to either 
* [[Plato Tiburtinus]]'s 1116 translation of the ''Astronomy'' of [[Al-Battani]]
* [[Gerard of Cremona]]'s translation of the ''Algebra'' of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwārizmī]]
* [[Robert of Chester]]'s 1145 translation of the tables of al-Khwārizmī
See Merlet, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-2204-2_16#page-1 ''A Note on the History of the Trigonometric Functions''] in Ceccarelli (ed.), ''International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms'', Springer, 2004&lt;br&gt;See Maor (1998), chapter 3, for an earlier etymology crediting Gerard.&lt;br&gt;See {{cite book |last=Katx |first=Victor |date=July 2008 |title=A history of mathematics |edition=3rd |location=Boston |publisher=[[Pearson (publisher)|Pearson]] |page=210 (sidebar) |isbn= 978-0321387004 |language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The choice was based on a misreading of the Arabic written form ''j-y-b'' ({{lang|ar|[[:wikt:جيب|جيب]]}}), which itself originated as a [[transliteration]] from Sanskrit ''{{IAST|jīvā}}'', which along with its synonym ''{{IAST|jyā}}''  (the standard Sanskrit term for the sine) translates to "bowstring", being in turn adopted from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[Chord (geometry)|χορδή]]}} "string".&lt;ref name="Plofker_2009"/&gt;

The word ''tangent'' comes from Latin ''tangens'' meaning "touching", since the line ''touches'' the circle of unit radius, whereas ''secant'' stems from Latin ''secans''—"cutting"—since the line ''cuts'' the circle.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix "[[co (function prefix)|co-]]" (in "cosine", "cotangent", "cosecant") is found in [[Edmund Gunter]]'s ''Canon triangulorum'' (1620), which defines the ''cosinus'' as an abbreviation for the ''sinus complementi'' (sine of the [[complementary angle]]) and proceeds to define the ''cotangens'' similarly.&lt;ref name="Gunter_1620"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roegel_2010"/&gt;

In [[computational geometry]], the '''Yao graph''', named after [[Andrew Yao]], is a kind of [[geometric spanner]], a weighted [[undirected graph]] connecting a set of [[point (geometry)|geometric points]] with the property that, for every pair of points in the graph, their [[shortest path]] has a length that is within a constant factor of their [[Euclidean distance]].

The basic idea underlying the two-dimensional Yao graph is to surround each of the given points by equally spaced [[ray (geometry)|rays]], partitioning the plane into sectors with equal angles, and to connect each point to its [[Nearest neighbor graph|nearest neighbor]] in each of these sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overlay Networks for Wireless Systems|url=http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scheideler/courses/600.348_F04/lecture_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with a Yao graph is an integer parameter {{math|''k'' ≥ 6}} which is the number of rays and sectors described above; larger values of {{math|''k''}} produce closer approximations to the Euclidean distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simple Topologies|url=http://www.cs.kent.edu/~dfuhry/presentations/simple_topologies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stretch factor]] is at most &lt;math&gt;1/(\cos \theta - \sin \theta)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the sectors.&lt;ref name=YaoPaper /&gt; The same idea can be extended to point sets in more than two dimensions, but the number of sectors required grows exponentially with the dimension.

[[Andrew Yao]] used these graphs to construct high-dimensional [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]]s.&lt;ref name="YaoPaper"&gt;{{citation|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7019">Zero-forcing (or null-steering) precoding is a method of spatial signal processing by which the multiple antenna transmitter can null multiuser interference signals in [[wireless|wireless communications]]. Regularized '''zero-forcing precoding''' is enhanced processing to consider the impact on a background [[noise]] and unknown user [[Interference (communication)|interference]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=B. C. B. Peel |author2=B. M. Hochwald |author3=A. L. Swindlehurst  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A vector-perturbation technique for near-capacity multiantenna multiuser communication - Part I: channel inversion and regularization|journal=IEEE Trans. Commun.|pages=195–202|volume=53|date=Jan 2005|doi=10.1109/TCOMM.2004.840638}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the background noise and the unknown user interference can be emphasized in the result of (known) interference signal nulling.

In particular, '''null-steering''' is a method of [[beamforming]] for [[narrowband]] [[signal processing|signals]] where we want to have a simple way of compensating delays of receiving signals from a specific source at different elements of the antenna array. In general to make better use of the antenna arrays, we sum and average the signals coming to different elements, but this is only possible when delays are equal. Otherwise, we first need to compensate the delays and then sum them up. To reach this goal, we may only add the weighted version of the signals with appropriate weight values. We do this in such a way that the frequency domain output of this weighted sum produces a zero result. This method is called null steering. The generated weights are of course related to each other and this relation is a function of delay and central working frequency of the source.

==Performance==
If the transmitter knows the downlink [[channel state information]] (CSI) perfectly, ZF-precoding can achieve almost the system capacity when the number of users is large. On the other hand, with limited [[channel state information]] at the transmitter (CSIT) the performance of ZF-precoding decreases depending on the accuracy of CSIT. ZF-precoding requires the significant feedback overhead with respect to signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) so as to achieve the full multiplexing gain.&lt;ref name="Jindal_ZF"&gt;{{cite journal|author=N. Jindal|title=MIMO Broadcast Channels with Finite Rate Feedback|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|pages=5045–5059|volume=52|issue=11|date=Nov 2006|doi=10.1109/TIT.2006.883550|arxiv=cs/0603065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaccurate CSIT results in the significant throughput loss because of residual multiuser interferences. Multiuser interferences remain since they can not be nulled with beams generated by imperfect CSIT.

==Mathematical description==
In a multiple antenna downlink system which comprises an &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; transmit antenna access point (AP) and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; single receive antenna users, the received signal of user &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is described as

:&lt;math&gt;y_k = \mathbf{h}_k^T\mathbf{x}+n_k, \quad k=1,2, \ldots, K&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^K s_i P_i \mathbf{w}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_t \times 1&lt;/math&gt; vector of transmitted symbols, &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; is the noise signal, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_t \times 1&lt;/math&gt; channel vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_t \times 1&lt;/math&gt; linear precoding vector. From the fact that each beam generated by ZF-precoding is orthogonal to all the other user channel vectors, one can rewrite the received signal as
:&lt;math&gt;y_k = \mathbf{h}_k^T \sum_{i=1}^K s_i P_i \mathbf{w}_i+n_k = \mathbf{h}_k^T s_k P_k \mathbf{w}_k  +n_k, \quad k=1,2, \ldots, K&lt;/math&gt;

For comparison purpose, we describe the received signal model for multiple antenna uplink systems. In the uplink system with a &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; receiver antenna AP and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; K single transmit antenna user, the received signal at the AP is described as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} s_i \mathbf{h}_i + \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;		
where &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; is the transmitted signal of user &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_r \times 1&lt;/math&gt; noise vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_r \times 1&lt;/math&gt; channel vector.

=== Quantify the feedback amount ===

Quantify the amount of the feedback resource required to maintain at least a given throughput performance gap between zero-forcing with perfect feedback and with limited feedback, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta R = R_{ZF} - R_{FB} \leq \log_2 g&lt;/math&gt; .

Jindal showed that the required feedback bits of a [[Spatial Correlation|spatially uncorrelated]] channel should be scaled according to SNR of the downlink channel, which is given by:&lt;ref name="Jindal_ZF"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B = (M-1) \log_2 \rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \log_2 (g-1) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the number of transmit antennas and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{b,m}&lt;/math&gt; is the SNR of the downlink channel.

To feed back ''B'' bits though the uplink channel, the throughput performance of the uplink channel should be larger than or equal to 'B'

:&lt;math&gt; b_{FB} \log_2(1+\rho_{FB}) \geq B &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b = \Omega_{FB} T_{FB}&lt;/math&gt; is the feedback resource consisted by multiplying the feedback frequency resource and the frequency temporal resource subsequently and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{FB}&lt;/math&gt; is SNR of the feedback channel. Then, the required feedback resource to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\Delta R \leq \log_2 g&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt; b_{FB} \geq \frac{B}{\log_2(1+\rho_{FB})}  =  \frac{(M-1) \log_2 \rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \log_2 (g-1)}{\log_2(1+\rho_{FB})} &lt;/math&gt;. 
Note that differently from the feedback bits case, the required feedback resource is a function of both downlink and uplink channel conditions. It is reasonable to include the uplink channel status in the calculation of the feedback resource since the uplink channel status determines the capacity, i.e., bits/second per unit frequency band (Hz), of the feedback link. Consider a case when SNR of the downlink and uplink are proportion such that &lt;math&gt;\rho_{b,m} / \rho_{FB}) = C_{up,dn}&lt;/math&gt; is constant and both SNRs are sufficiently high. Then, the feedback resource will be only proportional to the number of transmit antennas

:&lt;math&gt; b_{FB,min}^* =  \lim_{\rho_{FB} \to \infty } \frac{(M-1) \log_2 \rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \log_2 (g-1)}{\log_2(1+\rho_{FB})} = M - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows from the above equation that the feedback resource (&lt;math&gt;b_{FB}&lt;/math&gt;) is not necessary to scale according to SNR of the downlink channel, which is almost contradict to the case of the feedback bits. One, hence, sees that the whole systematic analysis can reverse the facts resulted from each reductioned situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30031">{{lowercase|μ operator}}
In [[recursion theory|computability theory]], the '''μ operator''', '''minimization operator''', or '''unbounded search operator''' searches for the least [[natural number]] with a given property. Adding the μ-operator to the five [[primitive recursive]] operators makes it possible to define all [[computable function]]s.

== Definition ==
Suppose that R( y, x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; ) is a fixed ''k+1''-ary relation on the [[natural numbers]]. The mu operator "μy", in either the unbounded or bounded form, is a "number theoretic function" defined from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. However, "μy" contains a ''[[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]'' over the natural numbers that delivers ''true'' when the predicate is satisfied and ''false'' when it is not.

The ''bounded'' mu operator appears earlier in Kleene (1952) ''Chapter IX Primitive Recursive Functions, §45 Predicates, prime factor representation'', as:
:"&lt;math&gt;\mu y_{y&lt;z} R(y). \ \ \mbox{The least} \ y&lt;z \ \mbox{such that} \ R(y), \ \mbox{if} \ (\exists y)_{y&lt;z} R(y); \ \mbox{otherwise}, \ z.&lt;/math&gt;" (p. 225)

[[Stephen Kleene]] notes that any of the six inequality restrictions on the range of the variable y is permitted, i.e. "y &lt; z", "y ≤ z", "w &lt; y &lt; z", "w &lt; y ≤ z", "w ≤ y &lt; z", "w ≤ y ≤ z". "When the indicated range contains no y such that R(y) [is "true"], the value of the "μy" expression is the cardinal number of the range"(p.&amp;nbsp;226); this is why the default "z" appears in the definition above. As shown below, the bounded mu operator "μy&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt;" is defined in terms of two primitive recursive functions called the finite sum Σ and finite product Π, a predicate function that "does the test" and a [[representing function]] that converts { t, f } to { 0, 1 }.

In Chapter XI §57 General Recursive Functions, Kleene defines the ''unbounded'' μ-operator over the variable y in the following manner,
:"&lt;math&gt;(\exists y) \mu y R(y) = \{ \mbox{the least (natural number)}\ y \ \mbox{such that} \ R(y)\}&lt;/math&gt;" (p. 279, where "&lt;math&gt;(\exists y)&lt;/math&gt;" means "There exists a ''y'' such that..."

In this instance R itself, or its [[representing function]], delivers 0 when it is satisfied (i.e. delivers ''true''); the function then delivers the number y. No upper bound exists on y, hence no inequality expressions appear in its definition.

For a given R(y) the unbounded mu operator μyR(y) (note no requirement for "(Ey)" ) is a [[partial function]]. Kleene makes it as a [[total function]] instead (cf. p.&amp;nbsp;317):
:εyR(x, y) =
::* the least y such that R(x,y) [is true], if (Ey)R(x,y)
::* 0, otherwise.
The total version of the unbounded mu operator is studied in ''higher-order'' [[reverse mathematics]] ({{harvtxt|Kohlenbach|2005}}) in the following form:

&lt;math&gt;(\exists \mu^2)(\forall f^1)\big( (\exists n^0)(f(n)=0 \rightarrow f(\mu(f))=0   \big). &lt;/math&gt;

This axiom gives rise to the Big Five system ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; when combined with the usual base theory of higher-order reverse mathematics.


== Properties ==

(i) In context of the [[primitive recursive functions]], where the search variable y of the μ-operator is bounded, e.g. y&lt;z in the formula below, if the predicate R is primitive recursive (Kleene Proof #E p.&amp;nbsp;228), then
: μy&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt; R( y, x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ) is a primitive recursive function.

(ii) In the context of the (total) [[total recursive function|recursive functions]]: Where the search variable y is ''unbounded'' but guaranteed to exist for ''all'' values x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of the total recursive predicate R's parameters,
:(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., (x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) (Ey) R( y, x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ... x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ) implies that μyR(y, x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ... x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[total recursive function]].
:: here (x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) means "for all x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;" and Ey means "there exists at least one value of y such that..." (cf Kleene (1952) p. 279.)

then the five primitive recursive operators plus the unbounded-but-total μ-operator give rise to what Kleene called the "general" recursive functions (i.e. total functions defined by the six recursion operators).

(iii) In the context of the [[partial recursive function]]s: Suppose that the relation ''R'' holds if and only if a partial recursive function converges to zero. And suppose that that partial recursive function converges (to something, not necessarily zero) whenever &lt;math&gt;\mu y R(y,x_1,\ldots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt; is defined and ''y'' is &lt;math&gt;\mu y R(y,x_1,\ldots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt; or smaller. Then the function &lt;math&gt;\mu y R(y,x_1,\ldots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt; is also a partial recursive function.

&lt;!-- If for every &lt;math&gt;(y_1,\ldots,y_k)&lt;/math&gt; there is some ''x'' such that  &lt;math&gt;R(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)&lt;/math&gt;, then the function &lt;math&gt;\mu x R(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)&lt;/math&gt; is total. If it is a total function and also a partial recursive function then it is a [[total recursive function]].--&gt;
The μ operator is used in the characterization of the computable functions as the  [[Mu-recursive function|μ recursive function]]s.

In [[constructive mathematics]], the unbounded search operator is related to [[Markov's principle]].

== Examples ==

=== Example #1: The bounded μ-operator is a primitive recursive function ===

:''In the following, to save space the bold-face x i.e. '''x''' will represent the string x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.''

The ''bounded'' μ-operator  can be expressed rather simply in terms of two primitive recursive functions (hereafter "prf") that also are used to define the CASE function—the product-of-terms Π and the sum-of-terms Σ (cf Kleene #B page 224). (As needed, any boundary for the variable such as s≤t or t&lt;z, or 5&lt;x&lt;17 etc. is appropriate). For example:
:*Π&lt;sub&gt;s≤t&lt;/sub&gt; f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ('''x''', s) = f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''', 0) * f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''', 1) * . . . * f&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''', t)
:*Σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; ( '''x''', t ) = g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;( '''x''', 0 ) + g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''', 1 ) + . . . + g&lt;sub&gt;z-1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''', z-1 )

Before we proceed we need to introduce a function ψ called "the [[representing function]]" of predicate R. Function ψ is defined from inputs ( t= "truth", f="falsity" ) to outputs ( 0, 1 ) (''Observe the order!''). In this case the input to ψ i.e. { t, f } is coming from the output of R:
:* ψ( R = t ) = 0
:* ψ( R = f ) = 1

Kleene demonstrates that μy&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt; R(y) is defined as follows; we see the product function Π is acting like a Boolean OR operator, and the sum Σ is acting somewhat like a Boolean AND but is producing { Σ≠0, Σ=0 }  rather than just { 1, 0 }:
:  μy &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt; R(y) = Σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt; Π&lt;sub&gt;s≤t&lt;/sub&gt; ψ( R( '''x''' ,t ,s )) =
:* [ ψ( '''x''', 0, 0 ) ] '''+'''
:* [ ψ( '''x''', 1, 0 ) * ψ( '''x''', 1, 1 ) ] '''+'''
:* [ ψ( '''x''', 2, 0 ) * ψ( '''x''', 2, 1 ) * ψ( '''x''', 2, 2 ) ] '''+'''
:*  . . . . . . '''+'''
:* [ ψ( '''x''', z-1, 0 ) * ψ( '''x''', z-1, 1 ) * ψ( '''x''', z-1, 2 ) + . . . + ψ ( '''x''', z-1, z-1 ) ]

:''Σ is actually a primitive recursion with the base Σ('''x''', 0) = 0 and the induction step Σ('''x''', y+1 )  = Σ( '''x''', y ) + Π( '''x''', y ). The product Π is also a primitive recursion Π with base step Π( '''x''', 0 ) = ψ( '''x''', 0 ) and induction step Π( '''x''', y+1 ) = Π( '''x''', y )*ψ( '''x''', y+1 ).''

The equation is easier if observed with an example, as given by Kleene. He just made up the entries for the representing function ψ(R(y)). He designated the representing functions χ(y) rather than ψ( '''x''', y ):

=== Example #2: The unbounded μ-operator is not primitive-recursive ===
The unbounded μ operator—the function μy—is the one commonly defined in the texts. But the reader may wonder why—the modern texts do not state the reason—the unbounded μ-operator is searching for a function R('''x''', y) to yield ''zero'', rather than some other natural number.
:''In a footnote Minsky does allow his operator to terminate when the function inside produces a match to the parameter "k"; this example is also useful because it shows another author's format:''
::" For μ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;[ φ(t) = k ] "(p. 210)

The reason for ''zero'' is that the unbounded operator μy will be defined in terms of the function "product" Π with its index y allowed to "grow" as the μ operator searches. As noted in the example above, the product Π &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;y&lt;/sub&gt; of a string of numbers ψ('''x''', 0) *, . . ., * ψ('''x''', y) yields zero whenever one of its members ψ('''x''', i) is zero:
: Π&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = ψ('''x''', 0) * , . . ., * ψ('''x''', y) = 0

if any ψ('''x''', i)=0 where 0 ≤ i ≤ s. Thus the Π is acting like a Boolean AND.

The function μy produces as "output" a single natural number y = { 0, 1, 2, 3 ... }. However, inside the operator one of a couple "situations" can appear: (a) a "number-theoretic function" χ that produces a single natural number, or (b) a "predicate" R that produces either { t= true, f = false }. (And, in the context of ''partial'' recursive functions Kleene later admits a third outcome: "μ = undecided", pp.&amp;nbsp;332ff ).

Kleene splits his definition of the unbounded μ operator to handle the two situations (a) and (b). For situation (b), before the predicate R('''x''', y) can serve in an arithmetic capacity in the product Π, its output { t, f } must first be "operated on" by its ''representing function χ''  to yield { 0, 1 }. And for situation (a) if one definition is to be used then the ''number theoretic function χ'' must produce zero to "satisfy" the μ operator. With this matter settled, he demonstrates with single "Proof III" that either types (a) or (b) together with the five primitive recursive operators yield the (total) [[total recursive function|recursive function]]s ... with this proviso for a [[total function]]:
: ''That for all parameters '''x''', a demonstration that must be provided to show that a y exists that satisfies (a) μy ψ('''x''', y) or (b) μy R('''x''',y).''
Kleene also admits a third situation (c) that does not require the demonstration of "for all '''x''' a y exists such that ψ('''x''', y)." He uses this in his proof that more total recursive functions exist than can be enumerated;'' cf footnote [[#Total function demonstration|Total function demonstration]].

Kleene's proof is informal and uses an example similar to the first example. Fbut first he casts the μ-operator into a different form that uses the "product-of-terms" Π operating on function χ that yields a natural number n where n can be any natural number, and 0 in the instance when the u operator's test is "satisfied".

:The definition recast with the Π-function:
:μy &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt;χ(y) =
:*(i):  π('''x''', y) = Π&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;y&lt;/sub&gt; χ( '''x''', s)
::*(ii): φ('''x''') = τ( π('''x''', y), π( '''x''', y' ), y)
::*(iii): τ(z', 0, y) = y ;τ( u, v, w ) is undefined for u = 0 or v &gt; 0.

This is subtle. At first glance the equations seem to be using primitive recursion. But Kleene has not provided us with a base step and an induction step of the general form:
:* base step: φ( 0,'''x''' ) = φ( '''x''' )
:* induction step: φ( 0,'''x''' ) = ψ( y, φ(0,'''x'''), '''x''' )

What is going on? First, we have to remind ourselves that we have assigned a parameter (a natural number) to every variable x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Second, we do see a successor-operator at work iterating y (i.e. the y'). And third, we see that the function μy &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt;χ(y, '''x''') is just producing instances of χ(y,'''x''') i.e. χ(0,'''x'''), χ(1,'''x'''), ... until an instance yields 0. Fourth, when an instance χ(n,'''x''') yields 0 it causes the middle term of τ, i.e. v = π( '''x''', y' ) to yield 0. Finally, when the middle term v = 0, μy &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;z&lt;/sub&gt;χ(y) executes line (iii) and "exits". Kleene's presentation of equations (ii) and (iii) have been exchanged to make this point that line (iii) represents  an ''exit''—an exit taken only when the search successfully finds a y to satisfy χ(y) and the middle product-term π('''x''', y' ) is 0; the operator then terminates its search with τ(z', 0, y) = y.
: τ( π('''x''', y), π( '''x''', y' ), y), i.e.:
:* τ( π('''x''', 0), π( '''x''', 1 ), 0),
:* τ( π('''x''', 1), π( '''x''', 2 ), 1)
:* τ( π('''x''', 2), π( '''x''', 3 ), 2)
:* τ( π('''x''', 3), π( '''x''', 4 ), 3)
:* . . . . . until a match occurs at y=n and then:
:* τ(z', 0, y) = τ(z', 0, n) = n and the μ operator's search is done.

For the example Kleene "...consider[s] any fixed values of x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ... x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and write[s] simply "χ(y)" for "χ(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ... x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;),y)":

&lt;!-- === Example #3: The CASE operator ===

The CASE operator is interesting in its own right because it appears in computer programming in the form of CASE (the "switch" instruction of [[C (programming language)|C]]) or more often in the simplest form of an IF-THEN-ELSE (cf below and [[McCarthy Formalism]]). But it appears here because Kleene offers two definitions, the first of which looks very much like the μ-operator (defined in terms of the prf series-of-products Π and series-of-sums Σ), the second definition of which is explicitly in terms of the μ-operator.

:''A related discussion also appears in Minsky (1967) and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002).''

* #F:  Definition by cases: The function defined thus, where Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are mutually exclusive ''predicates'' (or "ψ('''x''') shall have the value given by the first clause which applies), is primitive recursive in φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;:
::  φ('''x''') = 
::* φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') if Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') is true,
::* .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
::* φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') if Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') is true
::* φ&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') otherwise

Observ that the Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are ''predicates'' -- they are defined (usually -- they could be logical operators) from the natural numbers to a single output from the truth-set { t, f }. As in the first two examples, before we can build the CASE operator from simpler primitive recursive functions we first need to apply a representing function ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to each Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;:
: ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;( Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = t = "true" ) = 0
: ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;( Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = f = "false" ) = 1

Then to be able to use the prf product Π and sum Σ functions in the demonstration below we will need to "flip the sense" of ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to produce "1" when Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is "true"; we use the prf ~sg(x) to do this -- it produces 1 if its input x is 0 and vice versa. Applying ~sg to ψ then returns "positive logic" "Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = t =&gt; 1" and "Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = f =&gt; 0":
:* ~sg( ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;( Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = t ) = 1
:* ~sg( ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;( Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = f ) = 0

Given these tools, Kleene then provides us with two equivalences for the CASE function
:(1) CASE φ('''x''') = ~sg(ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ) * φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + . . . + ~sg(ψ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ) * φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; +  '''[''' ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; * ... * ψ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; * φ&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt; ''']'''
:(2) CASE φ = μy&lt;sub&gt;y≤φ1+...+φm&lt;/sub&gt; ( Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; y=φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ) V ... V ( Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; y=φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ) V '''[''' ( ~Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;  ... &amp; ~Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ) &amp; y=φ&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt; ''']'''

On the right-hand side of both equations the terms in brackets '''[''' ''']''' are the conditions that must be met for the default or "otherwise" case. Definition (1) is just using * as a form of logical AND, and + as a kind of arithmetic OR. Definition (2) is actually using AND and OR( V ) but something ''subtle'' has appeared.

In the second definition using the μ-operator: y must range over a (potentially-) large number that is the ''sum'' of the various φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + . . . + φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. To see why this is the case, we design an example with only two cases and a default case. Substitute constants for the various φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, say φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 27, φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 19, φ&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 31:
:  φ(x) = 
:* φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(x) = 27 if "x = 1" is true,
:* φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(x) = 19 if "x = 2" is true,
:* φ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(x) = 31 otherwise

Unlike definition (1), the definition (2) contains "Boolean" logic-function terms that look like this: Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; y=φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, before the equivalence "y=φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;" can be tested, y must begin at 0 and then range successively "up" to φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, e.g. 27. If this fails because Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = false, then y must restart with
:* Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; y=φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

and proceed all the way up to φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 19 before it can test to see if "x = 2".

Failing this, y must restart again and proceed to 31 before it can satisfy the right-most term and declare that μyR(y) = 31. So the worst case number of ''steps'' that the μ-operator must proceed through will be (at the very worst) the ''sum'' of the steps for each case:
:φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(x) + φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(x) + φ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(x) = 27 + 19 + 31 --&gt;

&lt;!-- This is assuming the definition of CASE uses only the most primitive of the 5 primitive recursive operators, in particular (1) Constant 0, (2) Successor, etc.; i.e. excepting ~sg( ), no "more advanced" functions created from the operators are being used. The comparable case, if one were to do the equivalent with a [[Turing-equivalent]] [[counter machine]], would be to use the "successor" version with only the following instructions available to work on various registers r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; :
: { CLeaR (r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;), INCrement (r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;), and Jump_if_r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;_to_instruction I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; } --&gt;

=== Example #3: Definition of the unbounded μ operator in terms of an abstract machine ===

Both Minsky (1967) p.&amp;nbsp;21 and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) p.&amp;nbsp;60-61 provide definitions of the μ operator as an abstract machine; see footnote [[#Alternative abstract machine models of the unbounded .CE.BC operator from Minsky .281967.29 and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey .282002.29|Alternative definitions of μ]].

The following demonstration follows Minsky without "the peculiarity" mentioned in the footnote. The demonstration will use a "successor" [[counter machine]] model closely related to the [[Peano Axioms]] and the [[primitive recursive function]]s. The model consists of (i) a finite state machine with a TABLE of instructions and a so-called 'state register' that we will rename "the Instruction Register" (IR), (ii) a few "registers" each of which can contain only a single natural number, and (iii) an instruction set of four "commands" described in the following table:

:''In the following, the symbolism " [ r ] "  means "the contents of", and " →r " indicates an action with respect to register r.''

The algorithm for the minimization operator μy [φ( '''x''', y )] will, in essence, create a sequence of instances of the function φ( '''x''', y ) as the value of parameter y (a natural number) increases; the process will continue (see Note † below) until a match occurs between the output of function φ( '''x''', y ) and some pre-established number (usually 0). Thus the evaluation of φ('''x''', y) requires, at the outset, assignment of a natural number to each of its variables '''x''' and an assignment of a "match-number" (usually 0) to a register "w", and a number (usually 0) to register y.

:''Note †: The ''unbounded'' μ operator will continue this attempt-to-match process ad infinitum or until a match occurs. Thus the "y" register must be unbounded -- it must be able to "hold" a number of arbitrary size. Unlike a "real" computer model, abstract machine models allow this. In the case of a ''bounded'' μ operator, a lower-bounded μ operator would start with the contents of y set to a number other than zero. An upper-bounded μ operator would require an additional register "ub" to contain the number that represents the upper bound plus an additional comparison operation; an algorithm could provide for both lower- and upper bounds.''

In the following we are assuming that the Instruction Register (IR) encounters the μy "routine" at instruction number "n". Its first action will be to establish a number in a dedicated "w" register—an "example of" the number that function φ( '''x''', y ) must produce before the algorithm can terminate (classically this is the number zero, but see the footnote about the use of numbers other than zero). The algorithm's next action at instructiton "n+1" will be to clear the "y" register -- "y" will act as an "up-counter" that starts from 0. Then at instruction "n+2" the algorithm evaluates its function φ( '''x''', y ) -- we assume this takes j instructions to accomplish—and at the end of its evaluation φ( '''x''', y ) deposits its output in register "φ". At the n+j+3rd instruction the algorithm compares the number in the "w" register (e.g. 0) to the number in the "φ" register—if they are the same the algorithm has succeeded and it escapes through ''exit''; otherwise it increments the contents of the "y" register and ''loops'' back with this new y-value to test function φ( '''x''', y ) again.

=== Total function demonstration ===

What is ''mandatory'' if the function is to be a [[total function]] is a demonstration ''by some other method'' (e.g. [[mathematical induction|induction]]) that for each and every combination of values of its parameters x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; some natural number y will satisfy the μ-operator so that the algorithm that represents the calculation can terminate:
:"...we must always hesitate to assume that a system of equations really defines a general-recursive [i.e. total] function. We normally require auxiliary evidence for this, e.g. in the form of an inductive proof that, for each argument value, the computation terminates with a unique value." (Minsky (1967) p. 186)

:"In other words, we should not claim that a function is effectively calculable on the ground that it has been shown to be general [i.e. total] recursive, unless the demonstration that it is general recursive is effective."(Kleene (1952) p. 319)

For an example of what this means in practice see the examples at [[mu recursive function]]s—even the simplest ("improper") subtraction algorithm "x - y = d" can yield, for the undefined cases when x &lt; y, (1) no termination, (2) no numbers (i.e. something wrong with the format so the yield is not considered a natural number), or (3) deceit: wrong numbers in the correct format. The "proper" subtraction algorithm requires careful attention to all the "cases"
:(x, y) = { (0, 0), (a, 0), (0, b), (a≥b, b), (a=b, b), (a&lt;b, b) }.

But even when the algorithm has been shown to produce the expected output in the instances { (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2) }, we are left with an uneasy feeling until we can devise a "convincing demonstration" that the cases (x, y) = (n, m) ''all'' yield the expected results. To Kleene's point: is our "demonstration" (i.e. the algorithm that is our demonstration) convincing enough to be considered ''effective''?

=== Alternative abstract machine models of the unbounded μ operator from Minsky (1967) and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) ===

The unbounded μ operator is defined by Minsky (1967) p.&amp;nbsp;210 but with a peculiar flaw: the operator will not yield t = 0 when its predicate (the IF-THEN-ELSE test) is satisfied; rather, it yields t=2. In Minsky's version the counter is "t", and the function φ( t, '''x''' ) deposits its number in register φ. In the usual μ definition register w will contain 0, but Minsky observes that it can contain any number k. Minsky's instruction set is equivalent to the following where "JNE" = Jump to z if Not Equal:
:{ CLR (r), INC (r), JNE (r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, z) }

The unbounded μ operator is also defined by Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) p.&amp;nbsp;60-61 for a counter machine with an instruction set equivalent to the following:
: { CLR (r), INC (r), DEC (r), JZ (r, z), H }

In this version the counter "y" is called "r2", and the function f( '''x''', r2 ) deposits its number in register "r3". Perhaps the reason Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey clear r3 is to facilitate an unconditional jump to ''loop''; this is often done by use of a dedicated register "0" that contains "0":
