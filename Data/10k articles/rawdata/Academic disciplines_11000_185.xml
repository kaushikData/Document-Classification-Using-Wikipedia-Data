      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5145">{{About|a concept used universally in computing|virtual memory addressing|Virtual address space}}
{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}
In [[computing]], an '''address space''' defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a [[network host]], [[peripheral device]], [[disk sector]], a [[computer data storage|memory]] cell or other logical or physical entity.

For [[software program]]s to save and retrieve stored data, each unit of data must have an address where it can be individually located or else the program will be unable to find and manipulate the data. The number of address spaces available will depend on the underlying address structure and these will usually be limited by the [[computer architecture]] being used.

Address spaces are created by combining enough uniquely identified qualifiers to make an address unambiguous within the address space. For a person's physical address, the ''address space'' would be a combination of locations, such as a neighborhood, town, city, or country. Some elements of an address space may be the same, but if any element in the address is different than addresses in said space will reference different entities. An example could be that there are multiple buildings at the same address of "32 Main Street" but in different towns, demonstrating that different towns have different, although similarly arranged, [[street address]] spaces.

An address space usually provides (or allows) a partitioning to several regions according to the [[mathematical structure]] it has. In the case of [[total order]], as for [[memory address]]es, these are simply [[interval (mathematics)|chunks]]. Some nested domain hierarchies appear in the case of [[arborescence (graph theory)|directed ordered tree]] as for the [[Domain Name System]] or a [[directory structure]]; this is similar to the hierarchical design of [[postal address]]es. In the [[Internet]], for example, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) allocates ranges of [[IP address]]es to various registries in order to enable them to each manage their parts of the global Internet address space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ |title= IPv4 Address Space Registry |date=March 11, 2009 |publisher=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) |accessdate= September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Uses of addresses include, but are not limited to the following:
* [[Memory address]]es for [[main memory]], [[memory-mapped I/O]], as well as for [[virtual memory]];
* Device addresses on an [[expansion bus]];
* [[disk sector|Sector]] addressing for [[disk drive]]s;
* [[File name]]s on a particular [[volume (computing)|volume]];
* Various kinds of network host addresses in [[computer network]]s;
* [[Uniform resource locator]]s in the Internet.

== Address mapping and translation ==
[[File:CNFTL9.JPG|thumb|Illustration of translation from logical block addressing to physical geometry]]
Another common feature of address spaces are [[map (mathematics)|mappings and translations]], often forming numerous layers. This usually means that some higher-level address must be translated to lower-level ones in some way. 
For example, [[file system]] on a [[logical disk]] operates [[one-dimensional array|linear]] sector numbers, which have to be translated to ''absolute'' [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] sector addresses, in simple cases, via [[addition]] of the partition's first sector address. Then, for a disk drive connected via [[Parallel ATA]], each of them must be converted to ''logical'' [[cylinder-head-sector]] address due to the interface historical shortcomings. It is converted back to LBA by the disk [[controller (computing)|controller]] and then, finally, to ''physical'' [[cylinder (disk drive)|cylinder]], [[disk head|head]] and [[track (disk drive)|sector]] numbers.

The [[Domain Name System]] maps its names to (and from) network-specific addresses (usually IP addresses), which in turn may be mapped to [[link layer]] network addresses via [[Address Resolution Protocol]]. Also, [[network address translation]] may occur on the edge of ''different'' IP spaces, such as a [[local area network]] and the Internet.

[[File:Virtual address space and physical address space relationship.svg|thumb|Virtual address space and physical address space relationship]]
An iconic example of virtual-to-physical address translation is [[virtual memory]], where different [[Page (computer memory)|pages]] of [[virtual address space]] map either to [[paging|page file]] or to main memory [[physical address]] space. It is possible that several numerically different virtual addresses all refer to one physical address and hence to the same physical byte of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. It is also possible that a single virtual address maps to zero, one, or [[CPU cache#Homonym and synonym problems|more than one]] physical address.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24678">The biological treatment of wastewater in the [[sewage treatment]] plant is often accomplished using conventional [[activated sludge]] systems. These systems generally require large surface areas for treatment and biomass separation units due to the generally poor settling properties of the [[sludge]]. Aerobic granules are a type of sludge that can self-immobilize flocs and microorganisms into spherical and strong compact structures. The advantages of aerobic granular sludge are excellent settleability, high biomass retention, simultaneous nutrient removal and tolerance to toxicity. Recent studies show that aerobic granular sludge treatment could be a potentially good method to treat high strength wastewaters with nutrients, toxic substances.

The aerobic granular sludge usually is cultivated in SBR (sequencing batch reactor) and applied successfully as a wastewater treatment for high strength wastewater, toxic wastewater and domestic wastewater. Compared with conventional aerobic granular processes for COD removal, current research focuses more on simultaneous nutrient removal, particularly COD, phosphorus and nitrogen, under pressure conditions, such as high salinity or thermophilic condition.

In recent years, new technologies have been developed to improve settlability. The use of '''aerobic granular sludge technology''' is one of them.

==Context==
Proponents of aerobic granular sludge technology claim "it will play an important role as an innovative technology alternative to the present activated sludge process in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment in the near future"&lt;ref name=ni&gt;{{cite book|last=Ni|first=Bing-Jie|title=Formation, Characterization and Mathematical Modeling of the Aerobic Granular Sludge|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-31280-9|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/601/bfm%253A978-3-642-31281-6%252F1.pdf?auth66=1355393926_e27270dacd9faf9671be171972ced9d5&amp;ext=.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it "can be readily established and profitably used in activated sludge plants".&lt;ref name=bathe /&gt; However, in 2011 it was characterised as "not yet established as a large-scale application ... with limited and unpublished full-scale applications for municipal wastewater treatment."&lt;ref name=gao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=Dawen|author2=Liu, Lin|author3= Liang, Hong|author4= Wu, Wei-Min|title=Aerobic granular sludge: characterization, mechanism of granulation and application to wastewater treatment|journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|date=1 June 2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=137–152|doi=10.3109/07388551.2010.497961|url=http://era.stanford.edu/pubs/Gao%20et%20al.%20%28CRB%29-2011_5579.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerobic granular biomass==
The following  definition differentiates an aerobic granule from a simple floc with relatively good settling properties and came out of discussions which took place at the ''1st IWA-Workshop Aerobic Granular Sludge'' in Munich (2004):&lt;ref name=bathe&gt;{{cite book|last=Bathe|first=Stephan|title=Aerobic granular sludge : selected proceedings of the 1st IWA-workshop aerobic granular sludge organised by the Institute of water quality control and waste management of the technical University of Munich (TUM) in cooperation with the Institute of advanced studies on sustainability of the European Academy of sciences and arts (EASA) and the international water association (IWA)|year=2005|publisher=IWA publishing|location=Londen|isbn=978-1843395096|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Granules making up aerobic granular activated sludge are to be understood as aggregates of microbial origin, which do not coagulate under reduced [[hydrodynamic shear]], and which settle significantly faster than activated sludge flocs|de Kreuk et al. 2005&lt;ref&gt;de Kreuk  M.K., McSwain B.S., Bathe S., Tay S.T.L., Schwarzenbeck and Wilderer P.A. (2005). "Discussion outcomes". Ede. In: ''Aerobic Granular Sludge''. Water and Environmental Management Series. IWA Publishing. Munich, pp. 165–169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Formation of aerobic granules==
[[Image:ReactorSBR.JPG|right|thumb|220px|SBR Reactor, with aerobic granules]]

Granular sludge biomass is developed in [[sequencing batch reactor]]s (SBR) and without carrier materials. These systems fulfil most of the requirements for their formation as:

: '''Feast - Famine regime: '''short feeding periods must be selected to create feast and famine periods (Beun et al. 1999&lt;ref name="Beun J.J. 2290"&gt;Beun J.J., Hendriks A., Van Loosdrecht M.C.M., Morgenroth E., Wilderer P.A. and Heijnen J.J. (1999). Aerobic granulation in a sequencing batch reactor. ''Water Research, ''Vol.  33, No. 10, pp. 2283–2290.&lt;/ref&gt;), characterized by the presence or absence of organic matter in the liquid media, respectively. With this feeding strategy the selection of the appropriate micro-organisms to form granules is achieved. When the substrate concentration in the bulk liquid is high, the granule-former organisms can store the organic matter in form of poly-''β''-hydroxybutyrate to be consumed in the famine period, giving an advantage over filamentous organisms. When an anaerobic feeding is applied this factor is enhanced, minimising the importance of short settling time and higher hydrodynamic forces.

: '''Short settling time: ''' This hydraulic selection pressure on the microbial community allows the retention granular biomass inside the reactor while flocculent biomass is washed-out. (Qin et al. 2004&lt;ref&gt;Qin L. Liu Y. and Tay J-H (2004). Effect of settling time on aerobic granulation in sequencing batch reactor''. Biochemical Engineering Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 1, pp. 47–52.&lt;/ref&gt;)

: '''Hydrodynamic shear force ''': Evidences show that the application of high [[shear forces]] favours the formation of aerobic granules and the physical granule integrity. It was found that aerobic granules could be formed only above a threshold shear force value in terms of superficial upflow air velocity above 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm/s in a column SBR, and more regular, rounder, and more compact aerobic granules were developed at high hydrodynamic shear forces (Tay et al., 2001&lt;ref&gt;Tay J.-H., Liu Q.-S. and Liu Y. (2001). The effects of shear force on the formation, structure and metabolism of aerobic granules. ''Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology'', Vol. 57, Nos. 1–2, pp. 227–233.&lt;/ref&gt;  ).

Granular activated sludge is also developed in flow-through reactors using the Hybrid Activated Sludge (HYBACS®) process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluewaterbio.com/technology.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828175556/http://www.bluewaterbio.com/technology.asp |archivedate=2015-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising an attached-growth reactor with short retention time upstream of a suspended growth reactor. The attached bacteria in the first reactor, known as a SMART unit, are exposed to a constant high COD, triggering the expression of high concentrations of hydrolytic enzymes in the EPS layer around the bacteria (citation needed). The accelerated hydrolysis liberates soluble readily-degradable COD which promotes the formation of granular activated sludge.

==Advantages==
The development of biomass in the form of aerobic granules is being studied for its application in the removal of  [[Natural organic matter#NOM in water|organic matter]], [[Microbial metabolism#Nitrification|nitrogen]] and [[Enhanced biological phosphorus removal|phosphorus]] compounds from wastewater.
Aerobic granules in an aerobic SBR present several advantages compared to conventional activated sludge process such as:

: '''Stability and flexibility:''' the SBR system can be adapted to fluctuating conditions with the ability to withstand shock and toxic loadings

: '''Low energy requirements:''' the aerobic granular sludge process has a higher aeration efficiency due to operation at increased height, while there are neither return sludge or nitrate recycle streams nor mixing and propulsion requirements

: '''Reduced footprint:''' The increase in biomass concentration that is possible because of the high settling velocity of the aerobic sludge granules and the absence of a final settler result in a significant reduction in the required footprint.

: '''Good biomass retention:''' higher biomass concentrations inside the reactor can be achieved, and higher substrate loading rates can be treated.

: '''Presence of aerobic and anoxic zones inside the granules:''' to perform simultaneously different biological processes in the same system (Beun et al. 1999&lt;ref name="Beun J.J. 2290"/&gt;  )

: '''Reduced investment and operational costs:''' the cost of running a wastewater treatment plant working with aerobic granular sludge can be reduced by at least 20% and space requirements can be reduced by as much as 75% (de Kreuk et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;de Kreuk, M.K.,  Bruin L.M.M. and van Loosdrecht M.C.M. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge: From idea to pilot plant.. In Wilderer, P.A. (Ed.), ''Granules 2004. IWA workshop Aerobic Granular Sludge, Technical University of Munich, 26–28 September 2004 ''(pp. 1–12). London: IWA.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The HYBACS process has the additional benefit of being a flow-through process, thus avoiding the complexities of SBR systems. It is also readily applied to the upgrading of existing flow-through activated sludge processes, by installing the attached growth reactors upstream of the aeration tank. Upgrading to granular activated sludge process enables the capacity of an existing wastewater treatment plant to be doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluewaterbio.com/PDF_Downloads/Case-Studies/Tubli_Municipal_Sewage_Rev8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514063005/http://www.bluewaterbio.com/PDF_Downloads/Case-Studies/Tubli_Municipal_Sewage_Rev8.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of industrial wastewater==
Synthetic wastewater was used in most of the works carried out with aerobic granules. These works were mainly focussed on the study of granules formation, stability and nutrient removal efficiencies under different operational conditions and their potential use to remove toxic compounds. The potential of this technology to treat industrial wastewater is under study, some of the results:

*  Arrojo et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Arrojo B., Mosquera-Corral A., Garrido J.M. and Méndez R. (2004) Aerobic granulation with industrial wastewater in sequencing batch reactors. ''Water Research'', Vol. 38, Nos. 14-15, pp. 3389 – 3399&lt;/ref&gt; operated two reactors that were fed with industrial wastewater produced in a laboratory for analysis of dairy products (Total [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] : 1500–3000&amp;nbsp;mg/L; soluble COD: 300–1500&amp;nbsp;mg/L; total nitrogen: 50–200&amp;nbsp;mg/L). These authors applied organic and nitrogen loading rates up to 7 g COD/(L·d) and 0.7 g N/(L·d) obtaining removal efficiencies of 80%.
* Schwarzenbeck ''et al. ''(2004)&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzenbeck N., Erley R.  and Wilderer P.A. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge in an SBR-system treating wastewater rich in particulate matter. ''[[Water Science and Technology]]'', Vol. 49, Nos. 11-12, pp. 41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;   treated malting wastewater which had a high content of particulate organic matter (0.9 g TSS/L). They found that particles with average diameters lower than 25-50&amp;nbsp;µm were removed at 80% efficiency, whereas particles bigger than 50&amp;nbsp;µm were only removed at 40% efficiency. These authors observed that the ability of aerobic granular sludge to remove particulate organic matter from the wastewaters was due to both incorporation into the [[biofilm]] matrix and metabolic activity of protozoa population covering the surface of the granules.
* Cassidy and Belia (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy D.P. and Belia E. (2005). Nitrogen and phosphorus removal from an abattoir wastewater in a SBR with aerobic granular sludge. ''Water Research'', Vol. 39, No. 19, pp. 4817–4823.&lt;/ref&gt;   obtained removal efficiencies for COD and P of 98% and for N and VSS over 97% operating a granular reactor fed with slaughterhouse wastewater (Total COD: 7685&amp;nbsp;mg/L; soluble COD: 5163&amp;nbsp;mg/L; [[TKN]]: 1057&amp;nbsp;mg/L and VSS: 1520&amp;nbsp;mg/L). To obtain these high removal percentages, they operated the reactor at a [[Dissolved oxygen|DO]] saturation level of 40%, which is the optimal value predicted by Beun et al. (2001) for N removal, and with an anaerobic feeding period which helped to maintain the stability of the granules when the DO concentration was limited.
* Inizan ''et al. ''(2005)&lt;ref&gt;Inizan M., Freval A., Cigana J. and Meinhold J. (2005). Aerobic granulation in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for industrial wastewater treatment. ''Water Science and Technology'', Vol. 52, Nos. 10-11, pp. 335–343.&lt;/ref&gt;   treated industrial wastewaters from pharmaceutical industry and observed that the suspended solids in the inlet wastewater were not removed in the reactor.

Studies on Biodegradation of Phenols and m -Cresols by Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket and Aerobic Sequential Batch Reactor.''Global Nest Journal'',10(1), 39-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Wastewaters from fossil fuel refining, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides are the main sources of phenolic compounds. Those with more complex structures are often more toxic than the simple phenol. This study was aimed at assessing the efficacy of granular sludge in UASB and SBR for the treatment of mixtures of phenolics compounds. The results indicates that anaerobic treatment by UASB and aerobic treatment by SBR can be successfully used for phenol/cresol mixture, representative of major substrates in chemical and petrochemical wastewater and the results shows proper acclimatization period is essential for the degradation of m - cresol and phenol. Moreover, SBR was found as a better alternative than UASB reactor as it is more efficient and higher concentration of m cresols can be successfully degraded.

The formation of granules was performed using a synthetic substrate and after 120 days of operation, synthetic media was replaced by real winery wastewater, with a COD loading of 6&amp;nbsp;kg COD/(m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·d).

Technol. 226, 211–219.&lt;/ref&gt; treated wastewater from potato industry. Granulation was successful achieved and simultaneous nitrification/denitrification was possible by short cutting the nitrogen cycle.

Technol. 238, 559–567.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared an aerobic feast/famine strategy and an anaerobic feast, aerobic famine strategy for the formation of aerobic granular sludge during the treatment of industrial petrochemical wastewater. Both strategies were successful.

==Pilot research in aerobic granular sludge==
Aerobic granulation technology for the application in wastewater treatment is widely developed at laboratory scales. The large-scale experience is growing rapidly and multiple institutions are making efforts to improve this technology:

* Since 1999 Royal HaskoningDHV (former DHV Water), Delft University of technology (TUD), STW (Dutch Foundation for Applied Technology) and STOWA (Dutch Foundation for Applied Water Research) have been cooperating closely on the development of the aerobic granular sludge technology ([http://www.royalhaskoningdhv.com/en-gb/nereda Nereda]). In September 2003, a first extensive pilot plant research was executed at STP Ede, the Netherlands with focus on obtaining stable granulation and biological nutrient removal. Following the positive outcome together with six Dutch Water Boards the parties decided to establish a Public-Private Partnership (PPP)- the National Nereda Research Program [http://www.neredannop.nl (NNOP)]- to mature,  further scale-up and implement several full-scale units. As part of this PPP extensive pilot tests have been executed between 2003 and 2010 at multiple sewage treatment plants. Currently more than 20 plants are running or under construction across 3 continents.
* From the basis of the aerobic granular sludge but using a contention system for the granules, a [[sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor]] (SBBGR) with a volume of 3.1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was developed by IRSA (Istituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque, Italy). Different studies were carried out in this plant treating sewage at an Italian wastewater treatment plant.
* The use of aerobic granules prepared in laboratory, as a starter culture, before adding in main system, is the base of the technology ARGUS ([[Aerobic granules upgrade system]]) developed by EcoEngineering Ltd.. The granules are cultivated on-site in small bioreactors called propagators and fill up only 2 to 3% of the main bioreactor or fermentor (digestor) capacity.  This system is being used in a pilot plant with a volume of 2.7 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; located in one Hungarian pharmaceutical industry.
* The Group of Environmental Engineering and Bioprocesses from the University of Santiago de Compostela is currently operating a 100 L pilot plant reactor.

The feasibility study showed that the aerobic granular sludge technology seems very promising (de Bruin et al., 2004.&lt;ref&gt;de Bruin L.M.M., de Kreuk M.K., van der Roest H.F.R., Uijterlinde C. and van Loosdrecht M.C.M. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge technology: and alternative to activated sludge. ''Water Science and Technology'', Vol. 49, Nos. 11-12, pp. 1–7)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on total annual costs a GSBR ([[Granular sludge sequencing batch reactors]]) with pre-treatment and a GSBR with post-treatment proves to be more attractive than the reference activated sludge alternatives (6-16%).
A sensitivity analysis shows that the GSBR technology is less sensitive to land price and more sensitive to rain water flow. Because of the high allowable volumetric load the footprint of the GSBR variants is only 25% compared to the references. However, the GSBR with only primary treatment cannot meet the present effluent standards for municipal wastewater, mainly because of exceeding the suspended solids effluent standard caused by washout of not well settleable biomass.

==Full scale application ==
Aerobic granulation technology is already successfully applied for treatment of wastewater.

* Since 2005, RoyalHaskoningDHV has implemented more than 20 full-scale aerobic granular sludge technology systems (Nereda) for the treatment of both industrial and municipal wastewater across 3 continents. One example is STP Epe, The Netherlands, with a capacity of 59.000 pe and 1,500 m3.h-1, being the first full-scale municipal Nereda in The Netherlands. Examples of the latest Nereda sewage treatment  plants (2012-2013) include Wemmershoek- South Africa, Dinxperlo,  Vroomshoop, Garmerwolde - The Netherlands.

As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like [[Vaginal lubrication|the vagina does]], so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a [[personal lubricant]] is not used.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krasner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert I Krasner| title =The Microbial Challenge: Science, Disease and Public Health| publisher =[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]]|year = 2010|pages=416–417|accessdate = August 28, 2013| isbn = 0763797359 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nThtlYxP84QC&amp;pg=PA416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anal sex without protection of a [[condom]] is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity,&lt;ref name="Krasner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn = 0495391921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Werner W.

Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to [[religion and homosexuality|religious prohibitions]]. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the [[Reproduction|procreative]] purpose of sexual activity.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt; It may be regarded as [[taboo]] or unnatural, and is a [[Crime|criminal offense]] in some countries, punishable by [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] or [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt; By contrast, people also regard anal sex as a natural and valid form of sexual activity that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions. They may regard it as an enhancing element of their [[Sex life|sex lives]] or as their primary form of sexual activity.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt;

==Anatomy and stimulation==
{{See also|Prostate massage}}
[[File:Male anatomy en.svg|thumb|Male genital anatomy, showing the location of the prostate with respect to the rectum]]

The abundance of [[Nerve|nerve endings]] in the anal region and [[rectum]] can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women.&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal]] and [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external]] [[sphincter]] muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The ''Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia'' states that "the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure" and that "the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand".&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;

Research indicates that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors,&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; but its association with [[dominance and submission]], as well as [[taboo]], makes it an appealing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] to people of all [[sexual orientation]]s.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"&gt;{{cite book|author =Joann S.

The anal sphincters are usually tighter than the [[pelvic floor|pelvic muscles]] of the vagina, which can enhance the sexual pleasure for the inserting male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt; Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt;

In a 2010 clinical review article of heterosexual anal sex, ''anal intercourse'' is used to specifically denote penile-anal penetration, and ''anal sex'' is used to denote any form of anal sexual activity. The review suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that "for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex".&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;

Anal intercourse is sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The likelihood of [[pregnancy]] occurring&lt;!-- NOTE: This paragraph, including this line, relates to practice far more than it does to health, so it seemingly fits better here than in the Health risks section. --&gt; during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of [[Birth control|contraception]], often in the absence of a condom.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies''[https://web.archive.org/web/20171231103438/http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&amp;featureid=1036&amp;pageid=682&amp;parentid=478] Accessed January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-to-female anal sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female [[virginity]] because it is non-procreative and does not tear the [[hymen]]; a person, especially a teenage girl or woman, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss. This is sometimes called ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&amp;pg=PT11 here] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&amp;pg=PA48 pages 48–49] for the majority of researchers and heterosexuals defining virginity loss/"technical virginity" by whether or not a person has engaged in vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

Carpenter stated that this view "dates to the late 1600s, with explicit 'rules' appearing around the turn of the twentieth century, as in marriage manuals defining petting as 'literally every caress known to married couples but does not include complete sexual intercourse.'"&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;

===Prevalence===

Because most research on anal intercourse addresses [[men who have sex with men]], little data exists on the prevalence of anal intercourse among heterosexual couples.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite book |authors =Hardin L.K. Coleman, Christine Yeh|title =Handbook of School Counseling|isbn = 1135283591|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|page=247|accessdate=December 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBiPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt; The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt; The review added that because "relatively little attention [is] given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners", this means that it is "quite rare" to have research "that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus."&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;

According to a 2010 study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] et al., although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days. Women engaged in anal intercourse less commonly than men. Vaginal intercourse was practiced more than insertive anal intercourse among men, but 13% to 15% of men aged 25 to 49 practiced insertive anal intercourse.&lt;ref name="Carroll 2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Janell L. Carroll| title = Discovery Series: Human Sexuality| edition = 1st | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|pages=285–286| isbn = 1111841896|year=2012| accessdate = December 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC&amp;pg=PT316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/ National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB).] Findings from the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University. ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', Vol. 7, Supplement 5. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to adolescents, limited data also exists. This may be because of the taboo nature of anal sex and that teenagers and caregivers subsequently avoid talking to one another about the topic. It is also common for subject review panels and schools to avoid the subject.  A 2000 study found that 22.9% of college students who self-identified as non-virgins had anal sex.  They used condoms during anal sex 20.9% of the time as compared with 42.9% of the time with vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

Anal sex being more common among heterosexuals today than it was previously has been linked to the increase in consumption of anal pornography among men, especially among those who view it on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johansson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidman"&gt;{{cite book|title =Introducing the New Sexuality Studies|edition =2nd|author=Steven Seidman|author2=Nancy Fischer|author3=Chet Meeks|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|pages=108–112|isbn=1136818103|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rmjynItoEkC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seidman et al. argued that "cheap, accessible and, especially, interactive media have enabled many more people to produce as well as consume pornography", and that this modern way of producing pornography, in addition to the buttocks and anus having become more eroticized, has led to a significant interest in or obsession with anal sex among men.&lt;ref name="Seidman"/&gt;

===Prevalence===

Reports regarding the prevalence of anal sex among gay men and other men who have sex with men vary. A survey in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have had anal sex at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in anal sex among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in anal sex in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, even if only between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.&lt;ref name=dodge&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual Behaviors of U.S. Men by Self-Identified Sexual Orientation: Results From the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior|author1=Brian Dodge|author2=et al.|year=2016|journal=J Sex Med|volume=13|pages=37e649|doi=10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.01.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral sex and mutual masturbation are more common than anal stimulation among men in sexual relationships with other men.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson and Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brannon&gt;{{cite book |author =Linda Brannon|title =Gender: Psychological Perspectives, Sixth Edition|isbn =1317348133|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=2015|page=484|accessdate=December 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd85CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT484}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weiten et al., anal intercourse is generally more popular among gay male couples than among heterosexual couples, but "it ranks behind oral sex and mutual masturbation" among both sexual orientations in prevalence.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; Wellings et al. reported that "the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike" and that "yet an Internet survey of 180,000 MSM across Europe (EMIS, 2011) showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place".&lt;ref name="Wellings"/&gt;

Women may sexually stimulate a man's anus by fingering the exterior or interior areas of the anus; they may also stimulate the [[perineum]] (which, for males, is between the base of the [[scrotum]] and the anus), [[prostate massage|massage the prostate]] or engage in anilingus.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zdrok"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keesling"&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara|last=Keesling| title = Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal and Intimacy | publisher =[[Hunter House Publishers|Hunter House]]|year = 2005|page=221|accessdate = July 6, 2013| isbn = 9780897934350 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=EG2qGvbgneoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex toys, such as a [[dildo]], may also be used.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zdrok"/&gt; The practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a [[strap-on dildo]] for sexual activity is called [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]].&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Savage|title=We Have a Winner!|publisher=''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''|date=June 21, 2001|accessdate=July 5, 2011|url=http://thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly, heterosexual men reject the idea of being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a [[Femininity|feminine]] act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay).&lt;ref name="Zdrok"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Odets"/&gt; The ''[[BMJ]]'' stated in 1999, however:&lt;blockquote&gt;There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship.

There is less research on anal sexual activity among [[women who have sex with women]] compared to couples of other sexual orientations. In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last ten sexual encounters, lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; While author Tom Boellstorff, when particularly examining anal sex among gay and lesbian individuals in Indonesia, stated that he had not heard of oral-anal contact or anal penetration as recognized forms of lesbian sexuality but assume they take place,&lt;ref name="Boellstorff"&gt;{{cite book|author =Tom Boellstorff|title=The Gay Archipelago: Sexuality and Nation in Indonesia|isbn = 978-0-691-12334-9 |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|pages=101–102|accessdate=March 12, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Whr4Tb0EuZUC&amp;pg=PA101}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Felice Newman]] cites anal sex as a part of lesbian sexual practices.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; A 2014 study of partnered lesbian women in Canada and the U.S. found that 7% engaged in anal stimulation or penetration at least once a week; about 10% did so monthly and 70% did not at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Jacqueline N.|last2=Byers|first2=E.

===General risks===
[[File:Gray1082.png|thumb|left|Mucous membranes of the [[rectum]]]]
Anal sex can expose its participants to two principal dangers: infections due to the high number of infectious [[microorganism]]s not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility.&lt;ref name="Krasner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"/&gt; Unprotected penile-anal penetration, colloquially known as ''[[Bareback (sex)|barebacking]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Partridge |first1=Eric|year=2006 |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I |first2=Tom |last2=Dalzell |first3=Terry|last3=Victor |edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-25937-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4YfsEgHLjboC |quote=Bareback&amp;nbsp;– to engage in sex without a condom. |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; carries a higher risk of passing on [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs) because the anal sphincter is a delicate, easily torn tissue that can provide an entry for pathogens.&lt;ref name="Krasner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"/&gt; The high concentration of [[white blood cell]]s around the rectum, together with the risk of tearing and the colon's function to absorb fluid, are what place those who engage in anal sex at high risk of STIs.&lt;ref name="Werner"/&gt; Use of [[condom]]s, ample lubrication to reduce the risk of tearing,&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lubrication/&gt; and [[safer sex]] practices in general, reduce the risk of STI transmission.&lt;ref name="Werner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ignatavicius and Workman"&gt;{{cite book| author = Donna D.

Although anal sex alone does not lead to pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during [[intercrural sex]] or other [[Sex position#Genital-genital rubbing|genital-genital rubbing]]) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=R.

Pain during receptive anal sex among gay men (or men who have sex with men) is formally known as ''anodyspareunia.''&lt;ref name=Heidelbaugh/&gt; In one study, 61% of gay or bisexual men said they experienced painful receptive anal sex and that it was the most frequent sexual difficulty they had experienced.

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common literary convention, represented as taking place with "eligible" youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing those not of proper age (for example, non-adolescent children) into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him; Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced male-female anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = James E.|year = 1995 | title = The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual? | url = | journal = Novum Testamentum | volume = 37 | issue = 1| page = 9 | quote = Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception | doi=10.1163/1568536952613631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male citizen taking the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse (''paedicatio'' in [[Latin]]) was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or un[[chastity]]); free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young male slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to "take it like a woman" (muliebria pati, "to undergo womanly things") when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.&lt;ref name="Skinner"&gt;{{cite book|title =Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought.

Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mishneh Torah |first=Moshe |last=Maimonides |page=Laws Concerning Forbidden Relations 21:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
{{See also|Sodomy#Christianity}}
Christian texts may sometimes [[Euphemism|euphemistically]] refer to anal sex as the ''peccatum contra naturam'' (the sin against nature, after [[Thomas Aquinas]]) or ''Sodomitica luxuria'' (sodomitical lusts, in one of [[Charlemagne]]'s ordinances), or ''peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non nominandum'' (that horrible sin that among Christians is not to be named).&lt;ref name="Classen"&gt;{{cite book|title =Sexuality in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Times: New Approaches to a Fundamental Cultural-historical and Literary-anthropological Theme|author=Albrecht Classen|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|year=2010|page=13|isbn=3110205742|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dX0LAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fone"&gt;{{cite book|title =Homophobia: A History|author=Byrne Fone|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year=2001|page=133|isbn=1466817070|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB-z1WUCKOEC&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crompton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Crompton|title =Homosexuality and Civilization|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2009|page=529|isbn=0674030060|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Main|Islamic views on anal sex}}

''Liwat'', or the sin of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s people, which has come to be interpreted as referring generally to same-sex sexual activity, is commonly officially prohibited by Islamic sects; there are parts of the [[Quran]] which talk about smiting on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are [[hadith]] and Islamic laws which prohibit it.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark M Leach|title =Cultural Diversity and Suicide: Ethnic, Religious, Gender, and Sexual Orientation Perspectives|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=121|isbn=1317786599|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqLrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, concerning Islamic belief, it is objectionable to use the words ''al-Liwat'' and ''luti'' to refer to homosexuality because it is [[blasphemy]] toward the prophet of [[Allah]], and therefore the terms ''sodomy'' and ''homosexuality'' are preferred,&lt;ref name="Bambale"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yahaya Yunusa Bambale|title =Crimes and Punishments Under Islamic Law|publisher=Malthouse Press Limited|origyear=2003 |year=2008|page=40|isbn=9780231595|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVGPAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; same-sex male practitioners of anal sex are called ''luti'' or ''lutiyin'' in plural and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation.&lt;ref name="Bambale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Randy P.

====Buddhism====
{{Further|Buddhism and sexuality|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}

The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics is [[the Five Precepts]].  These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Precepts is "To refrain from committing [[sexual misconduct]]".&lt;ref name=HIGG&gt;{{cite web| last =Higgins| first =Winton| title =Buddhist Sexual Ethics| publisher =BuddhaNet Magazine

====Hinduism====
{{See also|History of sex in India|LGBT topics and Hinduism}}

Although Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and [[third gender]]s as a variation of male-female sex (meaning a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analyzed in western terms). Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc. (the various forms of third gender that exist in India today) are all characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. However, sexuality between males (as distinct from third genders) has thrived, mostly unspoken and informally, without being seen as different in the way it is seen in the west; young men involved in "such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "Indian culture is highly homosocial and displays of affection, body contact and the sharing of beds between men is socially acceptable (Kahn, 1994) This creates opportunities for sexual contact, though sexual behavior in this context is rarely seen as real sex, but as play. Much of this same-sex sexual activity begins in adolescence between school friends and within family environments and is non-penetrative... Young men who cultivate such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="878">In [[biology]], '''antrum''' is a general term for a cavity or chamber, which may have specific meaning in reference to certain organs or sites in the body.

In [[vertebrates]], it may refer specifically to:
* [[Antrum cardiacum]], a dilation that occurs in the esophagus near the stomach (forestomach)
* [[Antrum follicularum]], the cavity in the epithelium that envelops the oocyte
* [[Mastoid antrum]], a cavity between the middle ear and temporal bone in the skull 
* [[Pyloric antrum]], the initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. This is what is usually referred to as "antrum" in stomach-related topics.
* [[Maxillary antrum]] or antrum of Highmore, the [[maxillary sinus]], a cavity in the maxilla and the largest of the paranasal sinuses

In [[invertebrates]], it may refer specifically to:
* Antrum of female [[lepidoptera genitalia]]

'''''Clavibacter michiganensis''''' is an aerobic non-sporulating [[Gram-positive]] [[plant pathogen]]ic [[actinomycete]] that currently constitutes the only species within the genus ''Clavibacter''. The other former ''Clavibacter'' species have been reclassified to genera ''Leifsonia'', ''Rathayibacter'' and ''Curtobacterium''. ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' currently has five subspecies; all are available from the [[National Collection of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria|NCPPB]] for legitimate researchers: ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''insidiosus'', ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganensis'', ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''nebraskensis'', ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''sepedonicus'' and ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''tesselarius''. ''Clavibacter michiganesis'' subsp. ''michiganensis'' and ''Clavibacter michiganesis'' subsp. ''sepedonicus'' are the main diseases that cause substantial economic losses worldwide by damaging tomatoes and potatoes.&lt;ref name="Gartemann et al"&gt;Gartemann et al. "Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis: first steps in the understanding of virulence of a Gram-positive phytopathogenic bacterium", ''Journal of Biotechnology'', Germany, 16 July 2003. Retrieved on 2011-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
Clavibacter is an unusual genus of phytopathogenic bacteria in that it is gram-positive and does not have a type 3 secretion system. All ''Clavibacter'' species and subspecies have a type B2γ cell wall crosslinked at a diaminobutyrate residue. ''Clavibacter'' is an aerobic bacterium with a coryneform morphology. There is no mycelium and no spores are produced.&lt;ref name="Eichenlaub2011"/&gt;

''Clavibacter michiganensis'' infects the primary host in one of three ways: wounds, hydathodes, or by contaminated seed. If the bacteria reach a suitable quorum, the result is a systemic vascular infection. In the first stages of invasion, ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' resides as a biotrophic pathogen in the xylem vessels.&lt;ref name="Eichenlaub2011"/&gt;
 
''Clavibacter'' has a complex history of taxonomical names. For a long time, there was only one recognized species within the genus ''Clavibacter''. There are now six recognized species within Clavibacter. At the same time, there are three subspecies within the ''michiganensis'' species. Recently, some strains have been reclassified into other genera. This complex history stems from the difficulty in characterizing [[bacteria]]. Unlike [[fungi]], the morpholology of bacteria is not very sufficient for taxonomical purposes. To this end, strains of a phytopathogenic bacteria, called pathovars, are distinguished by cultural (selective media), physiological, biochemical (e.g. secreted enzymes the chemical responses of the plant), or pathological characteristics (including the range of susceptible hosts).&lt;ref&gt;Eichenlaub R, Gartemann K-H, Burger A. 2006 ''Clavibacter michiganensis'', a group of Gram positive phytopathogenic bacteria. In "Plant-Associated Bacteria", ed. SS Gnanamanickam, pp. 385-422. Dordrecht: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, two strains of this bacteria - subsp. sepidonicum and subsp. michiganensis - have had their genomes sequenced and annotated. There is still much to discover about this pathogen-host interaction but now that the genome has been sequenced, the rate of discoveries will likely increase. One of the main goals pertaining to research of these bacterial genomes is to develop resistant varieties. Unfortunately, no resistant varieties have yet been found.&lt;ref&gt;Coaker GL, Willard B, Kinter M, Stockinger EJ, Francis DM. 2004. Proteomic analysis of resistance mediated by Rem 2.0 and Rem 5.1, two loci controlling resistance to bacterial canker of tomato. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 17: 1019-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''sepedonicus''==
''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''sepedonicus ''is a high-profile alien plant pathogen of A2 Quarantine status affecting only potatoes. It causes a disease in potatoes known as 'ring rot' due to the way it rots vascular tissue inside potato tubers&lt;ref&gt;Manzer F, Genereux H.1981.Ring Rot. In ''Compendium of Potato Disease'', ed. WJ Hobson, pp.31-32.St Paul, MN:Am Phytopathol.Soc.Press&lt;/ref&gt;  It is present in parts of Europe but is under statutory control under ‘Council Directive 93/85/EEC’ of 4 October 1993 on the control of potato ring rot. This means that if an outbreak occurs, the outbreak must be controlled and if possible the disease has to be eradicated. If necessary, prohibitions are put into place to prevent further spread.

A plant showing symptoms of ring rot should be reported to the local plant health authority.

===Hosts and symptoms===
The subsp. ''sepidonicus ''is an economically important pathogen because it affects only potato, which was the 12th highest ranking commodity in 2009, generating $44,128,413,000 globally.&lt;ref name="FAOSTAT"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. http://faostat.fao.org/site/339/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Like all bacteria in the genus ''Clavibacter michiganesis'' subsp. ''sepidonicus'' causes a systemic vascular infection by invading the xylem vessels and multiplying there which sometimes leads to plugged xylem vessels. When diagnosing a subsp. ''sepidonicus'' infection in potato, look for discoloration of the vascular ring within the tuber that has been described as "glassy" or "water-soaked" with the ooze inside having a "cheese-like consistency".&lt;ref name="FERA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evtuchenko"&gt;Evtushenko LI, Takeuchi M. 2006. The family Microbacteriaceae. In "The Prokaryotes", 3rd edition, ed. M Dworkin, S Falkow, E Rosenburg, KH Schleifer, E Stackenbrandt, 3:1020-99. New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of potato 'ring rot' are yellowing of the leaf margins which later turn brown and look like they are burned. Tubers rot from the inside, sometimes progressing to leave hollow shells. Rotting of the tubers is the more common symptom. Infected land cannot be used again for susceptible crops for several years. Among others, USA, Canada, many EU states and Middle Eastern countries have not yet been able to eradicate this pathogen.

===Disease cycle===
The causal agent of Ring Rot of Potato does not overwinter in the soil. The bacteria survives inside infected tubers or as dried slime on machinery or containers. For instance, if a knife cuts into an infected tuber, the next 20 tubers that the knife cuts have a high risk of becoming infected.&lt;ref name="Agrios"/&gt; The bacteria enters the host through wounds and invades the xylem where it multiplies via binary fission. If colonization is successful, the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels. In advanced stages of infection, the bacteria will move out of the vessels and break down the surrounding parenchyma tissue before moving into new vessels. The bacteria may also invade the roots and cause them to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Agrios"&gt;Agrios, George N (2005). ''Plant Pathology'', Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-044565-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

C. ''sepidonicus'' spreads by contaminated soil, surfaces, infected seed, wash waters, infected potato waste, etc. It can survive on warehouse walls, boxes, bags etc. On machinery in dry conditions, it can survive at least a month - sometimes in the form of dried bacterial ooze.  It is also able to overwinter in soil in association with plant debris. C. ''sepidonicus'' will only survive in the soil as long as the host tissue in which it resides persisits and resists decomposition by saphrophtytic microorganisms in the soil. This poor ability to compete as a saprophyte in the absence of a susceptible host makes ''Clavibacter'' sp. known as soil invaders as opposed to soil inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Agrios"/&gt;

===Environment===
North, Northwest and Central Europe have favorable climates for virulence. The disease multiplies rapidly and survives longer in cooler environments around 21&amp;nbsp;°C. At favorable conditions, the pathogen can survive 63 months in infected potato stems and 18 months in burlap sacs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eppo.org/QUARANTINE/bacteria/Clavibacter_m_sepedonicus/CORBSE_ds.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423105052/http://www.eppo.org/QUARANTINE/bacteria/Clavibacter_m_sepedonicus/CORBSE_ds.pdf |archivedate=23 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}, CABI and EPPO for the EU.

===Management===
In the UK, DEFRA Plant Health and Seed Inspectors (PHSI) and SEERAD carry out annual survey work on ware and seed potatoes. Samples are sent to the [[Food and Environment Research Agency]] which was formerly known as The Central Science Laboratory (for England and Wales) and to Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA) (for Scotland) for latent infection testing (infected but not showing symptoms). Infected crops once identified are intercepted, impounded, and destroyed. additional text. In the EU, quarantine facilities and licences are required to obtain, hold, and/or work with the bacteria and in the UK, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) export licences are required to export it to countries outside of the EU whether through a third party country or not. The last known outbreak in the UK was in August 2004.&lt;ref name="EPPO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eppo.org/QUARANTINE/bacteria/Clavibacter_m_michiganensis/CORBMI_ds.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517052625/http://www.eppo.org/QUARANTINE/bacteria/Clavibacter_m_michiganensis/CORBMI_ds.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}, CABI and EPPO for the EU.

==''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganensis''==
''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganensis ''is the causative agent of bacterial wilt and canker of tomato (''Lycopersicon esculentum'' Mill.).&lt;ref name="Eichenlaub2011"&gt;[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-phyto-072910-095258], Eichenlaub, Gartemann. "The Clavibacter michiganensis Subspecies: Molecular Investigation of Gram-Positive Bacterial Plant Pathogens", ''Annual Review of Phytopathology'', Germany, 2011. Retrieved on 2011-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hosts and symptoms===
When the infection occurs in an early stage of the tomato plant there may be wilting on leaves because ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganensis'' enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the xylem then a systemic infection is likely that may plug the xylem vessels. The wilting may only show on one side of the leaf and may recover during cooler periods.&lt;ref name="hdc"/&gt; The entire system of xylem within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 10^9 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. Wilting may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is to pinch the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then you've got a severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel.&lt;ref name="hdc"/&gt; Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly.&lt;ref name="hdc"/&gt;

If infection occurs at a late stage of plant development, plants are able to survive and generate fruits. However, the plant may appear stressed rather than wilted and may develop white interveinal areas that will develop into brown necrotic tissue. Often the seeds are infected as well.&lt;ref name="Gartemann et al"/&gt;

Superficial infections increase the risk of epidemics.&lt;ref name="hdc"/&gt; They occur when the bacteria multiply on the epidermis of the host, enter through stomata, or enter through a very shallow wound that does not allow the pathogen to reach the xylem tissue. The host may look like it was rubbed with corn meal or coarse flour but it is actually a series of blisters that me be raised or sunken and appear white to pale orange.&lt;ref name=hdc/&gt; The most common leaf symptom is a dark brown spot surrounded by a sort of orange-like area on the edge of the leaf. Fruits may develop "bird's eye" spotting, which are pale green to white raised pustules that have a brown center and chlorotic halo.&lt;ref name="hdc"/&gt; Pictures of these symptoms are available at the cited reference.

However, latent infections are common.&lt;ref name="Eichenlaub2011"/&gt;

The ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganensis'' wild type strain NCPPB382 carries two plasmids associated with virulence: pCM1 and pCM2. The avirulent strain, CMM100, does not contain these plasmids. Strains that carried one of the two plasmids were found to be virulent but wilting symptoms were delayed. The virulent and avirulent strains produced the same amount of ectopolysaccharides, suggesting that EPS does not play a significant role in pathogenicity.&lt;ref name="Meletzus"&gt;Meletzus D, Bermpohl A, Drier J, Eichenlaub R. 1993. Evidence for plasmid-encoded virulence factors in the phytopathogenic bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis NCPPB382. J. Bacteriol. 175:2131-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease cycle===
The causal agent of bacterial wilt and canker of tomato survives in or on seeds for up to 8 months&lt;ref name="hdc"&gt;Elphinstone J, O'Neill T. ''Bacterial wilt and canker of tomato(Clavibacter michiganensis subsp.michiganensis)''.Tomato factsheet.2010. Horticulture Development Company&lt;/ref&gt; but occasionally also in plant refuse in the soil. The pathogen can be spread long distances because of its association with seeds.&lt;ref name="Tsiantos"&gt;Tsiantos J.1987 Transmission of the bacterium ''Corneybacterium michiganense''pv.''michiganense'' by seeds. ''J. Phytopathol.''119:142-46&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of spreading the bacteria to healthy tomato plants is greatest during transplanting, tying, and suckering or any time when the host may be wounded. Once the bacteria enters the plant through a wound, it will move and multiply primarily in the xylem vessels. Once established, the bacteria may move into the phloem, pith, and cortex.&lt;ref name="Agrios"/&gt; Infection can result in either systemic or superficial disease. Systemic infections appear in 3–6 weeks and the risk of secondary infection goes up with water-splashing.&lt;ref name="hdc"/&gt; The common occurrence of latent infections – presence of the pathogen within the host yet the host shows no symptoms – makes this pathogen especially dangerous.&lt;ref name="Gitaitis"&gt;Gitaitis RD, Beaver RW, Voloudakis AE.1991. Detection of ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganensis'' in symptomless tomato transplants. ''Plant Dis.''75:834-38&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the assumption that C. michiganensis does not overwinter in the soil is not without controversy. The genome of Clavibacter michiganesis has recently been sequenced and new theories will surely arise once more work has been completed. What is known is that ''Cmm'' can use hydrolysis products as carbon and energy sources by means of a number of ABC transporters and α- and β-glucosidases.&lt;ref name="Gartemann"/&gt; This suggests that ''Cmm'' can survive in the soil as long as there is decaying host material present. It has also been determined that the genome of subsp. ''michiganensis'' does not have genes that encode for nitrate and nitrate reductases. This means that the bacteria depends on previously reduced nitrogen compounds or amino acids for its nitrogen source.&lt;ref name="Gartemann"&gt;Gartemann KH, Abt B, Bekel T, Burger A, Engemann J, et al. 2008. The genome sequence of the tomato-pathogenic actinomycete ''Clavibacter michiganensis''subsp ''michiganensis'' NCPPB382 reveals a large island involved in pathogenicity. J.Bacteriol.190:2138-49&lt;/ref&gt; Also lacking in the ''Cmm'' genome are genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction, which is associated with an auxotrophy for methionine - one of two amino acids that contain sulphur.&lt;ref name="Gartemann"/&gt;

''Cmm'' has a pathogenicity island (PI) that is encoded in the chromosome and is probably associated with colonization and plant defense evasion or suppression. This island has been subdivided into two subregions: ''chp'' and ''tomA''. Serine proteases of the families S1A, Ppa, and PpA-E are encoded in the ''chp'' subregion as well as subtilase SbtA.&lt;ref name="Eichenlaub2011"/&gt;

===Environment===
Warm temperature in the range of 23-28 Celsius and the high relative humidity (&gt;80%) are optimal environments for ''Clavibacter'' ''michiganesis'' subsp. ''michiganesis'', a tomato bacterial canker symptom development.&lt;ref name="Xu et al."&gt;Xu et al. "Colonization of Tomato Seedlings by Bioluminescent ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganesis'' under Different Humidity Regimes", ''Phytopathology'', Ohio. Retrieved on 2011-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In humid or wet weather, slimy masses of bacteria ooze through the cracks to the surface of the stem, from which they are spread to leaves and fruits and cause secondary infections&lt;ref name ="Agrios"/&gt; Infected host plants will show severe symptoms on hot days when there is a high transpiration rate since the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels.

===Management===
The best way to control a disease is an use of healthy seeds that have already been acid extracted. In addition, using chemical treatments such as copper hydroxide&lt;ref&gt;[http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.5.535], Werner at al. 
"Limiting Populations and Spread of ''Clavibacter michiganensis'' subsp. ''michiganensis'' on Seedling Tomatoes in the Greenhouse", ''Plant Disease'', East Lansing, May 2002. Retrieved on 2011-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt; or streptomycin in the seed bed,&lt;ref name="Agrios"/&gt; removing or isolating diseased crops can be helpful to reduce the rate of infection.&lt;ref name= "EPPO"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7548">'''Cognitive semiotics''' is the study model of [[meaning-making]], applying methods and theories from [[semiotics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[computational modeling]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]] and other sciences.  Contrary to classical cognitive science, cognitive semiotics is explicitly involved with questions of meaning, having recourse, when possible, to semiotic terminology, although developing it when necessary. As against classical semiotics, cognitive semiotics aims to incorporate the results of other sciences, using methods ranging from conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental and ethnographic investigations.

==History==
Cognitive semiotics has many sources. The first person to suggest the integration of the cognitive sciences and semiotics seems to have been Thomas C. Daddesio (1994). The Argentinean researcher Juan Magariños de Morentin has long been using the term "cognitive semiotics" to describe his own Peircean approach to semiotics (missing direct reference dating first time using "cognitive semiotics"). This is also the name of a web forum which he directed for many years. Several other prominent semioticians have been known to subscribe to a cognitive approach, such as [[Irene Mittelberg]] in gesture studies and [[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] in pictorial semiotics. 

[[Per Aage Brandt]] founded a Center for Semiotics in 1995 at [[Aarhus University]] and subsequently a Master Education in Cognitive Semiotics, to investigate the connections between semiotics and cognitive science (with a strong focus on cognitive linguistics), and he has had several followers along this line such as [[Line Brandt]] (Center for Semiotics at Aarhus University), and [[Todd Oakley]] (Case Western Reserve University). The Center for Semiotics is currently constituted by [[Frederik Stjernfelt]], [[Peer Bundgaard]], [[Mikkel Wallentin]], [[Svend Østergaard]], [[Riccardo Fusaroli]] and [[Kristian Tylén]]. Bundgaard published an anthology in Danish which brings together texts from cognitive science, cognitive linguistics, and semiotics. Stjernfelt has combined the inspiration from Peirce with that from Husserl. Wallentin is conducting neuro-imaging investigations. Tylén and Fusaroli develop behavioral and neuroscientific experimental approaches to sign usage and linguistic conversations.

Since 2009, there is also a Centre for Cognitive Semiotics (CCS) at Lund University (Sweden), which is headed by Göran Sonesson, who has long been working in the direction of cognitive semiotics, integrating semiotic theory with experimental studies, mainly with application to the study of pictures. Sonesson started collaborating with the linguist [[Jordan Zlatev]] around 2001 and organized a number of research project together with him, before adopting the label "cognitive semiotics". Other members of the CCS are, notably,  [[Mats Andrén]], who has published a number of gesture studies, partially in collaboration with Zlatev, and Sara Lenninger, who is working with Sonesson on the semiotics of pictures. The particular direction taken by cognitive semiotics in Lund consists in experimental studies which are geared to elucidate fundamental semiotic concepts such as sign, index, icon, etc., as well as their precursor notion such as imitation, mimesis, empathy and intersubjectivity. The research at CCS centers on the phylogeny and ontogeny of human semiosis, employing apes and children, respectively, as research subjects.

==Journal of Cognitive Semiotics==

An international journal on cognitive semiotics, (Journal of) Cognitive Semiotics (JCS) – Multidisciplinary Journal on Meaning and Mind, was started  in Denmark in 2005. Its inaugural issue, edited by Lars Andreassen, Line Brandt and Jes Vang, was published in 2007 (spring). In the fall of 2007, the first peer-reviewed issue, a theme issue on ‘Consciousness &amp; Semiosis’ (eds. Per Aage Brandt and Jakob Simonsen), was published, with funding from Case Western Reserve University. The editorial board consisted of Line Brandt, Per Aage Brandt, Frank Kjørup, Todd Oakley, Jacob Orquin, Jakob Simonsen and Jes Vang. Since then, many issues have been published, in part by Peter Lang, and in part online, available from the journal web site. From 2014, the journal has been published by Mouton de Gruyter. The present board consists of Peer Bundgaard, Göran Sonesson, Todd Oakley, Merlin Donald, and Bruno Gantolucci.

The journal's website states:  "The first of its kind, Cognitive Semiotics is a multidisciplinary journal devoted to high quality research, integrating methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive science with methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with the ultimate aim of providing new insights into the realm of human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices." 

==International Association for Cognitive Semiotics==

The International Association for Cognitive Semiotics (IACS) was initiated during the conference of the Nordic Association for Semiotics Studies (NASS) in Lund in 2011, and officially founded during the conference of NASS in Aarhus in May 2013. The Journal of Cognitive Semiotics then became the official organ of the IACS. The first official conference of IACS took place in Lund in 2014, and the second conference was organized in Lublin in 2014. Selected papers from the Lund conference were published at Peter Lang at the end of 2016 (https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/22221), and the acts of the Lublin conference will appear as a thematic issue of the journal "Philosophy and Science”, published by the Polish Academy of Sciences. 

== Cognitive Semiotics of Film ==
''Cognitive Semiotics of Film'' is a [[monograph]] written by Warren S. Buckland. Within the monograph, Warren Buckland argues that the conflict between cognitive film theory and contemporary film theory is unproductive. Cognitive semiotics of film is a neglected branch of film theory that works together with the terms [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. Cognitive science is also incorporated in a combination with [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]] to form what is called cognitive semiotics.

Shanefield « Honolulu Hawaii Obituaries - Hawaii Newspaper Obituaries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[United States]] [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic engineer]].

Shanefield was born in [[Orange, New Jersey]], and earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from [[Rutgers University]] in 1956; he went on to graduate studies at the same university, receiving his Ph.D. in [[physical chemistry]] from Rutgers in 1962. He worked from 1962 to 1967 at [[ITT Corporation|ITT Research Laboratories]], and from 1967 to 1986 at [[Bell Laboratories]]. In 1986 he returned to Rutgers as a Professor II (a professorial rank at Rutgers that is one step above a normal full professor).&lt;ref name="abet"&gt;Biographical sketch from [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~cannon/ABET%20ss.pdf documents for 2000 ABET Engineering Program review], Rutgers University, retrieved 2011-04-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Bell Laboratories, Shanefield was the co-inventor with Richard E. Mistler of the [[tape casting]] technique for forming thin ceramic films.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Surfactants in emerging technologies|volume=26|series=Surfactant science series|first=Milton J.|last=Rosen|publisher=CRC Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-8247-7801-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mbHGj8XriIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Surfactants+in+emerging+technologies+rosen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YPCYTe2MBLLKiAKdm_2cCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=shanefield&amp;f=false|page=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the development of a [[phase-change memory]] system based on an earlier patent of [[Stanford R. Ovshinsky]]; Shanefield's work in this area "represented the first proof of the phase change memory concept".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Phase Change Materials: Science and Applications|first1=Simone|last1=Raoux|first2=Matthias|last2=Wuttig|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2008|isbn=978-0-387-84873-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AO3SNSM2ykUC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=Phase%20Change%20Materials%20raoux&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=shanefield&amp;f=false|pages=7–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the mid-1970s, Shanefield was an early proponent of [[double-blind test|double-blind]] [[ABX test]]ing of [[high-end audio]] electronics; in 1980 he reported in [[High Fidelity (magazine)|''High Fidelity'' magazine]] that there were no audible differences between several different [[power amplifier]]s, setting off what became known in [[audiophile]] circles as "the great debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nousaine|first=Tom|contribution=The Great Debate: Is Anyone Winning?|title=8th International Conference: The Sound of Audio|publisher=Audio Engineering Society|year=1990|url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=5426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanefield is the author of two books, ''Organic Additives and Ceramic Processing'' (Kluwer, 1995; 2nd ed., Kluwer, 1996) and ''Industrial Electronics for Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians'' (William Andrew Publishing, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mse.rutgers.edu/about/history_mse Books Written by Faculty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415091158/http://mse.rutgers.edu/about/history_mse |date=2011-04-15 }}, Rutgers Materials Science and Engineering, retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a four-time winner of the AT&amp;T Outstanding Achievement Award&lt;ref name="abet"/&gt; and was elected as a Fellow of the [[American Ceramic Society]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceramics.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/fellows_recipients_2009.pdf American Ceramic Society Fellows as of 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725012424/http://ceramics.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/fellows_recipients_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}, retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional geography'''  is a subtopic within [[human geography]], dealing with the relationships between [[emotion]]s and [[Location (geography)|geographic place]]s and their contextual environments.

Emotional geography specifically focuses on how human emotions relate to, or affect, the [[Social environment|environment]] around them.&lt;ref name=HumGeo&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Derek |title=The Dictionary of Human Geography |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=1-4443-5995-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endoderm''' is one of the three primary [[germ layer]]s in the very early [[embryo]]. The other two layers are the [[ectoderm]] (outside layer) and [[mesoderm]] (middle layer), with the endoderm being the innermost layer.&lt;ref&gt;Langman's Medical Embryology, 11th edition. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cells migrating inward along the [[archenteron]] form the inner layer of the [[gastrulation|gastrula]], which develops into the endoderm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the [[epithelial]] lining of multiple systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In [[plant biology]], endoderm corresponds to the innermost part of the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] ([[Bark (botany)|bark]]) in young [[shoots]] and young [[Root|roots]] often consisting of a single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] layer. As the [[plant]] becomes older, more endoderm will [[Lignification|lignify]].

==Production==

The following chart shows the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s produced by the endoderm.
The embryonic endoderm develops into the interior linings of two tubes in the body, the digestive and respiratory tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=SF|title=Endoderm|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/|publisher=Sinauer Associates|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9765">[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]] (1924–1994), originator of epistemological anarchism.]]
'''Epistemological anarchism''' is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory advanced by [[Austria]]n [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Paul Feyerabend]] which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]]. It holds that the idea of the operation of science by fixed, universal rules is unrealistic, pernicious, and detrimental to science itself.&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;{{cite book | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Feyerabend | title = Against Method | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term [[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]] in the name reflected the [[methodological pluralism]] prescription of the theory, as the purported [[scientific method]] does not have a monopoly on truth or useful results. Feyerabend once famously said that because there is no fixed scientific method, it is best to have an "anything goes" attitude toward methodologies.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Feyerabend felt that science started as a liberating movement, but over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid, and therefore had become increasingly an [[ideology]] and despite its successes science had started to attain some oppressive features and it was not possible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He felt the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society was [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of the theory earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

==Rationale==
The theory draws on the observation that there is no identifiable fixed [[scientific method]] that is consistent with the practices of the paradigm of scientific progress – the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; It is a radical critique of [[rationalism|rationalist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[historiography]] which tend to represent the heroes of the scientific revolution as scrupulous researchers reliant on [[empirical research]], whereas Feyerabend countered that [[Galileo]], for example, relied on [[rhetoric]], [[propaganda]] and epistemological tricks to support his doctrine of [[heliocentrism]] and that [[aesthetic]] criteria, personal whims and [[social constructionism|social factors]] were far more prevalent than the dominant historiographies allowed.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=feyerabend |title=Paul Feyerabend |last=Preston |first=John|2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientific law]]s such as those posited by [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] or [[Newtonian physics]] that assumed the stance of objective models of the universe have been found to come short in describing the entirety of the universe. The movement of universal models from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[relativity theory]], where each preceding theory has been refuted as entirely universal model of reality, illustrates for the epistemological anarchist that scientific theories do not [[correspondence theory of truth|correspond to truth]], as they are in part cultural manifestations, and ergo not objective.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | page = 66 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend drew a comparison between one scientific paradigm triumphing over or superseding another, in the same manner a given [[myth]] is adapted and [[Appropriation (sociology)|appropriated]] by a new, triumphant successor myth in [[comparative mythology]]. Feyerabend contended, with [[Imre Lakatos]], that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing on objective grounds science from [[pseudoscience]] was irresolvable and thus fatal to the notion of science run according to fixed, universal rules.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;

Feyerabend also notes that science's success is not solely due to its own methods, but also to its having taken in knowledge from unscientific sources. In turn the notion that there is no knowledge outside science is a 'convenient [[fairy-tale]]' held only by dogmatists who distort history for the convenience of scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | page = 306 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, Copernicus was heavily influenced by Pythagoras, whose view of the world had previously been rejected as mystical and irrational. [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] writings played an important role in the works of Copernicus as well as Newton.&lt;ref name="Feyerabend 1983 306–307"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | pages = 306–307 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There exists fairly accurate astronomical knowledge that reaches back even to the [[Stone Age]], measured in stone observatories in England and the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="Feyerabend 1983 306–307"/&gt; Pre-Modern inventions such as crop rotation, hybrid plants, chemical inventions and architectural achievements not yet understood like that of the pyramids are all examples which threaten the notion that science is the only means of attaining knowledge.&lt;ref name="Feyerabend 1983 306–307"/&gt;

Feyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts, particularly the notions of Uniformity of Law and of Uniformity of Process across time and space. "We have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist," said Feyerabend; "we have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of unfounded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics), phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed; in physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science, we have now at least three different points of view...without a promise of conceptual (and not only formal) unification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Feyerabend held that deciding between competing scientific accounts was complicated by the [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]] of scientific theories. Incommensurability means that scientific theories cannot be reconciled or synthesized because the interpretation and practice of science is always informed by theoretical assumptions, which leads to proponents of competing theories using different terms, engaged in different [[language-game]]s and thus [[talking past each other]]. This for Feyerabend was another reason why the idea of science as proceeding according to universal, fixed laws was both historically inaccurate and prescriptively useless.

==Other proponents==

[[Terence McKenna]] was a fan of philosophers such as Feyerabend and [[Thomas Kuhn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-56455-206-3 | title = The Search of the Original Tree of Knowledge | publisher = Sounds True, Incorporated | last = McKenna | first = Terence | year = 1992 | authorlink = Terence McKenna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Hacking]] was a friend of Feyerabend's, and they corresponded with and cited each other. He wrote the introduction and praised the last edition of ''[[Against Method]]'', quoting French philosopher [[Jean Largeault]], who called it "more than a book: it is an event".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-56455-206-3 | title = Against Method (fourth edition) | page = introduction | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 2010 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imre Lakatos]] was also a friend of Feyerabend's. The two wrote letters to each other on the philosophy of science which would have been published in a book called ''For and Against Method'', but the death of Lakatos ended their plans to produce this dialogue volume.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/&lt;/ref&gt; While Lakatos never publicly labeled himself so, Feyerabend contended that he was a fellow epistemological anarchist. Lakatos was the one who suggested and encouraged that Feyerabend write a book based on his philosophy and the lectures he gave in his classes, which turned out to be his seminal work ''Against Method''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-226-24532-2 | title = Killing Time: The Autobiography of Paul Feyerabend | publisher =  University Of Chicago Press | page= 139 | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1996 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="105714">'''Exoplanetology''', or '''exoplanetary science''', is an integrated field of astronomical science dedicated to the search for and study of [[exoplanet]]s (extrasolar planets). It employs an interdisciplinary approach which includes [[astrobiology]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrochemistry]], [[astrogeology]], [[geochemistry]], and [[planetary science]].

== Nomenclature ==
{{Main|Exoplanet naming convention}}
The exoplanet naming convention is an extension of the system used for naming multiple-star systems as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). For an exoplanet orbiting a single star, the name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. The first planet discovered in a system is given the designation "b" (the parent star is considered to be "a") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbit size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the naming of [[circumbinary planet]]s. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.

== Definition ==

=== IAU ===
The official [[Definition of planet|definition of "planet"]] used by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) only covers the [[Solar System]] and thus does not apply to exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2011, the only defining statement issued by the IAU that pertains to exoplanets is a working definition issued in 2001 and modified in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That definition contains the following criteria:

{{quote|
* Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
* Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarfs]]", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
* Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).
}}

=== Alternatives ===
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s working definition is not always used. One alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from [[brown dwarf]]s on the basis of formation. It is widely thought that giant planets form through core [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], which may sometimes produce planets with masses above the deuterium fusion threshold;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=0710.5667 |title=Giant Planet Formation by Core Accretion| journal=Extreme Solar Systems |volume=398| page=235| bibcode = 2008ASPC..398..235M |author1=Mordasini| first1=C.| last2=Alibert| first2=Yann |last3=Benz| first3=W.| last4=Naef| first4=D.| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=0802.1810|title=Structure and evolution of super-Earth to super-Jupiter exoplanets.

Brown dwarfs form like stars from the direct gravitational collapse of clouds of gas and this formation mechanism also produces objects that are below the {{Jupiter mass|13|jup=y|link=y}} limit and can be as low as {{Jupiter mass|1|jup=y}}.&lt;ref name=ShivKumar&gt;{{cite journal| bibcode=2003IAUS..211..529B| title=Nomenclature: Brown Dwarfs, Gas Giant Planets, and ?| last1=Kumar| first1=Shiv S.|volume=211| date=2003| page=532| journal=Brown Dwarfs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects in this mass range that orbit their stars with wide separations of hundreds or thousands of AU and have large star/object mass ratios likely formed as brown dwarfs; their atmospheres would likely have a composition more similar to their host star than accretion-formed planets which would contain increased abundances of heavier elements.

One study suggests that objects above {{Jupiter mass|10|jup=y}} formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06185 Evidence of an Upper Bound on the Masses of Planets and its Implications for Giant Planet Formation], Kevin C.

Also, the 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with a mass below that cutoff.&lt;ref name="bodenheimer2013" /&gt; The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/727/1/57| title = The Deuterium-Burning Mass Limit for Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 727| issue = 1| page = 57| year = 2011| last1 = Spiegel | first1 = D.

As of 2016 this limit was increased to 60 Jupiter masses&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00917 Exoplanets versus brown dwarfs: the CoRoT view and the future], Jean Schneider, 4 Apr 2016&lt;/ref&gt; based on a study of mass–density relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1506.05097|last1= Hatzes Heike Rauer|first1= Artie P.|title= A Definition for Giant Planets Based on the Mass-Density Relationship|year= 2015|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/810/2/L25|volume=810|issue= 2|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|page=L25|bibcode = 2015ApJ...810L..25H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the [[#Mass|sin i ambiguity]]."&lt;ref name="eod"&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1012.5676 |title=The Exoplanet Orbit Database|date=2010| bibcode = 2011PASP..123..412W |doi = 10.1086/659427| volume=123| issue=902|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific| pages=412–422| last1=Wright|first1=J.

Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium fusion, formation process or location, is whether the core [[pressure]] is dominated by [[Lateral earth pressure#Coulomb theory|coulomb pressure]] or [[electron degeneracy pressure]] with the dividing line at around 5 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref name="whatbasribrown"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058 |journal=Annu.

== Detection methods ==
{{Main article|Methods of detecting extrasolar planets}}

=== Direct imaging ===

[[File:Beta Pictoris.jpg|thumb|alt=Two directly imaged exoplanets around star Beta Pictoris, star-subtracted and artificially embellished with an outline of the orbit of one of the planets. The white dot in the center is the other exoplanet in the same system.|Directly imaged planet [[Beta Pictoris b]]]]
Planets are extremely faint compared with their parent stars. For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star in order to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme [[optothermal stability]].&lt;ref name="Perryman_book11"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Perryman|first = Michael|title = The Exoplanet Handbook|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2011|page = 149|isbn = 978-0-521-76559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than [[Jupiter]]) and widely separated from their parent star.

Specially designed direct-imaging instruments such as [[Gemini Planet Imager]], [[VLT-SPHERE]], and [[Subaru Telescope#Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system|SCExAO]] will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods. The following are the indirect methods that have proven useful:

=== Indirect methods ===
* [[Transit method]]
:[[File:Dopspec-inline.gif|thumb|alt=Edge-on animation of a star-planet system, showing the geometry considered for the transit method of exoplanet detection|When the star is behind a planet, its brightness will seem to dim]]If a planet crosses (or [[Astronomical transit|transits]]) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' telescope]] uses this method.

:As a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity—that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth—can be detected from displacements in the star's [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]].

:When a planet orbits multiple stars or if the planet has moons, its transit time can significantly vary per transit. Although no new planets or moons have been discovered with this method, it is used to successfully confirm many transiting circumbinary planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pál |first=A. |last2=Kocsis |first2=B. |title=Periastron Precession Measurements in Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Systems at the Level of General Relativity |date=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13512.x |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=389 |issue=1 |pages=191–198 |arxiv=0806.0629|bibcode = 2008MNRAS.389..191P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Gravitational microlensing|Gravitational microlensing]]
:Microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in the magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1–10&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] away from Sun-like stars.
* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|Astrometry]]
:Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method has not yet been very productive. It has produced only a few disputed detections, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.
* [[Pulsar timing]]
:A [[pulsar]] (the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a [[supernova]]) emits radio waves extremely regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, they will cause slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses. [[PSR B1257+12|The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet]] was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.
* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Pulsation frequency (variable star timing)|Variable star timing (pulsation frequency)]]
:Like pulsars, there are some other types of stars which exhibit periodic activity. Deviations from the periodicity can sometimes be caused by a planet orbiting it.

* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Circumstellar disks|Circumstellar disks]]
:Disks of space dust surround many stars, thought to originate from collisions among asteroids and comets. The dust can be detected because it absorbs starlight and re-emits it as [[infrared]] radiation. Features in the disks may suggest the presence of planets, though this is not considered a definitive detection method.

== Orbital parameters ==
Most known extrasolar planet candidates have been discovered using indirect methods and therefore only some of their physical and orbital parameters can be determined. For example, out of the six independent [[orbital element|parameters]] that define an orbit, the radial-velocity method can determine four: [[semi-major axis]], [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], [[longitude of periastron]], and time of periastron. Two parameters remain unknown: [[inclination]] and [[longitude of the ascending node]].

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much further from their star. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU), takes 88 days for an orbit, but the smallest known orbits of exoplanets have orbital periods of only a few hours, e.g. [[Kepler-70b]]. The [[Kepler-11]] system has five of its planets in smaller orbits than Mercury's. [[Neptune]] is 30&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit it, but there are exoplanets that are thousands of AU from their star and take tens of thousands of years to orbit, e.g. [[GU Piscium b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technology.org/2014/05/14/enlightening-pisces-star-signs-lead-scientists-discovery/ |title=Enlightening Pisces star signs lead scientists to discovery |publisher=technology.org |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Radial velocity|radial-velocity]] and [[Transit method|transit]] methods are most sensitive to planets with small orbits. The earliest discoveries such as [[51 Peg b]] were [[gas giant]]s with orbits of a few days.&lt;ref name="cumming08"&gt;{{Cite journal| year=2008| title=The Keck Planet Search: Detectability and the Minimum Mass and Orbital Period Distribution of Extrasolar Planets| journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific| volume=120| issue=867|pages=531–554| arxiv=0803.3357|doi=10.1086/588487| bibcode=2008PASP..120..531C| authorlink3=Debra Fischer |last1=Cumming| first1=Andrew|last2=Butler|first2=R.

The [[Kepler spacecraft|''Kepler'' space observatory]] has found planets with even shorter orbits of only a few hours, which places them within the star's upper atmosphere or [[corona]], and these planets are Earth-sized or smaller and are probably the left-over solid cores of giant planets that have evaporated due to being so close to the star,&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, Irene (15 August 2013) [http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/time-flies-on-these-kepler-planets-130815.htm "Time Really Flies on These Kepler Planets"]. News.discovery.com&lt;/ref&gt; or even being engulfed by the star in its red-giant phase in the case of [[Kepler-70b]]. As well as evaporation, other reasons why larger planets are unlikely to survive orbits only a few hours long include orbital decay caused by [[tidal force]], tidal-inflation instability, and [[Roche lobe|Roche-lobe]] overflow.&lt;ref name="roche limit"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/773/1/L15|arxiv=1307.4080| title = The Roche limit for close-orbiting planets: Minimum density, composition constraints, and application to the 4.2 hr planet KOI 1843.03| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 773|issue=1| pages = L15| year = 2013| last1 = Rappaport | first1 = S. | last2 = Sanchis-Ojeda | first2 = R. | last3 = Rogers | first3 = L.

The [[direct imaging]] method is most sensitive to planets with large orbits, and has discovered some planets that have planet–star separations of hundreds of AU. However, protoplanetary disks are usually only around 100&amp;nbsp;AU in radius, and [[Nebular hypothesis#Giant planets|core accretion models]] predict giant planet formation to be within 10&amp;nbsp;AU, where the planets can coalesce quickly enough before the disk [[photoevaporation|evaporates]].

Most planets that have been discovered are within a couple of AU from their host star because the most used methods (radial-velocity and transit) require observation of several orbits to confirm that the planet exists and there has only been enough time since these methods were first used to cover small separations. Some planets with larger orbits have been discovered by direct imaging but there is a middle range of distances, roughly equivalent to the Solar System's gas giant region, which is largely unexplored. Direct imaging equipment for exploring that region was installed on two large telescopes that began operation in 2014, e.g. [[Gemini Planet Imager]] and [[VLT-SPHERE]]. The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#microlensing|microlensing]] method has detected a few planets in the 1–10&amp;nbsp;AU range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/?f=%22microlensing%22+IN+detection Catalog Listing]. Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt;
It appears plausible that in most exoplanetary systems, there are one or two giant planets with orbits comparable in size to those of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System. Giant planets with substantially larger orbits are now known to be rare, at least around Sun-like stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/717/2/878| title = A Uniform Analysis of 118 Stars with High-Contrast Imaging: Long-Period Extrasolar Giant Planets Are Rare Around Sun-Like Stars| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 717| issue = 2| pages = 878–896| year = 2010| last1 = Nielsen | first1 = E.

The distance of the [[#Habitability|habitable zone]] from a star depends on the type of star and this distance changes during the star's lifetime as the size and temperature of the star changes.

=== Eccentricity ===
The [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of an orbit is a measure of how elliptical (elongated) it is. All the planets of the Solar System except for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] have near-circular orbits (e&lt;0.1).&lt;ref name="marcyprogth05"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most exoplanets with orbital periods of 20 days or less have near-circular orbits, i.e. very low eccentricity. That is thought to be due to [[tidal circularization]]: reduction of eccentricity over time due to gravitational interaction between two bodies. The mostly sub-Neptune-sized planets found by the ''Kepler'' spacecraft with short orbital periods have very circular orbits.&lt;ref name="kepler1700"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=NASA's Kepler Mission Announces a Planet Bonanza, 715 New Worlds |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-mission-announces-a-planet-bonanza/ |date=26 February 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the giant planets with longer orbital periods discovered by radial-velocity methods have quite eccentric orbits. (As of July 2010, 55% of such exoplanets have eccentricities greater than 0.2, whereas 17% have eccentricities greater than 0.5.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider |first1=J. |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php|work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Moderate to high eccentricities (e&gt;0.2) of giant planets are ''not'' an observational selection effect, because a planet can be detected about equally well regardless of the eccentricity of its orbit. The statistical significance of elliptical orbits in the ensemble of observed giant planets is somewhat surprising, because current theories of [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] suggest that low-mass planets should have their [[orbital eccentricity]] circularized by gravitational interactions with the surrounding [[protoplanetary disk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Tanaka |first1=Hidekazu |title=Three-dimensional Interaction between a Planet and an Isothermal Gaseous Disk.

However, as a planet grows more massive and its interaction with the disk becomes nonlinear, it may induce eccentric motion of the surrounding disk's gas, which in turn may excite the planet's orbital eccentricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0608355 |last1=D'Angelo |first1=Gennaro |title=Evolution of Giant Planets in Eccentric Disks |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=652 |issue=2 |pages=1698–1714 |last2= Lubow |first2=Stephen H. |last3= Bate |first3=Matthew R. |year=2006 |doi=10.1086/508451 |bibcode = 2006ApJ...652.1698D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1603.00653 |last1=Teyssandier |first1=Jean |title=Growth of eccentric modes in disc-planet interactions |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=458 |issue=3 |pages=3221–3247 |last2= Ogilvie |first2=Gordon I. |year=2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw521 |bibcode = 2016MNRAS.458.3221T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1603.02544 |last1=Barker |first1=Adrian J. |title=Nonlinear hydrodynamical evolution of eccentric Keplerian discs in two dimensions: validation of secular theory |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=458 |issue=4 |pages=3739–3751 |last2= Ogilvie |first2=Gordon I. |year=2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw580 |bibcode = 2016MNRAS.458.3739B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Low eccentricities are correlated with high multiplicity (number of planets in the system) based on the analysis of planets observed by the radial-velocity method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.1073/pnas.1406545111| title = The Exoplanet Orbital Eccentricity – Multiplicity Relation and the Solar System| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 112| issue = 1| pages = 20–24| year = 2015| last1 = Limbach | first1 = M.

For weak [[Doppler spectroscopy|Doppler]] signals near the limits of the current detection ability, the eccentricity becomes poorly constrained and biased towards higher values. It is suggested that some of the high eccentricities reported for low-mass exoplanets may be overestimates, because simulations show that many observations are also consistent with two planets on circular orbits. Reported observations of single planets in moderately eccentric orbits have about a 15% chance of being a pair of planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/702/1/716| title = Which Radial Velocity Exoplanets Have Undetected Outer Companions?| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 702| issue = 1| pages = 716–723| year = 2009| last1 = Rodigas | first1 = T.

Radial velocity surveys found exoplanet orbits beyond 0.1 AU to be eccentric, particularly for large planets. Transit data obtained by the ''Kepler'' spacecraft, is consistent with the RV surveys and also revealed that smaller planets tend to have less eccentric orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1203.1631|bibcode = 2012MNRAS.425..757K |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21627.x | volume=425 |issue = 1 |title=The exoplanet eccentricity distribution from Kepler planet candidates |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |pages=757–762|year = 2012 |last1 = Kane |first1 = Stephen R. |last2 = Ciardi |first2 = David R. |last3 = Gelino |first3 = Dawn M. |last4 = von Braun |first4 = Kaspar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle ===
[[Orbital inclination]] is the angle between a planet's [[orbital plane]] and another plane of reference. For exoplanets, the inclination is usually stated with respect to an observer on Earth: the angle used is that between the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the planet's orbital plane and the line of sight from Earth to the star. Therefore, most planets observed by the [[transit method]] are close to 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, John (2008) ''Exoplanets: Detection, Formation, Properties, Habitability''.  Springer. {{ISBN|3-540-74007-4}}. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Because the word 'inclination' is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin–orbit angle or spin–orbit alignment. In most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown. The ''Kepler'' spacecraft has found a few hundred multi-planet systems and in most of these systems the planets all orbit in nearly the same plane, much like the Solar System.&lt;ref name="kepler1700" /&gt; However, a combination of astrometric and radial-velocity measurements has shown that some planetary systems contain planets whose orbital planes are significantly tilted relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=exoplanet-tilt Out of Flatland: Orbits Are Askew in a Nearby Planetary System]. ''Scientific American''. 24 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of [[hot Jupiter]]s have orbital planes substantially misaligned with their parent star's rotation. A substantial fraction of hot-Jupiters even have [[retrograde orbit]]s, meaning that they orbit in the opposite direction from the star's rotation.&lt;ref name="2010question"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/nam2010/pr10.php |title=Turning planetary theory upside down |publisher=Astro.gla.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a planet's orbit having been disturbed, it may be that the star itself flipped early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727765.200-tilting-stars-may-explain-backwards-planets.html "Tilting stars may explain backwards planets"], ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Vol. 2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periastron precession ===
[[Apsidal precession|Periastron precession]] is the rotation of a planet's orbit within the orbital plane, i.e. the axes of the ellipse change direction. In the Solar System, perturbations from other planets are the main cause, but for close-in exoplanets the largest factor can be tidal forces between the star and planet. For close-in exoplanets, the [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contribution to the precession is also significant and can be orders of magnitude larger than the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|same effect for Mercury]]. Some exoplanets have significantly [[#Eccentricity|eccentric orbits]], which makes it easier to detect the precession. The effect of general relativity can be detectable in timescales of about 10 years or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=0806.0630| bibcode = 2008ApJ...685..543J |doi = 10.1086/590549 | volume=685| issue = 1 |title=Observability of the General Relativistic Precession of Periastra in Exoplanets|journal=The Astrophysical Journal| pages=543–552| year = 2008 |last1 = Jordán |first1 = Andrés |last2 = Bakos |first2 = Gáspár Á.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nodal precession ===
[[Nodal precession]] is rotation of a planet's orbital plane. Nodal precession is more easily seen as distinct from periastron precession when the orbital plane is [[inclination|inclined]] to the star's rotation, the extreme case being a polar orbit.

[[WASP-33]] is a fast-rotating star that hosts a [[hot Jupiter]] in an almost polar orbit. The [[Quadrupole#Gravitational quadrupole|quadrupole mass moment]] and the proper [[angular momentum]] of the star are 1900 and 400 times, respectively, larger than those of the Sun.

=== Origin of spin and tilt of terrestrial planets ===
[[Impact event|Giant impacts]] have a large effect on the spin of [[terrestrial planets]]. The last few giant impacts during [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] tend to be the main determiner of a terrestrial planet's rotation rate. On average the spin [[angular velocity]] will be about 70% of the velocity that would cause the planet to break up and fly apart; the natural outcome of [[planetary embryo]] impacts at speeds slightly larger than [[escape velocity]]. In later stages terrestrial planet spin is also affected by impacts with [[planetesimal]]s. During the giant impact stage, the thickness of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is far larger than the size of planetary embryos so collisions are equally likely to come from any direction in three-dimensions. This results in the [[axial tilt]] of accreted planets ranging from 0 to 180 degrees with any direction as likely as any other with both [[retrograde and prograde motion|prograde and retrograde]] spins equally probable. Therefore, prograde spin with a small axial tilt, common for the Solar System's terrestrial planets except Venus, is not common in general for terrestrial planets built by giant impacts. The initial axial tilt of a planet determined by giant impacts can be substantially changed by stellar tides if the planet is close to its star and by satellite tides if the planet has a large satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |arxiv=1312.1689|bibcode = 2014prpl.conf..595R |doi = 10.2458/azu_uapress_9780816531240-ch026 | title=Terrestrial Planet Formation at Home and Abroad |journal=Protostars and Planets VI|page = 595 |year = 2014 |last1 = Raymond |first1 = S.

=== Tidal effects ===
For most planets, the rotation period and [[axial tilt]] (also called obliquity) are not known, but a large number of planets have been detected with very short orbits (where tidal effects are greater) that will probably have reached an [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] rotation that can be predicted (''i.e.'' [[tidally locked|tidal lock]], [[Mercury (planet)#Spin–orbit resonance|spin–orbit resonances]], and [[Retrograde and prograde motion#Planets|non-resonant equilibria such as retrograde rotation]]).&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

Gravitational tides tend to reduce the axial tilt to zero but over a longer timescale than the rotation rate reaches equilibrium. However, the presence of multiple planets in a system can cause axial tilt to be captured in a resonance called a [[Cassini state]]. There are small oscillations around this state and in the case of [[Mars]] these axial tilt variations are chaotic.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

[[Hot Jupiter]]s' close proximity to their host star means that their spin–orbit evolution is mostly due to the star's gravity and not the other effects. Hot Jupiters' rotation rate is not thought to be captured into spin–orbit resonance because of the way in which such a fluid-body reacts to tides; a planet like this therefore slows down into synchronous rotation if its orbit is circular, or, alternatively, it slows down into a non-synchronous rotation if its orbit is eccentric. Hot Jupiters are likely to evolve towards zero axial tilt even if they had been in a Cassini state during planetary migration when they were further from their star. Hot Jupiters' orbits will become more circular over time, however the presence of other planets in the system on eccentric orbits, even ones as small as Earth and as far away as the habitable zone, can continue to maintain the eccentricity of the Hot Jupiter so that the length of time for [[tidal circularization]] can be billions instead of millions of years.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

The rotation rate of planet [[HD 80606 b]] is predicted to be about 1.9 days.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt; HD 80606 b avoids spin–orbit resonance because it is a gas giant. The eccentricity of its orbit means that it avoids becoming tidally locked.

=== Mass ===
When a planet is found by the [[radial-velocity method]], its [[#Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle|orbital inclination]] ''i'' is unknown and can range from 0 to 90 degrees. The method is unable to determine the [[true mass]] (''M'') of the planet, but rather gives a [[minimum mass|lower limit for its mass]], ''M''&amp;nbsp;sin''i''. In a few cases an apparent exoplanet may be a more massive object such as a brown dwarf or red dwarf. However, the probability of a small value of i (say less than 30 degrees, which would give a true mass at least double the observed lower limit) is relatively low (1−{{radic|3}}/2 ≈ 13%) and hence most planets will have true masses fairly close to the observed lower limit.&lt;ref name="cumming08" /&gt;

If a planet's orbit is nearly perpendicular to the line of vision (i.e. ''i'' close to 90°), a planet can be detected through the [[transit method]]. The inclination will then be known, and the inclination combined with ''M''&amp;nbsp;sin''i'' from radial-velocity observations will give the planet's true mass.

Also, [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations and dynamical considerations in multiple-planet systems can sometimes provide an upper limit to the planet's true mass.

The mass of a transiting exoplanet can also be determined from the transmission spectrum of its atmosphere, as it can be used to constrain independently the atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and [[scale height]].&lt;ref name="JulienSeager2013"&gt;{{cite journal| last=de Wit| first=Julien|author2=Seager, S.| title=Constraining Exoplanet Mass from Transmission Spectroscopy| journal=Science| date=19 December 2013| volume=342| issue=6165|pages=1473–1477| arxiv=1401.6181| doi=10.1126/science.1245450| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6165/1473|pmid=24357312| bibcode = 2013Sci...342.1473D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transit-timing variation]] can also be used to find a planet's mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/592230| title = Mass and Orbit Determination from Transit Timing Variations of Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 688| issue = 1| pages = 636–646| year = 2008| last1 = Nesvorný | first1 = D. | last2 = Morbidelli | first2 = A. | bibcode=2008ApJ...688..636N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radius, density, and bulk composition ===
Prior to recent results from the ''Kepler'' space observatory, most confirmed planets were [[gas giant]]s comparable in size to Jupiter or larger because they are most easily detected. However, the planets detected by ''Kepler'' are mostly between the size of Neptune and the size of Earth.&lt;ref name="kepler1700" /&gt;

If a planet is detectable by both the radial-velocity and the transit methods, then both its true mass and its radius can be determined, as well as its [[density]]. Planets with low density are inferred to be composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], whereas planets of intermediate density are inferred to have water as a major constituent. A planet of high density is inferred to be rocky, like Earth and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System.

Gaseous planets that are hot is because they are close to their star, or because they are still hot from their formation and are expanded by the heat. For colder gas planets, there is a maximum radius which is slightly larger than Jupiter which occurs when the mass reaches a few Jupiter-masses. Adding mass beyond this point causes the radius to shrink.&lt;ref name="whatbasribrown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seager, S. and Lissauer, J. J.

==== Super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and gas dwarfs ====
{{Main article|Super-Earth|Mini-Neptune|Helium planet|Gas dwarf}}
If a planet has a radius and/or mass between that of Earth and Neptune, then there is a question about whether the planet is rocky like Earth, a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune, a small planet with a hydrogen/helium envelope (mini-Jupiter), or of some other composition.

Some of the Kepler transiting planets with radii in the range of 1–4 Earth radii have had their masses measured by radial-velocity or transit-timing methods. The calculated densities show that up to 1.5 Earth radii, these planets are rocky and that density increases with increasing radius due to gravitational compression. However, between 1.5 and 4 Earth radii the density decreases with increasing radius. This indicates that above 1.5 Earth radii, planets tend to have increasing amounts of volatiles and gas. Despite this general trend, there is a wide range of masses at a given radius, which could be because gas planets can have rocky cores of different masses and compositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/783/1/L6| title = The Mass-Radius Relation for 65 Exoplanets Smaller Than 4 Earth Radii| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 783| issue = 1| pages = L6| year = 2014| last1 = Weiss | first1 = L.

Excluding close-in planets that have lost their gas envelope due to stellar irradiation, studies of the [[metallicity]] of stars suggest a dividing line of 1.7 Earth radii between rocky planets and gas dwarfs, then another dividing line at 3.9 Earth radii between gas dwarfs and gas giants. These dividing lines are statistical trends and do not apply universally, because there are many other factors besides metallicity that affect planet formation, including distance from star – there may be larger rocky planets that formed at larger distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature13254| pmid = 24870544| title = Three regimes of extrasolar planet radius inferred from host star metallicities| journal = Nature| volume = 509| issue = 7502| pages = 593–595| year = 2014| last1 = Buchhave | first1 = L.

An independent reanalysis of the data suggests that there are no such dividing lines and that there is a continuum of planet formation between 1 and 4 Earth radii and no reason to suspect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines whether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1501.05953|bibcode = 2015ApJ...799L..26S |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/799/2/L26 | volume=799 |issue = 2 |title=A Continuum of Planet Formation between 1 and 4 Earth Radii |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |pages=L26|year = 2015 |last1 = Schlaufman |first1 = Kevin C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done in 2016 based on over 300 planets suggest that most objects over approximately two Earth masses collect significant hydrogen–helium envelopes, meaning rocky super-Earths may be rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1603.08614| title=Probabilistic Forecasting of the Masses and Radii of Other Worlds| author=Jingjing Chen| author2=David M.

[[Transit-timing variation]] measurements indicate that Kepler-52b, Kepler-52c and Kepler-57b have maximum masses between 30 and 100 times that of Earth, although the actual masses could be much lower. With radii about 2 Earth radii in size, they might have densities larger than that of an [[iron planet]] of the same size. They orbit very close to their stars, so they could each be the remnant core ([[chthonian planet]]) of an evaporated [[gas giant]] or [[brown dwarf]]. If a remnant core is massive enough it could remain in such a state for billions of years despite having lost the atmospheric mass.&lt;ref&gt;Mocquet, A.; Grasset, O.; Sotin, C.

Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars ([[B-type main-sequence star|B-type]] and [[O-type main-sequence star|O-type]] stars; 5–120 solar masses), where the [[protoplanetary disk]] would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high [[UV radiation]] and [[stellar wind|winds]] that could [[Photoevaporation|photoevaporate]] the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/521346| title = Mass‐Radius Relationships for Solid Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 669| issue = 2| pages = 1279–1297| year = 2007| last1 = Seager | first1 = S.| last2 = Kuchner | first2 = M.| last3 = Hier‐Majumder | first3 = C.

For comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13-Jupiter-mass limit used in the [[IAU]]'s working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold" /&gt;

Cold planets have a maximum radius because adding more mass at that point causes the planet to compress under the weight instead of increasing the radius. The maximum radius for solid planets is lower than the maximum radius for gas planets.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold"/&gt;

=== Shape ===
When the size of a planet is described using its radius, this is approximating the shape by a sphere. However, the rotation of a planet causes it to be flattened at the poles; so the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius, making it closer to an [[oblate spheroid]]. The oblateness of [[transit method|transiting]] exoplanets will affect the transit light curves. At the limits of current technology it has been possible to show that [[HD 189733b]] is less oblate than [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="CarterWinn"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/709/2/1219| title = Empirical Constraints on the Oblateness of an Exoplanet| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 709| issue = 2| pages = 1219–1229| year = 2010| last1 = Carter | first1 = J.

If the planet is close to its star, then gravitational tides will elongate the planet in the direction of the star, making the planet closer to a [[triaxial ellipsoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015811| title = Distorted, nonspherical transiting planets: Impact on the transit depth and on the radius determination| journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics| volume = 528| pages = A41| year = 2011| last1 = Leconte | first1 = J.| last2 = Lai | first2 = D.| last3 = Chabrier | first3 = G. | bibcode=2011A&amp;A...528A..41L|arxiv = 1101.2813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because tidal deformation is along a line between the planet and the star, it is difficult to detect from transit photometry; it will have an effect on the transit light curves an order of magnitude less than that caused by rotational deformation even in cases where tidal deformation is larger than rotational deformation (as is the case for tidally locked [[hot Jupiter]]s).&lt;ref name="CarterWinn" /&gt; Material rigidity of rocky planets and rocky cores of gas planets will cause further deviations from the aforementioned shapes.&lt;ref name="CarterWinn" /&gt; Thermal tides caused by unevenly irradiated surfaces are another factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=0901.0735 |last1=Arras |first1=Phil |title=Thermal Tides in Short Period Exoplanets |last2=Socrates |first2=Aristotle |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface composition ===
Surface features can be distinguished from atmospheric features by comparing emission and reflection spectroscopy with [[transmission spectroscopy]]. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky surfaces, and near-infrared may identify magma oceans or high-temperature lavas, hydrated silicate surfaces and water ice, giving an unambiguous method to distinguish between rocky and gaseous exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1204.1544|bibcode = 2012ApJ...752....7H |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/752/1/7 | volume=752|issue = 1 | title=Theoretical Spectra of Terrestrial Exoplanet Surfaces| journal=The Astrophysical Journal| page=7|year = 2012 |last1 = Hu |first1 = Renyu |last2 = Ehlmann |first2 = Bethany L. |last3 = Seager |first3 = Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperature of an exoplanet can be estimated by measuring the intensity of the light it receives from its parent star. For example, the planet [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly −220&amp;nbsp;°C (50 K). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they depend on the planet's usually unknown [[albedo]], and because factors such as the [[greenhouse effect]] may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For example, the planet [[HD 189733b]] has been estimated to have an average temperature of 1,205 K (932&amp;nbsp;°C) on its dayside and 973 K (700&amp;nbsp;°C) on its nightside.&lt;ref name="knutson_charbonneau07"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature05782 | url=http://www.ucolick.org/~jfortney/papers/Knutson07.pdf|arxiv=0705.0993 | pmid=17495920 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..183K  | title = A map of the day–night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7141 | pages = 183–6 | year = 2007 | last1 = Knutson | first1 = H.

=== Habitable zone ===
{{main article|Habitable zone}}
The habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on a planet; that is, not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star, so that the habitable zone can be at different distances for different stars. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: [[desert planet]]s (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

Planetary [[#Rotation and axial tilt|rotation rate]] is one of the major factors determining the [[#Atmospheric circulation|circulation of the atmosphere]] and hence the pattern of clouds: slowly rotating planets create thick clouds that [[albedo|reflect]] more and so can be habitable much closer to their star.

=== Ice ages and snowball states ===

The outer edge of the habitable zone is where planets are completely frozen, but  planets well inside the habitable zone can periodically become frozen. If orbital fluctuations or other causes produce cooling then this creates more ice, but ice reflects sunlight causing even more cooling, creating a feedback loop until the planet is completely or nearly completely frozen. When the surface is frozen, this stops [[Solution weathering|carbon dioxide weathering]], resulting in a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from volcanic emissions.

=== Tidal heating ===
If a planet has an eccentric orbit, then [[tidal heating]] can provide another source of energy besides stellar radiation. This means that eccentric planets in the radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water. Tides also [[tidal circularization|circularize]] orbits over time so there could be planets in the habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because they used to have eccentric orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ast.2012.0851| pmid = 23537135| title = Tidal Venuses: Triggering a Climate Catastrophe via Tidal Heating| journal = Astrobiology| volume = 13| issue = 3| pages = 225–250| year = 2013| last1 = Barnes | first1 = R. | last2 = Mullins | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldblatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Meadows | first4 = V.

{{Certainty}}
{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
Broadly speaking, '''fallibilism''' (from [[Medieval Latin]]: ''fallibilis'', "liable to err") is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] claim that no belief can have justification which guarantees the [[truth]] of the belief.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hetherington, "Fallibilism," ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallibil/&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all fallibilists believe that fallibilism extends to all domains of [[knowledge]].

==Usage==
The term "fallibilism" is used in a variety of senses in contemporary [[epistemology]]. The term was coined in the late nineteenth century by the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. By "fallibilism", Peirce meant the view that "people cannot attain absolute certainty concerning questions of fact."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, "The Scientific Attitude and Fallibilism," in Justus Buchler, ed., ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce''. New York: Dover, 1955, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists of knowledge have used the term differently. Thus, "fallibilism" has been used to describe the claim that:

# No beliefs can be conclusively justified.&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, "Fallibilism"; Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Knowledge does not require certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Feldman. ''Epistemology''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2003, p. 122; Alvin I. Goldman and Matthew McGrath, ''Epistemology: A Contemporary Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Almost no basic (that is, non-inferred) beliefs are certain or conclusively justified.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Pojman, ''What Can We Know? An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge'', 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2001, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some theorists embrace global versions of fallibilism (claiming that no human beliefs have truth-guaranteeing justification), while others restrict fallibilism to particular areas of human inquiry, such as [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[science]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, "Fallibilism", Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that all scientific claims are provisional and open to revision in the light of new evidence is widely taken for granted in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas S.]] ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. 3rd ed. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many forms of [[skepticism]], fallibilism does not imply that we have no knowledge; fallibilists typically deny that knowledge requires absolute certainty. Rather, fallibilism is an admission that, because empirical knowledge can be revised by further observation, any of the things we take as empirical knowledge [[falsifiability|might turn out to be false]].

Some fallibilists make an exception for things that are necessarily true (such as [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[logic]]al truths). Others remain fallibilists about these types of truths as well. [[Susan Haack]], following [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], has argued that to refrain from extending fallibilism to logical truths—due to the necessity or [[A priori and a posteriori|a prioricity]] of such truths—mistakes "fallibilism" as a predicate on propositions, when it is a predicate on people or agents:&lt;ref&gt;Haack, ''Philosophy of Logics'', pp. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One needs, first, to get clear just what is meant by the claim that logic is revisable - and, equally importantly, what is not meant by it. What I mean, at any rate, is not that the truths of logic might have been otherwise than they are, but that the truths of logic might be other than we take them to be, i.e. we could be mistaken about what the truths of logic are, e.g. in supposing that the law of excluded middle is one such.

So a better way to put the question, because it makes its epistemological character clearer, is this: does fallibilism extend to logic? Even this formulation, however, needs further refinement, for the nature of fallibilism is often misunderstood.||}}

The [[critical rationalism|critical rationalist]] [[Hans Albert]] argues that it is impossible to prove any truth with certainty, even in logic and mathematics. This argument is called the [[Münchhausen trilemma]].

==Proponents==
Historically, fallibilism is most strongly associated with Charles Sanders Peirce, [[John Dewey]], and other [[Pragmatism|pragmatists]], who use it in their attacks on [[foundationalism]] (the view that any system of rationally justified beliefs must rest on a set of properly basic beliefs—that is, beliefs that are accepted, and rightly accepted, directly, without any evidence or rational support whatsoever). However, fallibilist themes are already present in the views of both [[Philosophical_skepticism#Ancient_Greek_skepticism|ancient Greek skeptics]], such as [[Carneades]], and modern skeptics, such as [[David Hume]]. Most versions of ancient and modern skepticism, excepting [[Pyrrhonism]], depend on claims (e.g., that knowledge requires certainty, or that people cannot know that skeptical hypotheses are false) that fallibilists deny.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, ''Epistemology'', pp. 122-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proponent of fallibilism is [[Karl Popper]], who builds his [[theory of knowledge]], [[critical rationalism]], on [[falsifiability]]. Fallibilism has been employed by Quine to attack, among other things, the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] statements.&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism," http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral fallibilism==
Moral fallibilism is a specific subset of the broader [[epistemology|epistemological]] fallibilism outlined above. In the debate between moral [[Moral subjectivism|subjectivism]] and moral [[Moral universalism|objectivism]], moral fallibilism holds out a third plausible stance: that objectively true [[morality|moral]] standards may exist, but they cannot be reliably or conclusively determined by humans. This avoids the problems associated with the relativism of subjectivism by retaining the idea that morality is not a matter of mere opinion, while offering an account for the conflict between differing objective moralities. Notable proponents of such views are [[Isaiah Berlin]] ([[value pluralism]]) and [[Bernard Williams]] ([[perspectivism]]).

==Criticism==
Nearly all philosophers today are fallibilists in some sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, "Fallibilism," Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Few would claim that knowledge requires absolute certainty, or deny that scientific claims are revisable (though some philosophers recently argue for some version of infallibilist knowledge&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite journal |last1=Moon |first1=Andrew |title=Warrant does entail truth |journal=Synthese |volume=184 |page=287-297 |doi=10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2}}; {{cite journal |last1=Dutant |first1=Julien |title=How to be an infallibilist |journal=Philosophical Issues |date=2016 |volume=26 |pages=148-171 |doi=10.1111/phis.12085}}; and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Knowledge, hope, and fallibilism |journal=Synthese |date=2018 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1007/s11229-018-1794-8 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-018-1794-8 |accessdate=25 July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). But many philosophers would challenge "global" forms of fallibilism, such as the claim that no beliefs are conclusively justified. Historically, many Western philosophers from [[Plato]] to Augustine to [[René Descartes]] have argued that some human beliefs are infallibly known. Plausible candidates for infallible beliefs include beliefs about logical truths ("Either Jones is a Democrat or Jones is not a Democrat"), beliefs about immediate appearances ("It seems that I see a patch of blue"), and incorrigible beliefs (i.e., beliefs that are true in virtue of being believed, such as Descartes' "I think, therefore I am"). Many others, however, have taken even these types of beliefs to be fallible.&lt;ref&gt;Haack, "Philosophy of Logics", Chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [This next bit needs some kind of citation, it comes out of nowhere]
Though some contemporary philosophers would deny that any of these sorts of beliefs are conclusively justified, most adhere to the traditional view.

In the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], display of male nudity was contentious and the Queen herself was said to find it shocking. The museum commissioned this fig leaf and kept it in readiness in case of a visit by the Queen or other female dignitaries: the fig leaf was then hung on the figure using a pair of hooks. Today, the fig leaf is no longer used, but it is displayed in a case at the back of the cast's plinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The expression "'''fig leaf'''" is widely used figuratively to convey the covering up of an act or an object that is embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance, a [[metaphor]]ical reference to the [[Biblical]] [[Book of Genesis]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] used [[ficus|fig]] leaves to cover their [[nudity]] after eating the forbidden fruit from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Some paintings and statues have the genitals of their subjects covered by a representation of an actual fig leaf or similar object, either as part of the work or added afterwards for perceived modesty.

==History==

In [[Ancient Greek art]], male nakedness, including the [[genitals]], was common, although the female [[Mons pubis|vulval area]] &lt;!--anyone offended by this link may substitute [[groin]]--&gt; was generally covered in art for public display.  This tradition continued in [[Ancient Roman art]] until the conversion of the [[Roman Empire]] to [[Christianity]], when [[heroic nudity]] vanished.  During the [[Middle Ages]], only the unfortunate (most often the [[damnation|damned]]) were usually shown naked, although the depictions were then often rather explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Clark |title=The Nude, A Study in Ideal Form |year=1956 |isbn=0-691-01788-3 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam and Eve were often shown wearing fig or other leaves, following the Biblical description.  This was especially a feature of [[Northern Renaissance]] art.

From about 1530, the developing reaction to [[Renaissance]] freedoms and excesses that led to the [[Council of Trent]] also led to a number of artworks, especially in churches or public places, being altered to reduce the amount of nudity on display.  Often, as in the famous case of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgement]]'', drapery or extra branches from any nearby bush was used. This has been dubbed the "fig leaf campaign". For free-standing statues this did not work well, and carved or cast fig leaves were sometimes added, such as with the plaster copy of Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' displayed in [[Victorian era]] [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David's Fig Leaf|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=2017-02-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603175714/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|archivedate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adam and Eve panels on the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', already equipped with fig leaves by [[Jan van Eyck]],  were simply replaced with 19th-century panels copying the figures but clothed.   Many of these alterations have since been reversed, damaging some of the statues.

[[Eugen Sandow]], often considered the first modern-day [[bodybuilder]], was an admirer of the human physique, and in addition to strongman [[sideshow]]s; he performed "muscle displays" by posing in the nude — save for a fig leaf that he would don in imitation of statues he had seen in [[Italy]] as a boy.&lt;ref name=sandow&gt;{{cite web |last= Anderson |first= R.

==Metaphorical use==

The expression ''fig leaf'' has a [[pejorative]] [[metaphor]]ical sense meaning a flimsy or minimal cover for anything or behaviour that might be considered shameful, with the implication that the cover is only a token gesture and the truth is obvious to all who choose to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7746088.stm |title=Cable derides 'fig leaf' tax cuts |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-09-16 | date=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A metaphorical fig leaf is something visible but innocuous, as against a [[coverup]] in which the existence of something may be entirely hidden.

In the context of negotiation, an offer might be characterized as a "fig leaf" if that offer is actually a ploy to conceal a sinister plan.

'''Förster resonance energy transfer''' ('''FRET'''), '''fluorescence resonance energy transfer''' ('''FRET'''), '''resonance energy transfer''' ('''RET''') or '''electronic energy transfer''' ('''EET''') is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two light-sensitive molecules ([[chromophore]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ping-Chin |last1=Cheng |chapter=The Contrast Formation in Optical Microscopy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2maxdEXFNoC&amp;pg=PA162 |pages=162–206 |editor1-last=Pawley |editor1-first=James B. |title=Handbook Of Biological Confocal Microscopy |date=2006 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-387-25921-5 |edition=3rd |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-45524-2_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore through nonradiative [[dipole–dipole coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helms |first=Volkhard |chapter=Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Tavvybv5UwC&amp;pg=PA202 |title=Principles of Computational Cell Biology |date=2008 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |isbn=978-3-527-31555-0 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of this energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor, making FRET extremely sensitive to small changes in distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Daniel C. |chapter=Applications of Spectrophotometry |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIgLJ1De_jwC&amp;pg=PA419 |title=Quantitative Chemical Analysis |date=2010 |publisher=W.

Measurements of FRET efficiency can be used to determine if two [[fluorophore]]s are within a certain distance of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zheng |first=Jie |chapter=Spectroscopy-Based Quantitative Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Analysis |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2k-T_1DPcwC&amp;pg=PA65 |title=Ion Channels: Methods and Protocols |series=Methods in Molecular Biology, Volume 337 |date=2006 |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |isbn=978-1-59745-095-9 |pages=65–77 |editor1-first=James D. |editor1-last=Stockand |editor2-first=Mark S. |editor2-last=Shapiro |doi=10.1385/1-59745-095-2:65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such measurements are used as a research tool in fields including biology and chemistry.

FRET is analogous to [[Near and far field|near-field]] [[Near field communication|communication]], in that the radius of interaction is much smaller than the [[Light|wavelength]] of light emitted. In the near-field region, the excited chromophore emits a [[virtual photon]] that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a ''radiationless'' mechanism. [[Quantum electrodynamics|Quantum electrodynamical]] calculations have been used to determine that radiationless (FRET) and [[radiative transfer|radiative energy transfer]] are the short- and long-range [[asymptote]]s of a single unified mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0301-0104(89)87019-3 |title=A unified theory of radiative and radiationless molecular energy transfer |date=1989 |last1=Andrews |first1=David L. |journal=Chemical Physics |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=195–201 |bibcode=1989CP....135..195A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/25/6/017 |title=Virtual photons, dipole fields and energy transfer: A quantum electrodynamical approach |year=2004 |last1=Andrews |first1=David L |last2=Bradshaw |first2=David S |journal=European Journal of Physics |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=845–858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[Image:Concept of FRET.png|thumb|300px|right|Cartoon diagram of the concept of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).]]

Förster resonance energy transfer is named after the German scientist [[Theodor Förster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/andp.19484370105 |title=Zwischenmolekulare Energiewanderung und Fluoreszenz |trans-title=Intermolecular energy migration and fluorescence |date=1948 |last1=Förster |first1=Theodor |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=437 |bibcode=1948AnP...437...55F |pages=55–75 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both chromophores are fluorescent, the term "fluorescence resonance energy transfer" is often used instead, although the energy is not actually transferred by [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]].&lt;ref name="Wiley-VCH"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bernard |last1=Valeur |first2=Mario |last2=Berberan-Santos |chapter=Excitation Energy Transfer|title=Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications, 2nd ed. |date=2012 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |isbn=9783527328376 |pages=213–261 |doi=10.1002/9783527650002.ch8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympusfluoview.com/applications/fretintro.html FRET microscopy tutorial from Olympus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629220328/http://www.olympusfluoview.com/applications/fretintro.html |date=2012-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid an erroneous interpretation of the phenomenon that is always a nonradiative transfer of energy (even when occurring between two fluorescent chromophores), the name "Förster resonance energy transfer" is preferred to "fluorescence resonance energy transfer"; however, the latter enjoys common usage in scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Glossary of Terms Used in Photochemistry |edition=3rd |date=2007 |publisher=IUPAC |page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that FRET is not restricted to fluorescence. It can occur in connection with phosphorescence as well.&lt;ref name="Wiley-VCH"/&gt;

==Theoretical basis==
The FRET efficiency (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;) is the [[quantum yield]] of the energy transfer transition, i.e. the fraction of energy transfer event occurring per donor excitation event:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moens|first=Pierre|title=Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer spectroscopy|url=http://www.anatomy.usyd.edu.au/mru/fret/abot.html#frete|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{k_\text{ET}}{k_f+k_\text{ET}+\sum{k_i}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_\text{ET}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of energy transfer, &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; the radiative decay rate, and the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; are the rate constants of any other de-excitation pathways.&lt;ref name=SchaufeleDemarcoDay2005p72-94&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fred |last1=Schaufele |first2=Ignacio |last2=Demarco |first3=Richard N. |last3=Day |chapter=FRET Imaging in the Wide-Field Microscope |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0aawJ6sX-sC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72–94 |editor1-first=Ammasi |editor1-last=Periasamy |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Day |date=2005 |title=Molecular Imaging: FRET Microscopy and Spectroscopy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-517720-6 |doi=10.1016/B978-019517720-6.50013-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRET efficiency depends on many physical parameters that can be grouped as 1) the distance between the donor and the acceptor (typically in the range of 1–10&amp;nbsp;nm), 2) the spectral overlap of the donor [[emission spectrum]] and the acceptor [[absorption spectrum]], and 3) the relative orientation of the donor emission [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] and the acceptor absorption dipole moment.

&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; depends on the donor-to-acceptor separation distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with an inverse 6th-power law due to the dipole-dipole coupling mechanism:
: &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{1+(r/R_0)^6}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; being the Förster distance of this pair of donor and acceptor, i.e. the distance at which the energy transfer efficiency is 50%.&lt;ref name=SchaufeleDemarcoDay2005p72-94/&gt;
The Förster distance depends on the overlap [[integral]] of the donor emission spectrum with the acceptor absorption spectrum and their mutual molecular orientation as expressed by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Förster | first1 = Th. | title = Modern Quantum Chemistry.

where &lt;math&gt;Q_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the fluorescence [[quantum yield]] of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; is the dipole orientation factor, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium, &lt;math&gt;N_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]], and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral overlap integral calculated as

where &lt;math&gt;f_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the donor emission spectrum, &lt;math&gt;\overline{f_\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt; is the donor emission spectrum normalized to an area of 1, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceptor [[molar extinction coefficient]] normally obtained from an absorption spectrum.&lt;ref name="Demchenko2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Demchenko |first=Alexander P. |chapter=Fluorescence Detection Techniques |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMARxPxkE7EC&amp;pg=PA65 |title=Introduction to Fluorescence Sensing |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-1-4020-9002-8 |pages=65–118 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9003-5_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The orientation factor ''κ'' is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \kappa = \hat\mu_\text{A} \cdot \hat\mu_\text{D} - 3 (\hat\mu_\text{D} \cdot \hat R) (\hat\mu_\text{A} \cdot \hat R), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the normalized transition dipole moment of the respective fluorophore, and &lt;math&gt;\hat R&lt;/math&gt; denotes the normalized inter-fluorophore displacement.
&lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; = 2/3 is often assumed. This value is obtained when both dyes are freely rotating and can be considered to be isotropically oriented during the excited state lifetime. If either dye is fixed or not free to rotate, then &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; = 2/3 will not be a valid assumption. In most cases, however, even modest reorientation of the dyes results in enough orientational averaging that &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; = 2/3 does not result in a large error in the estimated energy transfer distance due to the sixth-power dependence of &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt;. Even when &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; is quite different from 2/3, the error can be associated with a shift in &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and thus determinations of changes in relative distance for a particular system are still valid. Fluorescent proteins do not reorient on a timescale that is faster than their fluorescence lifetime. In this case 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 4.&lt;ref name="Demchenko2008" /&gt;

The FRET efficiency relates to the quantum yield and the fluorescence lifetime of the donor molecule as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Irina |last1=Majoul |first2=Yiwei |last2=Jia |first3=Rainer |last3=Duden |chapter=Practical Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer or Molecular Nanobioscopy of Living Cells |pages=788–808 |editor-last=Pawley |editor1-first=James B. |title=Handbook Of Biological Confocal Microscopy |date=2006 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-387-25921-5 |edition=3rd |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-45524-2_45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - \tau'_\text{D}/\tau_\text{D},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{D}'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence lifetimes in the presence and absence of an acceptor respectively, or as
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - F_\text{D}'/F_\text{D},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_\text{D}'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence intensities with and without an acceptor respectively.

==Experimental confirmation of the Förster resonance energy transfer theory==
The inverse sixth-power distance dependence of Förster resonance energy transfer was experimentally confirmed by [[Meir Wilchek|Wilchek]], Edelhoch and Brand&lt;ref&gt;ISRAEL ''JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY'' Vol. 1. No. Sa. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelhoch | first1 = H. | last2 = Brand | first2 = L. | last3 = Wilchek | first3 = M. | year = 1967 | title = Fluorescence studies with tryptophyl peptides | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 547–559 | doi = 10.1021/bi00854a024 | pmid = 6047638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using tryptophyl peptides.

However, a lot of contradictions of special experiments with the theory was observed. The reason is that the theory has approximate character and gives overestimated distances of 50–100 ångströms.&lt;ref&gt;Vekshin N. L. Energy Transfer in Macromolecules, SPIE, 1997; Vekshin N. L. Photonics of Biopolymers, Springer, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods to measure FRET efficiency==
In fluorescence [[microscopy]], fluorescence [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]], as well as in [[molecular biology]], FRET is a useful tool to quantify molecular dynamics in [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], such as [[protein]]-protein interactions, protein–[[DNA]] interactions, and protein conformational changes. For monitoring the complex formation between two molecules, one of them is labeled with a donor and the other with an acceptor.  The FRET efficiency is measured and used to identify interactions between the labeled complexes. There are several ways of measuring the FRET efficiency by monitoring changes in the fluorescence emitted by the donor or the acceptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Protocol |url=http://coil.bio.ed.ac.uk/Protocols/FRET.htm |publisher=Wellcome Trust |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717083912/http://coil.bio.ed.ac.uk/Protocols/FRET.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitized emission===
One method of measuring FRET efficiency is to measure the variation in acceptor emission intensity.&lt;ref name=Clegg2009p1-57/&gt; When the donor and acceptor are in proximity (1–10&amp;nbsp;nm) due to the interaction of the two molecules, the acceptor emission will increase because of the [[intermolecular]] FRET from the donor to the acceptor. For monitoring protein conformational changes, the target protein is labeled with a donor and an acceptor at two loci. When a twist or bend of the protein brings the change in the distance or relative orientation of the donor and acceptor, FRET change is observed. If a molecular interaction or a protein conformational change is dependent on [[ligand]] binding, this FRET technique is applicable to fluorescent indicators for the ligand detection.

===Photobleaching FRET===
FRET efficiencies can also be inferred from the [[photobleaching]] rates of the donor in the presence and absence of an acceptor.&lt;ref name=Clegg2009p1-57/&gt; This method can be performed on most fluorescence microscopes; one simply shines the excitation light (of a frequency that will excite the donor but not the acceptor significantly) on specimens with and without the acceptor fluorophore and monitors the donor fluorescence (typically separated from acceptor fluorescence using a [[bandpass filter]]) over time. The timescale is that of photobleaching, which is seconds to minutes, with fluorescence in each curve being given by

:&lt;math&gt;\text{background} + \text{constant} \cdot e^{-\text{time}/\tau_\text{pb}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{pb}&lt;/math&gt; is the photobleaching decay time constant and depends on whether the acceptor is present or not. Since photobleaching consists in the permanent inactivation of excited fluorophores, resonance energy transfer from an excited donor to an acceptor fluorophore prevents the photobleaching of that donor fluorophore, and thus high FRET efficiency leads to a longer photobleaching decay time constant:

:&lt;math&gt; E = 1 - \tau_\text{pb}/\tau_\text{pb}',&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{pb}'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{pb}&lt;/math&gt; are the photobleaching decay time constants of the donor in the presence and in the absence of the acceptor respectively. (Notice that the fraction is the reciprocal of that used for lifetime measurements).

This technique was introduced by Jovin in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=János |last1=Szöllősi |first2=Denis R. |last2=Alexander |chapter=The Application of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer to the Investigation of Phosphatases |pages=203–24 |editor1-first=Susanne |editor1-last=Klumpp |editor2-first=Josef |editor2-last=Krieglstein |title=Protein Phosphatases |series=Methods in Enzymology, Volume 366 |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-12-182269-9 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(03)66017-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use of an entire curve of points to extract the time constants can give it accuracy advantages over the other methods. Also, the fact that time measurements are over seconds rather than nanoseconds makes it easier than fluorescence lifetime measurements, and because photobleaching decay rates do not generally depend on donor concentration (unless acceptor saturation is an issue), the careful control of concentrations needed for intensity measurements is not needed. It is, however, important to keep the illumination the same for the with- and without-acceptor measurements, as photobleaching increases markedly with more intense incident light.

===Lifetime measurements===
FRET efficiency can also be determined from the change in the fluorescence [[Fluorescence#Lifetime|lifetime]] of the donor.&lt;ref name=Clegg2009p1-57/&gt; The lifetime of the donor will decrease in the presence of the acceptor. Lifetime measurements of the FRET-donor are used in [[fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy]] (FLIM).

==Fluorophores used for FRET==
[[File:Proteolytic cleavage of a Dual-GFP fusion FRET-pair.png|thumb|250px|If the linker is intact, excitation at the absorbance wavelength of CFP (414nm) causes emission by YFP (525nm) due to FRET. If the linker is cleaved by a protease, FRET is abolished and emission is at the CFP wavelength (475nm).]]

===CFP-YFP pairs===
One common pair fluorophores for biological use is a [[cyan fluorescent protein]] (CFP) – [[yellow fluorescent protein]] (YFP) pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Periasamy|first=Ammasi|title=Fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy: a mini review|journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics|date=July 2001|volume=6|issue=3|pages=287–291|doi=10.1117/1.1383063|pmid=11516318|bibcode = 2001JBO.....6..287P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are color variants of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP). Labeling with organic fluorescent dyes requires purification, chemical modification, and intracellular injection of a host protein. GFP variants can be attached to a host protein by [[genetic engineering]] which can be more convenient. Additionally, a fusion of CFP and YFP linked by a [[protease]] cleavage sequence can be used as a cleavage assay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=AW|author2=Daugherty, PS|title=Evolutionary optimization of fluorescent proteins for intracellular FRET.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=March 2005|volume=23|issue=3|pages=355–60|pmid=15696158|doi=10.1038/nbt1066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BRET===
A limitation of FRET is the requirement for external illumination to initiate the fluorescence transfer, which can lead to background noise in the results from direct excitation of the acceptor or to [[photobleaching]]. To avoid this drawback, [[bioluminescence]] resonance energy transfer (or '''BRET''') has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicola |last1=Bevan |first2=Stephen |last2=Rees |chapter=Pharmaceutical Applications of GFP and RCFP |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8Y4zrEofpIC&amp;pg=PA361 |pages=361–90 |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=Chalfie |editor2-first=Steven R. |editor2-last=Kain |series=Methods of Biochemical Analysis, Volume 47 |title=Green Fluorescent Protein: Properties, Applications and Protocols |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-471-73682-0 |edition=2nd |doi=10.1002/0471739499.ch16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfleger|first=Kevin D G|last2=Eidne|first2=Karin A|title=Illuminating insights into protein-protein interactions using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nmeth841|journal=Nature Methods|volume=3|issue=3|pages=165–174|doi=10.1038/nmeth841|pmid=16489332|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique uses a bioluminescent [[luciferase]] (typically the luciferase from ''[[Renilla reniformis]]'') rather than CFP to produce an initial photon emission compatible with YFP. One drawback of BRET is the requirement to generate at least one fusion protein encoding luciferase, though some applications of FRET can be implemented with antibody-conjugated fluorophores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfleger|first=Kevin D.

BRET has also been implemented using a different luciferase enzyme, engineered from the deep-sea shrimp ''Oplophorus gracilirostris''.

===Homo-FRET===

In general, "FRET" refers to situations where the donor and acceptor proteins (or "fluorophores") are of two different types. In many biological situations, however, researchers might need to examine the interactions between two, or more, proteins of the same type—or indeed the same protein with itself, for example if the protein folds or forms part of a polymer chain of proteins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76265-0 |title=Homo-FRET Microscopy in Living Cells to Measure Monomer-Dimer Transition of GFP-Tagged Proteins |date=2001 |last1=Gautier |first1=I. |last2=Tramier |first2=M. |last3=Durieux |first3=C. |last4=Coppey |first4=J. |last5=Pansu |first5=R.B. |last6=Nicolas |first6=J.-C. |last7=Kemnitz |first7=K. |last8=Coppey-Moisan |first8=M. |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=3000–8 |pmid=11371472 |pmc=1301483|bibcode = 2001BpJ....80.3000G }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for other questions of quantification in biological cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.059 |title=Homo-FRET Imaging Enables Quantification of Protein Cluster Sizes with Subcellular Resolution |date=2009 |last1=Bader |first1=Arjen N. |last2=Hofman |first2=Erik G. |last3=Voortman |first3=Jarno |last4=Van Bergen En Henegouwen |first4=Paul M.P. |last5=Gerritsen |first5=Hans C. |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=2613–22 |pmid=19883605 |pmc=2770629|bibcode = 2009BpJ....97.2613B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously, spectral differences will not be the tool used to detect and measure FRET, as both the acceptor and donor protein emit light with the same wavelengths. Yet researchers can detect differences in the polarisation between the light which excites the fluorophores and the light which is emitted, in a technique called FRET anisotropy imaging; the level of quantified anisotropy (difference in polarisation between the excitation and emission beams) then becomes an indicative guide to how many FRET events have happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/b920242k |title=Fluorescence anisotropy: From single molecules to live cells |date=2010 |last1=Gradinaru |first1=Claudiu C. |last2=Marushchak |first2=Denys O. |last3=Samim |first3=Masood |last4=Krull |first4=Ulrich J. |journal=The Analyst |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=452–9 |pmid=20174695|bibcode = 2010Ana...135..452G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FRET and BRET are also the common tools in the study of [[Enzyme kinetics|biochemical reaction kinetics]] and [[molecular motors]].

The applications of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have expanded tremendously in the last 25 years, and the technique has become a staple technique in many biological and biophysical fields. FRET can be used as spectroscopic ruler in various areas such as structural elucidation of biological molecules and their interactions in vitro assays, in vivo monitoring in cellular research, nucleic acid analysis, signal transduction, light harvesting and metallic nanomaterial etc. Based on the mechanism of FRET a variety of novel chemical sensors and biosensors have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frommer|first1=WB|last2=Davidson|first2=MW|last3=Campbell|first3=RE|title=Genetically encoded biosensors based on engineered fluorescent proteins.|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|date=October 2009|volume=38|issue=10|pages=2833–41|doi=10.1039/b907749a|pmid=19771330|pmc=3000468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
In the field of chemistry, this technique is growing very fast for monitoring the nanoparticle formation&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez‐Gaytan, Brenda L., et al. "Real‐Time Monitoring of Nanoparticle Formation by FRET Imaging." Angewandte Chemie 129.11 (2017): 2969-2972.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly to see the protein interaction&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Sarah F., et al.

==Other methods==
A different, but related, mechanism is [[Dexter electron transfer]].

An alternative method to detecting protein–protein proximity is the [[bimolecular fluorescence complementation]] (BiFC), where two parts of a fluorescent protein are each fused to other proteins. When these two parts meet, they form a fluorophore on a timescale of minutes or hours.&lt;ref name="pmid11983170"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(02)00496-3 |title=Visualization of Interactions among bZIP and Rel Family Proteins in Living Cells Using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation |date=2002 |last1=Hu |first1=Chang-Deng |last2=Chinenov |first2=Yurii |last3=Kerppola |first3=Tom K. |journal=Molecular Cell |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=789–98 |pmid=11983170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacteria Bidirectional DNA Replication.png|thumb|There is a richness of G over T in the leading strand. There is a change in GC skew sign at the origin and terminus.]]

'''GC skew''' is when the nucleotides [[Guanine]] and [[Cytosine]] are over- or under-abundant in a particular region of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. In equilibrium conditions (without mutational or selective pressure and with nucleotides randomly distributed within the genome) there is an equal frequency of the four DNA bases ([[Adenine]], [[Guanine]], [[Thymine]], and [[Cytosine]]) on both single strands of a DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; However, in most [[prokaryotes]] (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'') and some [[archaea]] (e.g. ''[[Sulfolobus]] solfataricus''), [[nucleotide]] compositions are asymmetric between the leading strand and the lagging strand: the leading strand contains more Guanine (G) and Thymine (T), whereas the lagging strand contains more Adenine (A) and Cytosine (C).&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; This phenomenon is referred to as '''GC''' and '''AT skew'''. It is represented mathematically as follows:&lt;ref name="refname6"/&gt;

GC skew = (G - C)/(G + C) 
 
AT skew = (A - T)/(A + T)

==Asymmetric nucleotide composition==
[[Erwin Chargaff|Erwin Chargaff's]] work in 1950 demonstrated that, in DNA, the bases guanine and cytosine were found in equal abundance, and the bases adenine and thymine were found in equal abundance. However, there was no equality between the amount of one pair versus the other.&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt; Chargaff’s finding is referred to as Chargaff's rule or [[Chargaff|parity rule 1]].&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt;  Three years later Watson and Crick used this fact during their derivation the structure of DNA, their [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix model]].

A natural result of parity rule 1, at the state of equilibrium, in which there is no mutation and/or selection biases in any of the two DNA strands, is that when there is an equal substitution rate, the complementary nucleotides on each strand have equal amounts of a given base and its complement.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; In other words, in each DNA strand the frequency of occurrence of T is equal to A and the frequency of occurrence of G is equal to C because the substitution rate is presumably equal. This phenomenon is referred to as [[Chargaff|parity rule 2]]. Hence, the second parity rule only exists, when there is no mutation or substitution.

Any deviation from parity rule 2 will result in asymmetric base composition that discriminates the leading from the lagging strand. This asymmetry is referred to as GC or AT skew.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

There is a richness of guanine over cytosine and thymine over adenine in the leading strand and vice versa for the lagging strand. The nucleotide composition skew spectra ranges from -1, which corresponds to G = 0 or A = 0, to +1, which corresponds to T= 0 or C = 0.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Therefore, positive GC skew represents richness of G over C and the negative GC skew represents richness of C over G. As a result, one expects to see a positive GC skew and negative AT skew in the leading strand, and a negative GC skew and a positive AT skew in the lagging strand.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; GC or AT skew changes sign at the boundaries of the two [[replichore]]s, which correspond to DNA replication origin or terminus.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Originally, this asymmetric nucleotide composition was explained as a different mechanism used in [[DNA replication]] between the leading strand and lagging strand. DNA replication is semi-conservative and an asymmetric process itself.&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt; This asymmetry is due the formation of the replication fork and its division into nascent leading and lagging strands. The leading strand is synthesized continuously and in juxtapose to the leading strand; the lagging strand is replicated through short fragments of polynucleotide ([[Okazaki fragments]]) in a 5' to 3' direction.&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt;

==Calculation and GC skew plots==
There are three major approaches to calculate and graphically demonstrate GC skew and its properties.

===GC Asymmetry===
The first approach is GC and AT Asymmetry.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Jean R. Lobry was the first to illustrate the nucleotide composition asymmetry throughout the genome of three bacterium: ''[[E. coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', and ''[[haemophilus influenzae]]'' by using GC and AT bias. This is the most common and traditional way to quantitatively evaluate base composition asymmetry. The original formulas at the time were not named skew, but rather deviation from [A] = [T] or [C] = [G]:

deviation from [A] = [T] as (A - T)/(A + T)

deviation from [C] = [G] as (C - G)/(C + G)

where A, T, G, and C represent the frequency of occurrence of the equivalent base in a particular sequence in a defined length. A window sliding strategy is used to calculate deviation from C through the genome. In these plots, a positive deviation from C corresponds to lagging strand and negative deviation from C corresponds to leading strand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-language.org/GenomeProjector/wiki/circular_genome_map_view#gc_content_and_gc_skew "Explanation of Lobry 1996 article"]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the site where the deviation sign switches corresponds to origin or terminal. The x-axis represents the chromosome locations plotted 5' to 3' and y-axis represents the deviation value. The major weakness of this method is its window-size dependent property. Therefore, choosing an adequate window size greatly affects the outcome of the plot. Other techniques should be combined with deviation in order to identify and locate the origin of the DNA replication with greater accuracy.

===CGC Skew===
The second approach is referred to as cumulative GC skew (CGC skew).&lt;ref name="refname6"/&gt; This method still uses the sliding window strategy but it takes advantage of the sum of the adjacent windows from an arbitrary start. In this scheme, the entire genome is usually plotted 5' to 3' using an arbitrary start and arbitrary strand. In the cumulative GC skew plot, the peaks corresponds to the switch points (terminus or origin).

In contrast to Lobry's earlier paper, recent implementations of GC skew flips the original definition, redefining it to be:

GC skew = (G - C)/(G + C).

With the flipped definition of GC skew, the maximum value of the cumulative skew corresponds to the terminal, and the minimum value corresponds to the origin of replication.

===Z-curve===
The final approach is the [[Z curve]].&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt; Unlike the previous methods, this method do not uses the sliding window strategy and is thought to perform better as to finding the origin of replication.&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt; In this method each base’s cumulative frequency with respect to the base at the beginning of the sequence is investigated. Z curve uses a three-dimensional representation with the following parameters:

Xn = (An + Gn) – (Cn + Tn)

Yn = (An + Cn) – (Gn + Tn)

Zn = (An + Tn) – (Cn + Gn)

Where n = 0, 1, 2, …, N, Xn represents the excess of purine over pyrimidine, Yn denotes excess of keto over amino, and Zn shows the relationship between the weak and strong hydrogen bonds. X and Y components can alone detect the replication origin and asymmetric composition of the strands.
A combination of these methods should be used for prediction of replication origin and terminal, in order to compensate for their weakness.

==Mechanism of GC and AT skew==
There is lack of consensus in scientific community with regard to the mechanism underlining the bias in nucleotide composition within each DNA strand. There are two major schools of thought that explain the mechanism behind the strand specific nucleotide composition in bacteria.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;

The first one describes a bias and an asymmetric mutational pressure on each DNA strand during replication and transcription.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname8"/&gt; Due to the asymmetric nature of the replication process, an unequal mutational frequency and DNA repair efficiency during the replication process can introduce more mutations in one strand as compared to the other.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Furthermore, the time used for replication between the two strands varies and may lead to asymmetric mutational pressure between leading and lagging strand.&lt;ref name="refname9"/&gt; In addition to mutations during DNA replication, transcriptional mutations can create strand specific nucleotide composition skew.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Deamination of cytosine and ultimately mutation of cytosine to thymine in one DNA strand can increase the relative number of guanine and thymine to cytosine and adenine.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; In most bacteria majority of the genes are encoded in the leading strand.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; For instance, the leading strand in ''Bacillus'' ''subtilis'' encodes 75% of the genes.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; In addition an excess of deamination and conversion of cytosine to thymine in the coding strand compared to the non-coding strand has been reported.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname10"/&gt; One possible explanation is that the non-transcribed strand (coding strand) is single stranded during the transcription process; therefore, it is more vulnerable to deamination compared to the transcribed strand (non-coding strand).&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Another explanation is that the deamination repair activity during transcription does not occur on the coding strand.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Only the transcribed strand benefits from these deamination repair events.

The second school of thought describes the mechanism of GC and AT skew as resulting from differential selective pressure between the leading and lagging strands.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Examination of the prokaryotic genome shows a preference in third codon position for G over C and T over A.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; This discrimination creates an asymmetric nucleotide composition, if the coding strand is unequally distributed between the leading and lagging strands, as in the case for bacteria. In addition, the highly transcribed genes, such as ribosomal proteins, have been shown to be located mostly on the leading strand in bacteria.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Therefore, a bias in the third-position codon choice of G over C can lead to GC skew.  Additionally, some signal sequences are rich in guanine and thymine, such as [[chi site|chi sequences]], and these sequences might have a higher frequency of occurrence in one strand compared to the other.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;

Both mutational and selective pressure can independently introduce asymmetry in DNA strands. However the combination and cumulative effect of both mechanisms is the most plausible explanation for GC and AT skew.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt;

===Firmicutes===
In the majority of prokaryotes there is a richness of G over C and T over A in the leading strand and vice versa for the lagging strand. However, it has been reported that there is positive AT skew in the leading strand in some prokaryotes, such as the phylum [[Firmicutes]].&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Firmicutes demonstrate an atypical AT skew. This unique nucleotide composition is thought to be due to selection pressure of adenine over thymine in the coding region.&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; This biased selection avoids the formation of stop codons and use of metabolically expensive amino acids.&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; The coding regions are mostly distributed on the leading strand;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname8"/&gt; therefore, A over T richness is observed in Firmicutes.&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt;

==The application of GC skew==
The GC skew is proven to be useful as the indicator of the DNA leading strand, lagging strand, replication origin, and replication terminal.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Most prokaryotes and archaea contain only one DNA replication origin.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; The GC skew is positive and negative in the leading strand and in the lagging strand respectively; therefore, it is expected to see a switch in GC skew sign just at the point of DNA replication origin and terminus.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; GC skew can also be used to study the strand biases and mechanism related to them by calculating the excess of one base over its complementary base in different milieus.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname11"/&gt; Method such as GC skew, CGC skew, and Z-curve are tools that can provide opportunity to better investigate the mechanism of DNA replication in different organisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12175">'''Graphic notation''' (or graphic score) is the representation of music through the use of visual symbols outside the realm of traditional [[music notation]]. Graphic notation evolved in the 1950s, and can be used either in combination with or instead of traditional music notation.&lt;ref&gt;Pryer, Anthony. "Graphic Notation." ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', edited by Alison Latham. ''Oxford Music Online''. 12 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Composers often rely on graphic notation in [[experimental music]], where standard musical notation can be ineffective. Other uses include pieces where an [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] or [[Indeterminacy (music)|undetermined]] effect is desired. One of the earliest pioneers of the technique, along with [[John Cage]], was [[Earle Brown]], who sought to liberate performers from the constraints of notation and makes them active participants in the creation of the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taruskin|first1=Richard|title=Chapter 2 "Indeterminacy."|url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/view/Volume5/actrade-9780195384857-div1-002009.xml?rskey=Hd9BXx&amp;result=1|website=Oxford History of Western Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=April 7, 2018|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Graphic notation first appeared in the 1950s as an evolution of movement of [[Indeterminacy (music)|Indeterminacy]] as pioneered by [[John Cage]].{{Contradiction-inline|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--A little further down the page, examples from the 14th and 18th centuries are mentioned.--&gt; The technique was originally used by [[avant-garde]] musicians and manifested itself as the use of symbols to convey information that could not be rendered with traditional notation such as [[extended technique]]s. Graphic scores have, since their conception, evolved into two broadly defined categories, one being the invention of new notation systems used to convey specific musical techniques and the other the use conceptual notation such as shapes, drawings and other artistic techniques that are meant to evoke improvisation from the performer. Examples of the former include [[Morton Feldman|Feldman's]] ''[[Projection (Feldman)|Projection]]'' and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen's]] ''[[Prozession]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pryer, Anthony. "Graphic Notation." ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', edited by Alison Latham. ''Oxford Music Online''. 12 Apr. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the latter include [[Earle Brown|Earle Brown's]] ''December 1952'' and [[Cornelius Cardew|Cardew's]] ''[[Treatise (Cardew)|Treatise]]'', which was written in response to Cage's ''[[4'33"]]'' and which he wrote after having worked as Stockhausen's assistant. The score consists of 193 of lines and rectangles on a white background where. Here the lines represented elements in space and the score was merely a representation of that space at a given instant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taruskin|first1=Richard|title=Chapter 2: "Indeterminacy".|url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/view/Volume5/actrade-9780195384857-div1-002009.xml?rskey=Hd9BXx&amp;result=1|website=Oxford History of Western Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=April 7, 2018|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, one of the most notable users was [[Sylvano Bussotti]], whose score were even often displayed as pieces visual art by enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taruskin|first1=Richard|title=Chapter 2: "Indeterminacy".|url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/view/Volume5/actrade-9780195384857-div1-002009.xml?rskey=Hd9BXx&amp;result=1|website=Oxford History of Western Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=April 7, 2018|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, in an effort to promote the movement of abstract notation, [[John Cage]] and [[Allison Knowles]] published an archive of excerpts of scores by 269 composers with the intention of showing "the many directions in which notation is now going".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cage|first1=John|title=Notations|date=1969|publisher=Something Else Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0685148648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable pioneers of graphic notation include composers such as [[Roman Haubenstock-Ramati]], [[Mauricio Kagel]], [[György Ligeti]] (''[[Artikulation (Ligeti)|Artikulation]]''), [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]].

In 2008, Theresa Sauer edited a compendium featuring graphic scores by composers from over fifty countries,&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, Theresa. ''Notations 21''. Mark Batty Publisher. p. 010, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating how widespread the practice has become.

==Examples==

===As a notational system===
*''Time-based pictographic scores'' such as ''Waterwalk'' by [[John Cage]], uses a combination of time marking an pictographic notation as instruction on how and when to perform certain actions.
[[File:John Cage, Water Walk.png|thumb|center|Section of ''Waterwalk'' by [[John Cage]]|500x500px]]
*''Line staves showing approximate pitch'', with the actual pitches being decided upon performance.
[[Image:Relative pitch staff.png|center]]
*''Altered notation'' can be seen in [[George Crumb]]'s work,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v46/n06/CrumbSpiral.gif&lt;/ref&gt; where he uses traditional notation but presents the music on the page in a graphic or nontraditional manner such as spirals or circles.&lt;ref&gt;http://lens.lib.uchicago.edu/?hreciid=|library/marc/uc|2060598&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2018}} This device, however, was not an innovation of the twentieth century. It is found, for example, in some pieces composed by [[Baude Cordier]] in the late 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;John Bergsagel, "Cordier's Circular Canon," ''The Musical Times'' 113, No. 1558 (December 1972): 1175–77 (passim); [[Ursula Günther]], "Unusual Phenomena in the Transmission of Late 14th Century Polyphonic Music", ''Musica Disciplina'' 38 "Aspects of Music in Church, Court and Town from the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century" (1984): 87–118, citation on 91.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a piece by [[Joseph Haydn]] in the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt; Joseph Haydn, [http://www.themorgan.org/music/manuscript/115073 ''Heiligen zehn Gebote'': 1, "Du sollst an einen Gott glauben"], H. XXVIIa:1: autograph manuscript, 1791; Luciane Beduschi, [http://www.euromac2014.eu/programme/f/beduschi Composer’s Opinions about the multiple Solutions for Their Puzzle Canons]”. EuroMac 2014, Leuven.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|center|''Belle, bonne, sage'', by Baude Cordier]]
*''New specific notation system'', that is, a new of specifically and graphically notate musical actions like that of [[Psappha (Xenakis)|Xenakis' ''Psappha'']].&lt;ref&gt;Xenakis, I. (1975). ''Psappha'', (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

===As abstract visual reference===
*''Time-based abstract representation'', can be seen in Hans-Christoph Steiner's score for ''Solitude'' in which the music is represented using symbols and illustrations. Note that here, time is still represented horizontally from left to right like in a [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] graph system, and thus implies that the piece as a specific [[Form (music)|form]].[[Image:solitude.png|thumb|800x800px|center|Hans-Christoph Steiner's score for ''[http://at.or.at/hans/solitude Solitude]'', created using [[Pure Data]]'s data structures.]]
*''Time-based abstract notation'', such as [[Rudolf Komorous]]'s ''Chanson'' utilises abstract notation with time indication, or least a direction in which the piece is read and therefore implies a form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cage|first1=John|title=Notations|date=1969|publisher=Something Else Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0685148648}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Free Abstract Representations'', such as [[Earle Brown|Brown's]] December 1952, where the form, pitch material and instrumentation are left up to the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taruskin|first1=Richard|title=Chapter 2 "Indeterminacy."|url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/view/Volume5/actrade-9780195384857-div1-002009.xml?rskey=Hd9BXx&amp;result=1|website=Oxford History of Western Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=April 8, 2018|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Free Abstract Notation'', such as [[Mark Applebaum]]'s "The Metaphysics of Notation" and where elements of traditional music notation are melded with abstract designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heigemeir|first1=Ray|title=The Metaphysics of Notation|url=http://library.stanford.edu/blogs/stanford-libraries-blog/metaphysics-notation|website=Stanford Libraries|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/mark_applebaum_the_mad_scientist_of_music.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holmes Rolston III''' (born November 19, 1932) is a philosopher who is University Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[Colorado State University]]. He is best known for his contributions to [[environmental ethics]] and the [[relationship between science and religion]]. Among other honors, Rolston won the 2003 [[Templeton Prize]], awarded by [[Prince Philip]] in [[Buckingham Palace]].  He gave the [[Gifford Lectures]], [[University of Edinburgh]], 1997–1998.

The [[Darwinian]] model is used to define the main thematic concepts in Rolston's philosophy and, in greater depth, the general trend of his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index226.html Afeissa, H.

[[File:raphides in idioblast.jpg |thumb|Calcium oxalate needles shot out from idioblast (600x magnification)]]

An '''idioblast''' is an isolated plant cell that differs from neighboring tissues. They have various functions such as storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin, tannin or pigments etc. Some can contain mineral crystals such as acrid tasting and poisonous [[calcium oxalate]] or carbonate or silica.   
Any of the tissue or tissue systems of plants can contain idioblasts.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs 1874. "Botany"&lt;/ref&gt; 
Idioblasts are divided into three main categories: excretory, tracheoid, and [[sclerenchyma]]tous.

Idioblasts can contain biforine cells that form crystals. The chemicals are excreted by the plant and stored in liquid or crystalline form. In bundles they are known as [[druse (botany)|druse]] and as crystals they can be of [[raphide]] [needle] form.  When the end of an idioblast is broken the crystals or other substance is ejected by internal water pressure.  Idioblasts of calcium oxalate may function as a deterrent to herbivores, as a means of sequestering or storing calcium, or as a means of stiffening tissue structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Diversity and distribution of idioblasts producing calcium oxalate crystals in ''Dieffenbachia seguine'' (Araceae) | author = Gary G.

[[communication]]  with people of other [[culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W., &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012) The ICCA Facilitator's Manual. Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal.

''Health &amp; Social Care In The Community'', ''24''(6), e117-e130. doi:10.1111/hsc.12293&lt;/ref&gt; Effective intercultural communication relates to behaviors that culminate with the accomplishment of the desired goals of the interaction and all parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lustig, M. W., &amp; Koester, J. (2003). ''Intercultural competence: Interpersonal communication across cultures'' (4th ed.). Boston : Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate intercultural communication includes behaviors that suit the expectations of a specific culture, the characteristics of the situation, and the level of the relationship between the parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Basics==
It's very important for someone to be culturally competent at work and at school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individuals that are effective and appropriate in intercultural situations display high levels of cultural self-awareness and understand the influence of culture on behavior, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intercultural competence is achieved through a set of skills that includes cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Liu, S. (2014) that allow a person understand another person from another culture. Becoming intercultural: exposure to foreign cultures and intercultural competence through [[travel]] and [[tourism]]. ''China Media Research'', ''10''(3), 7+. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA381285571&amp;asid=99b4d2ef6464c5ca16122775ce082415&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

First, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raţă, G. (2016). Intercultural Development through Intercultural Awareness and Cultural Briefing. ''Scientific Papers: Animal Science &amp; Biotechnologies / Lucrari Stiintifice: Zootehnie Si Biotehnologii'', ''49''(1), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Finally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creating intercultural competence ==
Intercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Mindfulness: the ability of being cognitively aware of how the communication and interaction with others is developed. It is important to focus more in the process of the interaction than its outcome while maintaining in perspective the desired communication goals. For example, it would be better to formulate questions such as "What can I say or do to help this process?" rather than "What do they mean?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Cognitive flexibility: the ability of creating new categories of information rather than keeping old categories. This skill includes opening to new information, taking more than one perspective, and understanding personal ways of interpreting messages and situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciairano, S., Bonino, S., &amp; Miceli, R. (2006). COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE FROM CHILDHOOD TO EARLY ADOLESCENCE. ''Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior'', ''10''(3), 343-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tolerance for ambiguity: the ability to maintain focus in situations that are not clear rather than becoming anxious and to methodically determine the best approach as the situation evolves. Generally, low-tolerance individuals look for information that supports their believes while high-tolerance individuals look for information that gives an understanding of the situation and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Behavioral flexibility: the ability to adapt and accommodate behaviors to a different culture. Although knowing a second language could be important for this skill, it does not necessarily translate into cultural adaptability. The individual must be willing to assimilate the new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrard, V., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2015). Physician behavioral adaptability: A model to outstrip a "one size fits all" approach. ''Patient Education &amp; Counseling'', ''98''(10), 1243-1247. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2015.07.028&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cross-cultural empathy: the ability to visualize with the imagination the situation of another person from an intellectual and emotional point of view. Demonstrating empathy includes the abilities of connecting emotionally with people, showing compassion, thinking in more than one perspective, and listening actively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Ying Chung, R., &amp; Bemak, F. (2002). The Relationship of Culture and Empathy in Cross-Cultural Counseling. ''Journal Of Counseling &amp; Development'', ''80''(2), 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, P. B., &amp; Pope, m. (2010). Inclusive Cultural Empathy for Successful Global Leadership. ''American Psychologist'', ''65''(8), 841-854. doi:10.1037/a0020916&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in American ethnic studies==

The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the [[British Isles]], who originally settled in the original [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]].  While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of [[North America]], they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see [[Indian Removal Act]] describing specific actions during early 19th century).  During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.

Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians.  Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere.  While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.

In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation.  During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions.    Descendants of African [[Slavery|slave]]s and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the [[Jim Crow law]]s in the United States.  Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as [[Mexican American]]s have gained greater social and economic status and power.

Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Jacob Riis]].  After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S.  The arrival of more than half a million [[Southeast Asia]]n [[refugee]]s, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.

== Education in the United States ==
With the larger population of minorities and [[racial integration]] during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]] of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most [[teacher]]s in public school system came from white, [[middle class]] backgrounds.  Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures.  They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different [[value system]]s and [[norm (sociology)|normative behaviors]] from that of Anglo-European culture.  The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.

With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils.  The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator.  Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture.  People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors.  Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context.  "In short," Anderson (1984) says, "the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;374-375).  More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their "organized knowledge about the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to "‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'" (Anderson, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;382).  This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to "shared understandings" (p.&amp;nbsp;364).  Thus, teachers must remember that they are "cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field" (Blanchett, Mumford &amp; Beachum, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;306).

Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society.  Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student [[learning disabilities]], student behavioral problems, [[child abuse]], [[drug addiction]], [[mental health]], and [[poverty]], most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:
* role of women in the family and the decisions they can make
* practices among cultural groups (e.g. [[fire cupping]])
* symbol systems among cultural groups (see [[semiotics]])

Examples of sub-groups within the United States: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or American Indians and [[refugee]]s.

==Healthcare==
{{Main|Cultural competence in healthcare}}
The provision of culturally tailored health care can improve [[patient outcomes]]. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in [[California]] [[medical school]] to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/state-legislation-requires-inclusion-cultural-and-linguistic-competence-continuing-medical |title=State Legislation Requires Inclusion of Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Continuing Medical Education, Increasing Acceptance of Their Importance by Educational Programs and Clinicians |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/clinics-offer-culturally-tailored-diabetes-education-and-culturally-appropriate-care |title=Clinics Offer Culturally Tailored Diabetes Education and Culturally Appropriate Care to Ethiopian Patients, Leading to More Engagement, Better Outcomes, and Reduction of Health Disparities |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josepha Campinha-Bacote|title=The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services: A Model of Care|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hispanic versus Latin American ==
The term "Hispanic" is problematic{{According to whom|date=September 2016}}. It is impossible to refer to "a Hispanic-American perspective" or to "a single Latino culture".(1)(2)  The label "Hispanic" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term "Latino" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term "Latino" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).

There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations.  Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences.  In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research.  Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.

Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status.  Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new "tokenism", that is, having a large aggregate of "non-whites", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample.  Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.

==Cross-cultural competence==
{{Main|Cross-cultural competence}}

Cross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"&gt;Selmeski, B.R. (2007). ''Military cross-cultural competence: Core concepts and individual development''. Kingston: Royal Military College of Canada Centre for Security, Armed Forces, &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as "A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments".&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."&gt;Abbe, A., Gulick, L.M.V., &amp; Herman, J.L. (2007). ''Cross-cultural competence in Army leaders: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on "[[common sense]]" approaches.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"/&gt;

Cross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, [[language proficiency]], and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, [[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom]]'s affective and cognitive taxonomies&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B.S. (Ed.). (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., &amp; Masia, B.B. (1973). ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, the Classification of Educational Goals. Handbook II: Affective Domain.'' New York: McKay Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.

The development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.

===Immigrants and international students===
A salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.

[[International student]]s also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent [[culture shock]]s. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to "blend in" more. In the article it stated, "Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system" (Bondy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Peguero|first2=Anthony|last3=Johnson|first3=Brent|title=The Children of Immigrants’ Academic Self-Efficacy: The Significance of Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Segmented Assimilation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013124516644049#articleCitationDownloadContainer|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage publications|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such individuals may be said to have adopted [[Bicultural identity|bicultural identities]].

=== Ethnocentrism ===
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
Another issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from [[Ethnocentrism]]. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y. &amp; Rancer, A.S.|year=2003|title=Ethnocentrism, intercultural communication apprehension, intercultural willingness‐to‐communicate, and intentions to participate in an intercultural dialogue program: testing a proposed model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090309388800|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=62–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.

==Cultural differences==
{{See also|Geert Hofstede}}
Cultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:

=== Individualism versus Collectivism ===
* [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Luomala, H., Kumar, R., Singh, J., &amp; Jaakkola, M. (2015). When an Intercultural Business Negotiation Fails: Comparing the Emotions and Behavioural Tendencies of Individualistic and Collectivistic Negotiators. ''Group Decision &amp; Negotiation'', ''24''(3), 537-561. doi:10.1007/s10726-014-9420-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Maali, B. M., &amp; Al-Attar, A. (2017). CORPORATE DISCLOSURE AND CULTURAL VALUES: A TEST FOR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. ''Journal Of Developing Areas'', ''51''(3), 251-265. EBSCO''host'', db19.linccweb.org/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=123634171&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Decisions are based on the benefits of the group rather than the individual;
** Strong loyalty to the group as the main social unit;
** The group is expected to take care of each individual;
** Collectivist cultures include Pakistan, India, Japan, and Guatemala.
* [[Individualism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Autonomy of the individual has the highest importance;
** Promotes the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance;
** Decisions prioritize the benefits of the individual rather than the group;
** Individualistic cultures are Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States.

=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===
* Masculine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that indicate assertiveness and wealth;
** Judge people based on the degree of ambition and achievement;
** General behaviors are associated with male behavior;
** Sex roles are clearly defined and sexual inequality is acceptable;
** Masculine cultures include Austria, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
* Feminine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that promote the quality of life such as caring for others and nurturing;
** Gender roles overlap and sexual equality is preferred as the norm;
** Nurturing behaviors are acceptable for both women and men;
** Feminine cultures are Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and Thailand.

=== Uncertainty avoidance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty;
* Uncertainty avoidance dimension expresses the degree to which a person in society feels comfortable with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
** High uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance Index or UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas;
*** Members of society expect consensus about national and societal goals;
*** Society ensures security by setting extensive rules and keeping more structure;
*** High uncertainty avoidance cultures are Greece, Guatemala, Portugal, and Uruguay.
** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Low UAI societies maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible;
*** People in these cultures are more tolerant of change and accept risks;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures are Denmark, Jamaica, Ireland, and Singapore.

=== [[Power (social and political)|Power]] distance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Refers to the degree in which cultures accept unequal distribution of power and challenge the decisions of power holders;
* Depending on the culture, some people may be considered superior to others because of a large number of factors such as wealth, age, occupation, gender, personal achievements, family history, etc.
** High power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe that social and class hierarchy and inequalities are beneficial, that authority should not be challenged, and that people with higher social status have the right to use power;
*** Cultures with high power distance are Arab countries, Guatemala, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
** Low power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe in reducing inequalities, challenging authority, minimizing hierarchical structures, and using power just when necessary;
*** Low power distance countries are Austria, Denmark, Israel, and New Zealand.

=== Short-term versus Long-term Time Orientation ===
''See also:'' [[Chronemics]]
* Short-term or Monochronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Cultures value tradition, personal stability, maintaining "face," and reciprocity during interpersonal interactions;
** People expect quick results after actions;
** Historical events and beliefs influence people's actions in the present;
** Monochronic cultures are Canada, Philippines, Nigeria, Pakistan, and U.S.A.
* Long-term or Polychronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
** Cultures value persistence, thriftiness,and humility;
** People sacrifice immediate gratification for long-term commitments;
** Cultures believe that past results do not guarantee for the future and are aware of change;
** Polychronic cultures are China, Japan, Brazil, and India.

==Assessment==
The assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C.&lt;ref&gt;Fantini, A.E. (2006). ''87 Assessment tools of intercultural competence [Electronic version].'' Brattleboro, VT: School for International Training. Retrieved June 20, 2007, from http://www.sit.edu/publications/docs/feil_appendix_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

The following characteristics are tested and observed for the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: [[ambiguity tolerance]], openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, [[empathy]], [[metacommunicative competence]], and [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

===Quantitative assessment instruments===
Three examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;
* the [http://idiinventory.com/ Inter-cultural Intercultural Developmental Inventory]
* the [[Cultural Intelligence]] (CQ) Measurement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cq-portal.com/index.php|title=Cultural Intelligence Portal|website=www.cq-portal.com|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [http://www.tamas.com/index.php?q=node/21 Multicultural Personality Questionnaire]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halim|first=Haslina|last2=Bakar|first2=Hassan Abu|last3=Mohamad|first3=Bahtiar|date=2014-11-06|title=Expatriate Adjustment: Validating Multicultural Personality Trait among Self-initiated Academic Expatriates|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814057334|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|series=The International Conference on Communication and Media 2014 (i-COME’14) - Communication, Empowerment and Governance: The 21st Century Enigma|volume=155|pages=123–129|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.10.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative assessment instruments===
Research in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsantas, A. (2004). Studying abroad: the role of college students' goals on the development of cross-cultural skills and global understanding. ''College Student Journal'', 38(3). Retrieved July 9, 2007, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lessard-Clouston |first=M. |year=1997 |title=Towards an understanding of culture in L2/FL education |journal=Ronko: K.G. studies in English |volume=25 |pages=131–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lievens |first=F. |last2=Harris |first2=M. |last3=Van Keer |first3=E. |last4=Bisqueret |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Predicting cross-cultural training performance: The validity of personality, cognitive ability, and dimensions measured by an assessment center and a behavior description interview |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=476–489 |pmid=12814296 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative instruments, such as scenario-based assessments, are useful for gaining insight into intercultural competence.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B. (1993). ''Tools for teaching.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doll, W. (1993). ''A post-modern perspective on curriculum.'' New York: Teacher's College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English, F. &amp; Larson, R. (1996). ''Curriculum management for educational and social service organizations.'' Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palomba, A. &amp; Banta, T. (1999). ''Assessment essentials.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intercultural coaching frameworks, such as the ICCA™ ([http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal]), do not attempt an assessment; they provide guidance for personal improvement based upon the identification of [[Trait theory|personal traits]], strengths, and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W. &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012). ''The ICCA™ Facilitator's Manual'' London: Createspace.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is The ICCA?|url=http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx|work=Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal|publisher=GloBus Research Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
It is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rathje, S. (2007). Intercultural Competence: The Status and Future of a Controversial Concept. ''Journal for Language and Intercultural Communication'', 7(4), 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madison |first=Greg |year=2006 |title=Existential Migration |journal=Existential Analysis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=238–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.

The '''International Institute of Tropical Agriculture''' ('''IITA''') works with partners to enhance crop quality and productivity, reduce producer and consumer risks, and generate wealth from agriculture, with the ultimate goals of reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. IITA's research-for-development (R4D) focuses on addressing the development needs of tropical countries. The institute was established in 1967 and is headquartered in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]], with several research stations across [[Africa]]. IITA is a nonprofit organization governed by a Board of Trustees, supported by several countries and the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR).

==History==
IITA was established in 1967 in Ibadan, the idea of the institute came from [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] foundations desire to establish a centre for the improvement in quality of tropical foods.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, R. D. R., International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Symposium on Sustainable Food Production in Sub-Saharian Africa, &amp; Symposium on "Sustainable Food Production in Sub-Saharian Africa". (1992). Sustainable food production in sub-Saharian Africa: [symposium on "Sustainable Food Production in Sub-Saharian Africa", being held at IITA headquarters at Ibadan, Nigeria, in December 1992]. Ibadan: International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. P. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The institute came to existence with the enactment of decree 32. of 1967. Part of the institute's initial goals were to develop a better productive farming system, the selection and breeding of high yielding crop varieties that are resistant to diseases and pest and strengthening agricultulral research in the humid and tropic regions. The institute was initially situated on a 1000 hectare land. The institute focused on a cereal improvement program, grain and legumes improvement program, farming systems and root and tuber improvement program. The grain and [[legume]] improvement system consisted of [[soybean]], [[cowpea]] and tuber program composed of [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] and [[cassava]].&lt;ref&gt;Coker Onita. (1987). IITA and Massive Production of Food. Spear Focus, Spear Magazine, P. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt;  IITA joined CGIAR in 1971. It later added tree products such as plantain and banana.

'''Substitutability''' is a principle in [[object-oriented programming]] stating that, in a [[computer program]], if S is a [[subtype]] of T, then objects of [[datatype|type]] T may be ''replaced'' with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be ''substituted'' with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).  More formally, the '''Liskov substitution principle''' ('''LSP''') is a particular definition of a [[subtyping]] relation, called '''(strong) behavioral subtyping''', that was initially introduced by [[Barbara Liskov]] in a 1987 conference [[keynote]] address titled ''Data abstraction and hierarchy''. It is a [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantic]] rather than merely syntactic relation, because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of [[data type|types]] in a hierarchy, [[Object (computer science)|object type]]s in particular. Barbara Liskov and [[Jeannette Wing]] described the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:
&lt;!-- inline math as LaTeX has poor baseline alignment (better with MathJaX HTML/CSS rendering of LaTeX)     
:''Let &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a property provable about objects &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;q(y)&lt;/math&gt; should be provable for objects &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a subtype of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.''
--&gt;&lt;!-- inline math as HTML --&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Subtype Requirement'': Let {{tmath|\phi(x)}} be a property provable about objects {{tmath|x}} of type {{math| T}}.  Then {{tmath| \phi(y) }} should be true for objects {{tmath|y}} of type {{math| S }} where {{math| S }} is a subtype of {{math| T}}. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- inline math as HTML bold
:''Let {{math| '''q(x)''' }} be a property provable about objects {{math| '''x''' }} of type {{math| '''T'''. }} Then {{math| '''q(y)''' }} should be provable for objects {{math| '''y''' }} of type {{math| '''S''', }} where {{math| '''S''' }} is a subtype of {{math| '''T'''. }}''
 --&gt;
In the same paper, Liskov and Wing detailed their notion of behavioral subtyping in an extension of [[Hoare logic]], which bears a certain resemblance to [[Bertrand Meyer]]'s [[design by contract]] in that it considers the interaction of subtyping with [[precondition]]s, [[postcondition]]s and [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]].

== Principle ==
Liskov's notion of a behavioural subtype defines a notion of substitutability for objects; that is, if ''S'' is a subtype of ''T'', then objects of type ''T'' in a program may be replaced with objects of type ''S'' without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (e.g. [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]).

Behavioural subtyping is a stronger notion than typical [[subtyping of functions]] defined in [[type theory]], which relies only on the [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|contravariance]] of argument types and [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance]] of the return type. Behavioural subtyping is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general: if ''q'' is the property "method for ''x'' [[halting problem|always terminates]]", then it is impossible for a program (e.g. a compiler) to verify that it holds true for some subtype ''S'' of ''T'', even if ''q'' does hold for ''T''. Nonetheless, the principle is useful in reasoning about the design of class hierarchies.

Liskov's principle imposes some standard requirements on [[Type signature|signatures]] that have been adopted in newer object-oriented programming languages (usually at the level of classes rather than types; see [[Subtype#Subtyping schemes|nominal vs. structural subtyping]] for the distinction):

* [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Contravariance]] of method arguments in the subtype.
* [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Covariance]] of return types in the subtype.
* No new exceptions should be thrown by methods of the subtype, except where those exceptions are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.

In addition to the signature requirements, the subtype must meet a number of behavioural conditions. These are detailed in a terminology resembling that of [[design by contract]] methodology, leading to some restrictions on how contracts can interact with [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]]:

*[[Precondition]]s cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
*[[Postcondition]]s cannot be weakened in a subtype.
*[[Invariant (computer science)|Invariant]]s of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
* History constraint (the "history rule"). Objects are regarded as being modifiable only through their methods ([[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]]). Because subtypes may introduce methods that are not present in the supertype, the introduction of these methods may allow state changes in the subtype that are not permissible in the supertype. The history constraint prohibits this. It was the novel element introduced by Liskov and Wing. A violation of this constraint can be exemplified by defining a ''mutable point'' as a subtype of an ''immutable point''. This is a violation of the history constraint, because in the history of the ''immutable point'', the state is always the same after creation, so it cannot include the history of a ''mutable point'' in general. Fields added to the subtype may however be safely modified because they are not observable through the supertype methods. Thus, one can derive ''a circle with fixed center but mutable radius'' from ''immutable point'' without violating LSP.

== Origins ==
The rules on pre- and postconditions are identical to those introduced by Bertrand Meyer in his 1988 book ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]''. Both Meyer, and later Pierre America, who was the first to use the term ''behavioral subtyping'', gave [[proof-theoretic]] definitions of some behavioral subtyping notions, but their definitions did not take into account [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] that may occur in programming languages that support references or pointers. Taking aliasing into account was the major improvement made by Liskov and Wing (1994), and a key ingredient is the history constraint. Under the definitions of Meyer and America, a MutablePoint would be a behavioral subtype of ImmutablePoint, whereas LSP forbids this.

The effect was discovered in 1909 by [[Étienne Lombard]], a French [[otolaryngologist]].&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lombard É |title=Le signe de l'élévation de la voix |journal=Annales des Maladies de L'Oreille et du Larynx |volume=XXXVII |issue=2 |pages=101–9 |year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lombard speech==
Listeners hear a speech recorded with background noise better than they hear a speech which has been recorded in quiet with [[Auditory masking|masking noise]] applied afterwards. This is because changes between normal and Lombard speech include:&lt;ref name="Junqua"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Summers"/&gt;
* increase in phonetic [[fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]]
* shift in energy from low frequency bands to middle or high bands
* increase in [[sound intensity]]
* increase in [[vowel]] duration
* spectral tilting
* shift in [[formant]] center frequencies for F1 (mainly) and F2
* the duration of [[content word]]s are prolonged to a greater degree in noise than [[function word]]s&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patel R, Schell KW |title=The influence of linguistic content on the Lombard effect |journal=J.

The Lombard effect also occurs following [[laryngectomy]] when people following [[speech therapy]] talk with [[esophageal speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9924(88)90022-6 |vauthors=Zeine L, Brandt JF |title=The Lombard effect on alaryngeal speech |journal=J Commun Disord |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=373–83 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3183082 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0021-9924(88)90022-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==

The intelligibility of an individual's own vocalization can be adjusted with audio-vocal reflexes using their own hearing (private loop), or it can be adjusted indirectly in terms of how well listeners can hear the vocalization (public loop).&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; Both processes are involved in the Lombard effect.

===Private loop===
A speaker can regulate their vocalizations particularly its amplitude relative to background noise with reflexive auditory feedback. Such auditory feedback is known to maintain the production of vocalization since deafness affects the vocal acoustics of both humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.400107 |author=Waldstein RS |title=Effects of postlingual deafness on speech production: implications for the role of auditory feedback |journal=J. Acoust. Soc. Am. |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=2099–114 |date=November 1990 |pmid=2269726}}&lt;/ref&gt; and songbirds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Konishi M |title=Effects of deafening on song development in American robins and black-headed grosbeaks |journal=Z Tierpsychol |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=584–99 |date=August 1965 |pmid=5879978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing the auditory feedback also changes vocalization in human speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Siegel GM, Schork EJ, Pick HL, Garber SR |title=Parameters of auditory feedback |journal=J Speech Hear Res |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=473–5 |date=September 1982 |pmid=7176623 |url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7176623 |doi=10.1044/jshr.2503.473 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or bird song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leonardo A, Konishi M |title=Decrystallization of adult birdsong by perturbation of auditory feedback |journal=Nature |volume=399 |issue=6735 |pages=466–70 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10365958 |doi=10.1038/20933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neural circuits have been found in the [[brainstem]] that enable such reflex adjustment.&lt;ref name="Huge"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hage SR, Jürgens U, Ehret G |title=Audio-vocal interaction in the pontine brainstem during self-initiated vocalization in the squirrel monkey |journal=Eur. J. Neurosci. |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=3297–308 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16820019 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04835.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0953-816X&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=3297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public loop===
A speaker can regulate their vocalizations at higher cognitive level in terms of observing its consequences on their audience’s ability to hear it.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;  In this auditory self-monitoring adjusts vocalizations in terms of learnt associations of what features of their vocalization, when made in noise, create effective and efficient communication.  The Lombard effect has been found to be greatest upon those words that are important to the listener to understand a speaker suggesting such cognitive effects are important.&lt;ref name="Patel"/&gt;

===Development===
Both private and public loop processes exist in children. There is a [[child development|development]] shift however from the Lombard effect being linked to acoustic self-monitoring in young children to the adjustment of vocalizations to aid its intelligibility for others in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amazi DK, Garber SR |title=The Lombard sign as a function of age and task |journal=J Speech Hear Res |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=581–5 |date=December 1982 |pmid=7162159 |url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7162159 |doi=10.1044/jshr.2504.581 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
The Lombard effect depends upon audio-vocal neurons in the periolivary region of the [[superior olivary complex]] and the adjacent pontine [[reticular formation]].&lt;ref name="Huge"/&gt; It has been  suggested that the Lombard effect might also involve the higher cortical areas&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; that control these lower brainstem areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jürgens U |title=The neural control of vocalization in mammals: a review |journal=J Voice |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18207362 |doi=10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.07.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-1997(07)00092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choral singing==

[[Choir|Choral singer]]s  experience reduced  [[feedback]] due to the sound of other singers upon their own voice.&lt;ref name="tomkinson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0892-1997(05)80316-9 |author=Tonkinson S |title=The Lombard effect in choral singing |journal=J Voice |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=24–9 |date=March 1994 |pmid=8167784 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-1997(05)80316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a tendency for people in choruses to sing at a louder level if it is not controlled by a [[conducting|conductor]]. Trained soloists can control this effect but it has been suggested that after a concert they might speak more  loudly in noisy surroundings, such as after-concert parties.&lt;ref name="tomkinson"/&gt;

The Lombard effect also occurs to those playing instruments such as the [[guitar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.381900 |vauthors=Johnson CI, Pick HL, Garber SR, Siegel GM |title=Intensity of guitar playing as a function of auditory feedback |journal=J.

==Animal vocalization==

Noise has been found to affect the vocalizations of animals that vocalize  against a background of human [[noise pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brumm H.|author2=Slabbekoorn H. |title=Acoustic communication in noise|journal=In: Advances in the Study of Behavior|year=2005|volume=35|pages=151–209|doi=10.1016/S0065-3454(05)35004-2|series=Advances in the Study of Behavior|first1=H|isbn=978-0-12-004535-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Model-based specification''' is an approach to [[formal specification]] where the system specification is expressed as a [[system model|system state model]]. This state model is constructed using well-understood mathematical entities such as sets and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. System operations are specified by defining how they affect the state of the system model.

The most widely used notations for developing model-based specifications are [[VDM specification language|VDM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced Zed, not Zee). These notations are based on typed [[set theory]]. Systems are therefore modelled using sets and relations between sets.

Another well-known approach to formal specification is [[algebraic specification]].

It is also called "cellular vampirism" as the predatory [[cell (biology)|cell]] pierces the [[cell wall]] and/or [[cell membrane]] of the prey cell with a feeding tube, the '''conoid''', sucks out the cellular content and digests it.

Myzocytosis is found in [[Myzozoa]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-5d35e684-a832-3187-bc57-5f3d2ba06a04&lt;/ref&gt; and also in some species of [[Ciliophora]] (both comprise the [[alveolate]]s). A classic example of myzocytosis is the feeding method of the infamous predatory ciliate, ''[[Didinium]]'', where it is often depicted devouring a hapless ''[[Paramecium]]''.  The [[suctoria]]n [[ciliate]]s were originally thought to have fed exclusively through myzocytosis, sucking out the cytoplasm of prey via superficially [[drinking straw]]-like pseudopodia.  It is now understood that suctorians do not feed through myzocytosis, but actually, instead, manipulate and envenomate captured prey with their tentacle-like pseudopodia.&lt;ref name=Rudzinska1973&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Rudzinska | first1 = M.

Species use restricted [[ecological niche]]s, and the niches of all species are '''segregated''', often with much overlap, by the use of different habitats, different geographic areas and seasons, and different food resources, to mention only a few of the many niche dimensions. The causes of niche restriction and segregation are important problems in evolutionary ecology.

==Background==
Two ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called “classical” ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because “neighbouring” species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of [[natural selection]] introduced by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as an explanation for evolution.

The other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many [[vacant niches]]. It is based on many empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1980. Warum sind ökologische Nischen begrenzt?  Zwischenartlicher Antagonismus oder innerartlicher Zusammenhalt?  Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 33, 98-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 2005a. Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt; and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S.A. 1993. The origins of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution. Oxford University Press, New York Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances.

Both paradigms agree that species are never “universal” in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, ''Toxoplasma'' (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including humans, ''Enterobius vermicularis'' infects only humans.

The following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:

== Niche restriction ==

# Species must be specialized in order to survive. They may survive for a while in less optimal habitats under favourable conditions, but they will be extinguished when conditions become less favourable, for example due to changed weather conditions (this aspect was especially emphasized by Price 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Price, P. W. 1983. Communities of specialists: vacant niches in ecological and evolutionary time. In Strong, D., Simberloff, D. and Abele, L. Eds.. Ecological Communities: Conceptual Issues and the Evidence. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Niches remain narrow or become narrower as the result of natural selection in order to enhance the chances of mating. This “mating theory of niche restriction” &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1977. A non-competitive mechanism responsible for restricting niches.  Zoologischer Anzeiger 199, 164-172.&lt;/ref&gt; is supported by the observation that niches of asexual stages are often wider than those of sexually mature stages; that niches become narrower at the time of mating; and that microhabitats of sessile species and of species with small population sizes often are narrower than those of non-sessile species and of species with large population sizes.

== Niche segregation ==

# The random selection of niches in largely empty niche space will often automatically lead to segregation (this mechanism is of particular importance in the second paradigm).
# Niches are segregated due to interspecific competition (this mechanism is of particular importance in the first paradigm).
# Niches of similar species are segregated (as the result of natural selection) in order to prevent interspecific hybridisation, because hybrids are less fit. (Many cases of niche segregation explained by interspecific competition are better explained by this mechanism, i.e., “[[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement of reproductive barriers]]”) (e.g., Rohde 2005b).&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"/&gt;

==Relative significance of the mechanisms==

Both paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. – Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that [[interspecific competition]] is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984)&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha,H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1954. The distribution and abundance of animals. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1984. The ecological web. University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don’t even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1974. Habitat heterogeneity and avian community structure in North American grasslands. American Midland Naturalist 91,195-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1984. Resource systems, populations, and communities. In: Price, P.W., Slobodchikoff, C.N. and Gaud, W.S. Eds. A new ecology. Novel approaches to interactive systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, pp. 397-436.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Connell, J.H. 1980. Diversity and the coevolution of competitors, or the ghost of competition past. Oikos 35, 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt; found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, J.S.F. 1983. Interspecific competition. In: Ashburner, M., Carson, H.L. and Thompson, jr., J.N. Ed. The genetics and biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, London, pp. 285-341.&lt;/ref&gt; in his review of competition in ''Drosophila'' and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. – Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Kawano, K. 2002. Character displacement in giant rhinoceros beetles. American Naturalist 159, 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs.  This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models.  Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1991.

An '''oriscus''' is a type of [[neume]] found in [[gregorian chant]].{{Verifysource|date=January 2016}} &lt;br/&gt;
[[File:OriscusMain.tif]]

It is a single neume, meaning it represents one pitch, unlike a compound neume, representing a sequence of more than one pitch.

It is considered an ornamental neume, like the [[strophicus]], [[quilisma]], [[salicus]], and [[pressus]], but the original meaning of the ornament is unclear. It is usually found added to another neume as an auxiliary note. Some modern chant editions replace the sign with a regular [[Neume|punctum]]. 

It is found in the chant manuscripts of St. Gall, Northern Spain, Catalonia, Bologna, Breton, England, Metz, and Aquitaine, but not in those of Toledo. Wagner suggested the neume involved intervals of less than a [[semitone]] (i.e. [[microtone]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=P.|title=Neumenkunde: Paläographie des liturgischen Gesangs|year=1905|location=Fribourg}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars dispute this. For Cardine, it implied tension on the following note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cardine|first=E.|title=Seminologia gregoriana|year=1970|publisher=Solesmes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is possibly derived from the Greek ''horos'' "limit" or ''oriskos'' "little hill."

[[File:Iron powder.JPG|thumb|[[Iron powder]] is commonly used for [[sintering]]]]
'''Powder metallurgy''' ('''PM''') is a term covering a wide range of ways in which materials or components are made from [[metal powders]]. PM processes can avoid, or greatly reduce, the need to use [[subtractive manufacturing|metal removal processes]], thereby drastically reducing yield losses in manufacture and often resulting in lower costs.

Powder metallurgy is also used to make unique materials impossible to get from melting or forming in other ways. A very important product of this type is [[tungsten carbide]] (WC). WC is used to cut and form other metals and is made from WC particles bonded with cobalt. It is very widely used in industry for tools of many types and globally ~50,000t/yr is made by PM. Other products include [[Sintering|sinter]]ed filters, porous oil-impregnated bearings, electrical contacts and diamond tools.

Since the advent of industrial production–scale metal powder–based [[additive manufacturing]] (AM) in the 2010s, [[selective laser sintering]] and other metal AM processes are a new category of commercially important powder metallurgy applications.

==Overview==
The powder metallurgy press and [[sintering|sinter]] process generally consists of three basic steps: powder blending (pulverisation), die compaction, and sintering. Compaction is generally performed at room temperature, and the elevated-temperature process of sintering is usually conducted at atmospheric pressure and under carefully controlled atmosphere composition. Optional secondary processing such as [[Coining (metalworking)|coining]] or [[heat treatment]] often follows to obtain special properties or enhanced precision.&lt;ref&gt;DeGarmo, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the older such methods, and still one used to make around 1Mt/yr of structural components of iron-based alloys, is the process of blending fine (&lt;180 microns) metal (normally iron) powders with additives such as a lubricant wax, [[carbon]], [[copper]], and/or [[nickel]], pressing them into a die of the desired shape, and then heating the compressed material ("green part") in a controlled atmosphere to bond the material by sintering. This produces precise parts, normally very close to the die dimensions, but with 5-15% porosity, and thus sub-wrought steel properties.  There are several other PM processes which have been developed over the last fifty years. These include:
* Powder forging. A "preform" made by the conventional "press and sinter" method is heated and then [[forging|hot forged]] to full density, resulting in practically as-wrought properties.
* Hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Here the powder (normally gas atomized, spherical type) is filled into a mould, normally consisting of a metallic "can" of suitable shape. The can is vibrated, then evacuated and sealed.  It is then placed in a hot isostatic press, where it is heated to a [[homologous temperature]] of around 0.7, and subjected to an external gas pressure of ~100MPa (1000bar, 15,000psi) for 10-100minutes. This results in a shaped part of full density with as-wrought or better, properties. HIP was invented in the 1950-60s and entered tonnage production in the 1970-80s.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for physical properties of products |date=November 2016}} In 2015, it was used to produce ~25,000t/yr of stainless and tool steels, as well as important parts of superalloys for jet engines.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for tonnage produced in 2015 |date=November 2016}} 
* Metal injection moulding (MIM).  Here the powder, normally very fine (&lt;25microns) and spherical, is mixed with plastic or wax binder to near the maximum solid loading, typically around 65vol%, and injection moulded to form a "green" part of complex geometry. This part is then heated or otherwise treated to remove the binder (debinding) to give a "brown" part. This part is then sintered, and shrinks by ~18% to give a complex and 97-99% dense finished part. Invented in the 1970s, production has increased since 2000 with an estimated global volume in 2014 of 12,000t worth €1265millions.&lt;ref&gt;EPMA PM data 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electric current assisted sintering (ECAS) technologies rely on electric currents to densify powders, with the advantage of reducing production time dramatically (from 15 minutes of the slowest ECAS to a few microseconds of the fastest), not requiring a long furnace heat and allowing near theoretical densities but with the drawback of simple shapes. Powders employed in ECAS can avoid binders thanks to the possibility of direct sintering, without the need of pre-pressing and a green compact. Molds are designed for the final part shape since the powders densify while filling the cavity under an applied pressure thus avoiding the problem of shape variations caused by non isotropic sintering and distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures. The most common of these technologies is [[hot pressing]], which has been under use for the production of the [[diamond tool]]s employed in the construction industry. [[Spark plasma sintering]] and [[electro sinter forging]] are two modern, industrial commercial ECAS technologies.
* Additive manufacturing (AM) is a relatively novel family of techniques which use metal powders (among other materials, such as plastics) to make parts by laser sintering or melting. This is a process under rapid development {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, and whether to classify it as a PM process is perhaps uncertain at this stage. Processes include [[3D printing]], [[selective laser sintering]] (SLS), [[selective laser melting]] (SLM), and [[electron beam melting]] (EBM).

==History and capabilities==
The history of powder metallurgy and the art of metal and [[ceramic]] [[sintering]] are intimately related to each other. Sintering involves the production of a hard solid metal or ceramic piece from a starting powder. The ancient Incas made jewelry and other artifacts from precious metal powders, though mass manufacturing of PM products did not begin until the mid- or late- 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;DeGarmo, p. 460. Tweaked to make sense.&lt;/ref&gt; In these early manufacturing operations, iron was extracted by hand from metal sponge following reduction and was then reintroduced as a powder for final melting or sintering.

A much wider range of products can be obtained from powder processes than from direct [[alloy]]ing of fused materials. In melting operations the "[[Gibbs' phase rule|phase rule]]" applies to all pure and combined elements and strictly dictates the distribution of liquid and solid [[phase (matter)|phase]]s which can exist for specific compositions. In addition, whole body melting of starting materials is required for alloying, thus imposing unwelcome chemical, thermal, and containment constraints on manufacturing. Unfortunately, the handling of aluminium/iron powders poses major problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sheasby| first= J. S.| title= Powder Metallurgy of Iron-Aluminum| journal= Intern. J. Powder Metallurgy and Powder Tech.| volume= 15| issue= 4|date=Oct 1979| pages= 301–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other substances that are especially reactive with atmospheric oxygen, such as [[titanium]], are sinterable in special atmospheres or with temporary coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Makhlouf, M. M.; Mould, A. M.; and Merchant, H. D.| title= Sintering of Chemically Preconditioned Tin Powder| journal= Intern. J. Powder Metallurgy and Powder Tech.| volume=15| issue= 3|date=July 1979| pages= 231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In powder metallurgy or ceramics it is possible to fabricate components which otherwise would decompose or disintegrate. All considerations of solid-liquid phase changes can be ignored, so powder processes are more flexible than [[casting]], [[extrusion]], or [[forging]] techniques. Controllable characteristics of products prepared using various powder technologies include mechanical, magnetic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Khan| first= M. K.| title= The Importance of Powder Particle Size and Flow Behavior in the Production of P/M Parts for Soft Magnetic Applications| journal= Intern. J. Powder Metallurgy and Powder Tech.| volume= 16| issue= 2|date=April 1980| pages= 123–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other unconventional properties of such materials as porous solids, aggregates, and intermetallic compounds. Competitive characteristics of manufacturing processing (e.g. tool wear, complexity, or vendor options) also may be closely controlled.

==Powder production techniques==
Any fusible material can be atomized. Several techniques have been developed which permit large production rates of powdered particles, often with considerable control over the size ranges of the final grain population. Powders may be prepared by crushing, grinding, chemical reactions, or electrolytic deposition.

Powders of the elements titanium, vanadium, thorium, niobium, tantalum, calcium, and uranium have been produced by high-temperature [[Redox|reduction]] of the corresponding [[nitride]]s and [[carbide]]s. Iron, nickel, uranium, and beryllium submicrometre powders are obtained by reducing metallic [[oxalate]]s and [[formate]]s. Exceedingly fine particles also have been prepared by directing a stream of molten metal through a high-temperature [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] jet or [[flame]],  atomizing the material. Various chemical and flame associated powdering processes are adopted in part to prevent serious degradation of particle surfaces by atmospheric oxygen.

In tonnage terms, the production of iron powders for PM structural part production dwarfs the production of all of the non-ferrous metal powders combined. Virtually all iron powders are produced by one of two processes: the sponge iron process or water atomization.

=== Sponge iron process ===
The longest established of these processes is the sponge iron process, the leading example of a family of processes involving solid state reduction of an oxide. In the process, selected magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) ore is mixed with coke and lime and placed in a silicon carbide retort. The filled retort is then heated in a kiln, where the reduction process leaves an iron “cake” and a slag. In subsequent steps, the retort is emptied, the reduced iron sponge is separated from the slag and is crushed and annealed.

The resultant powder is highly irregular in particle shape, therefore ensuring good “green strength” so that die-pressed compacts can be readily handled prior to sintering, and each particle contains internal pores (hence the term “sponge”) so that the good green strength is available at low compacted density levels.

Sponge iron provides the
feedstock for all iron-based self-lubricating bearings, and still accounts for around 30% of iron powder usage in PM structural parts.

=== Atomization ===
Atomization is accomplished by forcing a molten metal stream through an orifice at moderate pressures. A gas is introduced into the metal stream just before it leaves the nozzle, serving to create turbulence as the entrained gas expands (due to heating) and exits into a large collection volume exterior to the orifice. The collection volume is filled with gas to promote further turbulence of the molten metal jet. Air and powder streams are segregated using gravity or [[cyclonic separation]]. Most atomized powders are annealed, which helps reduce the oxide and carbon content. The water atomized particles are smaller, cleaner, and nonporous and have a greater breadth of size, which allows better compacting. The particles produced through this method are normally of spherical or pear shape. Usually, they also carry a layer of oxide over them.

There are three types of atomization:
* Liquid atomization
* Gas atomization
* Centrifugal atomization

Simple atomization techniques are available in which liquid metal is forced through an orifice at a sufficiently high velocity to ensure turbulent flow. The usual performance index used is the [[Reynolds number]] R = fvd/n, where f = fluid density, v = velocity of the exit stream, d = diameter of the opening, and n = absolute viscosity. At low R the liquid jet oscillates, but at higher velocities the stream becomes turbulent and breaks into droplets. Pumping energy is applied to droplet formation with very low efficiency (on the order of 1%) and control over the size distribution of the metal particles produced is rather poor. Other techniques such as nozzle vibration, nozzle asymmetry, multiple impinging streams, or molten-metal injection into ambient gas are all available to increase atomization efficiency, produce finer grains, and to narrow the particle size distribution. Unfortunately, it is difficult to eject metals through orifices smaller than a few millimeters in diameter, which in practice limits the minimum size of powder grains to approximately 10 μm. Atomization also produces a wide spectrum of particle sizes, necessitating downstream classification by screening and remelting a significant fraction of the grain boundary.

=== Centrifugal disintegration ===
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Centrifugal disintegration of molten particles offers one way around these problems. Extensive experience is available with iron, steel, and aluminium. Metal to be powdered is formed into a rod which is introduced into a chamber through a rapidly rotating spindle. Opposite the spindle tip is an electrode from which an arc is established which heats the metal rod. As the tip material fuses, the rapid rod rotation throws off tiny melt droplets which solidify before hitting the chamber walls. A circulating gas sweeps particles from the chamber.  Similar techniques could be employed in space or on the Moon. The chamber wall could be rotated to force new powders into remote collection vessels,&lt;ref name=DeGarmo&gt;{{cite book| last=DeGarmo| first= E. P.| title=Materials and Processes in Manufacturing| edition=5th| publisher= Macmillan| location= New York| year= 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the electrode could be replaced by a solar mirror focused at the end of the rod.

An alternative approach capable of producing a very narrow distribution of grain sizes but with low throughput consists of a rapidly spinning bowl heated to well above the melting point of the material to be powdered. Liquid metal, introduced onto the surface of the basin near the center at flow rates adjusted to permit a thin metal film to skim evenly up the walls and over the edge, breaks into droplets, each approximately the thickness of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jones| first= W. D.| title= Fundamental Principles of Powder Metallurgy| publisher= Edward Arnold Ltd.| location= London| year= 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===
Another powder-production technique involves a thin jet of liquid metal intersected by high-speed streams of atomized water which break the jet into drops and cool the powder before it reaches the bottom of the bin. In subsequent operations the powder is dried. This is called water atomization. The advantage of water atomization is that metal solidifies faster than by gas atomization since the heat capacity of water is some magnitudes higher than gases. Since the solidification rate is inversely proportional to the particle size, smaller particles can be made using water atomization. The smaller the particles, the more homogeneous the micro structure will be. Notice that particles will have a more irregular shape and the particle size distribution will be wider. In addition, some surface contamination can occur by oxidation skin formation. Powder can be reduced by some kind of pre-consolidation treatment, such as annealing used for the manufacture of ceramic tools.

==Powder compaction==
[[File:Rhodium powder pressed melted.jpg|thumb|[[Rhodium]] metal: powder, pressed pellet (3*10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; psi), remelted]]
[[Compaction of ceramic powders|Powder compaction]] is the process of compacting metal powder in a die through the application of high pressures. Typically the tools are held in the vertical orientation with the punch tool forming the bottom of the cavity. The powder is then compacted into a shape and then ejected from the die cavity.&lt;ref name="Todd, Robert H. 1994"/&gt; In a number of these applications the parts may require very little additional work for their intended use; making for very cost efficient manufacturing.

The density of the compacted powder increases with the amount of pressure applied. Typical pressures range from 80 psi to 1000 psi (0.5&amp;nbsp;MPa to 7&amp;nbsp;MPa), pressures from 1000 psi to 1,000,000 psi have been obtained. Pressure of 10 tons/in² to 50 tons/in² (150&amp;nbsp;MPa to 700&amp;nbsp;MPa) are commonly used for metal powder compaction. To attain the same compression ratio across a component with more than one level or height, it is necessary to work with multiple lower punches. A cylindrical workpiece is made by single-level tooling. A more complex shape can be made by the common multiple-level tooling.

Production rates of 15 to 30 parts per minute are common.

There are four major classes of tool styles: single-action compaction, used for thin, flat components; opposed double-action with two punch motions, which accommodates thicker components; double-action with floating die; and double action withdrawal die. Double action classes give much better density distribution than single action. Tooling must be designed so that it will withstand the extreme pressure without deforming or bending. Tools must be made from materials that are polished and wear-resistant.

Better workpiece materials can be obtained by repressing and re-sintering.  Here is a table of some of the obtainable properties.

===Die pressing===
The dominant technology for the forming of products from powder materials, in terms of both tonnage quantities and numbers of parts produced, is die pressing. There are mechanical, servo-electrical and hydraulic presses available in the market, whereby the biggest powder throughput is processed by hydraulic presses.
This forming technology involves a production cycle comprising:

# Filling a die cavity with a known volume of the powder feedstock, delivered from a fill shoe. 
# Compaction of the powder within the die with punches to form the compact. Generally, compaction pressure is applied through punches from both ends of the toolset in order to reduce the level of density gradient within the compact. 
# Ejection of the compact from the die, using the lower punch(es) withdrawal from the die.
# Removal of the compact from the upper face of the die using the fill shoe in the fill stage of the next cycle, or an automation system or robot.

This cycle offers a readily automated and high production rate process.

===Design considerations===
Probably the most basic consideration is being able to remove the part from the die after it is pressed, along with avoiding sharp corners in the design. Keeping the maximum surface area below {{convert|20|sqin|m²}} and the height-to-diameter ratio below 7-to-1 is recommended. Along with having walls thicker than {{convert|0.08|in|mm}} and keeping the adjacent wall thickness ratios below 2.5-to-1.

One of the major advantages of this process is its ability to produce complex geometries. Parts with undercuts and threads require a secondary machining operation. Typical part sizes range from {{convert|0.1|sqin|cm2}} to {{convert|20|sqin|cm2}}. in area and from {{convert|0.1|to|4|in|cm}} in length. However, it is possible to produce parts that are less than {{convert|0.1|sqin|cm2}} and larger than {{convert|25|sqin|cm2}}. in area and from a fraction of an inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm) to approximately {{convert|8|in|cm}} in length.

===Isostatic pressing===
In some pressing operations, such as [[hot isostatic pressing]] (HIP) compact formation and sintering occur simultaneously. This procedure, together with explosion-driven compressive techniques, is used extensively in the production of high-temperature and high-strength parts such as turbine disks for jet engines. In most applications of powder metallurgy the compact is hot-pressed, heated to a temperature above which the materials cannot remain work-hardened. Hot pressing lowers the pressures required to reduce porosity and speeds welding and grain deformation processes. It also permits better dimensional control of the product, lessens sensitivity to physical characteristics of starting materials, and allows powder to be compressed to higher densities than with cold pressing, resulting in higher strength. Negative aspects of hot pressing include shorter die life, slower throughput because of powder heating, and the frequent necessity for protective atmospheres during forming and cooling stages.

==Isostatic powder compacting==
Isostatic powder compacting is a mass-conserving shaping process. Fine metal particles are placed into a flexible mould and then high gas or fluid pressure is applied to the mould.  The resulting article is then sintered in a furnace which increases the strength of the part by bonding the metal particles. This manufacturing process produces very little scrap metal and can be used to make many different shapes. The tolerances that this process can achieve are very precise, ranging from +/- 0.008&amp;nbsp;inches (0.2&amp;nbsp;mm) for axial dimensions and +/- 0.020&amp;nbsp;inches (0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) for radial dimensions.  This is the most efficient type of powder compacting (the following subcategories are also from this reference).&lt;ref name="Todd, Robert H. 1994"&gt;Todd, Robert H., Allen, Dell K., Alting, Leo, "Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide", 1st Edition, Industrial Press Inc., New York 1994, {{ISBN|0-8311-3049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This operation is generally applicable on small production quantities, as it is more costly to run due to its slow operating speed and the need for expendable tooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pickpm.com/designcenter/isostatic.asp?locarr=2|1|2|2 PICKPM.COM: A Powder Metallurgy Information Resource&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712211507/http://www.pickpm.com/designcenter/isostatic.asp?locarr=2%7C1%7C2%7C2 |date=2016-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compacting pressures range from {{convert|15000|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}} to {{convert|40000|psi|abbr=on}} for most metals and approximately {{convert|2000|psi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10000|psi|abbr=on}} for non-metals.  The density of isostatic compacted parts is 5% to 10% higher than with other powder metallurgy processes.

===Equipment===
There are many types of equipment used in isostatic powder compacting.  There is the mold, which is flexible, a pressure mold that contains the mold, and the machine delivering the pressure.  There are also devices to control the amount of pressure and how long the pressure is held. The machines need to apply pressures from {{convert|15,000|to|40,000|psi|MPa}} for metals.

===Geometrical possibilities===
Typical workpiece sizes range from {{convert|0.25|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|0.75|in|2|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|0.5|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|in|0|abbr=on}} long. It is possible to compact workpieces that are between {{convert|0.0625|in|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5|in|0|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|0.0625|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|40|in|0|abbr=on}} long.

===Tool style===
Isostatic tools are available in three styles, free mold (wet-bag), coarse mold (damp-bag) and fixed mold (dry-bag).  The free mold style is the traditional style of isostatic compaction and is not generally used for high production work. In free mold tooling the mold is removed and filled outside the canister. Damp bag is where the mold is located in the canister, yet filled outside. In fixed mold tooling, the mold is contained within the canister, which facilitates automation of the process.

===Hot isostatic pressing===
{{Main|Hot isostatic pressing}}

Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) compresses and sinters the part simultaneously by applying heat ranging from 900&amp;nbsp;°F (480&amp;nbsp;°C) to 2250&amp;nbsp;°F (1230&amp;nbsp;°C). [[Argon]] gas is the most common gas used in HIP because it is an inert gas, thus prevents chemical reactions during the operation.

===Cold isostatic pressing===
Cold isostatic pressing (CIP) uses fluid as a means of applying pressure to the mold at room temperature. After removal the part still needs to be sintered.
It is helpful in distributing pressure uniformly over the compaction material contained in a rubber bag.

===Design considerations===
Advantages over standard powder compaction are the possibility of thinner walls and larger workpieces. Height to diameter ratio has no limitation. No specific limitations exist in wall thickness variations, [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercuts]], reliefs, threads, and cross holes. No lubricants are need for isostatic powder compaction. The minimum wall thickness is 0.05&amp;nbsp;inches (1.27&amp;nbsp;mm) and the product can have a weight between 40 and 300 pounds (18 and 136&amp;nbsp;kg). There is 25 to 45% shrinkage of the powder after compacting.

==Sintering==
{{Contradicts other|date=February 2010|1=Sintering}}
{{Main|Sintering}}
Solid state sintering is the process of taking metal in the form of a powder and placing it into a mold or die.  Once compacted into the mold the material is placed under a high heat for a long period of time.  Under heat, bonding takes place between the porous aggregate particles and once cooled the powder has bonded to form a solid piece.

Sintering can be considered to proceed in three stages. During the first, neck growth proceeds rapidly but powder particles remain discrete. During the second, most densification occurs, the structure recrystallizes and particles diffuse into each other. During the third, isolated pores tend to become spheroidal and densification continues at a much lower rate. The words "solid state" in solid state sintering simply refer to the state the material is in when it bonds, solid meaning the material was not turned molten to bond together as alloys are formed.&lt;ref&gt;F. Thummler and W. Thomma, "The Sintering Process," Metallurgical Reviews No. 115, June (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

One recently developed technique for high-speed sintering involves passing high electric current through a powder to preferentially heat the [[Asperity (material science)|asperities]]. Most of the energy serves to melt that portion of the compact where migration is desirable for densification; comparatively little energy is absorbed by the bulk materials and forming machinery. Naturally, this technique is not applicable to electrically insulating powders.

To allow efficient stacking of product in the furnace during sintering and prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using [[ceramic powder separator sheet]]s.  These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia, and magnesia.  They are also available in fine, medium, and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the wares being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced, while maximizing furnace loading per batch.

==Continuous powder processing==
The phrase "continuous process" should be used only to describe modes of manufacturing which could be extended indefinitely in time. Normally, however, the term refers to processes whose products are much longer in one physical dimension than in the other two. Compression, rolling, and extrusion are the most common examples.

In a simple compression process, powder flows from a bin onto a two-walled channel and is repeatedly compressed vertically by a horizontally stationary punch. After stripping the compress from the conveyor, the compacted mass is introduced into a sintering furnace. An even easier approach is to spray powder onto a moving belt and sinter it without compression. However, good methods for stripping cold-pressed materials from moving belts are hard to find. One alternative that avoids the belt-stripping difficulty altogether is the manufacture of metal sheets using opposed [[hydraulic ram]]s, although weakness lines across the sheet may arise during successive press operations.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}}

Powders can also be rolled to produce sheets.  The powdered metal is fed into a two-high{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} rolling mill, and is compacted into strip form at up to {{convert|100|ft/min|m/s|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Manufacturing Engineering and Technology fifth edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The strip is then sintered and subjected to another rolling and further sintering.  Rolling is commonly used to produce sheet metal for electrical and electronic components, as well as [[coin]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Considerable work also has been done on rolling multiple layers of different materials simultaneously into sheets.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Extrusion processes are of two general types. In one type, the powder is mixed with a binder or [[plasticizer]] at room temperature; in the other, the powder is extruded at elevated temperatures without fortification.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} Extrusions with binders are used extensively in the preparation of tungsten-carbide composites. Tubes, complex sections, and spiral drill shapes are manufactured in extended lengths and diameters varying from {{convert|0.5|–|300|mm}}. Hard metal wires of {{convert|0.1|mm}} diameter have been drawn from powder stock. At the opposite extreme, large extrusions on a tonnage basis may be feasible.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2018}}
For softer, easier to form metals such as aluminium and copper alloys continuous extrusion may also be performed using processes such as Conform or Continuous Rotary Extrusion. These processes use a rotating wheel with a groove around it's circumference to drive the loose powder through a forming die. Through a combination of high pressure and a complex strain path the powder particles deform, generate a large amount of frictional heat and bond together to form a bulk solid. Theoretically fully continuous operation is possible as long as the powder can be fed into the process.

There appears to be no limitation to the variety of metals and alloys that can be extruded, provided the temperatures and pressures involved are within the capabilities of die materials. Extrusion lengths may range from 3–30&amp;nbsp;m and diameters from 0.2–1&amp;nbsp;m. Modern presses are largely automatic and operate at high speeds (on the order of m/s).

==Shock (dynamic) consolidation==
Shock consolidation, or dynamic consolidation, is an experimental technique of consolidating powders using high pressure shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vreeland, Jr., P. Kasiraj, Thomas J. Ahrens, and R.B. Schwartz (1983). "Shock Consolidation of Poders--Theory and Experiment. Proc. 1983 Materials Research Society Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Meyers and S.L. Wang (1988). "An Improved Method for Shock Consolidation of Powders." Acta Metall. Vol. 36 No. 4, pp 925-936.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are commonly produced by impacting the workpiece with an explosively accelerated plate.  Despite being researched for a long time, the technique still has some problems in controlability and uniformity. However, it offers some valuable potential advantages.  As an example, consolidation occurs so rapidly that metastable microstructures may be retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vassiliou | first1 = Marius | last2 = Rhodes | first2 = C. G. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = M. R. | last4 = Graves | first4 = J. A. | year = 1989 | title = Metastable Microstructure in Dynamically Consolidated g Titanium Aluminide | url = | journal = Scripta Metallurgica | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 1791–1794 | doi=10.1016/0036-9748(89)90362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric current assisted sintering==
These techniques employ electric currents to drive or enhance sintering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927796X08000995 |title=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports : Consolidation/synthesis of materials by electric current activated/assisted sintering |publisher=ScienceDirect |accessdate=2011-09-30 |doi=10.1016/j.mser.2008.09.003 |volume=63 |issue=4–6 |journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports |pages=127–287 | last1 = Orrù | first1 = Roberto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a combination of electric currents and mechanical pressure powders sinter more rapidly thereby reducing the sintering time compared to conventional thermal solutions. The techniques can be divided into two main categories: resistance sintering, which incorporates [[spark plasma sintering]] and [[hot pressing]]; and electric discharge sintering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10853-013-7805-8 |title=Journal of Materials ScienceElectric pulse consolidation: an alternative to spark plasma sintering
 |publisher=Springer |accessdate=2014-10-23 |doi=10.1007/s10853-013-7805-8 |volume=49 |journal=Journal of Materials Science |pages=952–985 | last1 = Yurlova | first1 = M. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[capacitor discharge sintering]] or its derivative, [[electro sinter forging]]. Resistance sintering techniques are consolidation methods based on temperature, where heating of the mold and of the powders is accomplished through electric currents, usually with a characteristic processing time of 15 to 30 minutes.  On the other hand, electric discharge sintering methods rely on high-density currents (from 0.1 to 1 kA/mm^2) to directly sinter electrically conductive powders, with a characteristic time between tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds.

==Special products==
Many special products are possible with powder metallurgy technology. A nonexhaustive list includes Al&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; whiskers coated with very thin oxide layers for improved refraction; iron compacts with Al&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; coatings for improved high-temperature creep strength; [[light bulb]] filaments made with powder technology; linings for friction brakes; metal glasses for high-strength films and ribbons; [[heat shield]]s for spacecraft reentry into Earth's atmosphere; electrical contacts for handling large current flows; [[magnet]]s; [[microwave]] [[Ferrite core#Ferrites|ferrites]]; filters for gases; and [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s which can be infiltrated with [[lubricant]]s.

Extremely thin films and tiny spheres exhibit high strength. One application of this observation is to coat brittle materials in whisker form with a submicrometre film of much softer metal (e.g. [[cobalt]]-coated tungsten). The surface strain of the thin layer places the harder metal under compression, so that when the entire composite is sintered the rupture strength increases markedly. With this method, strengths on the order of 2.8&amp;nbsp;GPa versus 550&amp;nbsp;MPa have been observed for, respectively, coated (25% cobalt) and uncoated [[tungsten carbide]]s.

==Hazards==
{{expand section|date=July 2015}}
The special materials and processes used in powder metallurgy can pose hazards to life and property. The high [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] of the powders can increase their [[chemical reactivity]] in biological exposures (for example, inhalation or ingestion), and increases the risk of [[dust explosion]]s. Materials considered relatively benign in bulk can pose special toxicological risks when in a finely divided form.

{{Rape}}
A '''rape fantasy''' (sometimes referred to as '''rapeplay''') or a '''ravishment''' is a [[sexual fantasy]] involving imagining or pretending being coerced or coercing another into [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. In [[sexual roleplay]], it involves acting out roles of [[Rape|coercive sex]]. [[Rape pornography]] is literature or images associated with rape and sometimes [[Stockholm syndrome]] as a means of [[sexual arousal]].

== Fantasy ==
Studies have found rape fantasy is a common sexual fantasy among both men and women. The fantasy may involve the fantasist as either the one being forced into sex or being the perpetrator. A 1974 study by Hariton and Singer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Specific Sexual Fantasy Themes: A Multidimensional Study |author1=William B. Arndt, Jr. |author2=John C. Foehl |author3=F. Elaine Good |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.2.472 |date=1985 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=472–480 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that being "overpowered or forced to surrender" was the second most frequent fantasy in their survey; a 1984 study by Knafo and Jaffe ranked being overpowered as their study's most common fantasy during intercourse. In 1985, Louis H. Janda who is an associate professor of psychology at [[Old Dominion University]]&lt;ref&gt;no author. (2005, April 6) Louis H. Janda Associate Professor of Psychology. Retrieved on August 9, 2015, from [http://ww2.sci.odu.edu/psychology/directory/janda.shtml link]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the sexual fantasy of being raped is the most common sexual fantasy for women.&lt;!-- This is in the middle of page 334.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janda, L.H. (1985). How to live with an imperfect person. USA: Wellness Institute, Inc. {{ISBN|1-58741-007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 study by Pelletier and Herold found that over half of their female respondents had fantasies of forced sex.&lt;!--This is in the left-middle of page 125.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. (2001). Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings. Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press. {{ISBN|1-84169-018-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequently cited hypothesis for why women fantasize of being forced and coerced into some sexual activity is that the fantasy avoids societally induced guilt—the woman does not have to admit responsibility for her sexual desires and behavior. A 1978 study by Moreault and Follingstad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://uknowledge.uky.edu/crvaw_facpub/53/ |title=Sexual Fantasies of Females as a Function of Sex Guilt and Experimenta |author1=Denise Moreault |author2=Diane R. Follingstad |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.46.6.1385 |date=1978 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1385–1393 |pmid=730888 |accessdate=2014-06-16 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was consistent with this hypothesis, and found that women with high levels of sex guilt were more likely to report fantasy themed around being overpowered, dominated, and helpless. In contrast, Pelletier and Herold used a different measure of guilt and found no correlation. Other research suggests that women who report forced sex fantasies have a more positive attitude towards sexuality, contradicting the guilt hypothesis.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=405}} A 1998 study by Strassberg and Lockerd found that women who fantasized about force were generally less guilty and more [[erotophilia|erotophilic]], and as a result had more frequent and varied fantasies. However, it said that force fantasies are not the most common or the most frequent.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=416}}

45.8% of men in a 1980 study reported fantasizing during heterosexual [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] about "a scene where [they had] the impression of being raped by a woman" (3.2% often and 42.6% sometimes), 44.7% of scenes where a seduced woman "pretends resisting" and 33% of raping a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crépault C, Couture M |title=Men's erotic fantasies |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |year=1980 |pmid=7458662 |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male sexual fantasy of raping a woman may bring sexual arousal either from imagining a scene in which first a woman objects but then comes to like and eventually participate in the intercourse, or else one in which the woman does not like it and arousal is associated with the idea of hurting the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arousal: The Secret Logic of Sexual Fantasies |last=Bader |first=Michael J. |year=2003 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |location= |isbn=0-312-30242-8 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of college-age women in 1998 found over half had engaged in fantasies of rape or coercion which, another study suggests, are simply "open and unrestricted" expressions of [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Force in Women's Sexual Fantasies |last=Strassberg |first=Donald S. |last2=Locker |first2=Lisa K. |year=1998 |journal=Arch Sex Behav |issn=1573-2800 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=403–414 |doi=10.1023/A:1018740210472 |pmid=9681121 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roleplay ==
One form of [[sexual roleplay]]ing is the rape fantasy, also called ravishment or forced sex roleplay. In [[BDSM]] circles (and occasionally outside these circles as well), some people choose to roleplay rape scenes—with communication, consent and safety being especially crucial elements. Though consent is a crucial component of any sexual roleplay, the illusion of non-consent (i.e. rape) is important to maintaining this type of fantasy. Due to this, the usage of a [[safeword]] is a logical safety measure, given that words that would normally halt sexual activity (i.e. stop) are often disregarded in these scenes. Continuing with the sexual roleplay after a safeword has been used constitutes [[sexual assault|assault]], as the use of a safeword indicates the withdrawal of consent.

'''Red tide''' is a common name for a worldwide phenomenon known as an [[algae bloom]] (large concentrations of aquatic microorganisms—protozoans or unicellular algae) when it is caused by species of [[dinoflagellate]]s and other algae. The upwelling of nutrients from the sea floor from massive storms is most likely the cause of these events.

== Overview ==
Certain species of phytoplankton and dinoflagellates found in red tides contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from brown to red. When the algae are present in high concentrations, the water appears to be discolored or murky, varying in color from a rust color to pink to blood red. Specifically, red tide species can be found in oceans, bays, and places where fresh water meets salt water, but they can not thrive in freshwater environments due to the lack of salinity. The growth of the algal bloom depends on wind, temperature, nutrients, and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, Frank. "An Assessment of Florida red tide: Causes, Consequences and Management Strategies." 2007. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some red tide algal blooms are associated with fish kills. The production of natural toxins such as [[brevetoxin]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/health/brevetoxin.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723194047/http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/health/brevetoxin.pdf# |archive-date=2017-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ichthyotoxins are harmful to marine life. Generally, red tides are described as [[harmful algal bloom]]s. The most conspicuous effects of these kinds of red tides are the associated wildlife mortalities, as well as harmful human exposure.

== Harmful toxins produced by the red tide ==

=== Marine life exposure ===
Red tides occur naturally off coasts all over the world. Not all red tides have toxins or are harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=47320&amp;pt=10&amp;p=18553|title=Red Tides: Questions and Answers|last=Gregg W. Langlois|first=Pamela D. Tom|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where red tides occur, dead fish wash up on shore for up to two weeks after a red tide has been through the area. In addition to killing fish, the toxic algae contaminate shellfish. Some mollusks are not susceptible to the toxin, and store it in their fatty tissues. Shellfish consume the organisms responsible for red tide and concentrate [[saxitoxin]] (produced from these organisms) in their tissues. Saxitoxin blocks [[sodium channel]]s and ingestion can cause [[paralysis]] within 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml#q9|title=Red Tide FAQ – Is it safe to eat oysters during a red tide?|publisher=www.tpwd.state.tx.us|accessdate=2009-08-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals that eat the shellfish are susceptible to the neurotoxin, leading to neurotoxic shellfish poisoning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sharon M. |last1=Watkins |first2=Andrew |last2=Reich |first3=Lora E. |last3=Fleming |first4=Roberta |last4=Hammond |title=Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning |journal=Marine Drugs |year=2008 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.3390/md20080021 |pmid=19005578 |pmc=2579735}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes even death. Most mollusks and clams filter feed, which results in higher concentrations of the toxin than just drinking the water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brand et al., Larry E., Lisa Campbell, Eileen Bresnan. "Karenia: The biology and ecology of a toxic genus." Harmful Algae 14 (2012): 156–178. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scaup]], for example, are [[diving ducks]] whose diet mainly consists of mollusks. When scaup eat the filter-feeding shellfish that are concentrated with high levels of the red tide toxin, their population along with other types of diving ducks become a prime target for poisoning. However, even birds that do not eat mollusks can be affected by simply eating dead fish on the beach or drinking the water, as in the Peking duck experiment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Forrester et al., Donald J., Jack M. Gaskin, Franklin H. White. "AN EPIZOOTIC OF WATERFOWL IN FLORIDA." Journal of Wildlife Diseases 13 (1997): 160–167.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2018}} The toxins released by the blooms can kill marine animals including [[dolphin]]s, sea turtles, birds, and [[Manatee|manatees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://start1.org/red-tide/effects/ | title=Red Tide &amp; Red Algae Effects | date=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/aquatic-toxins/_documents/red-tide-rack-card-2014-two-up-897kb.pdf | title=Top 10 Red Tide Facts |publisher=Florida Department of Health | date=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine dinoflagellates produce ichthyotoxins. Fish such as Atlantic herring, American pollock, winter flounder, Atlantic salmon, and cod were dosed orally with these toxins in an experiment. Within minutes of receiving doses of the toxin, fish started to exhibit a loss of equilibrium and began to swim in an irregular, jerking pattern followed by paralysis and shallow, arrhythmic breathing and eventually death after about an hour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;White, A. W. "Sensitivity of Marine Fishes to Toxins from the Red-Tide Dinoflagellate Gonyaulax excavata and Implications for Fish Kills." Marine Biology 65 (1981): 255–260. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists concluded that the toxic red tide had negative effects on fish that were exposed to it.

=== Human exposure ===
Humans are affected by the red tide species by ingesting improperly harvested shellfish, breathing in aerosolized brevetoxins (i.e. PbTx or ''Ptychodiscus'' toxins) and in some cases skin contact. The brevetoxins bind to [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s, important structures of cell membranes. Binding results in persistent activation of nerve cells, which interferes with neural transmission leading to health problems. These toxins are created within the unicellular organism, or as a metabolic product.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10646-008-0241-x|pmid=18758951|pmc=2683401|title=Harmful algal toxins of the Florida red tide (Karenia brevis): Natural chemical stressors in South Florida coastal ecosystems|journal=Ecotoxicology|volume=17|issue=7|pages=623–631|year=2008|last1=Pierce|first1=R. H.|last2=Henry|first2=M. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major types of brevetoxin compounds have similar but distinct backbone structures. PbTx-2 is the primary intracellular brevetoxin produced by ''K. brevis'' blooms. However, over time, the PbTx-2 brevetoxin can be converted to PbTx-3 through metabolic changes.&lt;ref name="doi.org" /&gt; Researchers found that PbTx-2 has been the primary intracellular brevetoxin that converts overtime into PbTx-3.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, R.H., M. S. Henry. "Harmful algal toxins of the Florida red tide (Karenia brevis): natural chemical stressors in South Florida coastal ecosystems." Ecotoxicology (2008): 623–631. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When the cells rupture, they release extracellular brevetoxins into the environment. Some of those stay in the ocean, while other particles get aerosolized. During onshore winds, brevetoxins can become aerosolized by bubble-mediated transport, causing respiratory irritation, bronchoconstriction, coughing, and wheezing, among other symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Backer et al., Lorraine C., Laura E. Flemming, Alan Rowan. "Recreational exposure to aerosolized brevetoxins during Florida red tide events." Harmful Algae 2 (2003): 19–28. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On a windy day,  avoiding contact with the aerosolized toxin is recommended. These individuals report a decrease in respiratory function after only 1 hour of exposure to a ''K. brevis'' red-tide beach and these symptoms may last for days.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming LE, Kirkpatrick B, Backer LC, et al. Initial evaluation of the effects of aerosolized Florida red tide toxins (brevetoxins) in persons with asthma. Environ Health Perspect. 2005;113:650–657.&lt;/ref&gt; People with severe or persistent respiratory conditions (such as chronic lung disease or asthma) may experience stronger adverse reactions.  The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Ocean Service]] provides a public conditions report identifying possible respiratory irritation impacts in areas affected by red tides.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/hab/|title=Harmful Algal Bloom Operational Forecast System|publisher=www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/hab/|accessdate=2012-02-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases like in the U.S., the seafood consumed by humans is tested regularly for toxins by the USDA to ensure safe consumption. However, improper harvesting of shellfish can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning in humans. Some symptoms include drowsiness, diarrhea, nausea, loss of motor control, tingling, numbing or aching of extremities, incoherence, and respiratory paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc=1637787|year=2000|last1=Van Dolah|first1=F. M.|title=Marine algal toxins: Origins, health effects, and their increased occurrence|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=108|issue=Suppl 1|pages=133–141|pmid=10698729|doi=10.1289/ehp.00108s1133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, reports of skin irritation after swimming in the ocean during a red tide are common, so people should try to avoid the red tide when it is in the area.

== Red tide ==
[[File:Karenia brevis Anatomy (1).png|thumb|The dinoflagellate labeled above is the microscopic alga'' [[Karenia brevis]]''. It is the cause of red tide in the Gulf of Mexico. The algae propel themselves using a longitudinal flagellum (A) and a transverse flagellum (B). The longitudinal flagellum lies in a groove-like structure called the cingulum (F). The [[dinoflagellate]] is separated into an upper portion called the epitheca (C) where the apical horn resides (E) and a lower portion called the hypotheca (D).]]

Red tide is a colloquial term used to refer to one of a variety of natural phenomena known as [[harmful algal bloom]]s. The term specifically refers to blooms of a species of [[dinoflagellate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hab/redtide/default.htm|title=Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs): Red Tide|publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being phased out among researchers because:

# Red tides are not necessarily red and many have no discoloration at all.
# They are unrelated to movements of the tides.
# The term is imprecisely used to refer to a wide variety of algal species that are known as bloom-formers.

As a technical term, it is being replaced in favor of more precise terminology, including the generic term "harmful algal bloom" for harmful species, and "algal bloom" for benign species.

=== On the U.S. coasts ===
The term red tide is most often used in the US to refer to ''Karenia brevis'' blooms in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]], also called the Florida red tide. ''K. brevis'' is one of many different species of the genus ''Karenia'' found in the world's oceans.
&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleming |first1=L.E. |last2=Kirkpatrick |first2=B. |last3=Backer |first3=L.C. |last4=Walsh |first4=C.J. |last5=Nierenberg |first5=K. |last6=Clark |first6=J. |last7=et al |date=2011 |title=Review of Florida red tide and human health effects |url= |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=224–233 |doi=10.1016/j.hal.2010.08.006|pmid=21218152 |pmc=3014608 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major advances have occurred  in the study of dinoflagellates and their genomics. Some include identification of the toxin-producing genes ([[Polyketide synthase|''PKS'']] genes), exploration of environmental changes (temperature, light/dark, etc.) have on gene expression, as well as an appreciation of the complexity of the ''Karenia'' genome.&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011" /&gt; These blooms have been documented since the 1800s, and occur almost annually along Florida's coasts.&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011" /&gt; There was increased research activity of HABs in the 1980s and 1990s. This was primarily driven by media attention from the discovery of new HAB organisms and the potential adverse health effects of their exposure to animals and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham and Baden, 2006; Backer et al., 2003a, 2005a; Backer and Fleming, 2008; Fleming et al., 2001; Fleming et al., 2004; Okamoto and Fleming, 2005; Twiner et al., 2008; Zaias et al., 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} The Florida red tides have been observed to have spread as far as the eastern coast of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011" /&gt; The density of these organisms during a bloom can exceed tens of millions of cells per litre of seawater, and often discolor the water a deep reddish-brown hue.

Red tide is also sometimes used to describe harmful algal blooms on the northeast coast of the United States, particularly in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. This type of bloom is caused by another species of dinoflagellate known as ''[[Alexandrium fundyense]]''. These blooms of organisms cause severe disruptions in [[fishery|fisheries]] of these waters, as the toxins in these organism cause filter-feeding shellfish in affected waters to become poisonous for human consumption due to saxitoxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/10/13/red-tide-fact-sheet-english.pdf |title=Red Tide (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015 |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Public Health |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related  ''[[Alexandrium monilatum]]'' is found in subtropical or tropical shallow seas and [[Estuary|estuaries]] in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Sea]], the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]].

=== Factors that may contribute to a bloom ===
[[File:Red tide.jpg|thumb|right|Red tide (NOAA)]]Red tides contain dense concentrations of organisms and appear as discolored water, often reddish-brown in color. It is a natural phenomenon, but the exact cause or combination of factors that result in a red tide outbreak are not necessarily known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml |title=Red Tide FAQ |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |location=Austin, TX |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, three key factors are thought to play an important role in a bloom - salinity, temperature, and wind. Red tides cause economic harm, so outbreaks are carefully monitored. For example, the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]]  provides an up-to-date status report on  red tides in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.myfwc.com/features/view_article.asp?id=9670 |title=Red Tide Current Status Statewide Information |publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822163316/http://research.myfwc.com/features/view_article.asp?id=9670 |archivedate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] also provides a status report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/ |title=Red Tide Index |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no  particular cause of red tides has been found,  many different factors can contribute to their presence. These factors can include [[water pollution]], which originates from sources such as human [[sewage]] and [[Agricultural pollution|agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name="West, L. 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.about.com/od/redtidesfaq/f/red_tide_causes.htm |title=Red Tide: Causes and Effects |author=West, L. |date=2016 |publisher=''About News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The occurrence of red tides in some locations appears to be entirely natural (algal blooms are a seasonal occurrence resulting from coastal upwelling, a natural result of the movement of certain ocean currents)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trainer |first1=VL |last2=Adams |first2=NG |last3=Bill |first3=BD |last4=Stehr |first4=CM |last5=Wekell |first5=JC |last6=Moeller |first6=P |last7=Busman |first7=M |last8=Woodruff |first8=D |year=2000 |title=Domoic acid production near California coastal upwelling zones, June (1998) |url = |journal=Limnol Oceanogr |volume=45 |issue= 8|pages=1818–1833 |doi=10.4319/lo.2000.45.8.1818|bibcode= 2000LimOc..45.1818T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=NG |last2=Lesoing |first2=M |last3=Trainer |first3=VL |year= 2000 |title=Environmental conditions associated with domoic acid in razor clams on the Washington coast |url= |journal=J Shellfish Res |volume=19 |issue= |pages=1007–1015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in others they appear to be a result of increased [[nutrient pollution]] from human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Lam CWY, Ho KC (1989) Red tides in Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong. In: Okaichi T, Anderson DM, Nemoto T (eds) Red tides. Biology, environmental science and toxicology. Elsevier, New York, pp 49–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of marine phytoplankton is generally limited by the availability of [[nitrates]] and [[phosphates]], which can be abundant in agricultural run-off as well as coastal upwelling zones. Coastal water pollution produced by humans and systematic increase in [[global warming|seawater temperature]] have also been implicated as contributing factors in red tides.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Other factors such as iron-rich dust influx from large desert areas such as the Sahara Desert are thought to play a major role in causing red tides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |display-authors=et al |year=2006 |title=Red tides in the Gulf of Mexico: Where, when, and why? |url=http://works.bepress.com/kendall_carder/7 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=111 |issue= C11003|pages=1–46 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002813 |pmid=20411040 |bibcode=2006JGRC..11111003W |pmc=2856968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some algal blooms on the Pacific Coast have also been linked to occurrences of large-scale climatic oscillations such as [[El Niño]] events. While red tides in the Gulf of Mexico have been occurring since the time of early explorers such as [[Cabeza de Vaca]],&lt;ref&gt;Cabeza de Vaca, Álvar Núnez. La Relación (1542). Translated by Martin A. dunsworth and José B. Fernández.

In [[computer architecture]], '''register renaming''' is a technique that eliminates the false [[Data dependency|data dependencies]] arising from the reuse of [[processor register|architectural registers]] by successive [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] that do not have any real data dependencies between them. The elimination of these false data dependencies reveals more [[instruction-level parallelism]] in an instruction stream, which can be exploited by various and complementary techniques such as [[superscalar]] and [[Out-of-order execution|out-of-order]] execution for better [[Computer performance|performance]].

== Problem definition ==
In a [[register machine]], programs are composed of instructions which operate on values.  The instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another.  A typical instruction might say, add X and Y and put the result in Z.  In this instruction, X, Y, and Z are the names of storage locations.

In order to have a compact instruction encoding, most processor instruction sets have a small set of special locations which can be directly named. For example, the x86 instruction set architecture has 8 integer registers, x86-64 has 16, many RISCs have 32, and IA-64 has 128.  In smaller processors, the names of these locations correspond directly to elements of a [[register file]].

Different instructions may take different amounts of time; for example, a processor may be able to execute hundreds of instructions while a single load from the main memory is in progress. Shorter instructions executed while the load is outstanding will finish first, thus the instructions are finishing out of the original program order. [[Out-of-order execution]] has been used in most recent high-performance CPUs to achieve some of their speed gains.

Consider this piece of code running on an out-of-order CPU:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! # !! Instruction
|-
! 1
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = M[1024]&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 2
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = R1 + 2&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 3
| &lt;code&gt;M[1032] = R1&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 4
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = M[2048]&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 5
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = R1 + 4&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 6
| &lt;code&gt;M[2056] = R1&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Instructions 4, 5, and 6 are independent of instructions 1, 2, and 3, but the processor cannot finish 4 until 3 is done, otherwise instruction 3 would write the wrong value.  This restriction can be eliminated by changing the names of some of the registers:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! # !! Instruction !! rowspan="4" | !! # !! Instruction
|-
! 1
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = M[1024]&lt;/code&gt;
! 4
| &lt;code&gt;R2 = M[2048]&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 2
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = R1 + 2&lt;/code&gt;
! 5
| &lt;code&gt;R2 = R2 + 4&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 3
| &lt;code&gt;M[1032] = R1&lt;/code&gt;
! 6
| &lt;code&gt;M[2056] = R2&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Now instructions 4, 5, and 6 can be executed in parallel with instructions 1, 2, and 3, so that the program can be executed faster.

When possible, the compiler would detect the distinct instructions and try to assign them to a different register. However, there is a finite number of register names that can be used in the assembly code. Many high performance CPUs have more physical registers than may be named directly in the instruction set, so they rename registers in hardware to achieve additional parallelism.

==Data hazards==
{{main|Data hazard}}

When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either by reading it (as an input) or by writing to it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can lead to three kinds of [[data hazard]]s:
* ''Read-after-write'' (RAW){{snd}} a read from a register or memory location must return the value placed there by the last write in program order, not some other write.  This is referred to as a ''true dependency'' or ''flow dependency'', and requires the instructions to execute in program order.
* ''Write-after-write'' (WAW){{snd}} successive writes to a particular register or memory location must leave that location containing the result of the second write.  This can be resolved by ''squashing'' (synonyms: cancelling, annulling, mooting) the first write if necessary. WAW dependencies are also known as ''output dependencies''.
* ''Write-after-read'' (WAR){{snd}} a read from a register or memory location must return the last prior value written to that location, and not one written programmatically after the read.  This is a sort of ''false dependency'' that can be resolved by renaming. WAR dependencies are also known as ''anti-dependencies''.

Instead of delaying the write until all reads are completed, two copies of the location can be maintained, the old value and the new value.  Reads that precede, in program order, the write of the new value can be provided with the old value, even while other reads that follow the write are provided with the new value.  The false dependency is broken and additional opportunities for out-of-order execution are created.  When all reads that need the old value have been satisfied, it can be discarded.  This is the essential concept behind register renaming.

Anything that is read and written can be renamed.  While the general-purpose and floating-point registers are discussed the most, flag and status registers or even individual status bits are commonly renamed as well.

Memory locations can also be renamed, although it is not commonly done to the extent practiced in register renaming.  The [[Transmeta Crusoe]] processor's gated store buffer is a form of memory renaming.

If programs refrained from reusing registers immediately, there would be no need for register renaming. Some instruction sets (e.g., [[IA-64]]) specify very large numbers of registers for specifically this reason.  However, there are limitations to this approach:
* It is very difficult for the compiler to avoid reusing registers without large code size increases.  In loops, for instance, successive iterations would have to use different registers, which requires replicating the code in a process called [[loop unrolling]].
* Large numbers of registers require more bits for specifying a register as an operand in an instruction, resulting in increased code size.
* Many instruction sets historically specified smaller numbers of registers and cannot be changed while still retaining backwards compatibility. 

Code size increases are important because when the program code is larger, the instruction cache misses more often and the processor stalls waiting for new instructions.

Machine language programs specify reads and writes to a limited set of registers specified by the [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA). For instance, the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] ISA specifies 32 integer registers, each 64 bits wide, and 32 floating-point registers, each 64 bits wide.  These are the ''architectural'' registers.  Programs written for processors running the Alpha instruction set will specify operations reading and writing those 64 registers.  If a programmer stops the program in a debugger, they can observe the contents of these 64 registers (and a few status registers) to determine the progress of the machine.

One particular processor which implements this ISA, the [[Alpha 21264]], has 80 integer and 72 floating-point ''physical'' registers. There are, on an Alpha 21264 chip, 80 physically separate locations which can store the results of integer operations, and 72 locations which can store the results of floating point operations. (In fact, there are even more locations than that, but those extra locations are not germane to the register renaming operation.)

The following text describes two styles of register renaming, which are distinguished by the circuit which holds the data ready for an execution unit.

In all renaming schemes, the machine converts the architectural registers referenced in the instruction stream into tags. Where the architectural registers might be specified by 3 to 5 bits, the tags are usually a 6 to 8 bit number. The rename file must have a read port for every input of every instruction renamed every cycle, and a write port for every output of every instruction renamed every cycle.  Because the size of a register file generally grows as the square of the number of ports, the rename file is usually physically large and consumes significant power.

In the ''tag-indexed register file'' style, there is one large register file for data values, containing one register for every tag. For example, if the machine has 80 physical registers, then it would use 7 bit tags. 48 of the possible tag values in this case are unused.

In this style, when an instruction is issued to an execution unit, the tags of the source registers are sent to the physical register file, where the values corresponding to those tags are read and sent to the execution unit.

In the ''reservation station'' style, there are many small associative register files, usually one at the inputs to each execution unit. Each operand of each instruction in an issue queue has a place for a value in one of these register files.

In this style, when an instruction is issued to an execution unit, the register file entries corresponding to the issue queue entry are read and forwarded to the execution unit.

;Architectural Register File or Retirement Register File (RRF): The committed register state of the machine. RAM indexed by logical register number. Typically written into as results are retired or committed out of a reorder buffer.
;Future File: The most speculative register state of the machine. RAM indexed by logical register number.
;Active Register File: The Intel P6 group's term for Future File.
;History Buffer: Typically used in combination with a future file. Contains the "old" values of registers that have been overwritten.  If the producer is still in flight it may be RAM indexed by history buffer number. After a branch misprediction must use results from the history buffer—either they are copied, or the future file lookup is disabled and the history buffer is [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) indexed by logical register number.
;Reorder Buffer (ROB): A structure that is sequentially (circularly) indexed on a per-operation basis, for instructions in flight. It differs from a history buffer because the reorder buffer typically comes after the future file (if it exists) and before the architectural register file.

Reorder buffers can be data-less or data-ful.

In Willamette's ROB, the ROB entries point to registers in the physical register file (PRF), and also contain other book keeping.  This was also the first Out of Order design done by Andy Glew, at Illinois with HaRRM.

P6's ROB, the ROB entries contain data; there is no separate PRF.  Data values from the ROB are copied from the ROB to the RRF at retirement.

One small detail: if there is temporal locality in ROB entries (i.e., if instructions close together in the von Neumann instruction sequence write back close together in time, it may be possible to perform write combining on ROB entries and so have fewer ports than a separate ROB/PRF would).  It is not clear if it makes a difference, since a PRF should be banked.

ROBs usually don't have associative logic, and certainly none of the ROBs designed by Andy Glew have CAMs.  [[Keith Diefendorff]] insisted that ROBs have complex associative logic for many years.  The first ROB proposal may have had CAMs.

== {{Anchor|REGISTER-FILE}}Details: tag-indexed register file ==
&lt;!--[[Image:register renaming:tag indexed scheme.png|{{deletable image-caption}}]]--&gt;

This is the renaming style used in the MIPS [[R10000]], the [[Alpha 21264]], and in the FP section of the [[AMD]] [[Athlon]].

In the renaming stage, every architectural register referenced (for read or write) is looked up in an architecturally-indexed '''remap file'''.  This file returns a tag and a ready bit.  The tag is non-ready if there is a queued instruction which will write to it that has not yet executed.  For read operands, this tag takes the place of the architectural register in the instruction.  For every register write, a new tag is pulled from a free tag FIFO, and a new mapping is written into the remap file, so that future instructions reading the architectural register will refer to this new tag.  The tag is marked as unready, because the instruction has not yet executed.  The previous physical register allocated for that architectural register is saved with the instruction in the [[reorder buffer]], which is a FIFO that holds the instructions in program order between the decode and graduation stages.

The instructions are then placed in various '''issue queues'''. As instructions are executed, the tags for their results are broadcast, and the issue queues match these tags against the tags of their non-ready source operands. A match means that the operand is ready. The remap file also matches these tags, so that it can mark the corresponding physical registers as ready. When all the operands of an instruction in an issue queue are ready, that instruction is ready to issue. The issue queues pick ready instructions to send to the various functional units each cycle. Non-ready instructions stay in the issue queues. This unordered removal of instructions from the issue queues can make them large and power-consuming.

Issued instructions read from a tag-indexed physical register file (bypassing just-broadcast operands) and then execute.  Execution results are written to tag-indexed physical register file, as well as broadcast to the bypass network preceding each functional unit.  Graduation puts the previous tag for the written architectural register into the free queue so that it can be reused for a newly decoded instruction.

An exception or branch misprediction causes the remap file to back up to the remap state at last valid instruction via combination of state snapshots and cycling through the previous tags in the in-order pre-graduation queue.  Since this mechanism is required, and since it can recover any remap state (not just the state before the instruction currently being graduated), branch mispredictions can be handled before the branch reaches graduation, potentially hiding the branch misprediction latency.

==Details: reservation stations==
{{Main|Reservation station}}
&lt;!--[[Image:register renaming:reservation station scheme.png|{{deletable image-caption}}]]--&gt;

This is the style used in the integer section of the AMD K7 and K8 designs.

In the renaming stage, every architectural register referenced for reads is looked up in both the architecturally-indexed '''future file''' and the rename file. The future file read gives the value of that register, if there is no outstanding instruction yet to write to it (i.e., it's ready). When the instruction is placed in an issue queue, the values read from the future file are written into the corresponding entries in the reservation stations.  Register writes in the instruction cause a new, non-ready tag to be written into the rename file.  The tag number is usually serially allocated in instruction order—no free tag FIFO is necessary.

Just as with the tag-indexed scheme, the issue queues wait for non-ready operands to see matching tag broadcasts.  Unlike the tag-indexed scheme, matching tags cause the corresponding broadcast value to be written into the issue queue entry's reservation station.

Issued instructions read their arguments from the reservation station, bypass just-broadcast operands, and then execute.  As mentioned earlier, the reservation station register files are usually small, with perhaps eight entries.

Execution results are written to the [[re-order buffer|reorder buffer]], to the reservation stations (if the issue queue entry has a matching tag), and to the future file if this is the last instruction to target that architectural register (in which case register is marked ready).

Graduation copies the value from the reorder buffer into the architectural register file.  The sole use of the architectural register file is to recover from exceptions and branch mispredictions.

Exceptions and branch mispredictions, recognised at graduation, cause the architectural file to be copied to the future file, and all registers marked as ready in the rename file.  There is usually no way to reconstruct the state of the future file for some instruction intermediate between decode and graduation, so there is usually no way to do early recovery from branch mispredictions.

==Comparison between the schemes==
In both schemes, instructions are inserted in-order into the issue queues, but are removed out-of-order.  If the queues do not collapse empty slots, then they will either have many unused entries, or require some sort of variable priority encoding for when multiple instructions are simultaneously ready to go.  Queues that collapse holes have simpler priority encoding, but require simple but large circuitry to advance instructions through the queue.

Reservation stations have better latency from rename to execute, because the rename stage finds the register values directly, rather than finding the physical register number, and then using that to find the value.  This latency shows up as a component of the branch misprediction latency.

Reservation stations also have better latency from instruction issue to execution, because each local register file is smaller than the large central file of the tag-indexed scheme.  Tag generation and exception processing are also simpler in the reservation station scheme, as discussed below.

The physical register files used by reservation stations usually collapse unused entries in parallel with the issue queue they serve, which makes these register files larger in aggregate, and consume more power, and more complicated than the simpler register files used in a tag-indexed scheme.  Worse yet, every entry in each reservation station can be written by every result bus, so that a reservation-station machine with, e.g., 8 issue queue entries per functional unit will typically have 9 times as many bypass networks as an equivalent tag-indexed machine.  Consequently, result forwarding consumes much more power and area than in a tag-indexed design.

Furthermore, the reservation station scheme has four places (Future File, Reservation Station, Reorder Buffer and Architectural File) where a result value can be stored, whereas the tag-indexed scheme has just one (the physical register file).  Because the results from the functional units, broadcast to all these storage locations, must reach a much larger number of locations in the machine than in the tag-indexed scheme, this function consumes more power, area, and time. Still, in machines equipped with very accurate branch prediction schemes and if execute latencies are a major concern, reservation stations can work remarkably well.

==History==

The [[IBM System/360 Model 91]] was an early machine that supported out-of-order execution of instructions; it used the [[Tomasulo algorithm]], which uses register renaming.

The [[POWER1]] is the first [[microprocessor]] that used register renaming and out-of-order execution in 1990.

The original [[R10000]] design had neither collapsing issue queues nor variable priority encoding, and suffered starvation problems as a result—the oldest instruction in the queue would sometimes not be issued until both instruction decode stopped completely for lack of rename registers, and every other instruction had been issued.  Later revisions of the design starting with the [[R10000#R12000|R12000]] used a partially variable priority encoder to mitigate this problem.

Early out-of-order machines did not separate the renaming and ROB/PRF storage functions.  For that matter, some of the earliest, such as Sohi's RUU or the Metaflow DCAF, combined scheduling, renaming, and storage all in the same structure.

Most modern machines do renaming by RAM indexing a map table with the logical register number. E.g., P6 did this; future files do this, and have data storage in the same structure.

However, earlier machines used [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) in the renamer. E.g., the HPSM RAT, or Register Alias Table, essentially used a CAM on the logical register number in combination with different versions of the register.

In many ways, the story of out-of-order microarchitecture has been how these CAMs have been progressively eliminated. Small CAMs are useful; large CAMs are impractical.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6 microarchitecture]] was the first microarchitecture by Intel to implement both out-of-order execution and register renaming. The P6 microarchitecture was used in Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium M, Core, and Core 2 microprocessors. The [[Cyrix 6x86|Cyrix M1]], released on October 2, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fermimn.gov.it/inform/materiali/evarchi/cyrix.dir/6x86.htm|title=Cyrix 6x86 Processor}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first x86 processor to use register renaming and out-of-order execution. Other x86 processors (such as [[NexGen]] Nx686 and [[AMD K5]]) released in 1996 also featured register renaming and out-of-order execution of RISC [[Micro-operation|μ-operations]] (rather than native x86 instructions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpushack.com/CIC/announce/1995/NexGenNx686PressRelease.html |title=NexGen Nx686 }}, {{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PITtFPwTaWwC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=PC Mag Dec 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the piece has one repeat sign alone, then that means to repeat from the beginning, and then continue on (or stop, if the sign appears at the end of the piece). A corresponding sign facing the other way indicates where the repeat is to begin. These are similar to the instructions [[da capo]] and [[dal segno]].

{{Quote|Repeat. ''Wiederholungszeichen'' (''Ger.'') A sign that a movement or part of a movement is to be twice performed.

==In Unicode==
In [[Unicode]], repeat signs are part of the [[Musical Symbols (Unicode block)|Musical Symbols]] and are coded as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notation==
When only standard  keyboard characters are available, the [[punctuation]] marks [[vertical bar]] and [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] are used to represent repeat signs: &lt;code&gt;|: ... :|&lt;/code&gt;

In [[Gregorian chant]], a repeat is indicated by a [[Roman numeral]] following a section. This is common particularly in a [[Kyrie]], where the lines followed by "iii" or "iij" are to be sung three times (corresponding to the correct liturgical form).

In [[shape-note]] singing, repeat signs usually have four dots, between each line of the staff. The corresponding sign to show where the repeat is from is either the same sign reversed (if it is at the beginning of a bar), or the dots themselves (if it is in the middle of a bar). First and second endings are given with just the numbers above the corresponding bars. Repeats notated at the beginning of a verse, or given with multiple lines of text per verse, are generally required; the repeats given for most songs of the final few lines are optional, and almost always used only for the final verse sung.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6306">In astronomy, '''rotational Brownian motion''' is the [[random walk]] in orientation of a [[binary star]]'s orbital plane, induced by gravitational perturbations from passing stars.

==Theory==

Consider a binary that consists of two massive objects (stars, black holes etc.) and that is embedded in a [[stellar system]] containing a large number of stars.  Let &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; be the masses of the two components of the binary whose total mass is &lt;math&gt;M_{12}=M_1+M_2&lt;/math&gt;.  A field star that approaches the binary with [[impact parameter]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; passes a distance &lt;math&gt;r_p&lt;/math&gt; from the binary, where

&lt;math&gt;
p^2=r_p^2\left(1+2GM_{12}/V^2r_p\right) \approx 2GM_{12}r_p/V^2;
&lt;/math&gt;

the latter expression is valid in the limit that [[gravitational focusing]] dominates the encounter rate.  The rate of encounters with stars that interact strongly with the binary, i.e. that satisfy &lt;math&gt;r_p &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;, is approximately &lt;math&gt;n\pi p^2 \sigma =2\pi GM_{12} n a/\sigma &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are the number density and velocity dispersion of the field stars and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the binary.

As it passes near the binary, the field star experiences a change in velocity of order 

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta V \approx V_{\rm bin} = \sqrt{GM_{12}/a}
&lt;/math&gt;, 

where &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm bin}&lt;/math&gt; is the relative velocity of the two stars in the binary.
The change in the field star's [[specific angular momentum]] with respect to the binary, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, is then Δ''l'' ≈ ''a'' ''V''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;.  Conservation of angular momentum implies that the binary's angular momentum changes by Δ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ -(m/μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)Δ''l'' where ''m'' is the mass of a field star and μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the binary [[reduced mass]]. Changes in the magnitude of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to changes in the binary's orbital eccentricity via the relation ''e'' = 1 - ''l''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''GM''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;''a''.  Changes in the direction of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to changes in the orientation of the binary, leading to rotational diffusion. The rotational diffusion coefficient is

&lt;math&gt;
\langle\Delta\xi^2\rangle = \langle\Delta l_{\rm bin}^2\rangle / l_{\rm bin}^2 
\approx \left({m\over M_{12}}\right)^2 \langle\Delta l^2\rangle/GM_{12}a \approx {m\over M_{12}} {G\rho a\over\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ = ''mn'' is the mass density of field stars.

Let ''F''(θ,''t'') be the probability that the rotation axis of the binary is oriented at angle θ at time ''t''.  The evolution equation for ''F'' is &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author=Debye, P.
 | authorlink = Peter Debye
 | title=Polar Molecules
 | publisher=Dover
 | year=1929}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

{\partial F\over\partial t} = {1\over\sin\theta} {\partial\over\partial\theta} \left(\sin\theta{\langle\Delta\xi^2\rangle\over 4} {\partial F\over\partial\theta}\right).  

&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;Δξ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;, ''a'', ρ and σ are constant in time, this becomes

&lt;math&gt;

{\partial F\over\partial\tau} = {1\over 2} {\partial\over\partial\mu} \left[(1-\mu^2) {\partial F\over\partial\mu}\right]  

&lt;/math&gt;

where μ = cos θ and τ is the time in units of the relaxation time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;
t_{\rm rel} \approx {M_{12}\over m} {\sigma\over G\rho a}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this equation states that the expectation value of μ decays with time as

&lt;math&gt;
\overline\mu = \overline{\mu}_0 e^{-\tau}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; is the time constant for the binary's orientation to be randomized by torques from field stars.

==Applications==

Rotational Brownian motion was first discussed in the context of binary [[supermassive black hole]]s at the centers of galaxies.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, D.]] (2002), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...568..998M  Rotational Brownian Motion of a Massive Binary], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''568''', 998-1003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perturbations from passing stars can alter the orbital plane of such a binary, which in turn alters the direction of the spin axis of the single black hole that forms when the two coalesce.

Rotational Brownian motion is often observed in [[N-body simulation]]s of [[galaxies]] containing binary black holes.&lt;ref&gt;Löckmann, U. and Baumgardt, H. (2008), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.384..323L  Tracing intermediate-mass black holes in the Galactic Centre], ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', '''384''', 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	
Matsubayashi, T., Makino, J. and Ebisuzaki, T. (2007), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...656..879M|Orbital Evolution of an IMBH in the Galactic Nucleus with a Massive Central Black Hole], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''656''', 879-896&lt;/ref&gt;  The massive binary sinks to the center of the galaxy via [[dynamical friction]] where it interacts with passing stars. The same gravitational perturbations that induce a random walk in the orientation of the binary, also cause the binary to shrink, via the [[gravitational slingshot]].  It can be shown&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;  that the rms change in the binary's orientation, from the time the binary forms until the two black holes collide, is roughly

&lt;math&gt;
\delta\theta\approx \sqrt{20m/M_{12}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In a real galaxy, the two black holes would eventually coalesce due to emission of [[gravitational wave]]s.  The spin axis of the coalesced hole will be aligned with the angular momentum axis of the orbit of the pre-existing binary. Hence, a mechanism like rotational Brownian motion that affects the orbits of binary black holes can also affect the distribution of black hole spins.  This may explain in part why the spin axes of supermassive black holes appear to be randomly aligned with respect to their host galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;Kinney, A. et al. (2000), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...537..152K  Jet Directions in Seyfert Galaxies], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''537''', 152-177&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SAE Institute''' ('''SAE''', formerly also known as the '''School of Audio Engineering''' and the '''SAE Technology College''') is a private college founded in 1976 by [[sound engineer]], record producer and businessman Tom Misner. The first school was opened 1977 in Sydney.

SAE Institute offers courses in [[audio engineering]], 3D animation, [[multimedia]], [[graphic design]], [[game design]], digital filmmaking, and music production. It currently has campuses and facilities, including licensed [[franchising|franchise]] operations, in 54 cities in 30 countries.

==History==
SAE was established by Tom Misner in 1976 in Sydney, converting a small advertising studio into a classroom. Over the next six years, campuses in [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] were established. In the mid-1980s, SAE began opening colleges outside of Australia, including locations in London, [[Munich]], Frankfurt, [[Vienna]], Berlin, [[Auckland]], and [[Glasgow]]. In the 1990s, SAE opened a European head office in [[Amsterdam]], and locations were opened in Paris, Hamburg, [[Zürich]], [[Hobart]], [[Cologne]], Stockholm, and [[Milan]]. SAE also began expanding into Asia in the 1990s, opening locations in Singapore and [[Kuala Lumpur]]. In the late 1990s, SAE formed the SAE Entertainment Company and launched full university degree programs with the co-operation of [[Southern Cross University]] and [[Middlesex University]]. In 1999, SAE began opening facilities in the United States, and over the following decade opened locations in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Miami, San Francisco, [[Atlanta]], Los Angeles, and Chicago. In 2000, SAE began licensing [[Franchising|franchise]] schools in [[India]], opening four that year. In 2000s, locations were opened in [[Liverpool]], Madrid, [[Brussels]], [[Bangkok]], Leipzig, [[Barcelona]], [[Dubai]], [[Amman]], [[Cape Town]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Serbia]]. Licence agreements were signed for new schools in Qatar, Bogotá Colombia , Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In the 2000s SAE also acquired QANTM, an Australian production, media and training company, and relocated its head office to [[Littlemore]] Park, [[Oxford]] and its headquarters to [[Byron Bay]], Australia.

In 2010, the SAE Institute was sold to Navitas, a publicly traded educational services company. Over the next few years, new locations were opened in [[Romania]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Moskhato]]. Navitas began taking over the licensed branches in the US in 2011, and laid off over 40 US employees in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;SAE Employee Discussion Thread, TheLayoff.com [http://www.thelayoff.com/SAE-institute "SAE Institute Layoffs"], TheLayoff.com.

'''Sexual stimulation''' is any [[stimulation|stimulus]] (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains [[sexual arousal]], and may lead to [[orgasm]]. Although sexual arousal may arise without [[physical stimulation]], achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation.

The term ''sexual stimulation'' often implies stimulation of the [[sex organ|genitals]], but may also include stimulation of other areas of the body, stimulation of the senses (such as sight or hearing) and mental stimulation (i.e. from reading or [[sexual fantasy|fantasizing]]). Sufficient stimulation of the [[human penis|penis]] in males and the [[clitoris]] in females usually results in an orgasm.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;{{cite book|first=Wayne |last=Weiten |first2=Dana S.|last2=Dunn |first3=Elizabeth Yost |display-authors=2 |last3=Hammer|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st century|page=386|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011 |accessdate=5 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT423&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clitoris"&gt;{{cite web|title='I Want a Better Orgasm!'|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=August 18, 2011|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113132443/http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archivedate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenneth Mah"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Kenneth | last = Mah | first2 = Yitzchak M | last2 = Binik | title = The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–856| date = January 7, 2001 | pmid = 11497209| doi = 10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00069-6 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735800000696 | quote=Women rated clitoral stimulation as at least somewhat more important than vaginal stimulation in achieving orgasm; only about 20% indicated that they did not require additional clitoral stimulation during intercourse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kammerer-Doak"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dorothy | last = Kammerer-Doak | first2 = Rebecca G. | last2 = Rogers | title =  Female Sexual Function and Dysfunction | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–183 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18486835 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2008.03.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889854508000235 | quote=Most women report the inability to achieve orgasm with vaginal intercourse and require direct clitoral stimulation ...

Some people practice [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]], whereby a person or their sexual partner controls the level of sexual stimulation to delay orgasm, and to prolong the sexual experience leading up to orgasm.

==Physical sexual stimulation==
[[File:Primary and specific erogenous zones.svg|thumb|The erogenous zones of the male and female body.]]

===Genital===
Physical sexual stimulation usually consists of touching the genitals or other [[erogenous zone]]s. [[Masturbation]], [[erotic massage]], sexual intercourse, a [[handjob]] or [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] are types of physical sexual stimulation involving the genitals. [[Sexual arousal]] is usually triggered through sensitive nerves in these body parts,&lt;ref&gt;Schober, Justine M., and Donald Pfaff. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justine_Schober/publication/5968480_The_neurophysiology_of_sexual_arousal/links/545cf0c90cf2c1a63bfa5af6.pdf The neurophysiology of sexual arousal.]" Best practice &amp; research Clinical endocrinology &amp; metabolism 21.3 (2007): 445-461.&lt;/ref&gt; which cause the release of pleasure-causing  chemicals ([[endorphins]]) that act as mental rewards to pursue such stimulation. A person may also become sexually aroused by touching another person's genitals or other body parts.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] is triggered by stimulation of the glans penis or clitoris.&lt;ref name=Wheeless&gt;http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/bulbocavernosus_reflex Bulbocavernosus Reflex&amp;nbsp;– Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[sex toy]]s is to provide pleasure and stimulation through an alternative route than just using people's bodies. They can be used by someone on their own, with partnered sex, or group sex. They can be exciting and provide new types of stimulation that the body cannot produce, such as vibrations.

Sex toys have been used as a source of sexual stimulation for thousands of years. There have been [[dildo]]s found from the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm|title=Ancient Phallus Unearthed in Cave.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of [[Siltstone]] and polished to a high gloss. Dildos were also made of camel dung and coated with resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of Kink: Sex Beyond the Missionary|last=Christina, E.|first=|publisher=Tarcher Perigree|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFcWmcGLXJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are uncertain whether these have been used for [[religious ritual]]s or for personal pleasure. It is known that dildos were used for [[fertility ritual]]s,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/sex-toy|title=The long, strange history of sex toys.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created their dildos from a carved penis covered in leather or animal intestines to create a more natural feel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Romans created double-ended dildos for use with a partner. Ancient Chinese dildos were made of [[bronze]] or other metals and some were hollow allowing them to be filled with liquid to simulate an [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=With the hand: a cultural history of masturbation|last=Driel, M.|first=|publisher=Reaktion Books.|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used because wealthy Chinese men would often have too many wives to please. In Persia, they thought that the blood of the [[hymen]] was unclean, and should be avoided by husbands. On the night before a lady's wedding, a local holy-man would come and break her hymen with a large stone dildo, a ritual also used to confirm the virginity of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage customs of the world: from henna to honeymoons|last=Monger, G.|first=|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2004|isbn=|location=California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-genital stimulation  ===
There are many areas through which a person can be sexually stimulated, other than the genitals. To name a few, the nipples, thighs, lips, and neck can all provide sexual stimulation when touched. 
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation small sharpened.png|thumb|Sexual stimulation of a nipple]]
[[Nipples]]: One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin, R. &amp;|first=Meston, C.|year=2006|title=Nipple/breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women.|url=http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31341-2/fulltext|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=3|pages=450–454|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; administered a questionnaire about sexual activity to 301 participants and found that 81.5% of women reported that stimulating their nipples caused or enhanced sexual arousal and that 59.1% of them asked to have their nipples stimulated during sex. Furthermore, 51.7% of men reported that nipple stimulation caused sexual arousal, and 39% said that it enhanced their existing arousal. Research  using &lt;ref name="Komisaruk"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Komisaruk |first1=B.

The research suggests the sensations are genital orgasms caused by [[nipple stimulation]], and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain".&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levi |first=R, J. |year=2006|title=The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality.|url=|journal=Sexual &amp; Relationship therapy|volume=21|pages=237–249|via=|doi=10.1080/14681990600674674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women, one study indicated that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;

[[Thigh]]s: In 2012 the California Institute of Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=V. |last1=Gazzola |first2=M.L. |last2=Spezio |first3=J.A. |last3=Etzel |first4=F. |last4=Castelli |first5=R. |last5=Adolphs |first6=C. |last6=Keysers|first=|year=2012|title=Primary somatosensory cortex discriminates affective significance in social touch.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|pages=1657–1666.|doi=10.1073/pnas.1113211109|pmc=3382530}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured brain responses in heterosexual males as they were having their inner thighs touched whilst being [[MRI Scanner|MRI scanned]]. They were either watching a video of a woman touching their thigh or a man touching their thigh. They reported more sexual pleasure when they thought it was the woman touching them than the man, and this was reflected in their MRI scans with greater arousal of their somatosensory cortex. It can be therefore concluded that the thighs are an area that can cause sexual stimulation when touched.

[[Lip]]s: Lips contain a huge number of [[nerve endings]] and are considered to be an erogenous zone. Men report experiencing more pleasure from the stimulation of their lips than women do (see below for sex differences in stimulation). In addition to stimulation of the lips by touching, men can be visually stimulated by looking at a woman's lips. It has also been&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality.|last=Symons, D.|first=|publisher=Oxford university press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that men prefer women with fuller lips because they are an indicator of youth.

[[Neck]]:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Turnbull |first1=O. H. |last2=Lovett |first2=V. E. |last3=Chaldecott |first3=J. |last4=Lucas |first4=M.

Females reported neck stimulation as being more arousing than men did, and the nape of the neck was more arousing for both sexes than the back of the neck.{{Contradict-inline|reason="nape is the back of the neck"|date=October 2017}}

=== Sex differences in erogenous zones ===
This table&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; shows the sex differences in erogenous zones and includes the top ten most arousing areas for both sexes. Each body part was rated out of ten for how arousing it is when touched. Apart from body parts exclusive to one gender such as the penis or clitoris, many of the erogenous zones are similar and contain lots of nerve endings. They suggested also that women experience more areas of greater arousal than men do.

=== Internal stimulation: excitation-transfer theory of sexual arousal ===
The [[excitation-transfer theory]] states that existing arousal in the body can be transformed into another type of arousal. For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cantor |first1=J. R. |last2=Bryant |first2=J. |last3=Zillmann |first3=D. |year=1975|title=Enhancement of experienced sexual arousal in response to erotic stimuli through misattribution of unrelated residual excitation.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanne_Cantor/publication/21948123_Enhancement_of_Experienced_Sexual_Arousal_in_Response_to_Erotic_Stimuli_Through_Misattribution_of_Unrelated_Residual_Excitation/links/5431cbe00cf277d58e982d6f.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|pages=69–75|via=|doi=10.1037/h0076784}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants performed some physical exercise and at different stages of recovery had to watch an erotic film and rate how aroused it made them feel. They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation.

== Alternative routes ==
The human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]] or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means.

=== Visual ===
Perhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnow | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Desmond | first2 = J.

Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of '[[Paraphilia|sexual deviation]]', it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar industry that is [[pornography]] is yet another example. A common presumption in society and the media is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than women&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., Martin, C. E., &amp; Sloan, S. (1948). [[Sexual behavior in the human male]].&lt;/ref&gt; and, arguably, can be seen depicted through the "male glaze"&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, L. (1989). [http://theslideprojector.com/pdffiles/art6/visualpleasureandnarrativecinema.pdf Visual pleasure and narrative cinema]. In ''Visual and other pleasures'' (pp. 14-26). Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt; that dominates the pornography industry. Nonetheless, both sexes can be sexually aroused through visual stimulation. In one study, visual stimulation was tested by means of an erotic video. Although significantly higher in the male group, sexual arousal was the main emotional reaction reported by both sexes. Their physiological responses to the video also showed characteristics of sexual arousal, such as increased urinary excretions of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levi | first1 = L | year = 1969 | title = Sympatho-adrenomedullary activity, diuresis, and emotional reactions during visual sexual stimulation in human females and males | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.5354&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 251–268 | doi=10.1097/00006842-196905000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study investigating male arousal showed that men were able to achieve rigid [[erection]]s through visual stimulation of an erotic film alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = B. | last2 = Sikka | first2 = S.

Studies that use visual stimulation as a means for sexual stimulation find that sexual arousal is predominantly correlated with an activation in [[Limbic system|limbic]] and [[Paralimbic cortex|paralimbic]] cortex and in [[Cerebral cortex|subcortical]] structures, along with a deactivation in several parts of the [[Temporal cortex|temporal]] cortex. These same areas are activated during physical sexual stimulation highlighting how powerful visual stimulation can be as a means of [[sexual arousal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holstege | first1 = G. | last2 = Georgiadis | first2 = J.

=== Olfactory and evolutionary ===
Olfactory information is critical to human sexual behavior. One study investigating olfactory sexual stimulation found that men experience sexual arousal in response to a female perfume. Individuals rated odourant stimulation and perceived sexual arousal. They also had [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] scans taken during the experiment. The results showed that olfactory stimulation with women's perfume produces activation of specific brain areas associated with sexual arousal in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huh | first1 = J. | last2 = Park | first2 = K. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = I. S. | last4 = Jung | first4 = S. I. | last5 = Kim | first5 = H. J. | last6 = Chung | first6 = T. W. | last7 = Jeong | first7 = G. W. | year = 2008 | title = Brain activation areas of sexual arousal with olfactory stimulation in men: A preliminary study using functional MRI | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31972-X/fulltext | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 619–625 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00717.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary analysis of sex differences in reproductive strategies can help explain the importance of smell in sexual arousal due to its link to immunological profile and offspring viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rikowski | first1 = A. | last2 = Grammer | first2 = K. | year = 1999 | title = Human body odour, symmetry and attractiveness | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | volume = 266 | issue = | pages = 869–874 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0717| pmc = 1689917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because olfactory cues may be able to trigger an [[incest]] avoidance mechanism by reflecting parts of an individual's genetic equipment. In one study, males rated visual and olfactory information as being equally important for selecting a lover, while females considered olfactory information to be the single most important variable in [[mate choice]]. Additionally, when considering sexual activity, females singled out [[Body odor|body odour]] from all other sensory experiences as most able to negatively affect desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herz | first1 = R. S. | last2 = Cahill | first2 = E. D. | year = 1997 | title = Differential use of sensory information in sexual behavior as a function of gender | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rachel_Herz/publication/225106584_Differential_use_of_sensory_information_in_sexual_behavior_as_a_function_of_sex/links/56e01e2608ae979addf0e501.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Nature | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 275–286 | doi=10.1007/bf02912495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditory ===
Auditory stimulants may also serve to intensify sexual arousal and the experience of pleasure. Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to men and women, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = R. J. | year = 1992 | title = The mechanisms of human female sexual arousal | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sex Research | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1–48 | doi=10.1080/10532528.1992.10559874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Female copulatory vocalizations|copulatory vocalisations]] are likely to serve mutual sexual stimulation for mating partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. J. | last2 = Arrowood | first2 = P. C. | year = 1978 | title = Copulatory vocalizations of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), gibbons (Hylobates hoolock), and humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 200 | issue = | pages = 1405–1409 | doi=10.1126/science.663622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when not coupled with "touching", sounds can be highly sexually arousing. Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to "low moans" for erotic effect. [[Vaudeville]] Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "Orgasm" or [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[You Sure Love to Ball]]" includes sounds of the female orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corbett | first1 = J. | last2 = Kapsalis | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title =  Aural Sex: The Female Orgasm in Popular Sound| url = | journal =  TDR (1988-)| volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 102–111 | doi=10.2307/1146553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant. In one mood induction study, exposure to certain music resulted in significantly greater [[penile tumescence]] and subjective sexual arousal for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = W. B. | last2 = DiBartolo | first2 = P. M. | last3 = Brown | first3 = T. A. | last4 = Barlow | first4 = D. H. | year = 1998 | title = Effects of positive and negative mood on sexual arousal in sexually functional males | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 197–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar experiment, women did not show significant physiological responses to certain types of music but did reported higher levels of sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laan | first1 = E. | last2 = Everaerd | first2 = W. | last3 = Van Berlo | first3 = R. | last4 = Rijs | first4 = L. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and sexual arousal in women | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 441–443 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(94)00059-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have looked at the connection between auditory stimulation and the experience of sexual pleasure. Whilst the highest levels of physiological and subjective arousal were found for visual stimuli, spoken-text was found to elicit sexual arousal in men implicating sounds a means for sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Julien | first1 = E. | last2 = Over | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Male sexual arousal across five modes of erotic stimulation | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 131–143 | doi=10.1007/bf01542663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental stimulation ==
Sexual arousal includes feelings, attractions and desires, as well as physiological changes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;LeVay, S., &amp; Valente, S. M. (2006). ''Human sexuality'' (2nd ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; These can be elicited not only by physical but also mental stimulations, such as [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]], erotic literature, dreams, role-play, and imagination.

]]

=== Fantasy  ===
[[Sexual fantasy]] is a form of mental sexual stimulation which many people engage in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is where a person imagines a sexual experience while they are awake. Fantasy has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It's also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leitenberg | first1 = H. | last2 = Henning | first2 = K. | year = 1995 | title = Sexual fantasy | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 469–496 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour. Many sexual fantasies are shared between men and women, possibly because of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, there are still gender differences that have been found. Men are more likely than women to imagine being in a dominant or active role, whereas women are more likely to imagine themselves as passive participants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's fantasies have significantly more affection and commitment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelley | first1 = K | year = 1984 | title = Sexual fantasy and attitudes as functions of sex of subject and content of erotica | url = | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 339–347 | doi=10.2190/j66d-n10e-lth5-8aw5}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas men are more likely to fantasise using visual imagery and explicit detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barclay | first1 = A. M. | year = 1973 | title = Sexual fantasies in men and women | url = | journal = Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 205–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = K. | last2 = Gold | first2 = S. | year = 1988 | title = Relationship of sex, sex guilt, and experience to written sexual fantasies | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/YQQJ-7A8U-23LE-59KJ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 155–163 | doi=10.2190/yqqj-7a8u-23le-59kj}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of this difference comes from the [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]]. Women have a higher minimum parental investment than males (they have 9 months of gestation prior birth and are then the main care givers, whereas men only have to provide sperm to ensure their genes are passed on) and are therefore more likely to want commitment from their partner in order to gain resources to improve their offspring's chance of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = B. | last2 = Symons | first2 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Sex Differences in Sexual Fantasy: An Evolutionary Psychological Approach | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 527–555 | doi=10.1080/00224499009551579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasies can have benefits, such as increasing arousal more than other forms of sexual stimuli (such as an [[Erotic literature|erotic story]]) and increasing [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldey | first1 = K. L. | last2 = van Anders | first2 = S. M. | year = 2012 | title = Sexual arousal and desire: Interrelations and responses to three modalities of sexual stimuli | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)34099-6/fulltext | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 2315–2329 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02845.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who disclose their sexual fantasies to their partners also have a higher sexual satisfaction. However, whether people are willing to open up to their partner generally depends on the content of such fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, M. (2012). ''[https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/9806/Anderson_ku_0099D_11825_DATA_1.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Sexual communication in romantic relationships: An investigation into the disclosure of sexual fantasies]'' (Order No. AAI3489846).&lt;/ref&gt; A more negative effect of sexual fantasy is that it has been linked with [[sexual crimes]], and indeed sexual offenders often report that they have had fantasies related to their offense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, such fantasies are also common among those who have not been involved in such criminal acts&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and non-offenders do not use their fantasies to guide their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howitt | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = What is the role of fantasy in sex offending? | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 182–188 | doi=10.1002/cbm.585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, fantasy alone cannot be used as a sign that someone will become an offender.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Dreams ===
Nocturnal orgasms, or "[[Nocturnal emission|wet dreams]]" are when men ejaculate during sleep. These occur during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM (rapid eye movement)]] phases of sleep,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is the main stage when humans dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suzuki | first1 = H. | last2 = Kuga | first2 = R. | last3 = Uchiyama | first3 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Relationship between dream experience and sleep state under ultra-short sleep-wake schedule | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjppp1983/20/1/20_19/_pdf | journal = Japanese Journal of Physiological Psychology and Psychophysiology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 19–28 | doi=10.5674/jjppp1983.20.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that [[Erotic Dream|erotic dreams]] alone are enough to stimulate men, however erections accompany all REM phases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to self-report data, as many as 22% of young women may also experience [[orgasm]] during sleep, with such dreams being more common in college students in higher school years than younger students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henton | first1 = C. L. | year = 1976 | title = Nocturnal orgasm in college woman: Its relation to dreams and anxiety associated with sexual factors | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 129 | issue = | page = 245 | doi=10.1080/00221325.1976.10534034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orgasms experienced were positively correlated with high emotionality, including [[Sexual arousal|sexual excitement]], but also [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sexual role-play ===
[[Sexual roleplay|Sexual role-play]] is when people act out characters or scenarios which may sexually stimulate each other. This can include [[Sexual fantasy|fantasies]] (discussed above) and [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]], such as [[BDSM]] (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism) or [[Ageplay|age-play]]. It has been described by some as an adult form of [[Live action role-playing game|L.A.R.P]] (live action role-play).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harviainen | first1 = J. T. | year = 2011 | title = Sadomasochist role-playing as live-action role-playing: a trait-descriptive analysis | url = http://www.ijrp.subcultures.nl/wp-content/issue2/IJRPissue2-Article5.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Role-Playing | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 59–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Role-play can also be carried out online, by typing stories to each other or pretending to be a character, and is therefore a form of mental stimulation you can engage in with another person without them being physically present. Many adolescents find online role-play pleasurable and arousing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = S. | last2 = Paasonen | first2 = S. | last3 = Spisak | first3 = S. | year = 2015 | title = 'Pervy role-play and such': Girls' experiences of sexual messaging online | url = | journal = Sex Education | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 472–485 | doi=10.1080/14681811.2015.1048852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Role-play can also include sexual [[Fan fiction|fanfiction]], where characters from well-known stories, that were not sexually or romantically together in the original story, are written into sexual scenes. [[Slash fiction]] is a type of fan fiction where the characters of the same sex (originally male-male) engage in romantic or sexual activities. Slash fiction allows people the freedom to share stimulating things that can be counter-cultural. However, there may still be [[copyright]] or [[Obscenity|obscenity laws]] if posted onto a public forum or published.&lt;ref&gt;Kustritz, A. M. (2008). Productive (cyber) public space: Slash fan fiction's multiple imaginary (Order No. AAI3276215). Available From PsycINFO. (621716546; 2008-99030-157).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36992">[[Theodicy]], in its most common form, is the attempt to answer the question of why a good [[God]] permits the manifestation of [[evil]]. Theodicy attempts to resolve the [[evidential problem of evil]] by reconciling the traditional divine characteristics of [[omnibenevolence]] and [[omnipotence]], in either their absolute or relative form, with the occurrence of evil or suffering in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 64, No. 254. (Apr., 1955), pp. 200–12, included in ''The Philosophy of Religion'', ed. Basil Mitchell (London: Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 92 and online at http://www.ditext.com/mackie/evil.html. Accessed September 27, 2015. Mackie says that “in its simplest form the [theodic] problem is this: God is omnipotent; God is wholly good; and yet evil exists.”&lt;/ref&gt; “Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birnbaum|first=David|title= God and Evil|year= 1989|publisher= Ktav Pub. House|location= Hoboken|isbn =0881253073|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "debates about theodicy continue among believers and unbelievers alike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Encyclopedia of Christianity: Volume 5, Si-Z|year= 2008|publisher=Eerdmans|location= Grand Rapids|isbn= 080282417X|editor= Erwin Fahlbusch|chapter= Theodicy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodicy is an "intensely urgent" and "constant concern" of "the entire Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bible on Suffering|year=2002|publisher =Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn= 0809140489|editor =Anthony J. Tambasco|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relating '''theodicy and the Bible''' is crucial to understanding [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] theodicy because the Bible "has been, both in theory and in fact, the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Griffin|first=David|title= God, Power, and Evil|year= 1976|publisher= Westminster Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 0664207537|page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible raises the issue of theodicy by its portrayals of God as inflicting evil and by its accounts of people who question God's goodness by their angry indictments. However, the Bible "contains no comprehensive theodicy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Kelly|first= Joseph|title= The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|year= 2001|publisher= Liturgical Press|location =Collegeville|isbn= 0814651046|page= 227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The most common theodicy is the ''free will theodicy''." It lays the blame for all moral evil and some natural evil on humanity's misuse of its free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Is Free Will the Reason God Allows Evil and Suffering|url= http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/theodicy_freewill.html|accessdate= 11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article shows that the free will theodicy interacts with the Bible at its core: what Jesus and Paul say about the freedom of the will and with what kind of freedom of the will God endowed humanity at the Creation.&lt;ref&gt;Alcorn, Randy, ''If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil'' (Multnomah Books, 2009), 238–50, illustrates this interaction with the Bible in a section on “The Free will Debate” that covers the freedom given Adam and Eve along with what Jesus and Paul say regarding free will.&lt;/ref&gt;

== God and evil in the Bible ==

The Bible contains numerous examples of God inflicting evil, both in the form of "moral evil" resulting from "man's sinful inclinations" and the "physical evil" of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Bible Dictionary|year=1974|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0802822827|editor1=J D Douglas |editor2=F F Bruce |chapter=Evil}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two biblical uses of the word ''evil'' parallel the Oxford English Dictionary's definitions of the word as (a) "morally evil" and (b) "discomfort, pain, or trouble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford English dictionary.|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198611862|edition=2nd|chapter=Evil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible sometimes portrays God as inflicting evil in the generic sense&lt;ref&gt;See  {{bibleref2|Isaiah|45:5–7}}, {{bibleref2|1Samuel|2:6–7||1 Samuel 2:6–7}}, and {{bibleref2|Amos|3:6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the word "evil" refers to suffering. Suffering results from either (a) "‘moral' evil, due to human volition" or (b) "‘physical' evil, directly due to nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament: Vol. 13, qôṣ - rạqîaʻ|year=2004|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0802823378|author1=Ringgren, Helmer |author2=Green, Heinz-Josef Fabry |author3=translated by David E. |editor1=G Johannes Botterweck |editor2=Helmer Ringgren |editor3=Heinz-Josef Fabry |others=trans. David E Green|page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible portrays God as inflicting evil in both senses because its writers "regarded God as the ultimate Cause of evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Bible Dictionary|year=1974|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0802822827|editor1=J D Douglas |editor2=F F Bruce |chapter=Evil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible contains examples of suffering caused by nature that are attributed to God,&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleref2|Ruth|1:21}}, {{bibleref2|Amos|4:9–10}}, {{bibleref2|Exodus|4:11}}, and {{bibleref2|Numbers|11:33}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as examples of suffering caused by humans that are attributed to God.&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleref2|Exodus|5:22–23}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|22:22}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:23}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:24–28}}, and {{bibleref2|1Peter|2:7-8||1 Peter 2:7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Whitney gives the reason why a theodicy is important for those who believe in the biblical God when he observes that "it is the believer in God, more so than the skeptic, who is forced to come to terms with the problem of evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=Barry L.|title=What Are They Saying About God and Evil?|year=1989|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809130785|url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/cmllc/whitney/bw-ge-2.htm|chapter=2: The Faith Solution and its Difficulties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical indictments of God ===

Biblical scholar [[Walter Brueggemann]] observes that "theodicy is a constant concern of the entire Bible,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |title=Theodicy in a Social Dimension |journal=[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]] |date=October 1985 |volume=10 |issue=33 |pages=3–25 |doi=10.1177/030908928501003301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible on Suffering|year=2002|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809140489|editor=Anthony J. Tambasco|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he describes theodicy, from the biblical perspective, as a subject that "concerns the question of God's goodness and power in a world that is manifestly marked by disorder and evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |title=Reverberations of Faith. A Theological Handbook of Old Testament Themes |year=2002 |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] |isbn=0664222315 |page=212 |chapter=Theodicy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible evokes a need for a theodicy by its indictments of God coupled with expressions of anger at God, both of which question God's righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleref2|Exodus|5:22}}, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|29:4}}, {{bibleref2|Ruth|1:20–21}}, {{bibleref2|1kings|17:20||1 Kings 17:20}}, {{bibleref2|Job|30:21}}, and {{bibleref2|Jeremiah|4:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|jeremiah|12:1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical responses to evils ===

Tyron Inbody avers that "there is no biblical theodicy." However, Inbody observes that the Bible proffers "various solutions" to questions about God and the evil of human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inbody|first=Tyron|title=The transforming God an interpretation of suffering and evil|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville|isbn=058528881X|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "various solutions" to the ''why'' of suffering and other evils are delineated in the Bible's "responses" (James Crenshaw)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crenshaw|first=James L|title=Defending God|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195140028}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "approaches" ([[Daniel J. Harrington]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrington|first=Daniel J|title=Why Do We Suffer?|year=2000|publisher=Sheed &amp; Ward|location=Franklin|isbn=1580510434}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "answers" ([[Bart Ehrman]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D|title=God's Problem|year=2008|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York|isbn=0061173975}}&lt;/ref&gt; to evil that these biblical scholars have identified. These scholars see a range of responses including punishment for sin, teaching or testing, or the means to some greater good.&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleref2|Proverbs|13:21}}, {{bibleref2|Hebrew|12:7}}, {{bibleref2|2corinthians|1:8–9||2 Corinthians 1:8–9}}, {{bibleref2|James|1:2–3}}. {{bibleref2-nb|James|1:12}}, {{bibleref2|Revelation|2:10}}, and {{bibleref2|Genesis|45:5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greg Boyd (theologian)|Gregory Boyd]], while appreciating "expositions of various biblical motifs that explain why we suffer, goes on to warn that "none of these motifs claim to be a comprehensive theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Greg|title=Review of Ehrman's ''God's Problem''|url=http://gregboyd.blogspot.com/2008/05/review-of-ehrmans-gods-problem.html|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agreement with Boyd, Milton Crum comments that although such biblical passages might lessen the weight of suffering, ad hoc interpretations of evils do not provide a blanket theodicy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crum|first=Milton|title=Evil, Anger, and God|year=2008|publisher=WingSpan Press|location=Livermore|isbn=1595942424|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; N. T. Wright "reminds us" that "the scriptures are frustratingly indirect and incomplete in answering questions of theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Scott|title=Book Review: Evil and the Justice of God|journal=Restorative Justice| date=March 2008 |url=http://www.restorativejustice.org/editions/2008/march08/brevilandjustice|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deuteronomic "theodic settlement" ===

Brueggemann observes that, while the various biblical books do not agree on a theodicy, there was a temporary "theodic settlement" in the biblical Book of Deuteronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |title=Theology of the Old Testament |year=1997 |publisher=[[Fortress Press]] |location=[[Minneapolis]] |isbn=0800630874 |page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "theodic settlement" in the Book of Deuteronomy interprets all afflictions as just punishment for sin, that is, as retribution. Brueggemann defines "the theological notion of retribution" as "the assumption or conviction that the world is ordered by God so that everyone receives a fair outcome of reward or punishment commensurate with his or her conduct." Brueggemann points to Psalm One as a succinct summary of this retribution theodicy: "the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish" (Psalm 1:6).&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter (1997). p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter (2002). p. 174. chapter Theodicy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deuteronomy elaborates its "theodic settlement" in Chapter 28. Verse two promises that "blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the Lord your God." This general promise of blessings is followed by a lengthy list of fourteen specific blessings. But, on the other hand, verse fifteen warns that "if you will not obey the Lord your God . . . , curses shall come upon you." This general warning of curses is followed by a list of fifty-four specific curses, all of which would fit into the biblical use of the word "evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=June|title=Blessing &amp; Cursing|url=http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/?page_id=936|work=Christian Voice|accessdate=13 June 2012| date=June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deuteronomic retribution theodic settlement interpreted whatever evils ("curses") people suffered as just retribution meted out by a just God. However, at least as early as the early 6th century BC, Jeremiah was asserting that the retribution theodicy was contrary to fact. Jeremiah upbraided God for endowing the wicked with prosperity: "Why does the way of the guilty prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive? You plant them, and they take root." {{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|12:1–2}}

In John 9:1–34, Jesus dismisses this "theodic settlement" by explaining that "It was neither that [a blind] man sinned, nor his parents [that caused his infirmity]; but it was so that the works of God might be displayed in him." &lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/nasb/john/9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Book of Job ===

Brueggemann treats the biblical [[Book of Job]] as the prime example of the "newly voiced theodic challenges" to the "old [Deuteronomic] theodic settlement"&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter (1997). p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Job "was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil,"{{bibleref2c|Job|1:1}} but nonetheless he suffered "all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him."{{bibleref2c|Job|42:11}} In the midst of his suffering, Job explicitly contradicted the Deuteronomic theodic settlement: "it is all one; therefore I say, [God] destroys both the blameless and the wicked."{{bibleref2c|Job|9:22}}

Not only did Job challenge the Deuteronomic theodic settlement by the fact of his own innocent suffering and by explicit contradiction of the old settlement, he interrogated God, "Why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?"{{bibleref2c|Job|21:7}} Brueggemann judges the fact that God had no answer to Job's ''why?'' to be so important that "the Book of Job turns on the refusal, unwillingness, or inability of [God] to answer" Job's query.&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter (1997). p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Even worse, God says of himself:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Lafayette |first=Maximillien |title=The 3 most evil, savage and deceptive inventions in history. God, the Bible and organized religions |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tyqVDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2016 |publisher=[[Lulu.com]] |location=[[Morrisville, North Carolina]] |isbn=1365130045 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=tyqVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 196]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...you [Satan] incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."{{bibleref2c|Job|2:3|NIV}}

Brueggemann explains that the "turn" he sees in the Book of Job is a turn from seeing the 'right' as accepting the old theodic settlement. Now, he continues, "perhaps what is 'right' is Job's refusal to concede, and therefore what is celebrated is his entire defiant argument...That is, what Yahweh intends as ‘right' is that Job (Israel, humankind) should make a legitimate case" before God "without timidity or cowardice" to "carry the human question of justice into the danger zone of God's holiness."&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter (1997). p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bible and free will theodicy ==

A theodicy is an attempt "to reconcile the power and goodness attributed to God with the presence of evil in the human experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Dennis|title=A Student's Guide to A2 Religious Studies for the AQA Specification|year=2003|publisher=Rhinegold|location=London|isbn=1904226094|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible attributes both "power" and "goodness" to God.&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleref2|2Peter|1:3||2 Peter 1:3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free will theodicy, first developed by [[Augustine]], defends God by placing all the blame for evil on "the misuse of free will by human beings." This free will theodicy is "perhaps the most influential theodicy ever constructed,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Dennis|title=A Student's Guide to A2 Religious Studies for the AQA Specification|year=2003|publisher=Rhinegold|location=London|isbn=1904226094|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is currently "the most common theodicy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Free Will the Reason God Allows Evil and Suffering|url=http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/theodicy_freewill.html|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the free will theodicy, Nick Trakakis writes that "the free will theodicist proceeds to explain the existence of moral evil as a consequence of the misuse of our freedom." Then "the free will theodicist adds, however, that the value of free will (and the goods it makes possible) is so great as to outweigh the risk that it may be misused in various ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trakakis|first=Nick|title=The Evidential Problem of Evil|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#SH1a|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 June 2012|date=31 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the free will theodicy, ''The New Bible Dictionary'' finds that the Bible attributes evil "to the abuse of free-will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Bible Dictionary|year=1974|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0802822827|editor1=J D Douglas |editor2=F F Bruce |chapter=Evil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted the free will theodicy's "compatibility with and reliance upon the [biblical Book of] Genesis account of creation" and the fall of Adam and Eve into sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Anne|title=Philosophy of Religion : For A Level, for OCR|year=2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|location=Cheltenham|isbn=0748780785|author2=Neil Lockyer &amp; Edwin Tate|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the compatibility between the free will theodicy and the Genesis account of the Creation and Fall of humanity "the Fall-doctrine" has been characterized as "fundamentally an exercise in theodicy-making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McFarland|first=Ian A|author-link=Ian A. McFarland|title=In Adam's Fall|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester|isbn=1405183659|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free will and freedom: definition problems ===

The two terms, "freedom" and "free will," are treated together (a) because, by definition, a "free will" means a "will" that possesses "freedom" and (b) because "free will" is "commonly used" as synonymous with "freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, "Determinism and Freedom Philosophy – Its Terminology," [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwTerminology.html UCL.ac.uk], accessed November 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Robert Kane, writing about "what is often called the free will issue or the problem of free will," says that it "is really a cluster of problems or questions revolving around the conception of human freedom"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, ''The Significance of Free Will'' (Oxford University Press, US, 1998), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing about free will, R. C. Sproul points out that "at the heart of the problem is the question of the definition of free will."&lt;ref&gt;http://thewikibible.pbworks.com/Free%20Will%20or%20Choice.&lt;/ref&gt; Manual Vargas adds that "it is not clear that there is any single thing that people have had in mind by the term ‘free will'."&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Vargas, "Revisionism," in  ''Four Views on Free Will'', John Martin Fischer, Robert Kane, Derk Pereboom, and Manuel Vargas, 128 (Blackwell, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the confusion created when "definitions of ''free will'' are assumed without being stated," Randy Alcorn urges, "be sure to define terms."&lt;ref&gt;Randy Alcorn, ''If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil'' (Multnomah Books, 2009), 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adler's kinds of freedom ==

[[Mortimer Adler#Freedom and free will|Mortimer Adler]] recognized the confusion resulting from the fact that there are "several different objects men have in mind when they use the word ''freedom''."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Jerome Adler, ''How to Think about the Great Ideas: from the Great Books of Western Civilization'', ed. Max Weismann (Open Court, 2000), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Idea of Freedom'', Adler resolved this confusion by distinguishing the "three kinds of freedom" that various writers have in mind when they use the word.  He calls these three kinds of freedom (1) "circumstantial freedom," (2) "natural freedom," and (3) "acquired freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural freedom" and "acquired freedom" are germane to the Bible in relation to the free will theodicy.

=== "Natural freedom" and the Bible ===

"Natural freedom," in Adler's terminology, is the freedom of "self-determination" regarding one's "decisions or plans." Natural freedom is "(i) inherent in all men, (ii) ''regardless'' of the circumstances under which they live and (iii) ''without regard'' to any state of mind or character which they may or may not acquire in the course of their lives"&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical scholars find that the Bible views all humanity as possessing the "natural freedom" of the will that enables "self-determination." ''In this sense of the term'', biblical scholars say that, although the Bible does not use the term, it assumes human "free will." For example, what Adler calls "natural freedom" matches the definition of the biblical concept of "free will" in the ''Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms'', namely, "the free choice of the will that all persons possess."&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. McKim, ''Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996). s.v. "free will."&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars describe free will in the Bible as follows:

:* If the phrase "free will" be taken morally and psychologically, as meaning the power of unconstrained, spontaneous, voluntary, and therefore responsible, choice, the Bible everywhere assumes that all men, as such, possess it, unregenerate and regenerate alike. ''The New Bible Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Douglas, ed., ''The New Bible Dictionary'' (Eerdmans, 1962), s.v. "Liberty, Section III. FREE WILL."&lt;/ref&gt;

:* "Free will is clearly taught in such Scripture passages as Matthew 23:37 . . . and in Revelation 22:17." ''Archaeology and Bible History''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Free, revised and expanded by Howard Frederic Vos, ''Archaeology and Bible History'' (Zondervan, 1992.), 83&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The Bible assumes that all human beings have "free will" in the sense of "the ability to make meaningful choices," that is, "the ability to have voluntary choices that have real effects." ''If God Is Good''.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Alcorn, ''If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil'' (Multnomah Books, 2009), 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* We make ''willing'' choices, choices that have ''real effect''. . . . In this sense, it is certainly consistent with Scripture to say that we have "free will." ''Bible Doctrine''.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Grudem,''Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith'', ed. Jeff Purswell (Zondervan, 1999), 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Debate on "natural freedom" ====

The proper interpretation of biblical passages relating to the freedom of the human will has been the subject of debate for most of the Christian era. The [[Pelagius]] versus [[Augustine of Hippo]] debate over free will took place in the 5th century. The [[Erasmus]] versus [[Martin Luther]] arguments in 16th century included disagreements about free will, as did the [[Arminians]] versus [[Calvinists]] debates in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

There is still no resolution of the free will debate because as Robert Kane observes, "debates about free will are more alive than ever today."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Acquired freedom" and the Bible ===

"Acquired freedom," in Adler's terminology, is the freedom "to live as [one] ought to live," and to live as one ought requires "a change or development" whereby a person acquires "a state of mind, or character, or personality" that can be described by such qualities as "good, wise, virtuous, righteous, holy, healthy, sound, flexible, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, while Adler ascribes the "natural freedom" of "self-determination" to everyone, he asserts that the freedom "to live as [one] ought to live" must be acquired by "a change or development" in a person. The ''New Bible Dictionary'' finds these two distinct freedoms in the Bible:&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, ed., ''The New Bible Dictionary'', s.v. "Liberty, Section III. Free Will."&lt;/ref&gt;

: (i) "The Bible everywhere assumes" that, by nature, everyone possesses the freedom of "unconstrained, spontaneous, voluntary, and therefore responsible, choice." The ''New Bible Dictionary'' calls this natural freedom "free will" in a moral and psychological sense of the term.

: (ii) At the same time, the Bible seems "to indicate that no man is free for obedience and faith till he is freed from sin's dominion." He still possesses "free will" in the sense of voluntary choices, but "all his voluntary choices are in one way or another acts of serving sin" until he acquires freedom from "sin's dominion." The ''New Bible Dictionary'' denotes this acquired freedom for "obedience and faith" as "free will" in a theological sense.

The Bible gives a basic reason why a person must acquire a freedom "to live as [one] ought to live" when it applies Adam and Eve's sin to all humanity: "the Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5). Or, in Paul's view, "by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners" (Romans 5:19). Thus, the Bible describes humanity as connaturally "enslaved to sin" (Romans 6:6; John 8:34). Therefore, in biblical thinking, a freedom from being "enslaved to sin" in order to "live as one ought" must be acquired because "sin" is "the failure to live up to Jesus' commandments to love God and love neighbor."&lt;ref&gt;Ted Peters, ''Sin: Radical Evil in Soul and Society'' (Eerdmans, 1994), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jesus on acquired freedom ====

Jesus told his hearers that they needed to be ''made'' free: "if you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free" (John 8:32). But Jesus' hearers did not understand that he was not talking about freedom from "economic or social slavery,"&lt;ref&gt;F. F. Bruce, ''The Gospel of John'' (Eerdmans, ), 197.&lt;/ref&gt; so they responded, "we are descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone. What do you mean by saying, ‘You will be made free'?" (John 8:33)."

To clarify what he meant by being "made free," Jesus answered them, "very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin" (John 8:34). By his words being "made free," Jesus meant being "made free" from "bondage to sin."&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Burge, "Gospel of John," in ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation'', ed. Craig A. Evans, (David C. Cook, 2005), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing his reply, Jesus added, "if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed" (John 8:36). "Free indeed [''ontós'']" can be more literally translated "truly free" or "really free," as it is in the following translations.&lt;ref&gt;Strong's ''Greek Dictionary'' translates ''ontós'' as "really" or "truly."&lt;/ref&gt;

:* "If the son makes you free, you will be truly free" (John 8:36 ''New Century Bible'').
:* "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" (John 8:36 ''Darby Translation'').

In the John 8:32–36 passage, Jesus taught that "those who sin are slaves to their sin whether they realize it or not" and "they cannot break away from their sin."&lt;ref&gt;Leon Morris, ''The Gospel According to John'' (Eerdmans, 1995), 406.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom of being "truly free" or "really free" had to be acquired by being ''made'' free by "the truth," John's name for Jesus in 14:6. Thus, Jesus characterized being made "truly free" as freedom ''from'' being a "slave to sin." At the same time, the Bible holds that it is freedom ''for'' righteous living because "from the very beginning God's people were taught that the alternative to servitude was not freedom in some abstract sense, but rather ''freedom to serve the Lord''."&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. "Freedom."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paul on acquired freedom ====

When the ''New Bible Dictionary'' says of humanity's connatural condition that "all his voluntary choices are in one way or another acts of serving sin," it references Romans 6:17–22.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, ed., ''The New Bible Dictionary'', s.v. "Liberty, Section III. FREE WILL."&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, Paul depicts the connatural human condition as being "slaves of sin." To be "set free from sin," Paul told his readers that they must "become slaves of righteousness."

Regarding the transformation from being "slaves of sin" to being "slaves of righteousness," Douglas J. Moo comments that Paul uses the image of slavery to say that "being bound to God and his will enables the person to become ‘free'" – in the sense of being free "to be what God wants that person to be." The slavery image underscores, as Moo says, that what Paul has in mind "is not freedom to do what one wants, but freedom to obey God" and that the obedience is done "willingly, joyfully, naturally," and not by coercion as with literal slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas J. Moo, ''The Epistle to the Romans'' (Eerdmans, 1996), 399, 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Fall and freedom of the will ==

The Fall (sometimes lowercase) in its theological use refers to  "the lapse of human beings into a state of natural or innate sinfulness through the sin of Adam and Eve."&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fall.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Fall of man|the Fall]] is narrated in Genesis 3:1–7.

''Nelson's Student Bible Dictionary'' describes "the fall" as "the disobedience and sin of Adam and Eve that caused them to lose the state of innocence in which they had been created. This event plunged them and all mankind into a state of sin and corruption."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald F. Youngblood, F. F. Bruce, R. K. Harrison, eds., ''Nelson's Student Bible Dictionary: A Complete Guide to Understanding the World of the Bible'' (Thomas Nelson, 2005), s.v. "Fall, The."&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Concise Dictionary of Theology'' provides a similar description of the Fall. In their fall, Adam and Eve "disobeyed God and so lost their innocent, ideal existence" and "brought moral evil into the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]] and Edward G. Farrugia, ''A Concise Dictionary of Theology'' (Paulist Press, 2000). s.v. "Fall, The."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible testifies to the deleterious impact of the Fall on all humanity. Shortly after the Fall, "the Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5). Or, in Paul's view, "sin came into the world through one man," and "by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners" (Romans 5:12, 19).

=== Freedom of will given at creation ===

Writing about God's creation and Adam and Eve, ''Baker's Dictionary of Biblical Theology'' says that "creation is climaxed by persons who possess wills that can choose to either obey or disobey."&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. "Will."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Ecclesiasticus]], which pre-[[Protestant Reformation]] churches consider part of the [[Bible]] but which [[Protestantism|Protestants]] classify among the [[Deuterocanonical books|Apocrypha]], explicitly names freedom of the will as an element in God's creation: God "created humankind in the beginning, and he left them in the power of their own free choice" (Ecclesiasticus 15:14).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Sirach%2015:14 Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 15:14 in various English translations]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of will not given at creation ===

Adam and Eve were created with "free will," that is, "the ability to choose either good or evil."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Cottrell, ''The Faith Once for All: Bible Doctrine for Today'' (2010 College Press, 2002), 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fall evidences that Adam and Eve were not created with the freedom that Paul calls being "slaves of righteousness" (Romans 6:18): a phrase that denotes "freedom to obey God – willingly, joyfully, naturally."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas J. Moo, ''The Epistle to the Romans'' (Eerdmans, 1996), 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the free will theodicy believe that it "fails" because "God could have created free agents without risking bringing moral evil into the world. There is nothing logically inconsistent about a free agent that always chooses the good."&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy of Religion, "The Free Will Defence," http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/arguments-for-atheism/the-problem-of-evil/the-argument-from-moral-evil/the-free-will-defence/, October 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Relating God's creation of Adam and Eve and the Fall to theodicy, J. L. Mackie argues "there was open to [God] the obviously better possibility of making beings who would freely act but always do right." And, Mackie adds, "clearly, [God's] failure to avail himself of this possibility is inconsistent with his being both omnipotent and wholly good."&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Mackie, "Evil and Omnipotence," ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 64, No. 254. (Apr., 1955), 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== God and moral evil ===

The free will theodicy justifies God by ascribing all evil to "the evil acts of human free will."&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Peterson and Raymond J. VanArragon, ''Contemporary Debates in Philosophy of Religion'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003). 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Bible teaches that God "rules the hearts and actions of all men."&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Douglas, ed., ''The New Bible Dictionary'' (Eerdmans, 1962), s.v. "Providence."&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible contains many portrayals of God as ruling "hearts and actions" for evil. Following are a few examples:&lt;ref&gt;Milton Crum quotes seventy-five passages illustrating "Human Behavior Directed by God" in his ''Evil, Anger, and God'', 138–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* God said, "I will harden [Pharaoh's] heart, so that he will not let the people go" (Exodus 4:21).
:* Isaiah asked, "Why, O Lord, do you make us stray from your ways and harden our heart, so that we do not fear you?" (Isaiah 63:17).
:* God said, "If a prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the Lord, have deceived that prophet" (Ezekiel 14:9).
:* John writes that those who "did not believe in [Jesus] could not believe," because, quoting Isaiah 6:10, "[God] has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart" (John 12:37–40 ''abr'').
:* God "hardens the heart of whomever he chooses" (Romans 9:18).
:* "God sends [those who are perishing] a powerful delusion, leading them to believe what is false, so [they] will be condemned" (2 Thessalonians 2:11–12).
:* "Those who do not believe . . . stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined [by God] to do" (1 Peter 2:7–8).

== Theodicy unresolved ==

The existence of evil in the world, in the view of Raymond Lam, "presents the gravest challenge to the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God." Lam also observes that "no theodicy is easy."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Lam, "The problem of Evil and Theodicy: A Non-Classical Approach through the Philosophy of the Gospels," ''Emergent Australasian Philosophers'', Issue 2, 2009, online at https://www.scribd.com/doc/24790170/The-Problem-of-Evil-and-Theodicy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dictionary of Theology'' explains why Lam asserts that "no theodicy is easy." It explains that "the [theodic] issue is raised in light of the sovereignty of God," and it asks, "how could a holy and loving God who is in control of all things allow evil to exist?" The difficulty of the question is attested by the fact that "the answer has been debated for as long as the church has existed," but "we still do not have a definitive answer and the Bible does not seek to justify God's actions."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Theology'', s.v. "Theodicy," http://www.carm.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding theodicy and the Bible, ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'' concludes that "the Bible does not answer the oft-posed problem of how a just, omnipotent, and loving God could permit evil to exist in a universe he had created."&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. "Evil."&lt;/ref&gt;

With no "definitive answer" to the theodic question, "debates about theodicy continue among believers and unbelievers alike," observes Robert F. Brown. Therefore, Brown adds, "theodicy remains a perennial concern for thoughtful religious commitment." Theodicy remains a "perennial concern" because, Brown reports, "how the divine can be compatible with the existence of evil in the world has perplexed profound thinkers and ordinary people right down to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch and others, eds., ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5'', s.v. "Theodicy."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virginia Wesleyan University''' is a comprehensive university of the liberal arts and sciences located in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. Founded in 1961 by the Virginia Conference of [[United Methodist Church|The United Methodist Church]], the university enrolls approximately 1,500 students annually in undergraduate, graduate, and online programs. An additional 510 non-credit continuing education students enroll annually through the Robert F. Boyd Institute, the Center for the Study of Religious Freedom, the Center for Sacred Music, and the Westminster/Wesleyan Lifelong Learning Institute. Virginia Wesleyan transitioned from a college to a university in 2017.

The Virginia Wesleyan University campus is also home to the Chesapeake Bay Academy, an educational institution founded in 1989 that educates and guides students with learning disabilities, including attention disorders (ADHD), dyslexia, and dysgraphia, and the Tidewater Collegiate Academy, an innovative laboratory for teaching and learning that extends from the primary grades through high school.

Through academic collaboration with local arts and sciences partners, on-site learning experiences are also provided at the [[Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center]] in Virginia Beach (the university and aquarium jointly own and operate "The Ocean Explorer," a marine science research vessel); The [[Chrysler Museum of Art]] in Norfolk; [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]]; and the [[Norfolk Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/about-us/accolades.php|title=Accolades|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was chartered in 1961 as Virginia Wesleyan College under the initiative of Methodist minister Joseph S. Johnston, later the college's first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/about-us/our-history.php|title=Our History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a university in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vwu.edu/news-a-events/news-releases/virginia-wesleyan-college-announces-transition-to-university-status|title="Virginia Wesleyan Announces Transition to University Status"|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's sports include basketball, cheer, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, indoor/outdoor track and field, and volleyball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vwuathletics.com/programs|title=Virginia Wesleyan Interactive Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university maintains an Athletic Hall of Fame honoring those who have made lasting contributions to Virginia Wesleyan's intercollegiate athletic program through outstanding achievements or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/alumni-a-friends/athletic-hall-of-fame/|title=Athletic Hall of Fame|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Virginia Wesleyan University has earned recognition as one of the top NCAA Division III programs in the country. The men's basketball team won the national championship in 2006, and the following year returned to the championship game, which they lost. The women's soccer team made it to the final four in 2006 after winning the ODAC tournament for the first time in program history. In 2016, Evan Cox was the Individual NCAA National Champion for Men's Golf. The Virginia Wesleyan softball team won the 2017 NCAA Division III National Championship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/softball/article/2017-05-29/diii-softball-championship-virginia-wesleyan-sweeps-final-against|title=DIII softball championship: Virginia Wesleyan sweeps final against St. John Fisher|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a record 54 wins. Head Coach Brandon Elliott was named ODAC Coach of the Year and State Coach of the Year, while his coaching staff earned Regional and National Coaching Staff of the Year honors. Freshman pitcher Hanna Hull earned 2017 Schutt Sports/NFCA Division III National Freshman of the Year and honors as the first National Player of the Year in program history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vwuathletics.com/sports/sball/championshipcentral|title=Virginia Wesleyan Softball|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, they repeated as NCAA Champions, Hull was again National Player of the Year, and Elliott's staff again earned National Coaching Staff of the Year honors.

The success has been greeted with support from private donors for new and renovated facilities:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3626">'''Virophysics''' is a branch of [[biophysics]] in which the theoretical concepts and experimental techniques of [[physics]] are applied to study the mechanics and dynamics driving the interactions between virus and cells.&lt;ref name=nsercdg13/&gt;&lt;ref name=conf2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcmaster14/&gt; 

== Overview ==
Research in virophysics typically focuses on resolving the physical structure and structural properties of viruses, the dynamics of their assembly and disassembly, their population kinetics over the course of an infection, and the emergence and evolution of various strains.&lt;ref name=nsercdg13/&gt;&lt;ref name=conf2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcmaster14/&gt; The common aim of these efforts is to establish a set of models (expressions or laws) that quantitatively describe the details of all processes involved in viral infections with reliable predictive power. Having such a quantitative understanding of viruses would not only rationalize the development of strategies to prevent, guide, or control the course of viral infections, but could also be used to exploit virus processes and put virus to work in areas such as nanosciences, materials, and biotechnologies.

Traditionally, in vivo and in vitro experimentation has been the only way to study viral infections. This approach for deriving knowledge based solely on experimental observations relies on common-sense assumptions (e.g., a higher virus count means a fitter virus). These assumptions often go untested due to difficulties controlling individual components of these complex systems without affecting others. The use of [[Mathematical model|mathematical models]] and [[Computer simulation|computer simulations]] to describe such systems, however, makes it possible to deconstruct an experimental system into individual components and determine how the pieces combine to create the infection we observe.

Virophysics has large overlaps with other fields. For example, the modelling of infectious disease dynamics is a popular research topic in mathematics, notably in [[applied mathematics]] or [[mathematical biology]]. While most modelling efforts in mathematics have focused on elucidating the dynamics of spread of infectious diseases at an epidemiological scale (person-to-person), there is also important work being done at the cellular scale (cell-to-cell). Virophysics focuses almost exclusively on the single-cell or multi-cellular scale, utilizing physical models to resolve the temporal and spatial dynamics of viral infection spread within a cell culture (in vitro), an organ (ex vivo or in vivo) or an entire host (in vivo).

[[File:Berlin-WZB-2007.jpg|thumb|WZB Berlin Social Science Center]]

The '''WZB Berlin Social Science Center''' ({{lang-de|Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung}}, '''WZB'''), also known by its German initials WZB, is an internationally renowned [[research institute]] for the [[social sciences]], the largest such institution in Europe not affiliated with a university.

It was founded in 1969 through an all-party initiative of the German ''[[Bundestag]]''.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/chronik.en.htm "Brief Timeline of the WZB"], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; Around 140 German and foreign sociologists, political scientists, economists, historians, statisticians, computer scientists and legal scholars work in the WZB conducting [[basic research]] on selected social and political issues, concentrating on the industrialized societies of Japan and the West, as well as the transformations of Central and Eastern Europe and China. The question of globalization is of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/selbstverst.en.htm "Positioning WZB Research in the Scientific Landscape"], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research areas==
The WZB is organized into four research areas:

# [[Education]], [[employment|work]] and life opportunities
# [[Market (economics)|Market]] [[policies]]
# [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic impacts]]
# [[Civil society]], [[War|conflicts]] and [[democracy]]

Constituted as a non-profit [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|limited liability company (GmbH)]], ownership is shared between the [[Politics of Germany|federal government]] (75 percent) and the city-state of [[Berlin]] (25 percent).&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; WZB is a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]].

Although not a university body, it collaborates with [[Free University of Berlin]], [[Hertie School of Governance]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]], [[Technical University of Berlin]], as well as with research institutions abroad. Many WZB scientists are also university professors or hold teaching assignments.

Recent presidents of the WZB have included [[Meinolf Dierkes]] (1980–1987), [[Wolfgang Zapf]] (1987–1994), [[Friedhelm Neidhardt]] (1994–2000), and historian [[Jürgen Kocka]] (2001–2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/ehemalige.en.htm Former Presidents], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is sociologist [[Jutta Allmendinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/allmendinger.en.htm Prof. Jutta Allmendinger, curriculum vitae], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

WZB is said to be the largest such research institution for the social sciences in [[Europe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2008}} Around 140 social scientists are conducting research on the developmental trends, problems of adaptation, and possibilities for innovation in modern societies.

The [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[Berlin|federal state of Berlin]] have been shareholders and main funders since 1976.

WZB headquarters on [[Landwehrkanal]] in [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Berlin-Tiergarten]] was designed 1979–1988 by the British architects [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Michael Wilford]] integrating the 1894 building of [[:de:Reichsversicherungsamt|Reichsversicherungsamt]].

== A.SK Social Science Award and Fellowships ==

'''Weapon systems engineering''' involves using engineering tools in [[technology]] to create and guarantee the safety and performance of weapons. It is currently being used by the [[military]] and the government to create new weapons to protect the [[United States]]. It is used to make nuclear and non-[[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and ensure their safety throughout their lifespan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/defenseprograms/futurescienceandtechnologyprograms/engineering|title=Engineering|website=NNSA|accessdate=February 15th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies Involved ==
Many companies help our government and military to manufacture new weapons and strategies. One is Parsons. The [[Missile Defense Agency]], MDA, is a research agency that develops and tests the missile defense agency to defend the United States and its allies. Parsons helps with this through the MDA [[missile]] contract. They provide missile system support including tests and evaluating the performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parsons.com/project/weapons-missile-systems-engineering/|title=Weapons and Missile Systems Engineering – Various U.S. Locations - Parsons|work=Parsons|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] awarded multi-million-dollar contracts with Tekla Research and Avian-Precise Co. to support the "[[Naval Air Systems Command|Naval Air Systems]] Command's Systems Engineering Department". Tekla is to help NAVAIR assess [[technology]], cost, and design. Avian-Precise is to help the command sustain a weapons system related to all U.S. naval platforms and systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.executivebiz.com/2018/02/navy-selects-tekla-research-avian-precise-co-for-navair-systems-engineering-support-idiqs/|title=Navy Selects Tekla Research, Avian-Precise Co. for NAVAIR Systems Engineering Support IDIQs|work=ExecutiveBiz|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventions ==
The electromagnetic railgun launcher is a new long-range weapon using electricity instead of chemicals to launch projectiles. [[Projectile|Projectiles]] can be launched at approximately 4,500 miles per hour using magnetic fields. These new weapons are allowing the military to eliminate [[Explosive material|explosives]] where possible. It is being used by the Navy as well for its ability to be effective and affordable. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://science.dodlive.mil/2015/02/13/the-future-moves-at-mach-6/|title=The Future Moves at Mach 6|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy is working on modernizing their weapons, including nuclear weapons. Two weapons on the list to work on creating are a "low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles" and a "nuclear capable submarine-launched cruise missile". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defensenews.com/space/2018/02/02/the-us-could-be-getting-2-new-nuclear-capabilities-here-are-the-details/|title=The US could be getting 2 new nuclear capabilities. Here are the details.|last=Mehta|first=Aaron|date=2018-02-21|work=Defense News|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is using Weapons Systems Engineering to help protect our soldiers. They have designed a [[Humvee]] to be equipped to contain a gun with an automated tracking system. This would be controlled by another [[soldier]] or a computer program. This along with other new systems, vehicles, etc. is all possible because of the new advancements in Weapon Systems Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taskandpurpose.com/army-wingman-autonomous-vehicle-program/|title=The Army Is Finally Engineering A Wingman Who Won’t Screw Soldiers Over|last=Keller|first=Jared|date=2018-02-14|work=Task &amp; Purpose|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the Army will test out automated Humvee's to certify them as combat ready vehicles. According to the Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) this is the first step toward weaponized robotics. The Army is not looking to make killing machines, but machines controlled by humans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.meritalk.com/articles/army-ready-to-certify-armed-robotic-wingman-vehicles-for-combat/|title=Army Ready to Certify Armed, Robotic ‘Wingman’ Vehicles for Combat – MeriTalk|website=www.meritalk.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] Research Lab (AFRL) assigned [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martain]] the job of creating "an aircraft-mounted high-power fibre laser". They must make a weapon that is small enough and light enough, but also can be effective. The laser will be mounted on jet fighters with the ability to disable enemies targeting systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.airforce-technology.com/features/agents-shield-us-air-forces-new-aircraft-mounted-laser-weapon/|title=Agents of SHiELD – the US Air Force’s new aircraft-mounted laser weapon - Airforce Technology|date=2018-02-19|work=Airforce Technology|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''white box system''' is a mechanical system installed in the [[engine room]] of a [[ship]] for controlling and monitoring the engine room [[bilge]] water discharge from the vessel.

The system consists of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the discharge from the vessel's [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]]. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The [[bilge water]] from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter. A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil content meter and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [[tamper resistance | cannot be tampered with]] and equally importantly provides the evidence that the vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as [[Port State Control]], [[United States Coast Guard]], [[Vetting]] or [[Classification society]] officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to [[MARPOL 73/78]] (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.

The '''World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)''' is a [[CEO]]-led organization of over 200 [[multinational company|international companies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us|title=About us|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Council is also connected to 60 national and regional buisness councils and partner organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/world-business-council-sustainable-development-wbcsd-0|title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development - WBCSD {{!}} Genève Internationale|website=www.geneve-int.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]] of 1992,&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt; when [[Stephan Schmidheiny]], a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memo to Rio+20: 'green economy' doesn't mean monetising nature|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/29/rio-20-green-economy-monetising-nature|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a forum called "Business Council for Sustainable Development", which went on to become ''Changing Course'', a book that coined the concept of [[eco-efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eco-Efficiency|url=http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/business/ecoeffic.shtml|website=www.smartcommunities.ncat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBCSD was created in 1995 in a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= THE ICC &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT|url=http://archive.corporateeurope.org/icc/icc_environment.html|website=archive.corporateeurope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based at the [[Maison de la paix]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/globalwarming/n721.xml|website=knowledge.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offices in New York and New Delhi.

==Operations==
The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are Circular Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Circular-Economy|title=Circular Economy - World business council for sustainable development|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cities and Mobility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Cities-and-Mobility|title=Cities and Mobility|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Climate and Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy|title=Energy &amp; Circular Economy|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Food, Land and Water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-Land-Water|title=Food, Land &amp; Water|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/People|title=People|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Redefining Value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value|title=Redefining Value|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wbcsd.org/2018/11/Value.Impact.Voice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Impact and influence==
A 2003 [[World Bank]]/[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] commissioned study  identified the WBCSD as one of the "most influential forums" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesaver.org/file/toolmanager/CustomO16C45F49313.pdf Race to the Top: Attracting and Enabling Global Sustainable Business]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Globescan]] survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveys.globescan.com/sdroleaders/sose04-2_resorg.pdf 2004 Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a "major role" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpi.cam.ac.uk/PDF/Aug%202006.pdf Cambridge Sustainability Research Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007's [[Ethisphere Institute]] list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked 9th, which made him the 2nd most influential NGO leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethisphere.com/influential/ 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210162230/http://ethisphere.com/influential/ |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to [[sustainable development]]. Among its over 180 members&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members&lt;/ref&gt; are well-known companies such as [[DuPont]], [[3M]], [[Nestlé]], [[BP]], [[Danone]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. WBCSD provides its members with the '''value, impact and voice''' to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.

A key element is the personal commitment of the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officers]] (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD’s policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD’s work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies.

===Forética===
Forética claims to be global network of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to [[ISO 26000]] and supported by [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csr-supplychain.org/ CSR Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/eNews/eNewsDetails.aspx?ID=16293&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Leading Spanish think-tank Forética joins WBCSD’s Global Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

According to Greenpeace the ''World Business Council for Sustainable Development '' is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the [[climate change]] and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest nonrenewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a ‘Who’s Who’ of the world’s largest carbon-intensive companies.&lt;ref name=GP2010&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back?Full report] November 23, 2011 page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sierra Club]] has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/rocky-mountain-chapter/calendar-2 |title=Calendar &amp;#124; Sierra Club |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austineconetwork.com/content/austin-sierra-club-monthly-meeting |title=Austin Sierra Club monthly meeting &amp;#124; Austin EcoNetwork |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/GHG_roadmap_Final.pdf |title=www.edf.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/biofuels-sustainability-certification-report.pdf |title=Biofuel Sustainability Performance Guidelines |accessdate=2015-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBCSC's Vision 2020 report was highlighted by [[The Guardian]] as "the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-world-business-council |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development: Vision 2050 &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business &amp;#124; The Guardian |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research''' ('''UNU-WIDER''') is part of the [[United Nations University]] (UNU). UNU-WIDER, the first research and training centre to be established by the UNU, is an international academic organization set up with the aim of promoting peace and progress by bringing together leading scholars from around the world to tackle pressing global problems.

==UNU-WIDER==

===The establishment of the UNU and UNU-WIDER===
In 1969 the UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] suggested that the time had arrived when serious consideration might be given to establishing an international university. An international university, the Secretary-General said, would be devoted to the Charter objectives of peace and progress. It would be staffed with professors from many nations and all parts of the world. The university would thus serve to break down the barriers that created misunderstanding and mistrust between nations and cultures.

The UNU was established by the General Assembly on 6 December 1973 to be an international community of scholars engaged in research, advanced training, and the dissemination of knowledge related to the pressing global problems of human survival, development, and welfare. The UNU started its activities in 1975 at its headquarters in Tokyo.

The UNU established UNU-WIDER following a brainstorming of leading economists of the day outlining the need for an institution to undertake a sustained effort for a more comprehensive understanding of the forces at work in the global economic system and their consequences for specific developing country situations and at the international level

In November 1983 Finland offered to host UNU-WIDER in its capital Helsinki, providing premises for the Institute and an endowment fund of US$25 million.

UNU-WIDER was founded by a Host Country Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding signed by the then Foreign Minister of Finland, Paavo Väyrynen, and the Rector of UNU, Soedjatmoko, on the 4th of February 1984.

===Mandate===
UNU-WIDER's mandate is to undertake multidisciplinary research and policy analysis on structural changes affecting the living conditions of the world's poorest people; provide a forum for professional interaction and advocacy of policies leading to equitable and environmentally sustainable growth; and train researchers and government officials in the field of economic and social policy making.

===History===
Following the approval by the Finnish Parliament, the Host Country Agreement came into force on 20 June 1984. [[Lal Jayawardena]] was appointed the inaugural director the 1st of March in 1985, and the institute was initially located at premises at Annankatu 42C in Helsinki, Finland.

====Research====

During its existence UNU-WIDER has produced a large amount of research on the broad topics of poverty, inequality and growth. The Research Programme changes every two years. It is constructed by the Director in consultation with the UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists, and donor government representatives. Areas of research have spanned all facets and levels of development economics including topics like; Finance and trade; economic growth and the environment; women and development; international migration and refugees; micro-simulation of tax benefit reforms; social impact of privatization; fiscal policies for growth; transition and institutions; development aid; global trends in inequality and poverty; personal assets from a global perspective and many more.  During the mid-1980s the Horn of Africa was confronting widespread famine. As this coincided with the launch of the very first UNU-WIDER research programme, the theme of “Hunger and Poverty: The Poorest Billion” was included in it. This research was directed by Jean  Drèze and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. It has been argued that the resulting three volumes of study transformed the thinking on issues of famine and food security at the time. In the late 1990s WIDER undertook a major study of income inequality trends throughout the world under the direction of its then director Giovanni Andrea Cornia. The study uncovered so called “new causes” of inequality linked to excessively liberal economic policies and the way in which economic reforms have been implemented. Furthermore, the study produced the first version of the [[World Income Inequality Database]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wider.unu.edu/research/Database/en_GB/database/&lt;/ref&gt; (WIID). It is a comprehensive and freely available database of statistics on inequality trends within countries. Since 2009, under director Finn Tarp, UNU-WIDER has concentrated widely on the “triple crisis” of food, climate change and finance.

Art House, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helsingin Sanomat, monthly supplement, 1993 February 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vihreä Lanka (22.4.1993, issue 15, pp. 9-11)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional framework===

The [http://unu.edu/council/ Council of UNU]  determines the principles and policies guiding the whole university. [http://www.wider.unu.edu/aboutus/institutional-framework/board/en_GB/list_board/ The Board of UNU-WIDER], comprising well-known economists, policy-makers, and social scientists from all over the world, advises on research and other activities. The Director of UNU-WIDER has overall responsibility for the research and management of the Institute, and implements the research programme in keeping with guidelines set out by the Board and the Council.
UNU functions as a decentralized 'network of networks' with an interdisciplinary and global perspective. The UNU system comprises the UNU Centre in Tokyo and a worldwide network of Research and Training Centres and Programmes (RTC/Ps)  assisted by numerous associated and cooperating institutions.

===Organization===
Research is coordinated by Helsinki-based staff consisting of resident researchers and  support staff. A network of external project directors, located at their universities or institutes, contribute to current projects along with several hundred network participants around the world. This group includes research staff from the [[United Nations University|UNU]], [[UN]], [[ECLAC]], [[UNDP]], [[FAO]], [[International Labour Organization]], the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[UNICEF]] and the [[Bretton Woods institutions]] including the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. Visiting scholars typically spend two to three months in Helsinki working on topics related to the current research programme. The internship programme allows PhD students in economics or related social sciences to spend two to three months at UNU-WIDER.

====Funding====
UNU-WIDER was founded with contributions from the governments of [[Finland]] and [[India]], the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (Sida), and the [[Nippon Foundation]] (Sasakawa Foundation, Japan). Income from the endowment fund has largely covered core expenditures. Supplementary financial support for research and other activities has been received from the governments of [[Denmark]], Finland, [[Italy]], [[Norway]], Sweden and the [[United Kingdom]]; the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]]( Kuwait), [[Ford Foundation]], [[Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation]] (Finland), [[MacArthur Foundation]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] (Finland), [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[SITRA]] (Finnish National Fund for Research and Development), [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UN-DESA), [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the World Bank. In-kind contributions, such as assistance in hosting workshops and conferences, are also regularly received from various universities, United Nations agencies and other international organizations.

===Directors===
The current director of UNU-WIDER is [[Finn Tarp]]. Tarp also holds the Chair of Professor of Development Economics at the Department of Economics at the University of Copenhagen, where he completed his MSc and PhD in Economics. Former directors include; [[Anthony Shorrocks]], [[Matti Pohjola]], [[Giovanni Andrea Cornia]], [[Mihály Simai]] and [[Lal Jayawardena]].

==Activities==

===Research===

The Research Programme is reformulated every two years by the Institute’s director in consultation with the UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists in the UN and elsewhere, and donor government representatives. Research projects are led by scholars (Research Fellows and External Project Directors) who elaborate the proposals before the projects are launched. Each project typically invites selected authors to write original research papers which are later presented and discussed at project workshops and conferences. In some cases, a more general 'call for papers' may be announced on the Institute’s website.
Typically, two large development conferences are organized annually in Helsinki, each of which brings together around 100 individuals to present papers and to discuss current problems on development issues. Participants are usually researchers and policy makers from the academic, government, and development communities. Special attempts are made to encourage researchers from developing countries and to achieve a gender balance at these events.
The research studies are published as [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/en_GB/wider-working-papers/ WIDER working papers]. The outcomes also often include a [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/policy-briefs/en_GB/Policy-briefs/  policy brief] and an article in the [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/newsletter/en_GB/introduction-angle/  WIDER''Angle''].

===Annual lecture===
The WIDER Annual Lecture is delivered by an eminent scholar who has made a significant contribution in the field of economics of development and transition.
