He was son of the third khan of Baku [[Mirza Muhammad Khan II]]. He later served as an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and participated in the [[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828|Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828]]. He later retired and settled in [[Quba]], but traveled extensively within Russia, meeting important literary figures as [[Alexander Pushkin]].

Also known by his [[pen name]] '''Qodsi''' / '''Qudsi''' / '''Gudsi''' (Azeri: ''Qüdsi''), Bakikhanov is referred to by many Azerbaijani scholars as being one of the "earliest (Azerbaijani) intellectuals and historians".{{sfn|Bournoutian|2004|page=17}} He is credited with being the first person that wrote a proper "scholarly [[monograph]] on the history of greater [[Shirvan]]"; the area that would later make up most of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].{{sfn|Bournoutian|2004|page=17}} His ''Qanun-e Qudsi'', was the first Persian grammar manual published in history.

==Early life==
[[File:Bakikhanov House Quba.jpg|right|thumb|Bakikhanov house in Quba, currently a museum named after him|255x255px]]
According to other sources, Bakikhanov was born on 10 June 1794. His childhood contemporized with a defining epoch in the history of the Caucasus—the era of battles between [[Russia]] and [[Persia]] over political domination in the region. Bakikhanov was the son of the 3rd khan of Baku, [[Mirza Muhammad Khan II]] and a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] lady Sofia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasrinbabanly.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/a-challenging-literary-figure/|title=A CHALLENGING LITERARY FIGURE|date=8 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his academic studies at the age of 7 and soon excelled in [[Persian language|Persian]]. In 1813, seven years after the loss of the khanate's sovereignty, the family moved to [[Quba]], where Bakikhanov studied [[social sciences|social]] and [[life sciences]], [[humanities]], and languages. Within the next ten years, he learned [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], followed later by [[French language|French]] and [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shirvan.org/rus/content.php?review.45 Studies on Qudsi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132619/http://www.shirvan.org/rus/content.php?review.45 |date=September 28, 2007 }} by G.Bakikhanova (in Russian). Retrieved 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, he established the first [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] literary society ''Golestan-i Iram''. His poetry at this early phase displayed Bakikhanov's deep moral and philosophical involvement in [[Islam]]. In 1820, he enlisted in the Russian army as an interpreter and got a commission for taking part in suppressing the rebellious [[Khanate of Kazi-Kumukh|Kazikumukh Khanate]] (present-day southern [[Dagestan]]).

==Political and diplomatic career==
Bakikhanov actively participated in political life of the [[Caucasus]]. He was a member of the Russian diplomatic mission that was in charge of negotiating border issues between Russia and Persia in the 1820s. In 1823, he assisted in gathering ethnographic information for the ''Description of the Province of Karabakh''. In 1828, he was among the Russian military command under General [[Paskevich]] that took part in peace negotiations with Persia, which resulted in signing the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]]. He managed to convince Khan Ehsan of [[Nakhchivan khanate|Nakhchivan]], as well as a number of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] leaders of Persia to ally with Russia. The year after Bakikhanov was awarded the 4th Degree Medal of [[St. Vladimir]] for participating in the siege of [[Kars]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829]]. For a while he served at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in [[Saint Petersburg]], and had travelled to [[Kaunas]], [[Riga]], and [[Warsaw]] before he retired in 1835 and returned to the village of Amsar near Quba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shirvan.org/rus/content.php?review.45 Azeri Literature] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132619/http://www.shirvan.org/rus/content.php?review.45 |date=September 28, 2007 }} (in Russian). Fundamental Electronic Library ''The Russian Literature and Folklore''. Retrieved 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in education==
Bakikhanov's religious views were generally [[Liberalism|liberal]] due to major European influences. He criticized [[fanaticism]] among the religious masses and the [[Obscurantism]] of the clergy. He promoted the Islamic culture in the region and in Russia as a whole. His ultimate goal was to establish a Muslim college in [[Baku]] and an Oriental languages school in [[Tbilisi]]. In 1832, he came up with a project for establishing a major educational institution for Muslims, where subjects would be taught in Russian, Persian, and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]. He went further, and wrote a number of textbooks through which students were expected to study. The project was sent to the governor of the Caucasus for approval but unfortunately was disregarded and never looked into. Bakikhanov also translated several fables by [[Ivan Krylov]] into Azeri — however, only one has been preserved till nowadays. His greatest accomplishment in the field of education was writing ''Qanun-e Qudsi'', the first Persian grammar manual published in history.{{sfn|Floor|Javadi|2009|page=xiii}}

==Major works==
'''''Riyadh al-Quds''''' (''The Holy Garden''). Bakikhanov wrote his first book (in Azeri) under religious influence from the Muslim communities of Quba. At the same time, ''Riyadh al-Quds'' was Bakikhanov's reflection piece on Shi'a mystic literature, such as ''Jila al-Uyun'' by Muhammed Baghir Majlisi.

'''''Golestan-e Eram''''' (''The Blooming Flower Garden'') is one of his major works (written in Persian) and dedicated to the history of the East Caucasus from Ancient Times to 1813.  An English translation of this work has been made by Willem Floor and Hasan Javadi and published by Mage Publishers in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Willem Floor, Hasan Javadi(2009), "The Heavenly Rose-Garden: A History of Shirvan &amp; Daghestan by Abbas Qoli Aqa Bakikhanov, Mage Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ketab-e Asgariyyeh''''' (''The Book of Asgar'') was Bakikhanov's first fiction book: a love story of two young people, persecuted by the fanatic society they lived in. The book was written in the Persian language.

'''''Qanun-e Qodsi''''' (''The Holy Law'') was the first book in history entirely dedicated to the grammar of the Persian language. Originally written in Persian in 1831, it was translated into Russian in 1841 and became one of the bases for the development of [[iranistics]] in Russia.

'''''Mishkat al-Anwar''''' (''The Cresset Niche''). This book is an almanach of fables, parables, as well as some quotes from the [[Qur'an]] and references to [[Sufi]] mysticism overall aimed at preserving social values and morals within society. The book was written in Persian.

'''''Kashf al-Qaraib''''' (''The Discovery of the Unknown'') was one of the school books written by Bakikhanov in the early 1830s in Persian, where he describes the discovery of the Americas.

'''''Asrar al-Malakut''''' (''The Secrets of Heavens'') is an introduction to astronomy, written in Arabic.

Other works include '''''Umumi Joghrafya''''' (''General Geography''), '''''[[Nasîhatnâme|Kitab-i Nasihat]]''''' (''The Book of Admonitions''), etc., scientific essays, collected poems, articles, translations of various works into Azeri and Russian, etc.

==Death==
In 1845, Bakikhanov went on a [[hajj]]. On his way to the holy Islamic sights, he was warmly received by the Shah of Persia and was awarded the [[Order of the Lion and the Sun|Shir-e Khorshid]], the highest ranking Persian medal. There he also visited [[Isfahan]], [[Yazd]], [[Shiraz]], and [[Kermanshah]]. In [[Constantinople]], Bakikhanov had an audience with the Sultan, who showed interest in some of his academic writings, particularly in ''Asrar al-Malakut'', of which he was presented a copy. From there, Bakikhanov went to visit [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. On his way from Medina back to [[Damascus]] he caught cholera and died in the small town of Wadi Fatima in [[Hejaz]] (present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]) in 1847.

== Family ==
In 1826, Bakikhanov married Sakina (b. 1807) his paternal cousin and grandnephew of [[Fatali Khan]], daughter of Kalb Huseyn agha, by whom he had two daughters:&lt;ref&gt;Acts collected by the Caucasian Archaeological Commission: [In 12 vols.] / Archive of Chief Executive viceroy of the Caucasus; Under the Society.

{{redirect|Miles Gloriosus|the Plautus play|Miles Gloriosus (play)}}
'''''Alazṓn''''' ({{lang-grc|ἀλαζών}}) is one of three [[stock characters]] in [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] of the [[theatre of ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; He is the opponent of the ''[[Eiron|eirôn]]''. The ''alazṓn'' is an [[impostor]] that sees himself as greater than he actually is. The '''''senex iratus''''' (the angry father) and the '''''miles gloriosus''''' (the glorious soldier) are two types of ''alazṓn''.&lt;ref name=Frye&gt;Frye, Northrop. 1957. ''Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays''. London: Penguin, 1990. {{ISBN|0-14-012480-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Miles Gloriosus''==
{{wiktionary|miles gloriosus}}
''Miles Gloriosus'' (literally, "braggart-soldier", in [[Latin language|Latin]]) is a [[stock character]] of a boastful soldier from the [[Comedy (drama)|comic]] [[theatre of ancient Rome]], and variations on this character have appeared in [[drama]] and [[fiction]] ever since.&lt;ref name=Frye /&gt; The character derives from the ''alazṓn'' or "braggart" of the [[Ancient Greek comedy#Old Comedy|Greek Old Comedy]] (e.g. [[Aristophanes]]).  The term "Miles Gloriosus" is occasionally applied in a contemporary context to refer to a posturing and self-deceiving boaster or bully.

=== Literary instances ===
In the play ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' by [[Plautus]], the term applies to the main character Pyrgopolynices. This foolish ''Miles Gloriosus'' brags openly and often about his supposed greatness, while the rest of the characters feign their admiration and secretly plot against him. Heavily borrowing from Plautus, the [[Stephen Sondheim]]-[[Burt Shevelove]]-[[Larry Gelbart]] musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' features a warrior named Miles Gloriosus.

Shakespeare uses the type most notably with the bombastic and self-glorifying ensign [[Ancient Pistol]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn, Shakespeare the Playwright: A Companion to the Complete Tragedies, Histories, Comedies, and Romances, Praeger, Westport, 1996. p.468.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are  "fashion's own knight", the Spaniard Armardo, in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', the worthless Captain Parolles in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', and [[Falstaff]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'', and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.

[[Baron Munchausen]] is a braggart soldier.

In [[Commedia dell'arte]], the figure of [[Il Capitano]] is a ''miles gloriosus''.&lt;ref&gt;John Rudlin, ''Commedia dell'Arte: An Actor's Handbook'', p. 120, {{ISBN|0-415-04770-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the title role of ''[[Háry János]]'' by [[Kodály]] is an example of the character.

In PC game ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'', there is a non-playable character named Miles Gloriosus, willing to brag about his accomplishments as soldier.

==''Senex iratus''==
The ''senex iratus'' or heavy father figure is a comic [[archetype]] character who belongs to the alazon or impostor group in [[theater]], manifesting himself through his rages and threats, his obsessions and his gullibility.

His usual function is to impede the love of the [[lovers (character)|hero and heroine]], and his power to do so stems from his greater social position and his increased control of cash.  In the [[New Comedy]], he was often the father of the hero and so his rival.  More frequently since, he has been the father of the heroine who insists on her union with the bad fiancé; as such, he appears in both ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', where he fails and so the play is a comedy, and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', where his acts are successful enough to render the play a tragedy.

[[Pantalone]] in [[Commedia dell'arte]] acts as a ''senex iratus''.

In his ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', [[Northrop Frye]] considered all blocking humors in comedy to be variations on the basic function of the ''senex iratus''.

'''Alfred DuPont Chandler Jr.''' (September 15, 1918 – May 9, 2007) was a professor of business history at [[Harvard Business School]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]], who wrote extensively about the scale and the management structures of modern corporations. His works redefined business and economic history of industrialization. He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] for his work, ''[[The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business]]'' (1977). He has been called "the doyen of American business historians".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21727049-1865-1896-saw-tumultuous-changes-new-oxford-history-united-states&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and life==
Chandler was the great-grandson of [[Henry Varnum Poor]]. "Du Pont" was apparently a family name given to his grandfather because his great-grandmother was raised by the Du Pont family, and there are other connections as well.&lt;ref&gt;Carol May, "[http://ecfanews.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/alfred-du-pont-chandler-jr-by-carol-may/ Alfred du Pont Chandler Jr.]," Edmund's Community Courier ([http://ecfanews.wordpress.com/about/ Edmund Chandler Family Association]), March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler graduated from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in 1936 and [[Harvard College]] in 1940. After World War II, he returned to Harvard, finished his M.A. in 1946, and earned his doctorate in 1952 under the direction of [[Frederick Merk]]. He taught at [[M.I.T.]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] before arriving at [[Harvard Business School]] in 1970.

==Publications==
Chandler used the papers of his ancestor [[Henry Varnum Poor]], a leading analyst of the railway industry, the publisher of the ''[[American Railroad Journal]]'', and a founder of [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], as a basis for his Ph.D. thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9184105 |title=Alfred Chandler |work=The Economist |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler began looking at large-scale enterprise in the early 1960s. His book ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise'' (1962) examined the organization of [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] He found that [[managerial]] [[organization]] developed in response to the [[corporation]]'s [[business strategy]]. The book was voted the eleventh most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the [[Academy of Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bedeian |first1= Arthur G. |last2= Wren |first2= Daniel A.|author-link1= Arthur G. Bedeian|author-link2=Daniel A. Wren|date= Winter 2001 |title= Most Influential Management Books of the 20th Century |journal= Organizational Dynamics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages= 221–225 |doi= 10.1016/S0090-2616(01)00022-5 | url = http://www.bus.lsu.edu/bedeian/articles/MostInfluentialBooks-OD2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on the importance of a cadre of managers to organize and run large-scale corporations was expanded into a "managerial revolution" in ''The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977) for which he received a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. He pursued that book's themes further in ''Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism'', (1990) and co-edited an [[anthology]] on the same themes, with [[Franco Amatori]] and [[Takashi Hikino]], ''Big Business and the Wealth of Nations'' (1997).

==''The Visible Hand''==
Chandler's masterwork was ''[[The Visible Hand]]: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977). His first two chapters looked at traditional owner-operated small business operations in commerce and production, including the largest among them, the slave plantations in the South. Chapters 3-5 summarize the history of railroad management, with stress on innovations not just in technology but also in accounting, finance and statistics. He then turned to the new business operations made possible by the rail system in mass distribution, such as jobbers, department stores and mail order. A quick survey (ch 8) review mass innovation in mass production.The integration of mass distribution and mass production (ch 9-11) led to many mergers and the emergence of giant industrial corporations by 1900. Management for Chandler was much more than the CEO, it was the whole system of techniques and included middle management (ch 11) as well as the corporate structure of the biggest firms, Standard Oil, General Electric, US Steel, and DuPont (ch 13-14). Chandler argued that managerial firms evolved in order to take advantage of productive techniques available after the rail network was in place. These firms had a higher productivity and lower costs resulting in higher profits. The firms created the "managerial class" in America because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system. According to Steven Usselman, this ability to achieve efficiency through coordination, and not some anti-competitive monopolistic greed by robber barons, explained the high levels of concentration in modern American industry.&lt;ref&gt;Steven W. Usselman, "Still Visible: Alfred D. Chandler's The Visible Hand," ''Technology and Culture'' 47, no. 3 (2006), 584-596.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational synthesis==
Along with economist [[Oliver E. Williamson]] and historians [[Louis Galambos]], [[Robert H. Wiebe]], and [[Thomas C. Cochran (historian)|Thomas C. Cochran]], Chandler was a leading historian of the notion of organizational synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3114810|title = Technology, Political Economy, and Professionalization: Central Themes of the Organizational Synthesis|journal = Business History Review|volume = 57|issue = 4|pages = 471–493|last1 = Galambos|first1 = Louis|doi = 10.2307/3114810|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argued that during the 19th century, the development of new systems based on steam power and electricity created a [[Second Industrial Revolution]], which resulted in much more capital-intensive industries than had the industrial revolution of the previous century. The mobilization of the [[capital (economics)|capital]] necessary to exploit these new systems required a larger number of workers and managers, and larger physical plants than ever before. More particularly, the thesis of ''The Visible Hand'' is that, counter to other theses regarding how [[capitalism]] functions, administrative structure and managerial coordination replaced Adam Smith's "[[invisible hand]]" (market forces) as the core developmental and structuring impetus of modern business.

In the wake of this increase of industrial scale, three successful models of capitalism emerged, which Chandler associated with the three leading countries of the period: [[Great Britain]] ("personal capitalism"), the [[United States]] ("competitive capitalism") and [[Germany]] ("cooperative capitalism.")

Despite the important differences in these three models, the common thread among the developed nations is that the large industrial firm has been the engine of growth in three ways: first, it has provided focal points for capital and labor on large scales; second, it became the educator whereby a nation learned the pertinent technology and developed managerial skills; third, it served as the core around which medium and small firms that supply and serve it grew.

==Influence==
Chandler's work was somewhat ignored in history departments, but proved influential in business, economics, and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. McCraw, "Alfred Chandler: His Vision and Achievement," ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 207-226&lt;/ref&gt;

In the business field, Chandler, along with [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] and [[Igor Ansoff]], has been credited with the foundational role in introducing and popularizing the concept of business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schendel, Dan E., and Hofer, Charles W., 1979, Strategic management. A new view of business policy and planning, Little Brown, Boston, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatten, Kenneth J., Schendel, Dan E., and Cooper, Arnold C., 1978, A strategic model of the U.S. brewing industry: 1952-1971, Academy of Management Journal, vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Anne Sigismund, and Reger, Rhonda Kay, 1987, A review of strategic process research, Journal of Management, vol. 13, no. 2, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKiernan, Peter, 1997, Strategy past; strategy futures, Long Range Planning, vol. 30, no. 5, p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chamberlain's Theory of Strategy]] cites Chandler's Strategy and Structure repeatedly as a source of key concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, Geoffrey P., 2010, Understanding Strategy, CreateSpace, Charleston, SC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, prior to Chandler's research, some sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. Chandler's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences, and this thesis has influenced organizational sociologists' work since the late 1970s. It also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique Chandler's work more closely, turning up instances in which Chandler assumed American corporations acted for reasons of efficiency, when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Fligstein]], "Chandler and the Sociology of Organizations," ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 241-250&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11862">The '''abbé Antoine Banier''' (2 November 1673 – 2 November 1741), a French clergyman and member of the ''[[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]'' from 1713,&lt;ref&gt;His [[antiquarian]] contributions to the Académie's ''Transactions'' are less remembered today.&lt;/ref&gt; was a historian&lt;ref&gt;His ambitious social history ''Histoire générale des cérémonies, moeurs, et coûtumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde'', ("General history of the ceremonies, morals and customs of all the world's peoples")&lt;/ref&gt; and translator, whose rationalizing interpretation of [[Greek mythology]] was widely accepted until the mid-nineteenth century.

==Early Life and Education==
Banier, born at Dallet in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and educated at the Jesuit college at [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]], arrived in Paris as a young man and held a place as tutor to the children of président Dumetz.&lt;ref&gt;These biographical details are drawn from Bouillet Chassang, ''Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de géographie'', ''s.v.'' "Antoine Banier". The "président Dumetz" in question may have been a member of the family Dumetz de Rosnay, which held several posts in the ''[[Chambre des comptes]]'' and as ''maître des requêtes'' during the eighteenth century. ("L'état civil", in ''Mémoires de la Société de l'Histoire de Paris et de l'Ile-de-France'' '''26''' [1899:290])&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l'histoire''==
In his ''Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l'histoire'' (1711, recast in dialogue form in 1715, enthusiastically received&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Journal des sçavans'', (1715:246-252).&lt;/ref&gt; and often reprinted)&lt;ref&gt;The original title is   ''Explication historique des fables où l'on découvre leur origine et leur conformité avec l'histoire ancienne'', "Historical explication of fables where one discovers their origin and their conformity to ancient history". The third edition (1738) is the definitive one, under the more familiar title.&lt;/ref&gt; he offered a frankly [[Euhemerus|Euhemerist]] reading of the origins of [[Greek mythology]], seen as the gradually deified accounts of actual personages (see [[Euhemerism]]). The ''Advertisement'' to the English translation of Banier's Ovid summarised his procedure:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Mr. Banier hath renounced the common Method of treating Fables as mere Allegories,&lt;ref&gt;The reading of [[Greek mythology]] as [[allegory]] had its origins in fifth-century Athens, was codified by [[Plato]] and absorbed into Christian uses through [[neoplatonism]].&lt;/ref&gt; and hath proved, that they have their &lt;small&gt;FOUNDATION&lt;/small&gt; in &lt;small&gt;REAL HISTORY&lt;/small&gt;, and contain many important ''Facts''. He hath most judiciously stripped them of their poetical Embelishments and Disguises, and reduced them to the plain Historical Truths which the first Poets found them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Banier's Christian context placed these myths firmly in the tradition of [[idolatry]], the worship of false gods.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Betty Weinshenker, "Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France" ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' '''38'''.3, (Spring 2005:485-507); the broader context of abbé Banier's ''Mythologie'' in the [[history of ideas]] is reviewed in Frank E. Manuel, ''The Eighteenth Century Confronts the Gods'' (Harvard University Press) 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'': translation and illustrations==
For his translation of [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']] he wrote a preface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/banier1747.html Banier's Ovid Preface Englished (1747)-Ovid Illustrated, Univ. of Virginia E-Text Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An edition with Ovid's Latin and an English translation of Banier on facing pages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/banier.html "Abbé Banier's Ovid commentary Englished"]&lt;/ref&gt; was published first in 1717, with a preface by [[Samuel Garth|Dr Sir Samuel Garth]] and handsome illustrations by [[Bernard Picart]]. This was the form in which most eighteenth-century British readers without Latin approached Ovid:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will perhaps at first sight appear Pedantic, that a Book, which by its Magnificence and Price can only be intended for a Court and for Persons of the first Quality, should be half filled with Latin. But how many are there of so elevated a Rank, especially among the English Nobility, who can relish the Beauties of the Original?"&lt;ref&gt;The Bookseller's Preface, 1732 edition ([http://etext.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/banier.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The engravings took up a career independent of the text; they formed part of the extensive visual repertory of prints and illustrated books that was assembled at the [[Meissen porcelain|Manufactory of Meissen porcelain]], for the use of porcelain painters in the rococo style,&lt;ref&gt;''Le metamorphose d'Ovide etc. etc. par M. l'abbé Banier'' Amsterdam 1732 (handwritten library inventiry of 1846, noted by Maureen Cassidy-Geiger, "Graphic Sources for Meissen Porcelain: Origins of the Print Collection in the Meissen Archives" ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' '''31''' [1996:99-126] p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; and they remained useful as a source of inspiration into the neoclassical nineteenth century, for a copy appears in the 1824 sale catalogue of [[Benjamin Vulliamy]], the neoclassical clockmaker and bronzefounder to [[George IV of Great Britain|George IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Smith, "Benjamin Vulliamy's Library: A Collection of Neo-Classical Design Sources" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''141''' No. 1155 (June 1999:328-337) p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Histoire générale des cérémonies, moeurs, et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde''==
In the ambitious ''Histoire générale des cérémonies, moeurs, et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde'', in seven volumes (Paris, 1741), for which the engravings had been supplied by the late [[Bernard Picart]], Banier and his collaborator, the abbé [[Jean-Baptiste Le Mascrier]], aimed to describe all religions of the known world, their origins and doctrines and especially their rites: "It reflects in content and tone the learning, urbanity and self-confidence of the Catholic Church of the Ancien Régime," the producers of a lavish modern facsimile have termed it.&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iss/library/spec/bookmonth/april07.html ''Histoire générale des cérémonies'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the work, Banier and Le Mascrier were in fact revising and enlarging an earlier ''Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses de tous les peoples du monde'', which had been compiled by the satirical [[Huguenot]] writer and printer, [[Jean-Frédéric Bernard]] (died 1752) and printed from the safety of Amsterdam, in 1723-24. Picart’s illustrations had originally been provided for that work. The ultimate sources for the information lay in Roman Catholic missionary accounts of religious beliefs encountered in Africa, the Americas and Asia. "Banier and Le Mascrier, while retaining much of this material, made considerable alterations to all sections of the work, particularly to those volumes dealing with Judaism and with the Catholic and Protestant churches. As well as correcting factual errors in Bernard’s account and adding much new material, they removed a number of passages which they regarded as satirical in their treatment of the Catholic Church. Instead they inserted a good deal of forthright proclamation of the primacy of Catholicism over all other doctrines."&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"/&gt;
 
==Legacy==
Banier's Euhemerist and rational explication of myth in his ''Explication historique des fables'' satisfied [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] expectations, before the beginnings of modern analysis of [[mythology]]. "Of the writers who interpreted myth as gilded history, the Abbé Antoine Banier was probably the best-known, the most widely cited, and the least controversial" assert Burton Feldman and Robert D. Richardson.&lt;ref&gt;Burton Feldman and Robert D. Richardson, ''The Rise of Modern Mythology, 1680-1860'' (Indiana University Press) 1972:86).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was translated into English and German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiqbook.de/boox/ham/14627.shtml ''Erläuterung der Götterlehre und Fabeln aus der Geschichte''].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diderot]] and his collaborators employed the abbé Banier's interpretations in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', as intellectual common property of the Enlightenment.
 
[[Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy|Étienne de Jouy]] (born in 1764) recalled in 1815
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember that, in my earliest youth, the book I loved the most, after ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', was that of the abbé Banier, where he displays, where he explains these ingenious [[emblem]]s&lt;ref&gt;De Jouy is recalling Banier's ''Histoire générale''&lt;/ref&gt; by means of which the Ancients gave, so to speak, a soul to all beings, a body to all thoughts"&lt;ref&gt;"Je me souviens que, dans ma première jeunesse, le livre que j'aimais le plus, après Robinson Crusoé, c'était celui de l'abbé Banier, où il expose, où il explique ces emblêmes ingénieux au moyen desquels les anciens donnaient, en quelque sorte, une âme à tous les êtres, un corps à toutes les pensées." (Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy, ''L'Hermite de la Chaussée-d'Antin, ou Observations sur les mœurs et les usages parisiens au commencement du XIXe siècle'', (Paris: Pillet) 1815:260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1820 his work (as abridged by Abbe Tressan) was translated into English by [[Frances Arabella Rowden]], an educator who, according to [[Mary Russell Mitford]], was not only a poet, but "had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=eds|first1=Lilla Maria Crisafulli &amp; Cecilia Pietropoli,|title=The languages of performance in British romanticism|date=2008|publisher=P. Lang|location=New York|isbn=3039110977|page=301|edition=Oxford ; Bern ; Berlin ; Frankfurt am Main ; Wien$nLang.|chapter=appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1887 [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] could write, in ''Myths and Myth-Makers: Old Tales and Superstitions Interpreted by Comparative Mythology''
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What, then, is a myth? The theory of Euhemeros, which was so fashionable a century ago, in the days of the Abbe Banier, has long since been so utterly abandoned that to refute it now is but to slay the slain. The peculiarity of this theory was that it cut away all the extraordinary features of a given myth, wherein dwelt its inmost significance, and to the dull and useless residuum accorded the dignity of primeval history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=i&amp;p=c&amp;a=p&amp;ID=23935&amp;c=505 on-line text].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Battle of Ilerda''' took place in June 49 BC between the forces of [[Julius Caesar]] and the Spanish army of [[Pompey the Great]], led by his [[legatus|legates]] [[Lucius Afranius (consul)|Lucius Afranius]] and [[Marcus Petreius]]. Unlike many other of the battles of the civil war, this was more a campaign of manoeuvre than actual fighting.

==Introduction==
After having driven the [[Optimates]] from Italy, in March 49 BC Caesar turned his attention to the Republican army in the Spanish provinces. On his way to Spain, Caesar was delayed when the port city of [[Marseilles|Massilia]] rebelled under the leadership of [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC)|Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus]] in April. Leaving the [[siege of Massilia]] to [[Gaius Trebonius]] and [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], Caesar moved to [[Hispania Citerior]] to reinforce the three legions he had sent there as an advance guard under his legate Fabius.

== Ilerda Campaign==
When he arrived on the Spanish border, Caesar was able to seize the [[Pyrenees]] passes from the republicans and march into Spain. Near Ilerda, the Pompeians made camp on a hill and Caesar endeavoured to camp about 400 paces from the foot of the hill.&lt;ref name=Caesar-1.41&gt;Caesar ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|BC]]'' 1.41&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Pompeians under Afranius threatened to give battle, Caesar declined, but had his first two lines of troops form up for battle anyway, while the third line was ordered to dig a wide ditch behind the lines, unseen. As night came, Caesar withdrew his army behind the ditch and spent the night under arms.&lt;ref name=Caesar-1.41/&gt;

The next day was spent creating the rest of the ditch and the rampart which would form the defences of Caesar's camp.  For this operation Caesar kept a part of his force on guard.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar ''BC'' 1.42&lt;/ref&gt;  In the midst of the plain there was a portion of rising ground which Caesar wanted to occupy. As he tells it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Between the city of Ilerda, and the hill where Petreius and Afranius were encamped was a plain of about three hundred paces, in the midst of which was a rising ground, which Caesar wanted to take possession of; because, by that means, he could cut off the enemy's communication with the town and bridge, and render the magazines they had in the town useless.&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit'' 1.43; translation: William Duncan, Edwards and Bushnell. 1856. v. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0076%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D41]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The contest for this hill led to a protracted battle.

=== Battle ===

Both armies sent detachments towards the hill and the Pompeians occupied it first. This, combined with their skirmish-like combat technique, overwhelmed the Caesarian detachment and his troops were forced to give ground, eventually retreating to safety.&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'' 1.43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

This minor reverse would result in Caesar spurning a renewed attack and this, in turn, led to a longer engagement.  As Caesar tells it (in the third person, as was his style):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Caesar, contrary to his expectation, finding the consternation like to spread through the whole army, encouraged his men, and led the ninth legion to their assistance. He soon put a stop to the vigorous and insulting pursuit of the enemy, obliged them to turn their backs, and pushed them to the very walls of Ilerda. But the soldiers of the ninth legion, elated with success, and eager to repair the loss we had sustained, followed the runaways with so much heat that they were drawn into a place of disadvantage, and found themselves directly under the hill where the town stood, whence when they endeavoured to retire, the enemy again facing about, charged vigorously from the higher ground. The hill was rough, and steep on each side, extending only so far in breadth as was sufficient for drawing up three cohorts; but they could neither be reinforced in flank, nor sustained by the cavalry. The descent from the town was indeed something easier for about four hundred paces, which furnished our men with the means of extricating themselves from the danger into which their rashness had brought them. Here they bravely maintained the fight, though with great disadvantage to themselves, as well on account of the narrowness of the place, as because being posted at the foot of the hill, none of the enemy's darts fell in vain. Still however they supported themselves by their courage and patience, and were not disheartened by the many wounds they received. The enemy's forces increased every moment, fresh cohorts being sent from the camp through the town, who succeeded in the place of those that were fatigued. Caesar was likewise obliged to detach small parties to maintain the battle, and bring off such as were wounded.  The fight had now lasted five hours without intermission, when our men, oppressed by the multitude of the enemy, and having spent all their darts, attacked the mountain sword in hand, and overthrowing such as opposed them, obliged the rest to betake themselves to flight. The pursuit was continued to the very walls of Ilerda, and some out of fear took shelter in the town, which gave our men an opportunity of making good their retreat. At the same time the cavalry, though posted disadvantageously in a bottom, found means by their valour to gain the summit of the mountain, and riding between both armies, hindered the enemy from harassing our rear. Thus the engagement was attended with various turns of fortune. Caesar lost about seventy men in the first encounter, among whom was Q. Fulginius, first centurion of the Hastati of the fourteenth legion, who had raised himself by his valour to that rank, through all the inferior orders. Upwards of six hundred were wounded. On Afranius's side was slain T. Caecilius, first centurion of a legion; also four centurions of inferior degree, and above two hundred private men.&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'' 1.45-46; translation, as above.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
The spring storms and the melting snow from the mountains then caused flooding, which particularly affected the lower-situated Caesarians, whose camp was flooded. This meant that the Caesarian troops were unable to forage and famine struck the army, accompanied by disease. When the flood of the river [[Segre River|Sicoris]] finally withdrew, the Caesarians built a bridge over it and caused Petreius and Afranius to abandon their camp and the city of Ilerda and retreat towards a second republican army under [[Marcus Terentius Varro]].

Caesar ordered a pursuit which overtook the retreating rear guard of the republican army and he was able to block the route on which the republicans were retreating. The two armies again camped close to each other leading to some fraternization between the two armies. Petreius, wanting to stop this fraternization, had the Caesarian soldiers who had wandered into the republican camp rounded up and killed. After this the republicans again retreated towards Ilerda, only to become besieged by the Caesarians in their new camp. By 30 July, Caesar had completely surrounded Afranius and Petreius's army. On 2 August, the five Pompeian legions in Ilerda surrendered to Caesar.

After the surrender of the republican main army in Spain, Caesar then marched towards Varro in [[Hispania Ulterior]], who at once without a fight submitted to him leading to another two legions surrendering. After this, Caesar left his legate [[Quintus Cassius Longinus]] —the brother of [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]— in command of Spain with four of the legions, partly made up of men who had surrendered and gone over to the Caesarian camp, and returned with the rest of his army to Massilia and its siege.

'''Bernal Díaz del Castillo''' (c. 1496 – 1584) was a Spanish [[conquistador]], who participated as a soldier in the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|conquest of Mexico]] under [[Hernán Cortés]] and late in his life wrote an account of the events. As an experienced soldier of fortune, he had already participated in expeditions to Tierra Firme, Cuba, and to Yucatán before joining Cortés. In his later years he was an [[encomienda|encomendero]] and governor in Guatemala where he wrote his memoirs called ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]''. He began his account of the conquest almost thirty years after the events and later revised and expanded it in response to the biography published by Cortes's chaplain [[Francisco López de Gómara]], which he considered to be largely inaccurate in that it did not give due recognition to the efforts and sacrifices of others in the Spanish expedition.
 
==Early life==
Bernal Díaz del Castillo was born around 1496 in [[Medina del Campo]], a prosperous commercial city in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. His parents were Francisco Díaz del Castillo and María Díez Rejón. His father was a ''regidor'' (city councilor) of Medina del Campo which provided the family with some prominence. Díaz had at least one older brother and they attended school together, learning to read and write. Bernal Diaz was intelligent and later showed a knack for languages, learning to speak the native dialect in Cuba, [[Nahuatl]] in Mexico, and the [[Cakchiquel language]] of the Guatemalan natives.&lt;ref name=cerwin&gt;Cerwin (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1514, when Díaz was about eighteen years old, he left home to join an expedition to the New World led by [[Pedrarias Dávila]]. It was the largest fleet yet sent to mainland America, consisting of 19 vessels and 1,500 persons. Díaz served as a common foot soldier and hoped to make his fortune but when they reached [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién|Darien]] in present-day Colombia, they were quickly overcome by famine and an epidemic that killed more than half of the settlers.  &lt;ref name="Adorno"&gt;Rolena Adorno, "Bernal Díaz del Castillo", ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerica'', David Carrasco, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001, vol. 1, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the colonists grew discouraged and looked elsewhere for new opportunities; some returned to Spain while others sailed to [[Hispaniola]] or Cuba.&lt;ref name="cerwin" /&gt;

==Expedition to Yucatán==
In 1516, Diaz sailed to Cuba with about 100 other soldiers looking for a share of the gold and native laborers that were said to be found on the island. They discovered that gold was scarce and the native labor was in short supply, leading Díaz, in 1517, to join an expedition organized by a group of about 110 disaffected soldiers and settlers to "discover new lands".&lt;ref name="weddle"&gt;Weddle (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; They chose [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]], a wealthy Cuban landowner, to lead the expedition. It was a difficult venture and, after sailing from Cuba for 21 days, they came across the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] coast in early March 1517, on the Cape Catoche.

On March 4, 1517, the Spanish had their first encounter with the Yucatán natives who came to meet them on five or perhaps 10, depending on the version/translation of his work, large wooden canoes. The next day, the Spaniards disembarked, invited by the natives who wanted to show them their village. They were ambushed but managed to retreat, after killing 15 locals and having 15 wounded, 2 of whom later died. Upon leaving, the Spaniards captured 2 natives who would be translators in future expeditions. The Spanish almost died of thirst and sailed to Florida in search of potable drinking water. As they were digging a well on the beach, the Spaniards were attacked by locals. During this fracas, one Spaniard was captured by the native Floridians while the Spanish killed 22 natives. The Spanish managed to make a retreat but were also able to gather some water. They returned to Cuba, all of them severely wounded. The captain, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, and other soldiers died shortly after making it back to Cuba.

Nevertheless, Díaz returned to the coast of Yucatán in April 1518, in an expedition led by [[Juan de Grijalva]], with the intent of exploring the lands. Upon returning to Cuba, he enlisted in a new expedition, this one led by [[Hernán Cortés]].

==Conquest of Mexico==
In this third effort, Díaz took part in the campaigns against the Mexica, later called the [[Aztec Empire]]. By this time, he was a highly experienced member of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s expedition. During this campaign, Díaz spoke frequently with his fellow soldiers about their experiences. These accounts, and especially Díaz's own experiences, served as the basis for the recollections that Bernal Díaz later told with great drama to visitors and, eventually, a book entitled ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'' ({{lang-en|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain}}). In the latter, Díaz describes many of the 119 battles in which he claims to have participated in, culminating in the defeat of the Aztecs in 1521. This work also claims to describe the diverse native peoples living in the territory renamed ''New Spain'' by the Spaniards. Bernal Díaz also examines the political rivalries of Spaniards, and gives accounts of the natives' human sacrifices, cannibalism and idolatry, which he claims he witnessed first-hand, as well as the artistic, cultural, political and intellectual achievements of the Aztecs, including their palaces, market places and beautifully organized botanical and zoological gardens. His account of the Mexica along with that of Cortés are first-person accounts recording important aspects of Mesoamerican culture. ''True History'' remains one of the best accounts we have of Mexico at the time of the conquest, but its purpose and style betrays some of the biases that appear in this so-called truthful history. Bernal Díaz's account has not been fully utilized as a source for conquest-era Mesoamerican culture.&lt;ref name="Adorno"/&gt;

==Governor of Antigua Guatemala==

As a reward for his service, Díaz was awarded an encomienda by Cortés in 1522. That was confirmed and supplemented by similar awards in 1527 and 1528.&lt;ref&gt;Carmelo Saenz de Santa María, ''Historia de una historia: la crónica de Bernal Díaz del Castillo''. Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1984, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; In 1541, he settled in Guatemala and, during the course of a trip to Spain, was appointed ''regidor'' (governor) of [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]], present-day [[Antigua Guatemala]], in 1551.

==''True History''==
[[File:Bernal Diaz del Castillo Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España 1632.jpg|thumb|Title page, Historia verdadera, 1632]]
His ''Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España'', finished in 1568, almost fifty years after the events it described, was begun around the same time as his appointment as regidor and was well in progress by the mid-1550s when he wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor (and king of Spain), Charles V, describing his services and seeking benefits. That was a standard action of conquerors to document their services to the crown and requests for rewards. Some version of his account circulated in central Mexico in the 1560s and 1570s, prior to its seventeenth-century publication. Bernal Díaz's account is mentioned by Alonso de Zorita, a royal official who wrote an account of indigenous society, and mestizo [[Diego Muñoz Camargo]], who wrote a full-length account of the Tlaxcalans' participation in the conquest of the Mexica.&lt;ref name="Adorno"/&gt; Bernal Díaz's manuscript was expanded in response to what he later found in the official biography of [[Hernán Cortés]] commissioned by Cortés's heir, Don Martín Cortés, published in 1552 by [[Francisco López de Gómara]]. The title ''Historia verdadera'' (True History) is in part a response to the claims made by Hernán Cortés in his published letters to the king, López de Gómara, Bartolomé de las Casas, Gonzalo de Illescas and others who had not participated in the campaign. Bernal Díaz also used the publication of [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]] on [[just war]], which allowed Bernal Díaz to cast the conquest of Mexico as a just conquest.&lt;ref name="Adorno"/&gt; Despite Bernal Díaz's lack of formal education and the self-interest that gave birth to his volume, the ''Historia verdadera'' evokes, like no other source, the often tragic and painful yet fascinating process through which one empire ended and another began to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Boruchoff, "Beyond Utopia and Paradise: Cortés, Bernal Díaz and the Rhetoric of Consecration." ''M L N'' [''Modern Language Notes''] 1991, 106, 2. pp. 330-369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bernal Díaz died in January 1584. He was alive on 1 January, but on 3 January, his son, Francisco, appeared before the Cabildo of Guatemala and informed them that his father had died.&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Wagner, "Notes on Writings by and about Bernal Díaz del Castillo", ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (May, 1945), pp. 199-211, at p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miguel León-Portilla]] accepts this date in his Introduction (dated July 1984 "''a cuatro siglos de la muerte de Bernal''") to the anthology of extended excerpts from the ''Historia verdadera''.&lt;ref&gt;published in 1988 by Conaculta (''Consejo nacional para la cultura y las artes'') in its series "100 de México", p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Alicia Mayer (2005) praised that edition, its selection, and León-Portilla's introduction, saying they remained, down to the date of her review, "''fuente imprescindible de consulta''" (an indispensable source to consult) without seeing his manuscript published. An expanded and corrected copy of the manuscript kept in Guatemala was sent to Spain and published, with revisions, in 1632. The manuscript was edited by Fray Alonso de Remón and Fray Gabriel Adarzo y Santander prior to publication. In this first published edition of Bernal Díaz's work, there is a chapter (212), which some consider apocryphal with signs and portents of the conquest and omitted for later editions.&lt;ref name="Adorno"/&gt;

'''Counterfeit money''' is imitation currency produced without the legal sanction of the state or government. Producing or using [[counterfeit]] money is a form of [[fraud]] or [[forgery]]. Counterfeiting is almost as old as money itself. Plated copies (known as [[Fourrée]]s) have been found of [[Lydia#First coinage|Lydian coins]] which are thought to be among the first western coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Case for the World's Oldest Coin:|url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the introduction of [[Banknotes|paper money]], the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure [[gold]] or [[silver]]. A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During [[World War II]], the [[Nazis]] forged British pounds and American dollars. Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called ''[[Superdollar]]s'' because of their high quality and likeness to the real US dollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of [[Euro]] banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than for the US dollar.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://itsamoneything.com/money/counterfeiting-cash-money-infographic/#.VB71g5R_uJQ |title= Counterfeiting statistics for several currencies |publisher= Itsamoneything.com |accessdate= 2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ill-effects that counterfeit money has on society include&lt;ref name="homepages.gac.edu"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://homepages.gac.edu/~wolfe/J-term/money-2004/talks/nfarlee.ppt| title= Counterfeiting of American Currency| accessdate=2007-06-12| page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William F Hummel"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://wfhummel.cnchost.com/counterfeiting.html| title = Counterfeit Money, Who Takes the Hit?| publisher=William F Hummel| accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reduction in the value of real money; and increase in prices ([[inflation]]) due to more money getting circulated in the economy - an unauthorized artificial increase in the [[money supply]]; a decrease in the acceptability of paper money; and losses, when traders are not reimbursed for counterfeit money detected by banks, even if it is confiscated. Traditionally, anti-counterfeiting measures involved including fine detail with raised [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing on bills which allows non-experts to easily spot forgeries. On coins, ''milled'' or ''reeded'' (marked with parallel grooves) edges are used to show that none of the valuable metal has been scraped off.

==History==
Counterfeiting is as old as money itself, and is sufficiently prevalent throughout history that it has been called "the world's ''second'' [[oldest profession (phrase)|oldest profession]]."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Michael. "Learn about the world of counterfeiting from one who lived there." ''Dallas Morning News,'' (TX) 15 July 2009: ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 8 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Riper, Frank. "Counterfeiting." ''Saturday Evening Post'' 250.7 (1978): 42-44. ''Academic Search Premier.'' Web. 8 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Coinage of money began in the Greek city of Lydia around 600 B.C. Before the introduction of [[Banknotes|paper money]], the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure [[gold]] or [[silver]]. A common practice was to "shave" the edges of a coin. This is known as "[[Coin clipping|clipping]]." Precious metals collected in this way could be used to produce counterfeit coinage. A [[fourrée]] is an ancient type of counterfeit coin, in which a base metal core has been plated with a precious metal to resemble its solid metal counterpart.

When paper money was introduced in China in the  13th century, wood from mulberry trees was used to make the money. To control access to the paper, guards were stationed around mulberry forests, while counterfeiters were punished by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Grant Robertson|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/rob-currencies/funny-money-how-counterfeiting-led-to-a-major-overhaul-of-canadas-money/article554632/?page=all/ |title=Funny money: How counterfeiting led to a major overhaul of Canada’s money|publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century Mastro Adamo was mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri]] as a counterfeiter of the Florentine [[Florin (Italian coin)|fiorino]], punished with death by [[hanging]]. The [[England|English]] couple [[Thomas Rogers and Anne Rogers|Thomas and Anne Rogers]] were convicted on 15 October 1690 for "Clipping 40 pieces of Silver." Thomas Rogers was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] while Anne Rogers was [[Death by burning|burnt alive]]. Evidence supplied by an informant led to the arrest of the last of the English Coiners "''King''" David Hartley, who was executed by hanging in 1770. The extreme forms of punishment were meted out for acts of [[treason]] against [[State (polity)|state]] or [[The Crown|Crown]], rather than simple crime.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Irish immigrants to London were particularly associated with the spending (uttering) of counterfeit money, while locals were more likely to participate in the safer and more profitable forms of currency crime, which could take place behind locked doors. These include producing the false money and selling it wholesale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Criminal were the Irish? Bias in the Detection of London Currency Crime, 1797-1821|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03058034.2016.1270876|journal = The London Journal|date = 2017-02-09|doi = 10.1080/03058034.2016.1270876|first = Adam|last = Crymble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in America, [[Early American currency#Colonial currency|Colonial paper currency]] printed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] and others often bore the phrase "to counterfeit is death."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1b"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.librarycompany.org/BFWriter/images/large/3.7.jpg |title= Counterfeit notes |publisher= Librarycompany.org |accessdate= 2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory behind such harsh punishments was that one who had the skills to counterfeit currency was considered a threat to the safety of the State, and had to be eliminated. Another explanation is the fact that issuing money that people could trust was both an economic imperative, as well as a (where applicable) Royal prerogative; therefore counterfeiting was a crime against the state or ruler itself, rather than against the person who received the fake money. Far more fortunate was an earlier practitioner of the same art, active in the time of the [[Emperor Justinian]]. Rather than executing Alexander the Barber, the Emperor chose to employ his talents in the government's own service.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Nations have used counterfeiting as a means of warfare. The idea is to overflow the enemy's economy with fake bank notes, so that the real value of the money plummets. [[Great Britain]] did this during the [[American Revolutionary War]] to reduce the value of the [[Continental Dollar]]. The counterfeiters for the British were known as "shovers," presumably for the ability to "shove" the fake currency into circulation. Two of the most well-known shovers for the British during the Revolutionary War were [[David Farnsworth]] and John Blair. They were caught with 10,000 dollars in counterfeits when arrested.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Counterfeiting In Colonial America, By Kenneth Scott|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington]] took a personal interest in their case and even called for them to be tortured to discover further information. They were eventually hanged for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Financial History of the United States, By Jerry W. Markham|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States dollar]] was heavily counterfeited by private interests on the Union side, often without the sanction of the Union government in Washington. The Confederacy's access to modern printing technology was limited while many Northern-made imitations were printed on high quality banknote paper procured through extralegal means. As a result, counterfeit Southern notes were often equal or even superior in quality compared to genuine Confederate money.

In 1834, counterfeit [[copper]] coins manufactured in the United States were seized from several ships with American flags in [[Brazil]]. The practice seemed to end after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.al.rs.gov.br/biblioteca/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=QypkJQ2HAP0%3d&amp;tabid=3101|title=Estados Unidos e Rio Grande - Negócios no Século XIX - Despachos dos Cônsules Norte-Americanos no Rio Grande do Sul 1829/1941|author=Rio Grande do Sul, Assembleia Legislativa|location=Porto Alegre|publisher=Assembleia Legislativa do Estado do RS|year=1998|page=60}} {{en icon}} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. An example of this is the Portuguese Bank Note Crisis of 1925, when the British banknote printers [[Waterlow and Sons]] produced [[Banco de Portugal]] notes equivalent in value to 0.88% of the Portuguese nominal Gross Domestic Product, with identical serial numbers to existing banknotes, in response to a fraud perpetrated by [[Alves dos Reis]]. Similarly, in 1929 the issue of postage stamps celebrating the Millennium of [[Iceland]]'s parliament, the [[Althing]], was compromised by the insertion of "1" on the print order, before the authorised value of stamps to be produced (see [[Postage stamps and postal history of Iceland]].){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1926 a {{ill|Frankhamisítási botrány|hu|lt=high-profile counterfeit scandal}} came to light in [[Hungary]], when several people were arrested in the [[Netherlands]] while attempting to procure 10 million francs' worth of fake French 1000-franc bills which had been produced in Hungary; after 3 years, the state-sponsored industrial scale counterfeit operation had finally collapsed. The [[League of Nations]]' investigation found Hungary's motives were to avenge its [[Treaty of Trianon|post-WWI territorial losses]] (blamed on [[Georges Clemenceau]]) and to use profits from the counterfeiting business to boost a militarist, border-revisionist ideology. Germany and Austria had an active role in the conspiracy, which required special machinery. The quality of fake bills was still substandard however, owing to France's use of exotic raw paper material imported from its colonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

During [[World War II]], the [[Nazis]] attempted to implement a similar plan ([[Operation Bernhard]]) against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The Nazis took [[Jew]]ish artists in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] and forced them to forge British pounds and American dollars. The quality of the counterfeiting was very good, and it was almost impossible to distinguish between the real and fake bills. Unable to enact planned aerial drops of the counterfeits over Britain, most notes were disposed of and not recovered until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Lawrence "Krueger's Men: The Secret Nazi Counterfeit Plot and the Prisoners of Block 19" (2006) {{ISBN|0-316-05700-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-316-05700-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called ''[[Superdollar]]s'' because of their high quality, and likeness to the real US dollar. The sources of such supernotes are disputed, with [[North Korea]] being vocally accused by US authorities.&lt;ref name="CBN-1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2010/August/Distributing-Supernotes-An-Act-of-War/ | title=Distributing Counterfeit Currency: An Act of War? | publisher=CBN | date=August 29, 2010 | accessdate=March 25, 2013 | author=Holton, Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount of [[counterfeit United States currency]] is estimated to be less than $3 per $10,000, with less than $3 per $100,000 being difficult to detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/policy_discussion_papers/2010/PDP2010-2.pdf |title=Estimating the Volume of Counterfeit U.S. Currency in Circulation Worldwide: Data and Extrapolation|author=Ruth Judson and Richard Porter|date=1 March 2010|publisher=Chicagofed.org|accessdate=2012-10-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a rapid growth in the counterfeiting of [[euro]] banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002. In 2003, 551,287 fake euro notes and 26,191 bogus euro coins were removed from EU circulation. In 2004, French police seized fake 10 euro and 20 euro notes worth a total of around €1.8 million from two laboratories and estimated that 145,000 notes had already entered circulation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In the early years of the 21st century, the [[United States Secret Service]] has noted a substantial reduction in the quantity of forged U.S. currency, as counterfeiters turn their attention towards the [[Euro]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A batch of counterfeit [[Australian fifty-dollar note|A$50]] and [[Australian one hundred-dollar note|A$100]] notes were released into the Australian city of [[Melbourne]] in July 2013. As of July 12, 2013, 40 reports had been made between the northern suburbs of [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] and [[Epping, Victoria|Epping]]. Police spokespersons explained to the public in media reports that the currency notes were printed on paper (Australia introduced [[Polymer banknote]]s in 1988) and could be easily detected by scrunching up the note or tearing it. Additionally, the clear window within the notes was also an easy way to identify fake versions, as the "window appears to have been cut out with two clear plastic pieces stuck together with stars placed in the middle to replicate the [[Crux|Southern Cross]]." Police also revealed that fake notes had been seized in June 2013 in Melbourne's eastern and western suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police warn on counterfeit cash|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/police-warn-on-counterfeit-cash-20130711-2priu.html#ixzz2YnNxp1Du|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=11 July 2013|author=Thomas O'Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Australian [[Reserve Bank of Australia|RBA]] figures, during 2014-15, the number of counterfeit $50 [[Currency detector|currency detected]] in circulation has more than doubled from the previous year, and more than 33,000 fake notes were removed from circulation. The officials believe this likely a fraction of the amount of fake currencies currently flooding through in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[NSW]] states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia flooded with fake $50 notes so good they fool banks|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/australia-flooded-with-fake-50-notes-so-good-they-fool-banks-20160226-gn5546.html|accessdate=28 February 2016|newspaper=smh.com.au|date=28 February 2016|author=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2016, the [[ACT Policing|ACT police]] have warned people to keep an eye out for fake $50 notes, which is circulating throughout [[Canberra]] in recent months.

==Effects on society==
Some of the ill-effects that counterfeit money has on society include:&lt;ref name="homepages.gac.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William F Hummel"/&gt;
# Companies not being reimbursed for counterfeits. This has led to companies losing buying power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.moneymetals.com/news/2018/08/24/money-fake-sound-money-001602|title=Money, Fake Money, &amp; Sound Money}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there is a reduction in the value of ''real'' money.
# Increase in prices ([[inflation]]) due to more money getting circulated in the economy - an unauthorized artificial increase in the [[money supply]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
# Decrease in the acceptability (satisfactoriness) of money - payees may demand electronic transfers of real money or payment in another currency (or even payment in a precious metal such as gold).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

At the same time, in countries where paper money is a small fraction of the total money in circulation, the macroeconomic effects of counterfeiting of currency may not be significant. The microeconomic effects, such as confidence in currency, however, may be large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-77/POST-PN-77.pdf|title=Counterfeit Banknotes|publisher=Parliamentary office of Science and Tech., UK| accessdate=2017-06-16|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-counterfeiting measures==
[[Image:Dollarsecurity.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Anti-counterfeiting features on an old [[United States twenty dollar bill|U.S. $20 bill]]]]
[[Image:US $20 under blacklight.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The security strip of a [[United States twenty-dollar bill|U.S. $20 bill]] glows under [[black light]] as a safeguard against counterfeiting]]
[[Image:Currency inspection machine – Lima airport (detail).jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Bill inspection device in use in [[Peru]], showing magnifying glass for inspection of detail and lit up security strip]]

Traditionally, anti-counterfeiting measures involved including fine detail with raised [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing on bills which would allow non-experts to easily spot forgeries. On coins, ''milled'' or ''reeded'' (marked with parallel grooves) edges are used to show that none of the valuable metal has been scraped off. This detects the ''shaving'' or ''[[Coin clipping|clipping]]'' (paring off) of the rim of the coin. However, it does not detect ''[[Sweating coins|sweating]]'', or shaking coins in a bag and collecting the resulting dust. Since this technique removes a smaller amount, it is primarily used on the most valuable coins, such as gold. In early paper money in [[Colonial North America]], one creative means of deterring counterfeiters was to print the impression of a [[leaf]] in the bill. Since the patterns found in a leaf were unique and complex, they were nearly impossible to reproduce.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1b" /&gt;

In the late twentieth century advances in [[computer]] and [[photocopy]] technology made it possible for people without sophisticated training to copy currency easily. In response, national engraving bureaus began to include new more sophisticated anti-counterfeiting systems such as [[hologram]]s, multi-colored bills, embedded devices such as strips, microprinting, [[watermark]]s and inks whose colors changed depending on the angle of the light, and the use of design features such as the "[[EURion constellation]]" which disables modern photocopiers. Software programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]] have been modified by their manufacturers to obstruct manipulation of scanned images of banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cds.html |title=Photoshop CS5: Photoshop and CDS |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist patches to counteract these measures.

Recently, there has been a discovery of new tests that could be used on U.S. Federal Reserve Notes to ensure that the bills are authentic.  These tests are done using intrinsic fluorescence lifetime.  This allows for detection of counterfeit money because of the significance in difference of fluorescence lifetime when compared to authentic money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-17-24-22054&amp;id=190364 |title=Detection of counterfeit U.S. paper money using intrinsic fluorescence lifetime|author=Chia, TH and Levene MJ|publisher=Opticsinfobase.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[United States dollar|U.S. currency]], anti-counterfeiting milestones are as follows:
* 1996 [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]] gets a new design with a larger portrait
* 1997 [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]] gets a new design with a larger portrait

* 2010 [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]] gets a new design with no oval around [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s portrait and more colors; along with the inclusion of the new "3D security ribbon"

The redesigned $100 bill was unveiled on April 21, 2010, and the Federal Reserve Board was to begin issuing the new bill on February 10, 2011, but the release was delayed until October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These New $100 Bills Are Going to Be Huge Overseas|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-08/these-new-100-bills-are-going-to-be-huge-overseas|work=BloombergBusinessweek|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|accessdate=11 November 2013|author=Mark Glassman|date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treasury had made no plans to redesign the [[United States five-dollar bill|$5 bill]] using colors, but recently reversed its decision, after learning some counterfeiters were bleaching the ink off the bills and printing them as $100 bills. The new [[United States ten-dollar bill|$10 bill]] (the design of which was revealed in late 2005) entered circulation on March 2, 2006. The [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 bill]] and [[United States two-dollar bill|$2 bill]] are seen by most counterfeiters as having too low a value to counterfeit, and so they have not been redesigned as frequently as higher denominations.

In the 1980s counterfeiting in the [[Republic of Ireland]] twice resulted in sudden changes in official documents: in November 1984 the [[Irish pound|£1]] postage stamp, also used on savings cards for paying television licences and telephone bills, was invalidated and replaced by another design at a few days' notice, because of widespread counterfeiting. Later, the £20 [[Central Bank of Ireland]] Series B banknote was rapidly replaced because of what the Finance Minister described as "the involuntary privatisation of banknote printing".

In the 1990s, the portrait of Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] was placed on the banknotes of the [[People's Republic of China]] to combat counterfeiting, as he was recognised better than the generic designs on the [[renminbi]] notes.

In 1988 the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] released the world's first long lasting and counterfeit-resistant [[polymer banknotes|polymer (plastic) banknotes]] with a [[Banknotes of the Australian dollar|special Bicentennial $10 note]] issue. After problems with this bill were discovered and addressed, in 1992 a problem-free $5 note was issued. In 1996 Australia became the first country to have a full series of circulating polymer banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/australia_innovates/?behaviour=view_article&amp;Section_id=1060&amp;article_id=10080 |title=Plastic banknotes - Australia Innovates |publisher=Powerhouse Museum |date=1993-10-28 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 3 May 1999 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand started circulating polymer banknotes printed by [[Note Printing Australia]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/notes_and_coins/notes/ |title=New Zealand's bank notes |publisher=Rbnz.govt.nz |date=1999-05-03 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology developed is now used in 26 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securency.com.au/enoflash/about.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302091809/http://www.securency.com.au/enoflash/about.htm |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note Printing Australia is currently printing polymer notes for 18 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noteprinting.com/banknotes_table.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918085958/http://www.noteprinting.com/banknotes_table.html |date=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Bank]] has a reserve series of notes for the [[Swiss franc]], in case widespread counterfeiting were to take place.

==Money art==
Money art is a subject related to counterfeiting that incorporates currency designs or themes. Some of these works of art are similar enough to actual bills that their legality is in question. While a counterfeit is made with deceptive intent, money art is not; however, the law may or may not differentiate between the two. [[JSG Boggs]] was an American artist best known for his hand-drawn, one-sided copies of US banknotes, which he sold for the face value of the note.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The street artist [[Banksy]] is known for making 10 [[Pound sterling|pound]] notes that feature [[Princess Diana]]'s portrait in place of the Queen, while "Bank of England" is replaced by "Banksy of England". The artist's original intent was to throw them off a building, but after some of the notes were dropped at a festival he discovered that they could pass for legal tender and changed his mind. As of 2012, Banksy is still in possession of all one hundred million pounds' worth of the currency.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Banksy from the Movie "[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]", around 0:37:00&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, American artist [[Jack Daws]] hired metalsmiths to make a mold of a 1970 U.S. penny and cast it in 18-karat gold. He then hired another metalsmith to copper-plate it, after which it looked like an ordinary penny. On March 28, 2007, Daws intentionally put the "penny" in circulation at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX). The sculpture was discovered in Brooklyn two-and-a-half years later by Jessica Reed, a graphic designer and coin collector, who noticed it while paying for groceries at a local store. Reed eventually communicated with Daws's Seattle art dealer, the Greg Kucera Gallery, and Daws confirmed that she had discovered the Counterfeit Penny sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;8. Lee, Jennifer.

==Training money==
In May 2017, Australian currency training notes (used in-house by Chinese banks in the training of bank tellers) were circulated briefly in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], with seven cases reported by the [[Northern Territory Police]] of notes being offered and taken as real money. The $100 ([[Australian dollar|Australian Dollar]]) notes had [[Chinese language]] characters printed on them, but otherwise had the color and feel of real notes, and the Chinese characters can be disguised when the note is folded. They had been sold through [[eBay]], with the disclaimer of not being for circulation. China also has equivalent $50 ([[United States dollar|U.S. Dollar]]) "training money", that has previously appeared in the USA.&lt;ref name="2017-05-09_ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-09/chinese-bank-training-money-used-as-real-australian-100-dollars/8510752 Chinese bank's 'Australian training money' used as genuine $100 notes], Tom Maddocks, [[ABC News Online]], 2017-05-09&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dmitry Dmitriyevich Smyshlyayev''' ({{lang-ru|Дми́трий Дми́триевич Смышля́ев}}) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] historian, ethnographer and politician. He is known for the study of history of [[Perm]] and [[Perm Governorate]].&lt;ref name="ESBE"&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://archive.is/20130416173934/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/095/95103.htm Смышляев] ([[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary|B&amp;EED]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BSE"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/103/615.htm Смышляев Дмитрий Дмитриевич]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ([[Great Soviet Encyclopedia|GSE]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dmitry Dmitriyevich Smyshlyayev was born in [[Perm]], on the March 5, 1828, in the family of [[Dmitry Yemelyanovich Smyshlyayev]], merchant of the 1st guild and mayor of [[Perm]] from 1823 to 1826. In 1844 he left the grammar school and assisted his father with commerce until 1857. Then he turned to social and educational activity and study of the local history. He took part in the organization of public reading and Sunday schools, and the foundation of the women's grammar school.&lt;ref name="ESBE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://gorodperm.ru/data280_26.asp История города.

From 1858 to 1860 Smyshlyayev published ''The Perm Anthology'' ({{lang-ru|"Пермский сборник"}}), which was devoted to history, ethnography and statistics of [[Perm Governorate]].&lt;ref name="BSE"/&gt;

From 1870 to 1879 Smyshlyayev was a chairman of the Governorate Executive Board. He brought up the problems of national education, medicine and improvements of social welfare. In 1872 he founded the journal ''[[Anthology of Perm Zemstvo]]'' ({{lang-ru|"Сборник Пермского земства"}}). He edited it until 1878 and published 34 issues. Later he edited the unofficial part of ''[[Perm Governorate News]]''.&lt;ref name="ESBE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BSE"/&gt;

In 1885 Smyshlyayev visited [[Jerusalem]] as a representative of the [[Imperial Palestina Society]]. He supported the building of shelters for the Russian pilgrims. The [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] appreciated his services and conferred the title of [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Knight of Holy Sepulchre]] on him. Later he returned to Perm and became a Secretary of the Governorat Statistic Committee.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

Smyshlyayev died on November 27, 1893. He is buried in Perm at the Yegoshikha Cemetery.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

'''Dominic of Flanders''' ({{lang-la|'''Dominicus de Flandria'''}}, {{lang-fr|Dominique de Flandre}}) (ca. 1425–1479) was a [[French Flanders|French-Flemish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] philosopher and [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] author, known to have been a renowned [[Thomism|Thomist]]. His commentaries on [[Aristotle]] and on [[Thomas Aquinas]] were frequently printed, the most famous being his commentary on Aristotle’s [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']]. This ''Commentaria'' is commonly known to have been dedicated to [[Lorenzo de’ Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, 1974, p. 49, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Little is known of Dominic's early life. He was born Baudouin Lottin, in the north of France near what is today the Belgian border, in either Merville or Merris, a few kilometers away from [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]].&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier, "Préface," in S. Thomae de Aquino, ''Opera Omnia, Iussu Leonis XIII P. M. Edita, Vol. 45, Sentencia Libri de Anima'', Rome/Paris, 1984, p. 33*.&lt;/ref&gt; The political circumstances of the region at the time are such that it is possible to deem him neither a Flemish nor a French philosopher. While born in present-day France (in the region of [[Lille]]), it was indeed the [[County of Flanders]] during the 15th century, a bilingual region which politically belonged to the [[Kingdom of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Steel, 2011, p. 970–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dominicusdeflandria.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece (excerpt), ''Questiones super XII libros Metaphysica'', Köln 1621.]]

Baudouin studied at the [[University of Paris]], becoming a Master of Arts at some time before 1452. At Paris he studied with [[John Versor]], and would receive philosophical training according to the trend of "[[Albertism]]." The first known date in the life of Baudouin is September 7, 1461—the day he took the Dominican habit (as well as the name, Dominic of Flanders, following the practice of the Order) at Bologna. Dominic's intellectual home would remain in Italy. At Bologna, it is likely that he studied under [[Peter of Bergamo]] (†1482), where he would switch from Albertist views to Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;Colosio, 1961, p. 120, n. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at Bologna from 1462 to 1470. He went on to teach in Florence and Pisa, by the invitation of Lorenzo de' Medici, then returned to Bologna from 1475 to 1476.  He finally returned to Florence, where he died of the plague on July 16, 1479.&lt;ref&gt;Schikowski, 1940, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elsa Goveia''' (12 April 1925 – 18 March 1980) was born in [[British Guiana]] and became a foremost scholar and historian of the [[Caribbean]]. She was the first woman to become a professor at the newly created [[University of the West Indies|University College of the West Indies]] (UCWI) and first professor of West Indian studies in the UCWI History Department. Her seminal work, ''Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands at the End of the Eighteenth Century'' (1965), was a pioneering study of the institution of slavery and the first to put forth the concept of a "slave society" encompassing not just the slaves but the entire community. Her research and teaching was widely influential in the region.

==Early life==
Elsa Vesta Goveia was born on 12 April 1925{{sfn|Library of the University of the West Indies|2017}} in British Guiana to middle-class, ethnically mixed Portuguese and [[Afro-Guyanese]] family.{{sfn|Moore|2016}} One of two daughters, she was educated in a time when education was rare for even males in British Guiana. After winning a scholarship, she attended [[St. Joseph High School (Guyana)|St. Joseph High School]] at the Convent of Mercy in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] and graduated with her certificate. In 1944, she won the national British Guiana Scholarship and continued her education, studying history at [[University College London]].{{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|p=169}} She won the Pollard Prize for English history in 1947, becoming the first [[West Indian]] to win the scholarship, graduating with First Class Honors for her degree in 1948. Furthering her studies, Goveia attended the [[Institute of Historical Research]] in London under the tutelage of Eveline Martin until 1950, when she returned to the Caribbean and accepted a post at the newly created University College of the West Indies, as an assistant lecturer.{{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|p=170}} Continuing her research during 1950 and 1951, Goveia prepared her thesis ''Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands 1780-1800'', submitted it the following year and earned her PhD in 1952.{{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|p=170}}{{sfn|Goveia|1984|p=2}}

==Career==
Upon receipt of her degree, Goveia became a [[Lecturer]]{{sfn|Goveia|1984|p=3}} and taught in the History Department of UCWI. Her courses focused on topics which had been elucidated in her doctoral thesis. Prior to Goveia, history of the Caribbean had focused on the economics of [[slavery]] and its political implications, {{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|p=174}} following a chronological sequence without regard to the larger context.{{sfn|Winks|1999|p=135}} Goveia, instead, analyzed the sociological impact of the slaves, [[free black]]s, and other elements of society and how they functioned both as separate communities and as part of the whole. She recognized that the entire culture was built upon a "slave society" wherein relationships were defined not only by color but by maintaining a structure based upon superiority and inferiority;{{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|p=174}} the interdependency of the group produced coherency in the society.{{sfn|Wilson-Tagoe|1998|p=29}} She did not advocate remaining silent and shamed about past slavery, instead arguing that only by acknowledging and confronting the past could "human beings change what human beings made".{{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|p=175}} At a time when historians mainly focused on the achievement and development the colonizers brought to the colonies, Goveia as an insider, approached history from the perspective of the colonized. It was an innovation to scholarship that forced scholars to consider the social history and a more interdisciplinary approach to analysis, questioning the [[historiography]] of the region.{{sfn|Winks|1999|p=135}}{{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|pp=176-177}}{{sfn|Higman|1999|p=337}}

Beginning in 1952 at the request of the [[Pan-American Institute of Geography and History]],{{sfn|Goveia|1984|p=3}}{{sfn|Higman|1999|p=6}} Goveia undertook a study that was to become one of her most important works, ''Study on the Historiography of the British West Indies''.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1980|p=13}} She researched and wrote parts of the project over a two-year period for the Pan-American Institute, which published it in 1956.{{sfn|Goveia|1984|p=3}}{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=77}} In the years since its publication, the study has been called one of the two seminal works on historiography published in the 1960s;{{sfn|Kale|2002|p=251}} one of the most influential works;{{sfn|Higman|1999|p=6}} a serious contribution to scholarship;{{sfn|Easton|1957|p=304}} and a catalyst which caused other historians to "probe the inner dynamics of West Indian societies, economies, and polities…".{{sfn|Brereton|1979|p=255}} She published other essays and analyses, such as "The West Indian Slave Laws of the Eighteenth Century", which appeared in a series published by UCWI called ''Chapters in West Indian History'', which were perceptive and insightful.{{sfn|Moore|Higman|Campbell|Bryan|2003|p=xi}}

In 1958, Goveia was made a [[Senior Lecturer]] and then in 1961 was appointed as a professor in West Indian History. The appointment was historic, as she simultaneously became the first (and only) female professor at UCWI, as well as the first Caribbean-born professor of West Indian History.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1980|p=13}} In 1965, her thesis was published under the title of ''Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands at the End of the Eighteenth Century''. Like her ''Study on Historiography'' the book became widely influential,{{sfn|Higman|1999|pp=537-538}} being one of the first works to define the term "slave society" and its inner-workings.{{sfn|Moore|Higman|Campbell|Bryan|2003|p=77}} Rather than a "colonial society", which effectively left out slaves and free blacks, Goveia's focus was on the whole society{{sfn|Moore|Higman|Campbell|Bryan|2003|p=63}} and did not merely examine how slavery effected the state, but rather how the people involved were effected by the institution itself.{{sfn|Higman|1999|p=240}} Pointedly, she noted that rivalries between the various islands in the Caribbean were a result of the broader system, which simultaneously united and divided them. Because the "system" required that they support the hierarchy, individual islands communicated with their colonizers, rather than among themselves and competed for status rather than overall improvement of the citizenry.{{sfn|Higman|1999|p=538}}

From 1961, Goveia had health issues which curtailed her publishing output to an extent, but she continued teaching until her untimely death at age fifty-five.{{sfn|Chamberlain|2004|p=170}}{{sfn|Moore|Higman|Campbell|Bryan|2003|p=xi}}

==Death and legacy==
Goveia died at her home in Hope Mews [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica]] on 18 March 1980.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1980|p=13}} In 1985, a lecture series named the Elsa Goveia Memorial Lectures was inaugurated and continues to highlight scholarship on the history of the Caribbean.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1985|p=18}} In 1989, the reading room at the library on the Mona Campus to the University of the West Indies was renamed in Goveia honor.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1989|p=18}} Since 1995, the Association of Caribbean Historians has awarded the Elsa Goveia Prize to scholars who have exhibited excellence in the study of  Caribbean history.{{sfn|Association of Caribbean Historians|2010}} She was one of the pioneers of historical research on slavery and the Caribbean and is considered the "premier social historian" from the 1960s to her death.{{sfn|Moore|Higman|Campbell|Bryan|2003|p=x}}

Eustathius was born in Epiphania (modern [[Hama]], [[Syria]]). He was probably a Christian and wrote in the time of the emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] a history (''Chronological Epitome'') from the fall of [[Troy]] to the 12th year of Anastasius (502/3) in two parts. The chronicle was used by later historians, but only a few fragments remain preserved in [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], the [[Suda]] and [[John Malalas]]. According to [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]], Eustathius's work was an epitome (a compilation, not an abridgement&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Treadgold, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;) of pagan and ecclesiastical writers.

Eustathius is also known to have compiled an epitome of [[Josephus]] (''Historikon of the Judaean Archaeology by Iosepos''). It is likely the same as a short 13th/14th-century text preserved in Paris. It begins with [[Adam and Eve]] and reaches to the reign of [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}
'''"Only one eye for one eye"'''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1945 | pp = 571ff}}, also known as '''"An eye for an eye"''' or '''"A tooth for a tooth"''', or the '''law of retaliation''', is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree, and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party. In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} The intent behind the principle was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}

The principle is sometimes referred using the Latin term '''''lex talionis''''' or '''the law of talion'''. The English word talion (from the [[Latin]]'' [[wikt:talio#Noun 3|talio]]''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}) means a retaliation authorized by law, in which the punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.

==Definition and methods==
The term '''''lex talionis''''' does not always and only refer to literal eye-for-an-eye codes of justice (see rather [[mirror punishment]]) but applies to the broader class of legal systems that specify formulate penalties for specific crimes, which are thought to be fitting in their severity. Some propose that this was at least in part intended to prevent excessive punishment at the hands of either an avenging private party or the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Douglas A | last1 = Knight | first2 = Amy-Jill | last2 = Levine | year = 2011 | title = The Meaning of the Bible| publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-06-112175-3 |page = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common expression of lex talionis is "an eye for an eye", but other interpretations have been given as well. Legal codes following the principle of ''lex talionis'' have one thing in common: prescribed 'fitting' counter punishment for a [[felony]]. In the famous legal [[Code of Hammurabi|code]] written by [[Hammurabi]], the principle of exact reciprocity is very clearly used. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death.{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC | loc = §230}}

The simplest example is the "eye for an eye" principle.  In that case, the rule was that punishment must be exactly equal to the crime. Conversely, the twelve tables of Rome merely prescribed particular penalties for particular crimes. The Anglo-Saxon legal code substituted payment of [[wergild]] for direct retribution: a particular person's life had a fixed value, derived from his social position; any homicide was compensated by paying the appropriate wergild, regardless of intent. Under the British Common Law, successful plaintiffs were entitled to repayment equal to their loss (in monetary terms). In the modern [[tort]] law system, this has been extended to translate non-economic losses into money as well.  The meaning of the principle Eye for an Eye is that a person who has been injured by another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation, or that an authority does so on behalf of the injured person. The exact Latin (lex talionis) to English translation of this phrase is "The law of retaliation." The root principle of this law is to provide equitable retribution.

==Antecedents==
Various ideas regarding the origins of ''lex talionis'' exist, but a common one is that it developed as early civilizations grew and a less well-established system for retribution of wrongs, [[feud]]s and [[Feud|vendettas]], threatened the social fabric. Despite having been replaced with newer modes of legal theory, ''lex talionis'' systems served a critical purpose in the development of social systems—the establishment of a body whose purpose was to enact the retaliation and ensure that this was the only punishment. This body was the state in one of its earliest forms.

The principle is found in [[Babylonian Law]].{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bond |first=Kenneth |year=1998 |quote=...Code of Hammurabi (1780 BC).  I used a translation by LW King with Commentary by Charles F. Horne (1915). My version was a 1996 electronically enhanced version of the 1910 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. |url=http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |title=Religious Beliefs as a Basis for Ethical Decision Making in the Workplace |publisher=[[Humboldt State University]] |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703102021/http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |archivedate=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is surmised that in societies not bound by the rule of law, if a person was hurt, then the injured person (or their relative) would take [[revenge|vengeful]] retribution on the person who caused the injury. The retribution might be worse than the crime, perhaps even death. Babylonian law put a limit on such actions, restricting the retribution to be no worse than the crime, as long as victim and offender occupied the same status in society.  As with [[blasphemy]] or [[lèse-majesté]] (crimes against a god or a monarch), crimes against one's social betters were punished more severely.

[[Roman law]] moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance.  In cases of assault, fixed penalties were set for various injuries, although ''talio'' was still permitted if one person broke another's limb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507759/Roman-law/41328/Delict-and-contract#ref469137 | contribution = Roman law: Delict and contract | title = Encyclopædia Britannica}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
The principle was first referenced in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], which predates the Hebrew bible.  In the Hebrew Law, the "eye for eye" was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss. Thus, it might be better read 'only one eye for one eye'.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}  The idiomatic biblical phrase "an eye for an eye" in Exodus and Leviticus ({{Hebrew|עין תחת עין}}, ayin tachat ayin) literally means 'an eye under/(in place of) an eye' while a slightly different phrase (עַיִן בְּעַיִן שֵׁן בְּשֵׁן, literally  "eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth") is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses.&lt;ref name=lev24&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ex21&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:22–25|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = deut19&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16-21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in [[Leviticus]] states, "And a man who injures his countryman{{snd}}as he has done, so it shall be done to him [namely,] fracture under/for fracture, eye under/for eye, tooth under/for tooth. Just as another person has received injury from him, so it will be given to him." (Lev. 24:19–21)&lt;ref name="lev24" /&gt;. For an example of {{Hebrew|תחת}} being used in its regular sense of ''under'', see Lev. 22:27 "A bull, sheep or goat, when it is born shall remain under its mother, and from the eighth day..."

===Judaism===
Isaac Kalimi explains that the "lex talionis was humanized by the Rabbis who interpreted "an eye for an eye" to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation. As in the case of the Babylonian 'lex talionis', ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the ''[[peshat]]'' (literal meaning) of the written Torah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biblical interpretation in Judaism and Christianity |first1= Isaac |last1= Kalimi | first2= Peter J | last2 = Haas | author2-link = Peter Haas (rabbi) | publisher = Continuum | year = 2006 | page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h6bSc6ksh0YC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=daYBTeziHZKesQPx-_HjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to "adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A concise history of the Jewish people | first1 = Naomi E | last1 = Pasachoff | first2 = Robert J | last2 = Littman | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2005 | page = 64 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z4eaj09hscAC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=pKoBTe_WDJO8sQPN1aD7CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talmud====
The [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Bava Kamma]] | at = 83b–84a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; interprets the verses referring to "an eye for an eye" and similar expressions as mandating monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.
{{Quote | The Oral Law explains, based upon the biblical verses, that the Bible mandates a sophisticated five-part monetary form of compensation, consisting of payment for "Damages, Pain, Medical Expenses, Incapacitation, and Mental Anguish" — which underlies many modern legal codes. Some rabbinic literature explains, moreover, that the expression, "An eye for an eye, etc." suggests that the perpetrator deserves to lose his own eye, but that biblical law treats him leniently. − Paraphrased from the [[Union of Orthodox Congregations]].&lt;ref name = "OU"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/torah.htm | contribution = Torah | publisher = ou.org | title = About Judaism}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice, where the phrase ''ayin tachat ayin'' makes another appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16–21|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person. The Torah requires the court to "do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother".&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria (such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was not yet executed), wherever it is possible to punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow, the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice (including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty). Otherwise, the offenders receive lashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Makot]] | at = 1:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bab. Talmud | at = 2a}}, based on critical [[exegesis]] of {{bibleverse ||Dt|25:1–3|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender (punitary amputation) there is no case where a conspiratorial false witness could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, or foot.  There is one case where the Torah states "…and you shall cut off her hand…"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|25:11–12|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner.  This verse teaches that, although one must intervene to save the victim, one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sifrei]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = [[Maimonides]] | title = Yad}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Nezikin | last = Hillel | contribution = Rotze'ach u'Sh'mirat Nefesh | at = 1:7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye, tooth, or foot.

{{bibleverse ||Numbers|35:9–30|JP}} discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court, where, under very limited circumstances, someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of "redeemer of blood". In such cases, the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge. While the guilty party is there, the "redeemer of blood" may not kill him.  If, however, the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile, the "redeemer of blood", as an accessory of the court, may kill the guilty party. Nevertheless, the provision of the "redeemer of blood" does not serve as true reciprocal justice, because the redeemer only acts to penalize a negligent killer who forgoes his exile. Furthermore, intentional killing does not parallel negligent killing and thus cannot serve directly as a reciprocal punishment for manslaughter, but as a penalty for escaping punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Makot | at = 7a–13a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to traditional Jewish Law, application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge, as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud.  The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment. These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years.

====Objective of reciprocal justice in Judaism====
The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (''middah k'neged middah'') in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society ("…and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst"&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"/&gt;) and to deter potential criminals from violating the law ("And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:20|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).

The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|19:17–18|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social hierarchy and reciprocal justice====
In Exodus 21, as in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals; the statement of reciprocal justice "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:23–25|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is followed by an example of a different law: if a slave-owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave, the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence. On the other hand, the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave-owner.&lt;ref name = "Coogan"&gt;{{cite book| last = Coogan | first = Michael D | authorlink = Michael Coogan | title = A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| location = New York| year = 2009| page = 112 | isbn = 978-0-19-533272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the reciprocal justice applies across social boundaries: the "eye for eye" principle is directly followed by the proclamation "You are to have one law for the alien and the citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows a much more meaningful principle for social justice, in that the marginalized in society were given the same rights under the social structure. In this context, the reciprocal justice in an ideal functioning setting, according to Michael Coogan,{{who|date=February 2015}} "to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and exacting disproportionate vengeance for offenses committed against them."&lt;ref name = "Coogan" /&gt;

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], [[Jesus]] urges his followers to [[turn the other cheek]]:

Some interpret this as an admonition not to seek legal steps for any compensation that corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} Others interpret it as Jesus simply teaching his followers not to take personal vengeance, rather than commenting on any legal practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Righteous Personal Conduct Interpretation of Turning the Other Cheek|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek#Righteous_personal_conduct_interpretation|website=Wikepedia|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

[[Christian]] interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the [[Church father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]]. He already discussed in his ''[[Contra Faustum]]'', Book XIX, the points of 'fulfilment or destruction' of the Jewish law.&lt;ref name = "New Advent"&gt;{{Citation | title = Fathers | contribution-url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/140619.htm | contribution = Contra Faustum | first = Augustine | last = of Hippo | publisher = NewAdvent}}.&lt;/ref&gt; George Robinson characterizes the passage of Exodus ("an eye for an eye") as one of the "most controversial in the Bible". According to Robinson, some have pointed to this passage as evidence of the vengeful nature of justice in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Essential Judaism: a complete guide to beliefs, customs and rituals|first = George|last = Robinson|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |year = 2000|page = 242|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=huTgZdgnXs4C&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=george+robinson+most+controversial+bible+eye&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r728JIroEM&amp;sig=XfrFaFpgX4oYkLwQet7sX4P5tLI&amp;ei=lIAkTZCrG4eycNeZ8K8B&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 978-0-671-03481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Abraham Bloch speculates that the "lex talionis has been singled out as a classical example of biblical harshness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A book of Jewish ethical concepts: Biblical and postbiblical |first=Abraham P |last=Bloch |publisher=KTAV |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harry S.

The [[Qur'an]] mentions the "eye for an eye" concept as being ordained for the [[Children of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Qur'an | at = V: 45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Lex talionis in Islam is Qiṣāṣ (Arabic: قصاص) as mentioned in [[Al-Baqara|{{Citation | title = Qur'an | at = 2:178}}]]: "O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution (''Qisas'') for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.  But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy.  But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment." Muslim countries that use Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, such as [[Iran]] or Saudi Arabia, apply the "eye for an eye" rule literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7754756.stm | title = Court orders Iranian man blinded | publisher = BBC | date = 28 November 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/14/acid-blinding-postponed-iran-outcry | title = Acid blinding sentence postponed by Iran after international outcry | newspaper = The Guardian | place = UK | date = 14 May 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote | In the Torah We prescribed for them a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, an equal wound for a wound: if anyone forgoes this out of charity, it will serve as atonement for his bad deeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8270">'''Flodoard''' (of [[Reims]]) (893/4 – 28 March 966) was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]], [[chronicler]], and presumed archivist of the [[Reims Cathedral|cathedral church of Reims]] in the [[West Francia|West Frankish kingdom]] during the decades following the dissolution of the [[Carolingian Empire]].

==Biography==
According to local tradition, Flodoard was born at [[Épernay]]. He was educated at the [[cathedral school of Reims]] which had been established by [[Archbishop of Reims|Archbishop]] [[Fulcon|Fulk]] (882–900).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and History|last=Glenn|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=171–172|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a canon of Reims, and favourite of the archbishops Heriveus (d. 922) and Seulf (d. 925), he occupied while still young an important position in the archiepiscopal ministry, and in particular in the cathedral [[scriptorium]]. Following Seulf's death in 925, the magnate [[Herbert II, Count of Vermandois]] installed his five-year-old son, [[Hugh of Vermandois (bishop)|Hugh]], as the new archbishop. Flodoard refused to participate in the young boy's election, and was stripped of his position and benefices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and History|last=Glenn|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=216–218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 931, Reims was taken from Count Herbert by King [[Rudolph of France|Raoul]] and Duke [[Hugh the Great]], who ejected Hugh and oversaw the election of a new archbishop, [[Artald of Reims|Artold]]. In 936-7, Flodoard visited Rome, perhaps on pilgrimage, where he met [[Pope Leo VII]]. Herbert recaptured Reims in 940, deposing Artold and reimposing Hugh on the see. Flodoard objected to the invasion of the bishopric on [[Canon law|canonical]] grounds; consequently, he was detained by Herbert and once again stripped of his prebends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and History|last=Glenn|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=219, 223–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 943-6, Flodoard appears to have been away from Reims with the court of King [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. In 946, Louis recaptured Reims with the backing of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]]. Hugh was again deposed, and Artold was re-ordained. His claim to the see was eventually ratified at the 948 [[Universal Synod of Ingelheim|Synod of Ingelheim]], which Flodoard attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and History|last=Glenn|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=220–221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 951, Flodoard was sent to Otto's court at [[Aachen]], where he represented the church of Reims in a property dispute. He retired from his canonical office in 963, aged 70, and died on 28 March 966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annales|last=Lauer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
His [[Ecclesiastical history|history of the church]] of Reims (''Historia Remensis Ecclesiae'') is one of the most remarkable productions of the 10th century. Flodoard had been given charge of the episcopal archives, and constructed his history out of the original texts, which he generally reproduces in full; the documents for the period of [[Hincmar]] being especially valuable.

The ''Annales'' which Flodoard wrote year by year from 919 to 966 are doubly important, by reason of the author's honesty and the central position of Reims in European affairs in his time.

Flodoard's poetical works are of hardly less historical interest. The long poem celebrating the triumph of Christ and His saints was called forth by the favour shown him by [[Pope Leo VII]], during whose pontificate he visited [[Rome]], and he devotes fourteen books to the history of the popes.

Flodoard's works were published in full by [[Jacques Paul Migne|JP Migne]] (''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', vol. 135); a modern edition of the ''Annales'' is the one edited by [[Philippe Lauer]] (Paris, 1906). For bibliography see [[Auguste Molinier]], ''Sources de l'histoire de France'' (No. 932).

'''Halvdan Koht''' (7 July 1873&amp;nbsp;– 12 December 1965) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[historian]] and politician representing the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]].

Born in the north of Norway to a fairly distinguished family, he soon became interested in politics and history. Starting his political career in the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], he [[party switching|switched]] to the Labour Party around the turn of the 20th century. He represented that party in the [[Bærum]] municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of [[Stortinget|Parliament]], but served nonetheless as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1935 to 1941, as part of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government-in-exile]] following [[Operation Weserübung|Germany's invasion of Norway]]. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.

As an academic he was a professor of history at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now the University of Oslo) from 1910 to 1935, having become a [[research fellow]] in 1900 and [[docent]] in 1908. Among many honors, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was a prolific writer, and touched on numerous subjects during his long academic career. He wrote several biographies; his works on [[Johan Sverdrup]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]] spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian [[nation]]. He was also interested in the [[United States]] and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.

Koht's views on the [[Norwegian language]] also garnered him nationwide academic recognition. He championed the [[Norwegian language#Danish to Norwegian|Samnorsk]] language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language in this direction was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led to the failure of this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was a founding member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]] and an ordinary member of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic, and nurturing a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.

==Background==
Halvdan Koht was born on 7 August 1873 in [[Tromsø]], one of the larger cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four children born to [[Paul Steenstrup Koht]] (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher with a penchant for singing, languages and drawing.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2002|title=Halvdan Koht|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Åsmund|last=Svendsen|editor-first=Knut|editor-last=Helle|editor-link=Knut Helle|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|volume=5|edition=2nd|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Halvdan_Koht/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant [[Jens Holmboe (bailiff)|Jens Holmboe]] from Tromsø.&lt;ref&gt;Genealogical entries for [http://vestraat.net/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I9931&amp;tree=IEA Hanna Birgitte Holmboe] and [http://vestraat.net/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I12428&amp;tree=IEA Joachim Gotsche Giæver] (vestraat.net)&lt;/ref&gt; Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian [[Ola Krogseng Giæver]].&lt;ref&gt;Genealogical entries for [http://vestraat.net/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I21389&amp;tree=IEA Jens Holmboe Giæver] (vestraat.net) and NSD data for [http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=polsys&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=10919 Ola Krogseng Giæver]&lt;/ref&gt; In Paul Koht's lineage, [[Kjeld Stub]] was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was intended to have the name Joachim, but this was stopped on request from Joachim G. Giæver who voiced his dislike for the name. He was then christened Halfdan, changed to Halvdan some years later.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in Tromsø, where Paul Steenstrup Koht was a headmaster and mayor. The family moved to Skien when Halvdan was twelve years old, where his father again immersed himself in politics: he served as mayor as well as parliamentarian for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]]. Koht finished school here, taking his [[examen artium]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; His father was among his teachers for a while in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, one year after the death of Koht's father, the family moved to [[Bekkelaget]], a borough in [[Aker, Norway|Aker]]. Koht studied at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now the University of Oslo).&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In September 1898 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], Koht married [[Karen Grude Koht|Karen Elisabeth Grude]] (1871–1960), an essay writer and women's rights activist one and a half years his senior; she bore him three children. One child died in infancy, but the remaining two had distinguished careers: [[Åse Gruda Skard]] (née Koht) became a child psychologist and [[Paul Koht]] an ambassador. Through Åsa,  Halvdan Koht was a father-in-law of literary scholar [[Sigmund Skard]] and a grandfather of politician and academic [[Torild Skard]], psychologist and ombud [[Målfrid Grude Flekkøy]]&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; and politician and organisational leader [[Halvdan Skard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Halvdan Skard|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Halvdan_Skard|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, Karen's declining health and Halvdan's preoccupation with his work placed a strain on their relationship. Disenchanted with the loveless union, Koht entered several extramarital friendships in the following decade, often [[pen friend]]s.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; During the Second World War, there were rumors about a romantic relationship with his secretary Unni Diesen.&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eriksen|first=Knut Einar|authorlink=Knut Einar Eriksen|editor-first=Hans Fredrik|editor-last=Dahl|editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=Koht, Halvdan|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/k/k3.html#koht-halvdan|accessdate=17 August 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811004631/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/k/k3.html#koht-halvdan|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945 the relationship to Karen regrew in strength.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Education==
Koht graduated with a [[cand.philol.]] degree from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=polsys&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=18073|title=Halvdan Koht|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied history with geography as a minor subject until 1895;&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; his main history teacher was [[Gustav Storm]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; The next examination was in different languages, both classical and modern. Koht had the choice between [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Classical Latin]] or Norwegian and German (including Norse); he chose the Norwegian and German.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, after finishing his history studies, he spent three months in the Mediterranean, travelling with three ships, the first from Norway to [[Venice]], the second from Venice to [[Constantinople]], the third back to Norway. He studied German literature during this travels.&lt;ref name=p60&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1896 Koht was finally examined by [[Sophus Bugge]] and earned his degree.&lt;ref name=p43&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of just three students to be examined in Norwegian and German in late 1896, and had been the only candidate in history the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

A break from the studies came in the second half of 1892. After his father's death, he could not afford to attend university that semester. He worked briefly as a private tutor in the Skien district, and was paid to write in the newspaper ''[[Varden (newspaper)|Varden]]''.&lt;ref name=p65&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to his studies he worked as a Kristiania correspondent for the newspaper; eventually he also worked for ''[[Päivälehti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 67, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 he took over from [[Erik Vullum]] as obituarist and anniversary writer in ''[[Verdens Gang (1868–1923)|Verdens Gang]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; In the next years he would contribute extensively to publications such as ''[[Den 17de Mai]]'', ''[[Nationalbladet]]'', ''Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift'', ''[[Syn og Segn]]'', ''[[Samtiden]]'', ''[[Unglyden]]'', ''[[Dagbladet]]'', ''Verdens Gang'' and ''[[Tidens Tegn]]''; these were mostly Liberal or Norwegian nationalist publications.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some months after graduating Koht worked as an unpaid volunteer at the [[University Library of Oslo]], while also continuing to attend university lectures. He was then given a scholarship, the "Gustav Bruun Endowment" of {{NOK|1800}}. The University doublled Koht's award to NOK 3600.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1897 to 1899 he studied abroad with this fellowship. He studied at the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[University of Leipzig]] and in Paris ([[École pratique des hautes études|École des hautes études]], [[École Nationale des Chartes|École des Chartes]]). He was especially influenced by [[Karl Lamprecht]] in Leipzig.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1899 to 1901 Koht worked as a substitute at the University Library of Oslo, and part-time as a school teacher.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He was also engaged by Gustav Storm to help him with publishing the [[source text]] ''[[Regesta Norvegica]]''.&lt;ref name=p35&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, after eight years of work, Koht completed the two last volumes of ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'', a [[biographical dictionary]] of Norwegian writers.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; However, it was a posthumous work, the principal author&amp;mdash;[[Jens Braage Halvorsen]]&amp;mdash;having died in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Jens Braage Halvorsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Olaf Chr. |last=Torp |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Jens_Braage_Halvorsen/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

===Appointments and doctorate===
In 1901 he was appointed as a [[research fellow]] at the Royal Frederick University. He rarely had responsibility for any teaching of the students, and since he was often busy with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'' he remained a research fellow until 1907. In 1908 he took his [[dr.philos.]] degree on the thesis ''Die Stellung Norwegens und Schwedens im Deutsch-Dänischen Konflikt 1863–1864''.&lt;ref name=innleiing7/&gt; Opponents at the dissertation were [[Ebbe Hertzberg]] and [[Yngvar Nielsen]].&lt;ref name=p119&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 119–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koht was then hired as a [[docent]] at the University in 1908. Because Koht had internal opponents at the university, the docenture was designated to cover "cultural history" instead of "history". A while later the university changed it to "history". The [[Løvland's Cabinet|cabinet]] changed it back to "cultural history", before the Parliament finally decided on "history".&lt;ref name=p119/&gt; Koht was going to start his tenure as a docent, but argued with [[Waldemar Christofer Brøgger (geologist)|Waldemar Christofer Brøgger]] that he deserved to travel abroad first.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1908 to 1909 Koht travelled around in the United States, England and Sweden, visiting the peace conferences in London (1908), [[Chicago]] (1909) and Stockholm (1910).&lt;ref name=innleiing7/&gt; During these years, his wife, daughter and her nanny lived in Eidsvoll.&lt;ref&gt;Skard, 1974: p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Koht then returned to Norway and the university, and remained docent until being promoted to professor in 1910. He remained professor until 1935, and also served as the [[dean (education)|dean]] of his Faculty from 1912 to 1917.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

===Fields of research===
Koht faced considerable skepticism among academics when announcing his intentions to study [[social history]] from the farmers' perspective. Gustav Storm claimed that farmers in Norway had "done no effort of their own".&lt;ref name=p35/&gt; [[Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae]] exclaimed that a person whom Koht wanted to study, the farmer-politician [[John G. Neergaard]], was a "crook&amp;nbsp;... oh well, trahit sua quemque voluptas".&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Koht was given {{NOK|100}} to do research in [[Nordmøre]] on Neergaard.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 professor [[Cathrinus Bang]] replied to Koht's wish to study social history: "Yes, do not go out and become a socialist!"&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Koht completed the dissertation ''Bonde mot borgar i nynorsk historie'', in which he further developed his theories on the role of the farmers in history.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in the journal ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Oslo)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' in 1912, it featured an elaboration on Koht's theory about class and the nation. According to Koht, the community of the nation was expanded in a democratic way when the agrarian movement, then the labour movement, both rose from political passivity to demand a place in the political and national sphere.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He wrote about this in the 1910 article ''Norsk folkesamling'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Norsk bondereisning'', published in 1926 as a compilation of Koht's presented material in his university lectures, represented the culmination of Koht's work on the topic of [[class conflict]] between the agrarian and the urban population. Koht argued that the peasant movement had abandoned the cause of [[class interest]] in favour of universal rights and social reforms. The same perspective had to be applied to the struggle of the labour movement, Koht maintained.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; An economic background for the farmers' rising was presented in 1912, in ''Priser og politikk i norsk historie'', originally a lecture for the second Norwegian conference of historians.&lt;ref name=p155&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; This lecture was also where his [[historical materialism]] came to fruition.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In 1951 he stated that he "has never thought that the theories could be foundational for a political or social uprising".&lt;ref name=p155/&gt;

Koht's stay in the United States affected his historical views and adaptation of historical materialism,&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; and he also tried to encourage the study of [[History of the United States|American history]] in Norway.&lt;ref name=p150&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; American culture did not have a particularly high standing in Norway at the time. In school, Koht did not learn proper English.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Before he embarked to the US, some historian colleagues insinuated that the country "barely had any history" and was not worth visiting.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Koht's first writing on the subject came in 1910 with the lecture ''Genesis of American Independence''. He followed with ''Pengemakt og arbeid i Amerika'' ("Monetary Power and Labor in America", 1910), which was based on "People's Academy" lectures,&lt;ref name=p150/&gt; then ''Amerikansk kultur'' ("American Culture", 1912) and ''Den amerikanske nasjonen'' ("The American Nation", 1920).&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He would return briefly to American academia during his career, for instance in the autumn of 1930 to hold a course at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wishing to unite materialism and idealism, Koht became interested in psychology and the role of individuals in history. The latter focus led to his becoming, in the words of his biographer [[Åsmund Svendsen]], "one of the greatest biographers of the 20th century".&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Inspired by the work with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'', he wrote a life of the author [[Henrik Wergeland]] in 1908. Later he published biographies both of Norwegians and foreigners: [[Otto von Bismarck]] (1911), [[Ivar Aasen]] (1913), [[Johan Sverdrup]] in three volumes between 1916 and 1925, [[Marcus Thrane]] in 1917, [[Henrik Ibsen]] in two volumes in 1928 and 1929, and [[Haakon VII of Norway]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He also wrote about 400 pieces in the first edition of ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]'', a [[biographical dictionary]] which would become a preeminent source on important figures in Norwegian history.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Between 1909 and 1932 he published letters and original writings of Henrik Ibsen, [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]], [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]] and Henrik Wergeland. He chaired ''Kjeldeskriftfondet'' from 1918 to 1927 and ''Norsk historisk kjeldeskriftråd'' from 1923 to 1928, two institutions that dealt with publishing of source texts.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He also chaired the [[Norwegian Historical Association]] from 1912 to 1927 and 1932 to 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|title=Historikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Historical Association]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Norwegian Genealogical Society]] from 1928 to 1940 and the [[Comité International des Sciences Historiques]] from 1926 to 1933.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref name=innleiing7/&gt;

===Honorary positions===
Koht became a fellow of the learned society [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] in 1908. Between 1923 and 1939 he was both praeses and vice praeses.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He held [[honorary degree]]s from the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of Warsaw]]. He was decorated by France as a Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]], and in 1952 he received the [[Gunnerus Medal]] from the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was also a member of the [[International Society for the History of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;2001, Franz-Andre Sondervorst, ''Chronique  de SIHM''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===Early involvement and local politics===
Koht's father introduced his son to politics, taking him to the Liberal Party national convention in 1891, where he was allowed to enter since he studied at the university. Koht's first political arena was the [[Norwegian Students' Society]], where he vehemently argued that the [[flag of Norway]] should not contain the [[Union badge of Norway and Sweden|union badge]] (the "flag case").&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he left this forum, co-founded a new students' association called ''Den Frisinnede Studenterforening'', and, as the students' association collectively entered the Liberal Party, became a board member of the local party branch in Kristiania.&lt;ref name=p65/&gt; He continued his fight against the union badge, and the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union]] as a whole. In 1905, when the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|union was dissolved altogether]], he agitated for the establishment of a republic, but [[Norwegian monarchy plebiscite, 1905|a plebiscite]] decided to keep the monarchy.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Though he never adhered to Christianity in his adolescent or adult life,&lt;ref name=p58/&gt; Koht valued the faith in the perfectability of human beings, as prompted "the greatest religions",&lt;ref&gt;See a lecture showing his attitude toward religion:"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1931/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1931 – Presentation Speech]", by Halvdan Koht. Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 5 Jan 2015. He states: "...human perfectability, the capacity to become more and more perfect. It is a faith which has provided the foundation for some of our greatest religions and one which has inspired much of the best work for progress. It was proclaimed by [[Jesus Christ]]; it inspired the work of men like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Henrik Wergeland|Wergeland]]."&lt;/ref&gt; and he started to feel solidarity with the labour movement and the working classes, leading to the [[Political radicalism|radicalisation]] of his views: from 1900 he voted for the [[Norwegian Labour Party]],&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; and had four years prior to that began to consider himself a [[socialist]].&lt;ref name=innleiing7&gt;Kjærheim, 1985: p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; While living in the United States, he developed a form of historical materialism, which led to a fusion of history scholarship and political views. He viewed the Liberal Party as an important agent in Norwegian history, since it pronounced the rights of the farmers, but he now viewed the [[working class]] as the next class to be included in the political life, and specifically through the Labor Party.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In Koht's Liberal Party period, he cooperated with some of their more radical members, among them [[Carl Jeppesen]], who later would join the Labour Party.&lt;ref name=p65/&gt; He joined the Labour Party when he returned from the United States and moved to [[Bærum]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1951: p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with his family in [[Stabekk]], but commissioned a house in [[Lysaker]] in 1910. The house, designed by architect [[Arnstein Arneberg]], was dubbed "Karistua". The university offered him no office, so he had to conduct his research at home.&lt;ref&gt;Skard, 1974: p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koht served as a member of Bærum [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] in the terms 1916–1919, 1928–1931 and 1931–1934.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; In 1952 he wrote the 50-year history of Bærum Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Koht, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign affairs politician===
[[File:Halvdan Koht and Cordell Hull by Harris &amp; Ewing.jpg|thumb|Koht (left) with [[Cordell Hull]], 1937.]]
Internationally, Koht tried to prop up the institutions that maintained [[public international law]]. In 1923 he participated in the arbitrations between [[Denmark]] and Norway about the disposition of Eastern [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; Sovereignty was claimed by Denmark. Koht teamed up with the conservative politician [[C. J. Hambro]], who had edited ''Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift'' to which Koht had contributed. The negotiations led to an agreement on Norwegian trade rights in the area, but a question of sovereignty over Eastern Greenland remained unsolved. In 1931, forces in and outside of the then-[[Centre Party (Norway)|Agrarian]] [[Kolstad's Cabinet|government]] annexed "[[Erik the Red's Land]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|title=C J Hambro|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Paul|last=Thyness|authorlink=Paul Thyness|editor-first=Knut|editor-last=Helle|editor-link=Knut Helle|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|volume=4|edition=2nd|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/C_J_Hambro/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s Koht became the foremost international politician of the Labour Party. He positioned himself in the Labour Party as the prospective [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] should the party form a government. He did so because fellow historian and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1928, [[Edvard Bull, Sr.]], had died, making Koht the "Foreign Minister-designate". The Labour Party also polled well in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1933]], leading them to prepare for office.&lt;ref&gt;Ørvik, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour government was formed on 20 March 1935. Koht became Minister of Foreign Affairs in [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]'s [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Cabinet]].&lt;ref name=nygaardsvold&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/the-government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/norway-at-war/johan-nygaardsvolds-government.html?id=438691|title=Johan Nygaardsvold's Government|publisher=[[Government.no]]|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Koht's first actions as minister was to persuade the Labour Party not to pull Norway out of the [[League of Nations]], something the party had declared that it would do as recently as 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In foreign policy matters Koht and Nygaardsvold usually made decisions without consulting the other ministers, merely informing the rest of the cabinet of the decisions that had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nygaardsvold Cabinet.jpg|thumb|[[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet]]. Koht is the third from left, standing between [[Fredrik Monsen]] and [[Johan Nygaardsvold]].]]
After the League of Nations failed as an effective international body, Koht again favoured the strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] policy to which Norway had adhered before the League of Nations membership. For many years, he was reluctant to an expansion of a Norwegian military defense capacity.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He did not vehemently and principally oppose such an expansion, and [[#Peace activism|had been]] quite friendly to the principle of a national defense in the past. His neutrality policy nonetheless put him on the "defense-skeptical" side together with Johan Nygaardsvold and most of his cabinet. Among the more "defense-friendly" in and around the cabinet, not the least from 1936, were [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Haakon Lie]], [[Finn Moe]], [[Trygve Lie]], [[Oscar Torp]], [[Martin Tranmæl]] and Minister of Defense [[Fredrik Monsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pryser, 1988: pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Koht expressed great concern for the consequences of the arms race taking place in Europe, which he felt could easily lead to war.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1936 outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]] in the conflict between [[Second Spanish Republic|the Spanish government]] and rebels led by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government for the duration of the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. [[Martin Tranmæl]], a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]'', led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the [[International Brigades]].&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;92–94.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Koht personally the civil war in Spain came close to ending his cabinet career on several occasions. On 9 April 1937, following a series of incidents where Francoist warships intercepted Norwegian vessels sailing on Spanish ports and confiscated both cargoes and ships, and Norwegian protests failing to gain results, Koht made a formal proposal to dispatch the Norwegian minelayer [[HNoMS Olav Tryggvason|''Olav Tryggvason'']] to Spain to protect Norwegian shipping. After the proposal met opposition in parliament and was set to fail, Koht offered to resign. Prime Minister Nygaardsvold refused to accept Koht's resignation, stating that he "would rather be shot than lose Koht". The case came close to causing the whole cabinet's fall in parliament, before it was agreed that it would be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;170–81.&lt;/ref&gt; When Koht in 1938 attempted to establish a trade agreement with Franco, he was blocked by his own party and the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]]. Again requesting to be allowed to resign, Koht stayed after months of debating ended with the party giving the cabinet free rein to do what it saw as best with regards to trade with Franco. By October 1938 Koht had negotiated a trade agreement with Franco. The formal Norwegian recognition of the Franco government as the representative of Spain followed on 31 March 1939, three days after the [[Siege of Madrid|fall of Madrid]] to the nationalist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Moen and Sæther, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;199–208, 260, 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===

====Pre-war phase====
With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Norwegian government declared the country neutral in the conflict. Both warring sides subsequently stated that they would respect Norway's neutrality, provided that she protect her neutrality against trespasses by the other side. Koht was clear from early on that Norway should remain neutral, but also that in the event of her being forced to enter the war it was critical that it was on the side of the British.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp. 2, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the first months of the Second World War Norwegian neutrality was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February [[Altmark Incident]] in [[Jøssingfjorden]]. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;26–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April the Allies sent notes to both Norway and Sweden warning that they would take any action necessary if the Germans were allowed to use the neutral countries' territory to their advantage. Koht responded with a speech in which he said that the Allies had nothing to gain by interfering with Norwegian shipping lanes&amp;mdash;the British had a more significant trade with Norway than the Germans. The next day the Allies decided to launch [[Operation Wilfred|a mining operation]] on the Norwegian coast, and to land troops at Narvik in case the Germans responded to the mining by landing in Norway. Shortly before the mining was carried out, Koht warned the British that no further neutrality violations would be tolerated, and that in the future the Norwegians would respond with force.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;37–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans too repeatedly violated Norwegian neutrality, and, following a visit from the Norwegian fascist leader [[Vidkun Quisling]] to Hitler in December 1939, began serious planning for a possible occupation of Norway. Following the Altmark Incident, Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp.&amp;nbsp;54–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the British mining operation on 8 April 1940, the Norwegian government lodged formal protests with the British and French governments, while secretly remaining set on avoiding war with the Allies at all cost. Koht told the Norwegian parliament that he believed that the Allies were trying to bring Norway into the war. The Allied mining of the Norwegian coast coincidentally distracted the Norwegian government from realising that large German forces had been on their way to invade Norway for several days prior.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp. 97, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

====German invasion and war====
At the advent of the Nazi German [[Operation Weserübung]], the invasion of Norway of 9 April 1940, Germany sent the envoy [[Curt Bräuer]] to present demands of capitulation. Koht personally met with Bräuer, and rejected his demands and threats of war, stating that "war had already started". Koht and the cabinet fled Norway's capital in the morning of 9 April. Even though Koht rejected Bräuer's initial contact, he did convince the cabinet to listen to further German proposals for negotiations later the same day. All Norwegian negotiations with the Germans ended after a failed attempt to capture the Norwegian king and government [[Battle of Midtskogen|in Midtskogen]] early on 10 April.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp. 226–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Koht was willing to take up the fight against the invaders. He wrote several key speeches, some of which were delivered by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], to convey staunch resistance to the German demands.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;

Vital to the Norwegian effort to try to halt the German advance was assistance from the Allies, which Koht requested in the early hours of 9 April, although skeptical of the potential of Allied aid.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp. 223, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; When the rest of the government fled from [[Molde]] to [[Tromsø]], landing on 1 May, Koht and [[Birger Ljungberg|Ljungberg]] (Minister of Defense) continued from there with the cruiser [[HMS Glasgow (C21)|HMS ''Glasgow'']] to London. Here, from 5 May they negotiated with British government representatives ([[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Philips]]) on British aid to Norway. Koht also made a radio speech from London on the BBC, broadcasting to Norway, and a speech on American radio. On 8 and 9 May he met [[Reynaud]], [[Maurice Gamelin|Gamelin]] and [[Daladier]] in Paris. The Norwegian Ministers departed from London on 11 May, arriving back in Norway on 17 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&amp;bokid=innstillbilag2&amp;sideid=149&amp;innhaldid=4 |author=Parliament of Norway 1947 |title=pp. 298&amp;ndash;299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks with the Allies resulted in concrete promises and plans for large French reinforcements for the Norwegian front. These plans were however abandoned by the Allies on 24 May 1940, following the worsening situation for the Allies in France, and an evacuation decided.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp. 514–515.&lt;/ref&gt; Koht was informed by British Minister to Norway [[Cecil Dormer|Sir Cecil Dormer]] on 1 June that the Allied Forces had decided to retreat from Norway, owing to the difficult situation at the Western Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&amp;bokid=innstillbilag2&amp;sideid=149&amp;innhaldid=4 |author=Parliament of Norway 1947 |title=pp. 300&amp;ndash;301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Allied decision to evacuate, the cabinet sent Koht to [[Luleå]] in Sweden to try to reinvigorate a previously rejected plan to create a demarcation line between the Germans and Norwegian in Northern Norway. Swedish troops were planned to occupy Narvik. The plan was named the Mowinckel plan, after its initiator, the former prime minister [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]]. During a meeting with the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, [[Christian Günther]], who was to act as a middle man with Germans in relation to the plan, Koht revealed that the Allies were about to evacuate Norway. Although Günther never revealed the evacuation plans to the Germans, Koht was heavily criticised for doing so by his colleagues upon his return to Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, 2009: pp. 518–519.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In exile====
The cabinet eventually fled the country on 7 June. Koht landed in London on 19 June 1940, now heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Norway was now a close ally of the United Kingdom, but Koht was seen as clinging somewhat to his neutrality policy, and not embracing the alliance with the United Kingdom enough.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Halvdan Koht|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Halvdan_Koht|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the autumn of 1940, Trygve Lie championed a change in policy which meant seeking lasting allies in the western world. Koht viewed this as "distrust". A schism between him and the rest of the cabinet grew as it also became known that Koht's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received reports of a possible forthcoming assault on Norway, without Koht having informed the cabinet thoroughly. Furthermore, there was discontent over Koht's decision to establish the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile in [[Bracknell]], several miles west of the cabinet headquarters.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;

Koht was granted leave of absence on 19 November 1940, and ultimately left the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs on 20 February 1941,&lt;ref name=nygaardsvold/&gt; being succeeded by Trygve Lie.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; Koht decided to travel to Canada and then the United States. He lived with his daughter Åsa and her family in [[Washington, DC]], returning to Norway after the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

===Political legacy===
[[File:Professor Kohts vei og Gamle Drammensvei - 2012-03-11 at 12-16-31.jpg|thumb|Professor Kohts vei (lit. "Professor Koht's street") in [[Bærum]] was named after Halvdan Koht in 1967.]]
Trygve Lie, who after the war had become the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations#List of Secretaries-General|first Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]], characterised Koht in his memoirs as an expert on foreign affairs, but introverted. He had relatively little contact with other politicians, kept to himself to study in peace, and spent much time on his extensive writing. Koht reportedly preferred to solve a problem by himself instead of involving co-workers and employees, even the experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His way of thinking was logical and rational, but he allegedly nurtured an "exaggerated belief in paragraphs" and a "dogmatic belief in international law", and wrongly thought that other countries would obey formal regulations at most times.&lt;ref&gt;Lie, 1955: pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Koht had few or no alternatives to his neutrality policy, and in many ways he based his entire career in foreign affairs on that policy. Trygve Lie claimed that before the Second World War, the neutrality policy had "become a religion" for Koht.&lt;ref&gt;Lie, 1955: pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koht's role in the weak and unorganised defense against Operation Weserübung was debated during and after the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation]]. After the World War, a commission named ''[[Undersøkelseskommisjonen av 1945]]'' ("Scrutiny Commission of 1945") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; After receiving ''Undersøkelseskommisjonen''{{'s}} analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an [[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] trial. The Parliament of Norway did not find it necessary, and no such trial took place.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

Since Koht lived in Lysaker, Bærum Municipality wanted to honor him by naming a street after him. When the street was named in 1967, Koht was still controversial. The street was therefore named ''Professor Kohts vei'' ("Professor Koht's Road") to emphasise his academic, rather than his political career.&lt;ref name=basbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|title=Professor Kohts vei.|encyclopedia=Budstikkas store Asker og Bærum-leksikon|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Bakken, Tor Chr.|url=http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|accessdate=4 May 2011|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-573-1534-4|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322091434/http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language views==
Hailing from Tromsø, Koht spoke a [[Northern Norway|Northern Norwegian]] dialect in his early life. In Skien his dialect provoked negative reactions from his peers. He was inspired by the dialects of Skien's surroundings ([[Telemark]]); from 1891 he wrote the "rural" [[Norwegian language conflict|language form]] [[Landsmål]] with strong tinges of [[Bø, Telemark|Bø]] dialect.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref name=p43/&gt; Before this he had attempted to write both "[[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knudsen]] [[Riksmål]]" and "[[Ivar Aasen|Aasen]] Landsmål", but neither stuck.&lt;ref name=p58&gt;Koht, 1951: pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Early publications on the [[Norwegian language struggle|Norwegian language controversy]] were ''Det norske målstrævs historie'' (1898) and ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for målstræve'' (1900).&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He became a board member of the Landsmål-based publishing house [[Det Norske Samlaget]], and edited the Landsmål periodical ''Syn og Segn'' from 1901 to 1908, until 1905 together with [[Rasmus Flo]].&lt;ref name="p43"/&gt; He chaired [[Noregs Mållag]], an association the propagation of Landsmål, from 1921 to 1925.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In 1929, Landsmål was renamed [[Nynorsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=nynorsk|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=|location=|url=http://www.snl.no/nynorsk|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koht spoke of language in a social context in general and of the [[class struggle]] in particular. He eventually used the Labour Party as a vehicle for his language activism, especially after being asked by the party to write ''Arbeidarreising og målspørsmål'' in 1921. In it, he synthesised the class struggle and language struggle in Norway, and because he was an integrationist he wanted a popular gathering around one written language.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Koht became a member of ''Rettskrivingsnemnda'' in 1934,&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; and in 1936 the Labour Party agreed that a language reform should be carried out, moving the two language forms [[Bokmål]] and Nynorsk closer to one another. The language reforms took place in 1938 and promoted the [[Samnorsk]] ideal.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; The reforms were reversed in 1941 under Nazi rule; the original changes were reinstated after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Sørensen|first=Øystein|authorlink=Øystein Sørensen|editor-first=Hans Fredrik|editor-last=Dahl|editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=rettskrivningsreformen av 1941|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|accessdate=16 December 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231073302/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|archivedate=31 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Kåre Lunden]], Koht was much hated by many because of his language reforms, which were routinely perceived as attacks and degradations on their preferred language. His ideals were dubbed "det kohtske knot", i.e. "the Kohtian mishmash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Det kohtske knot|last=Hustad|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Hustad|date=15 January 2005|work=[[Klassekampen]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his own part, Koht often used spellings that contrasted with both Nynorsk and Bokmål. The [[definite article]], which is formally the suffix "-et", was substituted with the suffix "-e", such as in the titles of his publications ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for målstræve'' and ''Sosialdemokratie''.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Peace activism==
Koht's first travel abroad was in 1890, when he accompanied his father as well as [[Hans Jacob Horst]] and [[John Theodor Lund]] to an interparliamentary peace conference in London.&lt;ref name=p58/&gt; In 1895 he was a founding member and board member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]], serving as chairman from 1900 to 1902.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; From 1901 to 1902 he edited his own monthly periodical named ''Fredstidende'' ("Peace Times").&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

The Peace Association was dominated by Liberal Party politicians—from a Marxist perspective, "[[bourgeois]]" people. Historian [[Nils Ivar Agøy]] had noted that the socialists who were active in the bourgeois peace movement—the most prominent being Koht, [[Adam Egede-Nissen]] and [[Carl Bonnevie]]—were "radicalised sons of the bourgeoisie". This meant that they were "capable of asserting themselves among the ship-owners and county governors in the board" of the Norwegian Peace Association. Koht also followed his own goals during his first period as chairman. He wanted to tie the "apolitical" peace movement closer to the labour movement, to create "economic justice" and to employ the use of [[arbitration]] in labour conflicts. These goals were not embraced by all of the members, particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral. A larger problem, however, was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism. He had thus carried out his [[compulsory military service]] "with fervor", notes Agøy. Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the "fatherland". The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle, and Koht therefore resigned his membership.&lt;ref&gt;Agøy, 2000: pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by others, as a result of a schism in the Peace Association between the pacifists and the more pragmatic peace activists. Koht has also been assessed as an ineffective organisational leader.&lt;ref name=ringsp52&gt;Rønning and Ringsby, 2010: p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense question more or less solved itself when the Swedish-Norwegian union was [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|peacefully dissolved in 1905]]. Koht later returned to the Peace Association to serve as a board member from 1910 to 1912.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

He became a member of [[Institut International de la Paix]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bio - Halvdan Koht |publisher=Nobelprize.org |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/bios/koht.html |accessdate=9 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a consultant for the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] from 1904 to 1913,&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; with the task of examining proposed candidates for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. From 1918 to 1942 he served on the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Norwegian Nobel Committee Since 1901 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |accessdate=9 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, he gave the Award Ceremony Speech for the Nobelists [[Jane Addams]] and [[Nicholas Murray Butler]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1931/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1931 – Presentation Speech]". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 5 Jan 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; but was absent in the decisive meeting in 1936 that awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to [[Carl von Ossietzky]]. He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aarsberetninger fra Det Norske Stortings Nobelkomité 1931–1945|author=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|publisher=[[Parliament of Norway]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = All Nobel Peace Prize Laureates | publisher = Nobel Foundation| url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/ |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koht's academic writing also encompassed the peace issue. His books on the subject include ''Histoire du mouvement de la paix en Norvège'' ("History of the Peace Movement in Norway", 1900) and ''Fredstanken i Noregs-sogo'' ("The Notion of Peace in the History of Norway", 1906).&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Post-political life==
Having stepped down from the exiled cabinet in 1941, Koht lived in the United States for the remainder of the war. There he continued his literary production;&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; however, the books ''Norway Neutral and Invaded'' (1941) and ''The Voice of Norway'' (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in Norway, and was released in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to Norway at the end of war.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Upon returning to Norway, Koht published three books on the war-time events in Norway: ''For fred og fridom i krigstid 1939–1940'', ''Frå skanse til skanse. Minne frå krigsmånadene i Noreg 1940'' and ''Norsk utanrikspolitikk fram til 9. april 1940. Synspunkt frå hendingstida'', all of which were released in 1947. These memoir-like books have been analysed as putting a self-apologetic message forth.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; His political career was effectively ended, but some of his ideas had prevailed. For instance, his analysis of the class situation in Norway became a part of the general social-democratic ideology of the post-war years.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

Despite not holding the professor chair any longer, Koht continued his academic writing; his principal work from the post-war epoch was the six-volume ''Kriseår i norsk historie''. The six volumes each describe a decisive moment in Norwegian history. The first volume, released in 1950, centers on "[[Vincens Lunge]] contra [[Henrik Krummedige]]". The second volume (1951) describes [[Olav Engelbriktsson]] and Norway's descent into dependency to Denmark in 1537. The third and fourth volumes, released in 1952 and 1955, are about medieval kings: [[Sverre I of Norway|Sverre I]] and [[Harald I of Norway|Harald I]]. The fifth volume (1956) focuses on "[[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margaret]] and the [[Kalmar Union]]". The sixth and final volume (1960) chronicles the years from 1657 to 1661, when Denmark (and thus Norway) transitioned into an [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Koht died on 12 December 1965 in Bærum.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was buried at [[Nordre gravlund]] in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/index.php?language=engelsk|title=Cemeteries in Norway|publisher=DIS-Norge|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two works by Koht have been released posthumously: the memoirs ''Minne frå unge år'' in 1968 and the diary ''Rikspolitisk dagbok 1933–1940'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=innleiing12&gt;Kjærheim, 1985: p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His son-in-law Sigmund Skard wrote a biography of him, ''Mennesket Halvdan Koht'' ("Halvdan Koht the Man") in 1982.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

The '''history of the world''', in common parlance, is the '''history of humanity''' (or '''human history'''), as determined from  [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[genetics]], [[linguistics]], and other disciplines; and, for periods since the [[history of writing|invention of writing]], from [[recorded history]] and from [[secondary sources]] and studies.

Humanity's written history was preceded by its [[prehistory]], beginning with the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic Era]] ("Early Stone Age"), followed by the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Era]] ("New Stone Age").  The Neolithic saw the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] begin, between 8000 and 5000 [[BCE]], in the [[Near East]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]]. During this period, humans began the systematic [[Agriculture|husbandry]] of plants and animals.{{sfn|Tudge|1998|pp=30–31}} As agriculture advanced, most humans transitioned from a [[nomad]]ic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in [[civilization|permanent settlements]].  The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in [[history of transport|transportation]].

Whether in prehistoric or historic times, people always needed to be near reliable sources of [[potable water]].  Settlements developed on [[river]] [[Bank (geography)|banks]] as early as 3000 BCE in [[Mesopotamia]],{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=13–15}} on the banks of [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]'s [[Nile|Nile River]],{{sfn|Baines|Malek|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Bard|2000|pp=64–65}} in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River valley]],{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2004|p=11}} and along China's rivers.{{sfn|Lee|2002|pp=15–42}}{{sfn|Teeple|2006|pp=14–20}}  As farming developed, [[Cereal|grain agriculture]] became more sophisticated and prompted a [[division of labour]] to store food between growing seasons. Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured [[upper class]] and the development of [[City|cities]], which provided the [[Cradle of civilization|foundation]] for [[civilization]]. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of [[accounting]] and [[writing]].

With civilizations flourishing, [[ancient history]] ("[[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]]," including the [[Classical Age]],{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=161}} up to about 500 CE{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=xii}}) saw the rise and fall of empires. [[Post-classical history]] (the "[[Middle Ages]]," c. 500–1500 CE {{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=xiv}}) witnessed the rise of [[Christianity]], the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (c. 750 CE – c. 1258 CE), and the early Italian [[Renaissance]] (from around 1300 CE). The mid-15th-century invention of modern [[printing]], employing [[movable type]],{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|p=63}} revolutionized [[communication]] and facilitated ever wider dissemination of [[information]], helping end the Middle Ages and ushering in the [[Scientific Revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2006|p=53}} The [[Early Modern Period]], sometimes referred to as the "European Age",{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=535}} from about 1500 to 1800,{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2008|p=595}} included the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].  By the 18th century, the accumulation of [[knowledge]] and [[technology]] had reached a [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] that brought about the [[Industrial Revolution]]{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=712–14}} and began the [[Modern history#Late modern period|Late Modern Period]], which started around 1800 and has continued through the present.{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=xix}}

This scheme of historical [[periodization]] (dividing history into Antiquity, Post-Classical, Early Modern, and Late Modern periods) was developed for, and applies best to, the history of the [[Old World]], particularly Europe and the Mediterranean. Outside this region, including [[ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]], historical timelines unfolded differently. However, by the 18th century, due to extensive [[International trade|world trade]] and [[colonization]], the histories of most civilizations had become [[Globalization|substantially intertwined]]. In the last quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of [[Population growth|population]], knowledge, technology, communications, commerce, weapons destructiveness, and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated, creating opportunities and perils that now confront the planet's human communities.{{sfn|Baten|2016|pp=1–13}}

===Rise of civilization===
The [[Neolithic Revolution]], beginning around 10,000 BCE, saw the development of agriculture, which fundamentally changed the human lifestyle. Farming developed around 10,000 BCE in the Middle East, around 7000 BCE in what is now China, about 6000 BCE in the [[Indus Valley]] and Europe, and about 4000 BCE in the Americas.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=36–37}} Cultivation of [[cereal crops]] and the [[domestication of animals]] occurred around 8500 BCE in the Middle East, where wheat and barley were the first crops and [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s were domesticated.{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=11}} In the Indus Valley, crops were cultivated by 6000 BCE, along with domesticated cattle. The Yellow River valley in China cultivated [[millet]] and other cereal crops by about 7000 BCE, but the Yangtze River valley domesticated [[rice]] earlier, by at least 8000 BCE. In the Americas, [[sunflower]]s were cultivated by about 4000 BCE, and [[corn]] and [[bean]]s were domesticated in Central America by 3500 BCE. [[Potato]]es were first cultivated in the Andes Mountains of South America, where the [[llama]] was also domesticated.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=36–37}}  [[Metal-working]], starting with [[copper]] around 6000 BCE, was first used for tools and ornaments. [[Gold]] soon followed, with its main use being for ornaments. The need for metal ores stimulated trade, as many of the areas of early human settlement were lacking in ores. [[Bronze]], an alloy of copper and [[tin]], is first known from about 2500 BCE, but did not become widely used until much later.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=42–43}}

[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] [[writing]], [[Mesopotamia]]]]
Though early "cities" appeared at [[Jericho]] and [[Catal Huyuk]] around 6000 BCE,{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=13}} the first civilizations did not emerge until around 3000 BCE in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013}} and [[Mesopotamia]].{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=53}} These cultures gave birth to the invention of the [[wheel]],{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|p=44}} [[mathematics]],{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=59}} bronze-working, [[sailing]] boats, the [[pottery wheel]], woven cloth, construction of monumental buildings,{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=16}} and [[writing]].{{sfn|McNeill|1999|p=18}} Writing developed independently and at different times in five areas of the world:{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}}  Egypt (c. 3200 BCE),{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}} India (c. 3200 BCE),{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|p=58}} Mesopotamia (c. 3000 BCE),{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=18–19}} China (c. 1600 BCE),{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=60–61}} and Mesoamerica (c. 600 BCE).{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}}

Farming permitted far denser populations, which in time organized into [[State (polity)|states]]. Agriculture also created food surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=34–35}} The development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first [[city|cities]]. These were centres of [[trade]], [[manufacturing]] and [[political power]].{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=15}} Cities established a [[symbiosis]] with their surrounding [[Rural area|countrysides]], absorbing agricultural products and providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection.

The development of cities was synonymous with the rise of [[civilization]].{{efn|The very word "[[civilization]]" comes from the [[Latin]] ''civilis'', meaning "civil," related to ''civis'' ("citizen") and ''civitas'' ("city" or "city-state").&lt;ref&gt;Larry E.

Writing facilitated the administration of cities, the expression of ideas, and the preservation of information.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=43–46}}

Entities such as the Sun, Moon, Earth, sky, and sea were often deified.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Shrine]]s developed, which evolved into [[temple]] establishments, complete with a complex hierarchy of [[Priest|priests and priestesses]] and other functionaries.

===Cradles of civilization===
{{Main article|Cradle of civilization|Bronze Age|Iron Age}}
[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]]]
The Bronze Age is part of the [[three-age system]] ([[Neolithic|Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]]) that for some parts of the world describes effectively the early history of [[civilization]]. During this era the most fertile areas of the world saw [[city-state]]s and the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] develop. These were concentrated in fertile river valleys: the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]],{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2004|pp=10–13}} and the [[Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s in China.

[[Sumer]], located in [[Mesopotamia]], is the first known complex civilization, developing the first [[city-state]]s in the 4th millennium BCE.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=54–55}} It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, [[cuneiform script]], appeared around 3000 BCE.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=53–54}} Cuneiform writing began as a system of [[pictography|pictographs]]. These pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=53–54}} Cuneiform texts were written on [[clay tablet]]s, on which [[symbol]]s were drawn with a blunt [[Phragmites|reed]] used as a [[stylus]].{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=62–63}} Writing made the administration of a large state far easier.

Transport was facilitated by waterways—by rivers and seas. The [[Mediterranean Sea]], at the juncture of three continents, fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas, and inventions. This era also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based cavalry and chariots, that allowed armies to move faster.

[[File:Knossos Bull-Leaping Fresco.jpg|thumb|left|185px|[[Bull-Leaping Fresco|Fresco]], [[Knossos]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]]]]

These developments led to the rise of territorial states and [[empire]]s. In Mesopotamia there prevailed a pattern of independent warring city-states and of a loose hegemony shifting from one city to another.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In Egypt, by contrast, first there was a dual division into [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] which was shortly followed by unification of all the valley around 3100 BCE, followed by permanent pacification.{{sfn|Bard|2000|pp=57–64}} In Crete the [[Minoan civilization]] had entered the Bronze Age by 2700 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=76–77}} Over the next millennia, other river valleys saw monarchical empires rise to power.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the 25th – 21st centuries BCE, the empires of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and [[Neo-Sumerian Empire|Sumer]] arose in [[Mesopotamia]].{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=36–37}}

Over the following millennia, civilizations developed across the world. [[Trade]] increasingly became a source of power as states with access to important resources or controlling important trade routes rose to dominance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  By 1400 BCE, [[Mycenaean Greece]] began to develop.{{sfn|Price|Thonemann|2010|p=22}} In India this era was the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]], which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and ended in the 6th century BCE.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=116–22}} From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapada]]s were established across the subcontinent.{{sfn|Singh|2008|pp=260–64}}

As complex civilizations arose in the Eastern Hemisphere, the indigenous societies in the [[Americas]] remained relatively simple and fragmented into diverse regional cultures. During the [[formative stage]] in [[Mesoamerica]] (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They included civilizations such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]]. They developed agriculture, growing [[maize]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[tomato]]es, and [[potato]]es, crops unique to the Americas, and creating distinct cultures and religions. These ancient indigenous societies would be greatly affected, for good and ill, by European contact during the early modern period.

===Axial Age===

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Buddha]]]]
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]

Beginning in the 8th century BCE, the "[[Axial Age]]" saw the development of a set of transformative philosophical and religious ideas, mostly independently, in many different places.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Chinese [[Confucianism]], Indian [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[monotheism]] are all claimed by some scholars to have developed in the 6th century BCE. ([[Karl Jaspers]]' Axial-Age theory also includes [[Persia]]n [[Zoroastrianism]], but other scholars dispute his timeline for Zoroastrianism.)  In the 5th century BCE, [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] made substantial advances in the development of [[ancient Greek philosophy]].

In the East, three schools of thought would dominate Chinese thinking well into the 20th century. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would become particularly dominant, looked for [[Politics|political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of [[tradition]].  Confucianism would later spread to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and toward [[Japan]].

In the West, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other philosophers,{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=63}} along with accumulated science, technology, and culture, diffused throughout [[Europe]], Egypt, the [[Middle East]], and Northwest India, starting in the 4th century BCE after the conquests of Alexander III of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedon]] ([[Alexander the Great]]).{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|pp=70–71}}

===Regional empires===
{{Main article|Civilization|Empire}}
The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects.
The great [[empire]]s depended on [[military]] [[annexation]] of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres. The relative peace that the empires brought encouraged [[international trade]], most notably the massive trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the maritime trade web in the Indian Ocean, and the [[Silk Road]]. In southern Europe, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] (and later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]), in an era known as "[[classical antiquity]]," established cultures whose practices, laws, and customs are considered the foundation of contemporary [[Western culture]].

There were a number of regional empires during this period. The kingdom of the [[Medes]] helped to destroy the [[Assyrian Empire]] in tandem with the nomadic [[Scythians]] and the [[Babylonians]]. [[Nineveh]], the capital of Assyria, was sacked by the Medes in 612 BCE.{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|p=110}} The [[Median Empire]] gave way to successive [[History of Iran|Iranian]] empires, including the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550–330 BCE) and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224–651 CE).

Several empires began in modern-day Greece. First was the [[Delian League]] (from 477 BCE){{sfn|Martin|2000|pp=106–07}} and the succeeding [[Athenian Empire]] (454–404 BCE), centred in present-day [[Greece]]. Later, [[Alexander the Great]] (356–323 BCE), of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], founded an empire of conquest, extending from present-day Greece to present-day India.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/alexander_the_great.shtml|title=Alexander the Great|last=|first=|date=|website=Historic Figures|publisher=BBC|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire divided shortly after his death, but the influence of his [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] successors made for an extended [[Hellenistic period]] (323–31 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/haht/hd_haht.htm|title=Art of the Hellenistic Age and the Hellenistic Tradition|last=Hemingway|first=Collette|last2=Hemingway|first2=Seán|date=April 2007|website=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the region.

In Asia, the [[Maurya Empire]] (322–185 BCE) existed in present-day [[History of India|India]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of India |last=Kulke |first=Hermann |last2=Rothermund |first2=Dietmar |publisher=Routledge |year=2004| isbn=978-0-415-32920-0 |edition=4th| location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 3rd century BCE, most of [[South Asia]] was united to the Maurya Empire by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and flourished under [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]]. From the 3rd century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's Golden Age. From the 4th to 6th centuries, northern India was ruled by the [[Gupta Empire]]. In southern India, three prominent [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] kingdoms emerged: the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of South India|last=Nilakanta Sastri |first=K.

The ensuing stability contributed to heralding in the golden age of [[Hindu]] culture in the 4th and 5th centuries.

In Europe, the [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]], centered in present-day [[Italy]], began in the 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=106–07}} In the 3rd century BCE the [[Roman Republic]] began expanding its territory through conquest and alliances.{{sfn|Kelly|2007|pp=4–6}} By the time of [[Augustus]] (63 BCE – 14 CE), the first Roman Emperor, Rome had already established dominion over most of the Mediterranean. The empire would continue to grow, controlling much of the land from [[England]] to [[Mesopotamia]], reaching its greatest extent under the emperor [[Trajan]] (died 117 CE). In the 3rd century CE, the empire split into western and eastern regions, with (usually) separate emperors. The Western empire would [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]], in 476 CE, to German influence under [[Odoacer]]. The eastern empire, now known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], with its capital at [[Constantinople]], would continue for another thousand years, until Constantinople was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453.

In China, the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE), the first imperial dynasty of China, was followed by the [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]] (206 BCE – 220 CE). The Han Dynasty was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay at the other end of the [[Silk Road]]. Han China developed advanced cartography, shipbuilding, and navigation. The Chinese invented [[blast furnace]]s, and created finely tuned copper instruments. As with other empires during the Classical Period, Han China advanced significantly in the areas of government, education, mathematics, astronomy, technology, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Remaking China's Public Philosophy for the Twenty-First Century |last=Zhou |first=Jinghao |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-275-97882-2 |location=Westport |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], centred in present-day Ethiopia, established itself by the 1st century CE as a major trading empire, dominating its neighbours in South [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and controlling the [[Red Sea]] trade. It minted its own currency and carved enormous monolithic [[stele]]s such as the [[Obelisk of Axum]] to mark their emperors' graves.

Successful regional empires were also established in the [[Americas]], arising from cultures established as early as 2500 BCE.{{sfn|Fagan|2005|pp=390, 396}} In [[History of Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]], vast pre-Columbian societies were built, the most notable being the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec Empire]] (700 BCE – 1521 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Zapotec civilization has its beginnings in 700 BCE: see {{Cite book|title=Zapotec Civilization: How Urban Society Evolved in Mexico's Oaxaca Valley|last=Flannery|first=Kent V.|last2=Marcus|first2=Joyce|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=1996|isbn=978-0-500-05078-1|location=New York|page=146|quote=|via=}} Zapotec civilization ended in 1521 according to the five archaeological stages presented in {{Cite book|title=The Zapotecs: Princes, Priests, and Peasants|last=Whitecotton|first=Joseph W.|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1977|isbn=|location=Norman|page= 26, LI.1–3|nopp=y|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Maya civilization]], which reached its highest state of development during the Mesoamerican Classic period (c. 250–900 CE),{{sfn|Coe|2011|p=91}} but continued throughout the Post-Classic period until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century CE. Maya civilization arose as the [[Olmec]] [[mother culture]] gradually declined. The great Mayan [[city-state]]s slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and surrounding areas. The later empire of the [[Aztecs]] was built on neighbouring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples such as the [[Toltec]]s.

Some areas experienced slow but steady technological advances, with important developments such as the [[stirrup]] and [[moldboard plow|moldboard plough]] arriving every few centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress. Most important, perhaps, was the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] area during the [[Hellenistic period]], when hundreds of technologies were invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Camp|first1=John McK.|last2=Dinsmoor|first2=William B.|title=Ancient Athenian building methods|date=1984|publisher=American School of Classical Studies at Athens|series=Excavations of the Athenian Agora|volume=21|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-87661-626-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such periods were followed by periods of technological decay, as during the [[Roman Empire]]'s decline and [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] and the ensuing [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period.

===Declines, falls, and resurgence===
The ancient empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy. These costs fell most heavily on the [[peasant]]ry, while land-owning [[magnate]]s increasingly evaded centralized control and its costs. [[Barbarian]] pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution. [[China]]'s [[Han dynasty]] fell into [[civil war]] in 220 CE, beginning the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, while its [[Roman Empire|Roman]] counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The great empires of Eurasia were all located on temperate and subtropical coastal plains. From the [[Central Asia]]n steppes, horse-based nomads, mainly Mongols and Turks, dominated a large part of the continent. The development of the [[stirrup]] and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations.

==Post-classical history==
{{Main article|Post-classical history}}
[[File:Sankore Moske Timboektoe.JPG|thumb|[[University of Timbuktu]], [[Mali]]]]
The Post-classical Era, though deriving its name from the Eurocentric era of "[[Classical antiquity]]", refers to a broader geographic sweep. The era is commonly dated from the 5th-century [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], which fragmented into many separate kingdoms, some of which would later be confederated under the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  The Eastern Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]] survived until late in the Post-classical, or Medieval, period.  The Post-classical period also encompasses the [[Early Muslim conquests]], the subsequent [[Islamic Golden Age]], and the commencement and expansion of the [[Arab slave trade]], followed by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]] in the Middle East and Central Asia,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the founding around 1280 of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Shaw|1976|p=13}} [[South Asia]] saw a series of [[middle kingdoms of India]], followed by the establishment of [[Islamic empires in India]].

In western Africa, the [[Mali Empire]] and the [[Songhai Empire]] developed.  On the southeast coast of Africa, Arabic ports were established where [[gold]], [[Spice trade|spices]], and other commodities were traded. This allowed Africa to join the [[Southeast Asia]] trading system, bringing it contact with Asia; this, along with Muslim culture, resulted in the [[Swahili culture]]. [[China]] experienced the successive [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], and early [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties. Middle Eastern trade routes along the Indian Ocean, and the [[Silk Road]] through the Gobi Desert, provided limited economic and cultural contact between Asian and European civilizations. During the same period, civilizations in the [[Americas]], such as the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Aztecs]], reached their zenith; all would be compromised by, then conquered after, contact with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] at the beginning of the [[Modern history|Modern period]].

===Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia===
{{Main article|History of the Middle East|History of North Africa|History of Central Asia|Islamic Golden Age}}
Prior to the advent of [[Islam]] in the 7th century, the [[Middle East]] was dominated by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Persian [[Sasanian Empire]], which frequently fought each other for control of several disputed regions. This was also a cultural battle, with the Byzantine Hellenistic and Christian culture competing against the Persian Iranian traditions and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]]. The formation of the [[History of Islam|Islamic religion]] created a new contender that quickly surpassed both of these empires. Islam greatly affected the [[political history|political]], [[economic history|economic]], and [[military history]] of the [[Old World]], especially the Middle East.

[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, vue d'ensemble.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], founded 670 CE]]

From their centre on the Arabian Peninsula, Muslims began their expansion during the early Postclassical Era. By 750 CE, they came to conquer most of the Near East, North Africa, and parts of Europe, ushering in an era of learning, science, and invention known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The knowledge and skills of the ancient Near East, Greece, and Persia were preserved in the Postclassical Era by Muslims, who also added new and important innovations from outside, such as the manufacture of paper from China and decimal positional numbering from India.

Much of this learning and development can be linked to geography. Even prior to Islam's presence, the city of [[Mecca]] had served as a centre of trade in Arabia, and the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] himself was a merchant. With the new Islamic tradition of the ''[[Hajj]]'', the pilgrimage to Mecca, the city became even more a centre for exchanging goods and ideas. The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous. As a result, Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy, in contrast to the Europeans, Indians, and Chinese, who based their societies on an agricultural landholding nobility. Merchants brought goods and their Islamic faith to [[Islam in China|China]], [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|India]], [[Islam in Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]], and the kingdoms of western [[Islam in Africa|Africa]], and returned with new discoveries and inventions.
[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Crusades|Crusader]] ''[[Krak des Chevaliers]]'', [[Syria]]]]

Motivated by religion and dreams of conquest, European kings launched a number of [[Crusades]] to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the [[Holy Land]]. The Crusades were ultimately unsuccessful and served more to weaken the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially with the 1204 [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]]. The Byzantine Empire began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the Ottoman Turks. Arab domination of the region ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders,  the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region but were eventually eclipsed by the Turks{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and the founding of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] around 1280.{{sfn|Shaw|1976|p=13}}

[[North Africa]] saw the rise of polities formed by the [[Berbers]], such as the [[Marinid dynasty]] in [[Morocco]], the [[Zayyanid dynasty]] in [[Algeria]], and the [[Hafsid dynasty]] in [[Tunisia]]. The region will later be called the [[Barbary Coast]] and will host pirates and privateers who will use several North African ports for their raids against the coastal towns of several European countries in search of slaves to be sold in North African markets as part of the [[Barbary slave trade]].

Starting with the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618), the Chinese began expanding into eastern [[Central Asia]], and confronted [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in Central Asia.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=113}}{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=149–52, 257–64}} Originally the relationship was largely cooperative, but in 630 the [[Tang dynasty]] began an offensive against the Turks,{{sfn|Xue|1992|pp=226–27}} capturing areas of the Mongolian Ordos Desert. In the 8th century, Islam began to penetrate the region and soon became the sole faith of most of the population, though Buddhism remained strong in the east.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The desert nomads of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] could militarily match the nomads of the steppe, and the early [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] gained control over parts of Central Asia.

The [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]] were the most powerful of the nomad groups in the 6th and 7th centuries, and controlled much of the region. In the 9th through 13th centuries the region was divided among several powerful states, including the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid dynasty]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the [[Seljuq dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of the Seljuq Turks from the Jami' al-Tawarikh: An Ilkahnid Adaptation of the Saljuq-nama of Zahir al-Din Nishapuri|last=Nishapuri|first=Zahir al-Din|publisher=C.

The largest empire to rise out of Central Asia developed when [[Genghis Khan]] united the tribes of Mongolia. The [[Mongol Empire]] spread to comprise all of Central Asia and China as well as large parts of Russia and the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} After Genghis Khan died in 1227,{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=153}} most of Central Asia continued to be dominated by a successor state, [[Chagatai Khanate]]. In 1369, [[Timur]], a Turkic leader in the Mongol military tradition, conquered most of the region and founded the [[Timurid Empire]]. Timur's large empire collapsed soon after his death, however. The region then became divided into a series of smaller khanates that were created by the [[Uzbeks]]. These included the [[Khanate of Khiva]], the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], and the [[Khanate of Kokand]], all of whose capitals are located in present-day [[Uzbekistan]].

===Europe===
{{main article|History of Europe|Middle Ages}}
[[Europe]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]] was characterized by depopulation, deurbanization, and [[barbarian]] invasion, all of which had begun in [[Late Antiquity]]. The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East, once part of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], became part of the [[Caliphate]] after conquest by [[Muhammad]]'s successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, most of the new kingdoms incorporated as many of the existing Roman institutions as they could. Christianity expanded in western Europe, and monasteries were founded. In the 7th and 8th centuries the [[Franks]], under the [[Carolingian dynasty]], established an empire covering much of western Europe;{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} it lasted until the 9th century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders—the [[Vikings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vikings|last=Roesdahl|first=Else|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=978-0-14-025282-8|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungarians#Entering the Carpathian Basin (c. 895)|Magyars]], and [[Saracen]]s.

During the [[High Middle Ages]], which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. [[Manorialism]]—the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles—and [[feudalism]]—a political structure whereby [[knight]]s and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and [[manor]]s—were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages. Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. The [[Crusades]], first preached in 1095, were an attempt by western Christians from nations such as the [[Kingdom of England]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to regain control of the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslim]]s and succeeded for long enough to establish some Christian states in the Near East. Italian merchants imported [[Armenians]], [[Balts]], [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Slavs]] to work as household slaves and in processing [[sugar]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Intellectual life was marked by [[scholasticism]] and the founding of universities, while the building of [[Gothic cathedrals]] was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] were marked by difficulties and calamities. Famine, plague, and war devastated the population of western Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The [[Black Death]] alone killed approximately 75 to 200 million people between 1347 and 1350.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm|title=Black death 'discriminated' between victims|last=Dunham|first=Will|date=January 29, 2008|work=ABC Science|access-date=November 24, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1576875.stm|title=De-coding the Black Death|last=|first=|date=October 3, 2001|work=BBC|access-date=November 24, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history.

The Middle Ages witnessed the first sustained [[urbanization]] of northern and western Europe. Many modern European states owe their origins to events unfolding in the Middle Ages; present European political boundaries are, in many regards, the result of military and dynastic events during this tumultuous period.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The Middle Ages lasted until the beginning of the [[Early modern period]] in the 16th century,{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2008|p=595}} marked by the rise of [[nation state]]s,{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=280}} the division of Western [[Christianity]] in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]],{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=319–23}} the rise of [[humanism]] in the [[Italian Renaissance]],{{sfn|McNeill|1999|pp=267–68}} and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the [[Columbian Exchange]].

In [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], in 1386, the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (the latter including territories of modern [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]), facing depredations by the [[Teutonic Knights]] and later also threats from [[Grand Duchy of Muscovy|Muscovy]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]], formed a [[personal union]] through the marriage of Poland's Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] to [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Lithuanian Grand Duke]] Jogaila, who became King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland.  For the next four centuries, until the 18th-century [[Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by [[Prussia]], [[Russia]], and [[Austria]], the two polities conducted a federated [[condominium]], long Europe's largest state, which welcomed diverse ethnicities and religions, including most of the world's [[Jews]], furthered scientific thought (e.g., [[Copernicus]]'s [[heliocentric theory]]), and—in a last-ditch effort to preserve their [[sovereignty]]—adopted the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], the world's second modern written constitution after the [[U.S. Constitution]] that went into effect in 1789.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
{{main article|History of Africa}}
[[File:WLA metmuseum Head of an Oba 16th century.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Brass]] "[[Benin bronze]]", [[Nigeria]]]]
Medieval [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was home to many different civilizations. The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] declined in the 7th century as Islam cut it off from its Christian allies and its people moved further into the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] for protection. They eventually gave way to the [[Zagwe dynasty]] who are famed for their rock cut architecture at [[Lalibela]]. The Zagwe would then fall to the [[Solomonic dynasty]] who claimed descent from the Aksumite emperors{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and would rule the country well into the 20th century. In the West African [[Sahel]] region, many Islamic empires rose, such as the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]], the [[Songhai Empire]], and the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]]. They controlled the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, salt and slaves.

South of the Sahel, civilizations rose in the coastal forests where horses and camels could not survive.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These include the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city of [[Ife]], noted for its art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blier |first=Suzanne Preston |year=2012 |title=Art in Ancient Ife, Birthplace of the Yoruba |url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/blier/files/blier.pdf |journal=African Arts |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=70–85 |doi=10.1162/afar_a_00029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oyo Empire]], the [[Benin Empire]] of the [[Edo people]] centred in [[Benin City]], the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] [[Kingdom of Nri]] which produced advanced bronze art at [[Igbo-Ukwu]], and the [[Akan people|Akan]] who are noted for their intricate architecture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Central Africa]] saw the birth of several states, including the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. In what is now modern [[Southern Africa]], native Africans created various kingdoms such as the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. They flourished through trade with the [[Swahili people]] on the East African coast. They built large defensive stone structures without mortar such as [[Great Zimbabwe]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Khami]], capital of [[Kingdom of Butua]], and [[Danangombe]] (Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Swahili people themselves were the inhabitants of the East African coast from Kenya to Mozambique who traded extensively with Asians and Arabs, who introduced them to Islam. They built many port cities such as [[Mombasa]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], which were known to Chinese sailors under [[Zheng He]] and Islamic geographers.

In northern [[History of India|India]], after the fall (550 CE) of the [[Gupta Empire]], the region was divided into a complex and fluid network of smaller kingly states.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Early Muslim incursions began in the west in 712 CE, when the Arab [[Umayyad Caliphate]] annexed much of present-day [[Pakistan]]. Arab military advance was largely halted at that point, but Islam still spread in India, largely due to the influence of Arab merchants along the western coast. The [[Tripartite Struggle]] for control of northern India took place in the ninth century. The struggle was between the [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Pratihara Empire]], the [[Pala Empire]] and the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta Empire]]. Some of the important states that emerged in India at this time included the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. Post-classical dynasties in South India included those of the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], the [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the Islamic [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysores]].

{{main| History of Southeast Asia}}
The beginning of the Middle Ages in [[Southeast Asia]] saw the fall (550 CE) of the [[Funan|Kingdom of Funan]] to the [[Chenla|Chenla Empire]], which was then replaced by the [[Khmer Empire]] (802 CE). The Khmer's capital city [[Angkor]] was the largest city in the world prior to the industrial age and contained over a thousand temples, the most famous being [[Angkor Wat]]. The [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] (1238 CE) and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (1351 CE) kingdoms were major powers of the [[Thai people]], who were influenced by the Khmer. Starting in the 9th century, the [[Pagan Kingdom]] rose to prominence in modern [[Myanmar]]. Other notable kingdoms of the period include the [[Srivijaya|Srivijayan Empire]] and the [[Lavo Kingdom]] (both coming into prominence in the 7th century), the [[Champa]] and the [[Hariphunchai]] (both about 750), the [[Dai Viet]] (968), [[Lan Na]] (13th century), [[Majapahit]] (1293), [[Lan Xang]] (1354), and the [[Kingdom of Ava]] (1364). [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] formed tribal alliances such as the [[Kingdom of Middag]]. It was also during this period that Islam spread to present-day Indonesia (beginning in the 13th century), and the [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malay states]] began to emerge including the [[Malacca Sultanate]], the [[Bruneian Empire]] and the [[Rajahnate of Maynila]].

{{main| History of Oceania}}
In the region of [[Oceania]], the [[Tuʻi Tonga Empire]] was founded in the 10th century CE and expanded between 1200 and 1500. Tongan culture, language, and hegemony spread widely throughout Eastern [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]] and Central [[Polynesia]] during this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirch|first1=Patrick Vinton|last2=Green|first2=Roger C.|title=Hawaiki, ancestral Polynesia: an essay in historical anthropology|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University press|isbn=978-0-521-78879-3|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WRapfjQ_iTEC&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing East 'Uvea, Rotuma, Futuna, Samoa and Niue, as well as specific islands / parts of Micronesia (Kiribati, Pohnpei and miscellaneous outliers), Vanuatu and New Caledonia (specifically, the [[Loyalty Islands]], with the main island being predominantly populated by the Melanesian [[Kanak people]] and their cultures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geraghty|first1=Paul|chapter=Linguistic evidence for the Tongan empire|editor1-last=Dutton|editor1-first=Tom|title=Language contact and change in the Austronesian world|date=1994|publisher=Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-11-012786-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOlI8czLshIC&amp;pg=PA233|series=Trends in linguistics: Studies and monographs|volume=77|pages=236–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, a powerful [[thalassocracy]] appeared in Eastern Polynesia centred around the [[Society Islands]], specifically on the sacred [[Taputapuatea marae]], which drew in Eastern Polynesian colonists from places as far away as Hawaii, New Zealand ([[Aotearoa]]), and the Tuamotu Islands for political, spiritual and economic reasons, until the unexplained collapse of regular long-distance voyaging in the Eastern Pacific a few centuries before Europeans began exploring the area. Indigenous written records from this period are virtually non-existent, as it seems that all Pacific Islanders, with the possible exception of the enigmatic [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] and their currently undecipherable [[Rongorongo]] script, had no writing systems of any kind until after their introduction by European colonists; however, some indigenous prehistories can be estimated and academically reconstructed through careful, judicious analysis of native oral traditions, colonial ethnography, archaeology, physical anthropology and linguistics research.

In [[North America]], this period saw the rise of the [[Mississippian culture]] in the modern-day [[United States]] c. 800 CE, marked by the extensive 12th-century urban complex at [[Cahokia]]. The [[Ancestral Puebloans]] and their predecessors (9th – 13th centuries) built extensive permanent settlements, including stone structures that would remain the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century.{{sfn|Fagan|2005|p=35}} In [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Teotihuacan]] civilization fell and the [[Classic Maya collapse]] occurred. The [[Aztec Empire]] came to dominate much of Mesoamerica in the 14th and 15th centuries. In [[South America]], the 14th and 15th centuries saw the rise of the Inca. The [[Inca Empire]] of Tawantinsuyu, with its capital at [[Cusco]], spanned the entire Andes Mountain Range, making it the most extensive Pre-Columbian civilization. The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent [[Inca road system|road system]] and unrivaled [[masonry]].

==Modern history==
{{main article|Modern history}}
[[Modern history]] (the "modern period," the "modern era," "modern times") refers to the history of the period following the Middle Ages, spanning from about 1500 to the present day. In contrast, "[[Contemporary history]]" is history that covers events from around 1945 to the present day.

===Early modern period===
{{Main article|Early modern period}}
"[[Early modern period]]"{{efn|"Early Modern," historically speaking, refers to Western European history from 1501 (after the widely accepted end of the [[Late Middle Ages]]; the transition period was the 15th century) to either 1750 or c. 1790–1800, by whichever [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is favored by a school of scholars defining the period—which, in many cases of [[periodization]], differs as well within a discipline such as art, philosophy or history.}} is a term used by historians to refer to the period between the [[Middle Ages]] ([[Post-classical history]]) and the [[Industrial Revolution]]—roughly 1500 to 1800.{{sfn|Bentley|Ziegler|2008|p=595}} The Early Modern period is characterized by the rise of science, and by increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[Secularization|secularized]] civic [[politics]], and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise, initially in northern [[Italy|Italian]] [[republic]]s such as [[Genoa]]. The Early Modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory. As such, the Early Modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom, and the power of the [[Catholic Church]]. The period includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Age of Discovery]], European [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]], the peak of European [[witch-hunt]]ing, the [[Scientific revolution]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{efn|The Age of Enlightenment has also been referred to as the [[Age of Reason]].

The use of the term here includes both Ages under a single all-inclusive time-frame.}}

====Renaissance====
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]]]]
{{main article|Renaissance}}
[[Europe]]'s [[Renaissance]], meaning "rebirth," referring to the rebirth of classical culture, beginning in the 14th century and extending into the 16th, consisted of the rediscovery of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] world's scientific contributions, and of the [[Economy|economic]] and social rise of Europe. The Renaissance also engendered a culture of [[curiosity|inquisitiveness]] which ultimately led to [[Humanism]]{{sfn|Hart-Davis|2012|pp=250–53}} and the [[Scientific Revolution]].{{sfn|Roberts|Westad|2013|pp=683–85}} Although it saw social and political upheaval and revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, the Renaissance is perhaps known best for its [[art]]istic developments{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]."

====European expansion====
{{Further information|History of Europe|Age of Discovery|Colonialism|16th century|17th century}}
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap.jpeg|thumb|left|185px|[[Abraham Ortelius#Map publisher|1570 world map]], with Europeans' discoveries]]
During this period, European powers came to dominate most of the world. Although the most developed regions of European classical civilization were more urbanized than any other region of the world, European civilization had undergone a lengthy period of gradual decline and collapse. During the Early Modern Period, Europe was able to regain its dominance; historians still debate the causes.

Europe's success in this period stands in contrast to other regions. For example, one of the most advanced civilizations of the Middle Ages was China. It had developed an advanced [[monetary economy]] by 1000 CE. China had a free [[peasant]]ry who were no longer subsistence farmers, and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market. According to [[Adam Smith]], writing in the 18th century, China had long been one of the richest, most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, most urbanized, and most prosperous countries in the world. It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in [[cast iron]] production, piston bellows, [[suspension bridge]] construction, [[printing]], and the [[compass]]. However, it seemed to have long since stopped progressing. [[Marco Polo]], who visited China in the 13th century, describes its cultivation, industry, and populousness almost in the same terms as travelers would in the 18th century.
[[File:Gutenburg bible.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gutenberg Bible]], produced using [[movable type]] c. 1450]]
One theory of Europe's rise holds that Europe's [[geography]] played an important role in its success. The Middle East, India and China are all ringed by mountains and oceans but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the [[Pyrenees]], [[Alps]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several seas. This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the Eurasian continent and, as they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]] was ended by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol]] [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic [[invasion]]s, and Russia spent a couple of centuries under the [[Tatar invasions|Mongol-Tatar]] yoke. Central and western Europe, logistically more distant from the Central Asian heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats.

Geography contributed to important [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] differences. For most of their histories, China, India, and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 1600 the [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled almost all the Middle East,{{sfn|Imber|2002|p=66}} the [[Ming dynasty]] ruled China,{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006}}{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|pp=376–77}} and the [[Mughal Empire]] held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states. Pan-European empires, with the notable exception of the [[Roman Empire]], tended to collapse soon after they arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe was the Mediterranean Sea, which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the exchange of goods, people, ideas and inventions.

Nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their [[Natural environment|environments]]. Productivity remained low, and [[Climate|climatic]] changes easily instigated [[boom-and-bust]] [[Business cycle|cycles]] that brought about civilizations' rise and fall. By about 1500, however, there was a qualitative change in world history. [[Technology|Technological]] advance and the [[wealth]] generated by [[trade]] gradually brought about a widening of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Miller|editor1-first=Edward|editor2-last=Postan|editor2-first=Cynthia|editor3-last=Postan|editor3-first=M. M.|title=The Cambridge economic history of Europe: Volume 2, Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-08709-4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have also argued that Europe's institutions allowed it to expand, that [[property right]]s and [[free market|free-market]] economics were stronger than elsewhere due to an ideal of [[Political freedom|freedom]] peculiar to Europe. In recent years, however, scholars such as [[Kenneth Pomeranz]] have challenged this view. Europe's maritime expansion unsurprisingly—given the continent's geography—was largely the work of its Atlantic states: Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands. Initially the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s were the predominant conquerors and sources of influence, and their union resulted in the [[Iberian Union]], the first [[global empire]] on which the "[[The empire on which the sun never sets|sun never set]]". Soon the more northern English, French and Dutch began to dominate the Atlantic. In a series of wars fought in the 17th and 18th centuries, culminating with the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Britain emerged as the new world power.

====Regional developments====
[[File:Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom) - the epitome of Byzantine architecture - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), [[Turkey]]]]
[[Persia]] came under the rule of the [[Safavid Empire]] in 1501, succeeded by the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid Empire]] in 1736, and the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Empire]] in 1796. Areas to the north and east were held by [[Uzbeks]] and [[Pashtuns]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]], after taking [[Constantinople]] in 1453, quickly gained control of the Middle East, the [[Balkans]], and most of North Africa.

In [[History of Africa|Africa]], this period saw a decline in many civilizations and an advancement in others. The [[Swahili Coast]] declined after coming under Portuguese (and later [[History of Oman|Omani]]) control. In west Africa, the [[Songhai Empire]] fell to the Moroccans in 1591 when they invaded with guns. The South African [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] gave way to smaller kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]], [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua]], and [[Rozwi Empire|Rozwi]]. [[Ethiopia]] suffered from the 1531 invasion from neighbouring Muslim [[Adal Sultanate]], and in 1769 entered the [[Zemene Mesafint]] (Age of Princes) during which the Emperor became a figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords, though the royal line later would recover under Emperor [[Tewodros II]]. The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, succeeded by the [[Sultanate of the Geledi|Geledi Sultanate]]. Other civilizations in Africa advanced during this period. The [[Oyo Empire]] experienced its golden age, as did the [[Benin Empire]]. The [[Ashanti Empire]] rose to power in what is modern day [[Ghana]] in 1670. The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] also thrived during this period. European [[exploration of Africa]] reached its zenith at this time.
[[File:Chemin de ronde muraille long.JPG|thumb|[[Ming Dynasty]] section, [[Great Wall of China]]]]
In the Far East, the [[History of China|Chinese]] [[Ming Dynasty]] gave way (1644) to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], the last Chinese imperial dynasty, which would rule until 1912. [[History of Japan|Japan]] experienced its [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1568–1603), followed by the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). The [[History of Korea|Korean]] [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910) ruled throughout this period, successfully repelling 16th- and 17th-century invasions from Japan and China. Japan and China were significantly affected during this period by expanded maritime trade with Europe, particularly the Portuguese in Japan. During the Edo period, Japan would pursue isolationist policies, to eliminate foreign influences.
[[File:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Taj Mahal]], [[Mughal Empire]], [[India]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Deccan sultanates]] would give way, beginning in the 16th century, to the [[Mughal Empire]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Starting in the northwest, the Mughal Empire would by the late 17th century come to rule the entire subcontinent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=La l|first1=Vinay |url=https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/mughals.html |title=The Mughal Empire |work=Manas: India and its Neighbors |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |date=2001 |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for the southernmost Indian provinces, which would remain independent. Against the Muslim Mughal Empire, the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] was founded on the west coast in 1674, gradually gaining territory—a majority of present-day India—from the Mughals over several decades, particularly in the [[Mughal–Maratha Wars]] (1681–1701). The Maratha Empire would in 1818 fall under the control of the British [[East India Company]], with all former Maratha and Mughal authority devolving in 1858 to the [[British Raj]].

In 1511 the Portuguese overthrew the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in present-day Malaysia and Indonesian [[Sumatra]]. The Portuguese held this important trading territory (and the valuable associated navigational strait) until overthrown by the Dutch in 1641. The [[Johor Sultanate]], centred on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region. [[Western imperialism in Asia|European colonization]] expanded with the Dutch in the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]], and the Spanish in the [[History of the Philippines|Philippines]]. Into the 19th century, European expansion would affect the whole of Southeast Asia, with the British in [[History of Myanmar|Myanmar]] and [[History of Malaysia|Malaysia]], and the establishment of [[French Indochina]]. Only [[History of Thailand|Thailand]] would successfully resist colonization.

The Pacific islands of [[History of Oceania|Oceania]] would also be affected by European contact, starting with the circumnavigational voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who landed on the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and other islands in 1521. Also notable were the voyages (1642–44) of [[Abel Tasman]] to present-day Australia, New Zealand and nearby islands, and the voyages (1768–1779) of Captain [[James Cook]], who made the first recorded European contact with [[History of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. Britain would found its first colony on Australia in 1788.
[[File:Russian chapel at Fort Ross (2016).jpg|thumb|left|Russian chapel, [[Fort Ross, California]], [[U.S.]]]]
In the [[History of the Americas|Americas]], the [[European colonization of the Americas|western European powers]] vigorously colonized the newly discovered continents, largely displacing the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations]], and destroying the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca]]. Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France all made extensive territorial claims, and undertook large-scale settlement, including the importation of large numbers of African [[Slavery in the Americas|slaves]]. Portugal claimed [[History of Brazil|Brazil]]. Spain claimed the rest of [[History of South America|South America]], [[Mesoamerica]], and southern [[History of North America|North America]]. Britain colonized the east coast of North America, and France colonized the central region of North America. Russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of North America, with a first colony in present-day [[History of Alaska|Alaska]] in 1784, and the outpost of [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] in present-day [[History of California|California]] in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ohp|5|Fort Ross|2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1762, in the midst of the [[Seven Years' War]], France secretly ceded most of its North American claims to Spain in the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. Thirteen of the British colonies declared independence as the [[History of the United States|United States of America]] in 1776, ratified by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] won France’s claims back from Spain in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1800, but sold them to the United States in 1803 as the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

In [[History of Russia|Russia]], [[Ivan the Terrible]] was crowned (1547) the first [[Tsar]] of Russia, and by annexing the Turkic Khanates in the east, transformed Russia into a regional power. The countries of western Europe, while expanding prodigiously through technological advancement and colonial conquest, competed with each other economically and militarily in a state of almost constant [[List of wars 1500–1799|war]]. Often the wars had a [[European wars of religion|religious dimension]], either Catholic versus Protestant, or (primarily in eastern Europe) Christian versus Muslim. Wars of particular note include the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]], and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Napoleon came to power in France in 1799, an event foreshadowing the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.

[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Watt|Watt]]'s [[steam engine]] powered the [[Industrial Revolution]].]]
The [[Scientific Revolution]] changed humanity's understanding of the world and led to the [[Industrial Revolution]], a major transformation of the world's economies. The [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 17th century had had little immediate effect on industrial [[technology]]; only in the second half of the 18th century did scientific advances begin to be applied substantially to practical [[invention]]. The Industrial Revolution began in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and used new modes of production—the [[factory]], [[mass production]], and [[mechanization]]—to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] also led to the beginnings of modern [[democracy]] in the late-18th century [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s. [[Democracy]] and [[republicanism]] would grow to have a profound effect on world events and on [[quality of life]].
[[File:World 1898 empires colonies territory.png|thumb|260px|[[Empire]]s, 1898]]
After Europeans had achieved influence and control over the Americas, [[Imperialism|imperial]] activities turned to the lands of Asia and Oceania. In the 19th century the European states had social and technological advantage over Eastern lands.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Britain gained control of the Indian subcontinent, Egypt and the [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malay Peninsula]]; the [[Cochinchina Campaign|French took Indochina]]; while the Dutch cemented their control over the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The British also colonized Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with large numbers of British colonists emigrating to these colonies. Russia colonized large pre-agricultural areas of Siberia. In the late 19th century, the European powers [[Scramble for Africa|divided the remaining areas of Africa]]. Within Europe, economic and military challenges created a system of [[nation state]]s, and ethno-linguistic groupings began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for cultural and political autonomy. This [[nationalism]] would become important to peoples across the world in the 20th century.

During the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], the world economy became reliant on [[coal]] as a fuel, as new methods of [[transport]], such as [[railways]] and [[steamship]]s, effectively shrank the world. Meanwhile, industrial [[pollution]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] damage, present since the discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization, accelerated drastically.

The advantages that Europe had developed by the mid-18th century were two: an [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Neal|title=John Locke and agrarian capitalism|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-05046-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KIpqQ9QHBkC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wealth generated by the Atlantic trade (including the [[African slave trade]]). By the late 16th century, [[silver]] from the Americas accounted for the Spanish empire's wealth.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The profits of the [[slave trade]] and of [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations amounted to 5% of the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|British economy]] at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mintz |first1=S. |last2=McNeil |first2=S. |title=Was slavery the engine of economic growth? |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/topic_display.cfm?tcid=104 |website=Digital History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226000000/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some historians conclude that, in 1750, [[Workforce productivity|labour productivity]] in the most developed regions of China was still on a par with that of Europe's Atlantic economy,&lt;ref&gt;see the NBER Publications by Carol H.

The 20th century opened with Europe at an apex of wealth and power, and with much of the world under its direct [[Colonialism|colonial]] control or its indirect domination. Much of the rest of the world was influenced by heavily Europeanized nations: the United States and Japan. As the century unfolded, however, the global system dominated by rival powers was subjected to severe strains, and ultimately seemed to yield to a more fluid structure of independent nations organized on Western models.

This transformation was [[catalysis|catalysed]] by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation. [[World War I]] destroyed many of Europe's empires and monarchies, and weakened Britain and France. In its aftermath, powerful ideologies arose. The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 created the first [[communism|communist]] state, while the 1920s and 1930s saw [[militarism|militaristic]] [[fascism|fascist]] dictatorships gain control in Italy, Germany, Spain and elsewhere.

Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]], helped precipitate [[World War II]]. The [[Militarism|militaristic]] [[dictatorship]]s of Europe and Japan pursued an ultimately doomed course of [[Imperialism|imperialist]] [[expansionism]], in the course of which [[Nazi Germany]] orchestrated the murder of six million [[Jews]] in [[the Holocaust]] and of millions of [[Poles]], [[Russians]], and other [[Slavs]], while [[Imperial Japan]] murdered millions of [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. An earlier, [[World War I]] model of [[genocide]] had been provided by [[Turkey]]'s mass murder of [[Armenians]].  The World War II defeat of the [[Axis Powers]] opened the way for the advance of [[communism]] into [[Central Europe]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Albania]], China, [[North Vietnam]], and [[North Korea]].

The Cold War ended in 1991, when the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union disintegrated]], in part due to inability to compete economically with the United States and western Europe.

The 21st century has been marked by growing [[economic globalization]] and integration, with consequent increased risk to interlinked economies; and by the expansion of communications with [[mobile phone]]s and the [[Internet]], which have caused fundamental [[society|societal]] changes in  business, politics, and individuals' personal lives, including the advent of [[social media|social-media]] platforms such as [[Facebook]].

The early 21st century saw escalating intra- and international strife in the Near East and Afghanistan, stimulated by vast economic disparities, by dissatisfaction with governments dominated by Western interests, by inter-ethnic and inter-sectarian feuds, and by the longest war in the history of the United States, the proximate cause for which was [[Osama bin Laden]]'s provocative [[September 11 attacks|2001 destruction]] of [[New York City]]'s [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].{{efn|In consequence, write [[Robert Malley]] and [[Jon Finer]] in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', "The United States has become captive to a [[national security]] paradigm that ends up magnifying the very fears from which it was born....

The greenhouse effect is a natural mechanism that becomes dangerous if the [[atmosphere]]'s [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] concentrations exceed environmentally safe levels, as they have gradually been doing since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  As predicted, this is already increasing the frequency and severity of [[flood]]s and [[drought]]s due to accelerated melting of [[icecap]]s, [[glacier]]s, and [[snowpack]]s; flooding of low-lying [[coast]]s; [[storm]]s; [[agricultural]] disruption and [[famine]]s; [[ecological]] displacements; [[ocean acidification]] with havoc to marine life; release, from thawing [[Arctic]] [[permafrost]], of [[methane]], a greenhouse gas more powerful than [[carbon dioxide]]; and intra- and intersocietal [[conflict (process)|conflicts]], with increased [[crime]] and [[warfare]].

And if our planet is so special, it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves, our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home."  He explains that the [[universe]]'s first [[star]]s after the [[Big Bang]], 13 billion years ago, could not have had planets because [[chemical elements]] heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] had not yet been cooked up inside stars.  By the time our star, the [[Sun]], came into being 4.5 billion years ago, there were sufficient amounts of heavier elements available to form [[Earth]].  The Sun resides within a fairly narrow "galactic habitable zone" that is at reduced risk from destructive [[supernova]]e and [[gamma-ray burst]]s.  An orderly arrangement of [[planet]]s in nearly circular [[orbit]]s providing long-term stability – as in our [[solar system]] – is uncommon.  "Earth-like planets" that have been discovered are generally uninhabitable, by contrast with Earth with its thin mobile crust where [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity brings [[ore]]s and nutrients to the surface through [[volcanism]].  Earth also has a large [[metal]]lic core that, coupled with Earth's rapid rotation, produces a strong [[magnetic field]] that shields Earth from harmful [[cosmic radiation]]; without this screen, "our atomosphere would probably erode, and any living thing on the surface would get fried."  These planetary attributes are diredtly related to our [[Moon]], which probably formed early in the solar system's history when a [[Mars]]-size object struck the nascent Earth a glancing blow, causing both [[protoplanet]]s to melt; the metallic material from the two objects settled into Earth's center, and much of Earth's original lighter rocky material splashed out to become the Moon, leaving Earth with a thinner crust.  Without that impact, Earth would lack its crucial magnetic field and plate tectonics.  The presence of such a large Moon stabilizes Earth, preventing it from toppling far from the vertical, as happened with Mars.  Once the Earth-Moon system settled down, "life emerged with almost indecent rapidity":  [[fossil]]s of single-celled [[prokaryote]]s have been found in rocks 3.4 billion years old – about a billion years younger than Earth.  But it was only about 1.5 billion years ago that more complex, [[eukaryote]] cells, the stuff of all plants and animals, arose from a single merging of two types of primordial single-celled organisms:  [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].  "It is a measure of how unlikely such a single fusion of cells was that it took two billion years of [[evolution]] to occur."  Even then, little changed for about a billion years, apart from early eukaryotes forming flat, soft-bodied multicellular organisms, until the [[Cambrian explosion]] some 550 million years ago.  [[DNA analysis]], showing extremely close similarities among the most diverse human populations, indicates that all humans are descended from a tiny population, possibly survivors of some catastrophe or catastrophes.  DNA evidence pinpoints two [[evolutionary bottleneck]]s:  150,000 years ago, the human population was reduced to no more than a few thousand breeding pairs; and about 70,000 years ago, the entire human population fell to about 1,000.  "Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the galaxy?" asks John Gribbin.  "Almost certainly, given the speed with which it appeared on Earth.

'''Ioan Lazăr Kalinderu''' (born '''Calenderoglu''',&lt;ref name="nimlr5"&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], "Molière și Romînii. Comunicație comemorativă la Academia Romînă", in ''Revista Istorică'', Nr. 1–3/1922, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Iancu Kalinderu''', '''Ioan Kelenderu''', '''Ioanŭ Calenderu''', or '''Jean Kalindéro''';&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', p. 793; Teodorescu ''et al'', pp. 849–853&lt;/ref&gt; December 28 or 29, 1840 – December 11, 1913) was a [[Wallachia]]n, later [[Romania]]n jurist and confidant of [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], who served for thirty years as the administrator of crown domains, and for three years as president of the [[Romanian Academy]]. Educated in France, he was the son of a rich and influential [[Greeks in Romania|Greek-Romanian]] banker, Lazăr Kalenderoglu, and the brother of physician [[Nicolae Kalinderu]]. Like them, he was a sympathizer of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], with which he debuted in politics in the 1880s.

Kalideru was an expert in [[Roman law]], but his attempts in the field, as well as his later studies in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], are generally seen as minor contributions. His overall competence as an interpreter of law was questioned following his handling of the [[Strousberg Affair]], although he served on the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Cassation]] and on international bodies of experts. Kalinderu stayed on as Carol's legal adviser, also helping him in direct negotiations with the National Liberal and [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative]] political machines, and was several times considered for the office of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]].

As administrator for the crown, Kalinderu enacted his vision of rural improvement, setting up [[model farm]]s and a cottage industry, promoting literacy and the arts, and encouraging entrepreneurship. He viewed these methods as a working alternative to [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], defending property rights during and after the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasants' revolt of 1907]]. He was praised for his passion and dedication, but also criticized for the uncertainty of their outcome. In addition to his agrarian project and his social work, Kalinderu played a significant part in promoting [[mountaineering]] and modern [[forestry]], set up the resort of [[Bușteni]], and created his own art museum. A picturesque figure with eccentric customs, and often regarded as snobbish and servile, he became a [[stock character]] for the writers and cartoonists at ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'' magazine. His unfulfilled promise to donate his fortune to the public bled into a posthumous scandal which lasted into the interwar years.

Although a Wallachian native and relatively assimilated,&lt;ref&gt;Zane, p. 332. See also Bellessort, pp. 849, 852&lt;/ref&gt; Lazăr was sometimes regarded as an [[Turks of Romania|ethnic Turk]], owing to his Turkish-sounding surname.&lt;ref name="acarg56"&gt;Alinuța Cofan, "Pamfletul arghezian sau 'arta de a spurca frumos' (II)", in ''Caiete Critice'', Nr. 7/2013, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He identified as [[Greeks in Romania|Greek-Romanian]] and, as late as 1879, was ''[[ktitor]]'' of an eponymous [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church in Bucharest. His fully assimilated son later barred the Greek colony from attending the church, and rededicated it to [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Papacostea-Danielopolu, "La vie culturelle de la communauté grecque de Bucarest dans la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle", in ''Revue Des Études Sud-est Européennes'', Nr. 2/1969, pp. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt; Ioan and his brother Nicolae were educated in Greek,&lt;ref name="nimlr5"/&gt; before graduating high school in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt; Ioan studied law at the [[University of Paris]]. Taking his license degree with a study of dowries in [[Roman law]] (1860), and earning a doctorate with a thesis on [[Ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] (''De la non-rétroactivité des lois'', 1864),&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al'', pp. 849, 850–851&lt;/ref&gt; he returned home to take up positions as a judge, serving as the first president of Bucharest Tribunal.&lt;ref name="aidi382"/&gt; He then became a counselor with the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref name="aidi382"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tsctit"&gt;Tache Soroceanu, "Artistice. Muzeul Kalinderu: ctitorul și opera", in ''Ilustrațiunea Română'', Nr. 26/1934, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1872, the [[Ministry of Justice (Romania)|Ministry of Justice]] employed him as an adviser for penal reform, alongside [[Vasile Boerescu]], [[Nicolae Mandrea]], [[Grigore Păucescu]], [[Mihail Pherekyde]] and [[Grigore Triandafil]]. Boerescu referred to Kalinderu as "a man of the new world, with very progressive ideas, and an excellent jurisconsult."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vasile Boerescu]], ''Discursuri politice, 1859—1883. Volumul II: 1874—1883'', p. 110. Bucharest: [[Editura Socec|Atelierele Grafice Socec &amp; Co.]], 1910&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, his family was involved with the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal-radical movement]]. Brother Nicolae, a Paris-trained physician, became one of the founders of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalabașa I, pp. 146, 153, 171, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The aged Kalenderoglu was founder of ''Creditul Rural'', a [[credit union]] for the benefit of peasants, alongside major liberal figures.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalabașa I, p. 115; Zane, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, Ioan also joined the National Liberals in opposing the concession of the [[Căile Ferate Române Line 300|Predeal railway]] to the Englishman George Crawley; alongside party leaders [[Ion Brătianu]] and [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], he created an investment firm that tried to compete with Crawley for the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalabașa I, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Kalinderu advanced on the public scene following the [[Strousberg Affair]], during which Romania purchased back her railways from the bankrupt [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] investor [[Bethel Henry Strousberg|B. H. Strousberg]]. In February 1880, he and Strudza were dispatched to Berlin to negotiate payment of Strousberg's [[government bond]]s with the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] authorities.&lt;ref&gt;"Télégraphie privée (sérvice télégraphique de l'agence Havas)", in ''[[Journal des Débats]]'', February 29, 1880, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In April, ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] appointed him on the Princely Commission for the Administration of Railways, the embryonic ''[[Căile Ferate Române]]''. The other members of this directorial triumvirate were [[Eugeniu Stătescu]] and [[Ștefan Fălcoianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Gheorghe, Miliana Șerbu, ''Miniștrii de interne (1862–2007). Mică enciclopedie'', p. 95. Bucharest: [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Romanian Ministry of the Interior]], 2007.  {{ISBN|978-973-745-048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalinderu maintained his office in Berlin until 1882,&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt; representing the newly established [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In 1882, he published a French-language tome dealing specifically with the legal implications of the Strousberg Affair: ''De la compétence des tribunaux et particulièrernent des tribunaux prussiens dans toute contestation relative aux biens mobiliers qu'un état étranger peut posséder en Prusse''.&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al849"&gt;Teodorescu ''et al'', p. 849&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted at the time by [[Titu Maiorescu]], Kalinderu was responsible for placing his government in a humiliating position, and it was surprising that such a mission was entrusted to so unqualified an individual.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; Brătianu, who had taken over as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], arrived in Berlin to personally supervise the negotiations, reportedly because the hastiness on the German side to seal off the deal "inspired in him grave disquietude".&lt;ref&gt;''Documents diplomatiques français, 1871–1914. 1re série (1871–1900); Tome III (2 janvier 1880 – 13 mai 1881)'', p. 58. Paris: Alfred Costes &amp; L'Europe Nouvelle, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, he viewed Kalinderu as incompetent, arranging for [[Eugeniu Carada]] to replace him as the actual negotiator, in all but name.&lt;ref&gt;Theodorian-Carada, pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kalinderu's authority in international law was recognized following his employment by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]].&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fp77"&gt;Pădurean, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; From 1888, he was also an associate member of the [[Institut de Droit International]].&lt;ref name="aidi382"/&gt;

Kalinderu earned additional favors from Carol I, crowned [[King of the Romanians]], who appointed him his adviser on legal and agricultural matters.&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt; For a while, he served as administrator of the state-owned forest and fields.&lt;ref name="aidi382"/&gt; In June 1884, Kalinderu was named the first administrator of crown domains, which had been set aside by organic law,&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mihaesco, pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; resigning from his position at the railways company in December 1885.&lt;ref&gt;"Informațiuni", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', December 22, 1885, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Owned by the state and managed by the [[House of Hohenzollern]] (through Kalinderu), the domains originally included twelve country estates and two mountains of the [[Southern Carpathians]]: [[Clăbucetul Taurului]] and [[Caraiman Peak|Caraiman]].&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt; During the first years of his new assignment, Kalinderu tried to pursue a parallel career in politics. He ran for [[General Council of Bucharest|Bucharest Council]] in 1886, second on the National Liberal list.&lt;ref&gt;"Candidații Partidului național-liberal pentru alegerile comunale din Capitală", in ''[[Voința Națională]]'', November 2/14, 1886, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew upon winning, citing his "many other engagements".&lt;ref&gt;"Ultime informațiunĭ", in ''[[Voința Națională]]'', November 6/18, 1886, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Romanian general election, October 1888|election of 1888]], "I. Calenderoglu" ran at Olt as an independent, but lost, collecting 55 of 165 votes.&lt;ref&gt;"Resultatul alegerei Col. I", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', October 14/26, 1888, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually handled the purchase of Strousberg railways, negotiating a loan for 175 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in 1889.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt; In 1891, following the resignation of a [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] government under [[Gheorghe Manu]], Carol reportedly proposed Kalinderu as Prime Minister of an independent cabinet. This maneuver was rejected by the opposition National Liberals—the refusal was instigated by a moribund Brătianu.&lt;ref&gt;Theodorian-Carada, pp. 106, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academy presidency===
By 1888, Kalinderu was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="aidi382"/&gt; Made titular in March 1893, he became chairman of its Historical Section in 1895–1897, and again in 1907–1910.&lt;ref name="fp77"/&gt; He also served as Academy president from 1904 to 1907.&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fp77"/&gt; The administrator of the [[Ioan Oteteleșanu]] estate after winning the trial against his relatives in 1889,&lt;ref name="Teodorescu et al, pp. 849, 850"&gt;Teodorescu ''et al'', pp. 849, 850&lt;/ref&gt; he donated most of it to the Academy. The fund included 900 [[hectare]]s of land,&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt; and ran at 4 million gold lei.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa II, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure there, Kalinderu marginalized [[Ioan Slavici]], who had criticized his management,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovidiu Papadima]], "Ioan Slavici", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], Ovidiu Papadima, [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 390. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and tried but failed to do the same with historian [[Radu Rosetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He was also confronted with criticism from [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]], who, in 1904, claimed that the Academy was turning into an "asylum for the intellectually impaired."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, pp. 497–498&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, he continued to work as an envoy of the king. By 1899, with Romania hit by a major economic crisis, Kalinderu and Manu were sent abroad to negotiate loans—as Ornea notes, theirs was a "dilettante" adventure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Junimea și junimismul'', Vol. I, pp. 350–352. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1998.  {{ISBN|973-21-0562-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalinderu also reported to his former Berlin colleague Sturdza, by then the National Liberal Prime Minister, that Carol had dismissed him,&lt;ref&gt;Theodorian-Carada, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; then negotiated a reunification of the Conservatives and ''[[Junimea]]'' defectors, prompted by the king's wish to have a stable government party.&lt;ref&gt;Marghiloman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He had declined offers to replace Sturdza himself, favoring [[Theodor Rosetti]] or [[Ioan Lahovary]] for that position.&lt;ref&gt;"Informații", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', July 21, 1898, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, Kalinderu restored the church on his own estate of Schitu-Greci, radically altering the overall design.&lt;ref&gt;Ionașcu, pp. 232, 241–242&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly concerned with building and restoring Orthodox religious buildings on the king's domain,&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mr422"&gt;[[Marie of Romania]], ''Însemnări zilnice'', p. 422. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 2006.  {{ISBN|978-973-876-888-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nm197"&gt;Mihaesco, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; personally involved in restoring and refurbishing the church of [[Periș|Bălteni-Periș]].&lt;ref&gt;"Donațiuni", in ''Biserica Orthodoxă Română. Revistă Periodică Eclesiastică'', Nr. 12, March 1900, p. 1191&lt;/ref&gt; He supervised [[model farm]]s,&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tsctit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mihaesco, p. 197; Mitu, pp. 304–305&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a textbook for crown agents,&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al850"&gt;Teodorescu ''et al'', p. 850&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered the founding of cultural societies, the first appearing on a domain in 1897.&lt;ref name="mr422"/&gt; It published the eponymous "people's encyclopedic magazine", ''Albina'' ("The Bee"), appearing between October 1897 and 1916. Kalinderu was the head editor, with [[George Coșbuc]], [[Petre Dulfu]], and [[Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel]] serving as co-editors.&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; His work in public literacy also led him to establish Steaua Association. Joined by [[Constantin Banu]] and [[Spiru Haret]], and later by [[Barbu Știrbey]] and [[Alexandru Lapedatu]], it had as its object the promotion of "moral, patriotic and useful publications", and the prevention, "by all lawful meas, of immoral writings and publications".&lt;ref&gt;"«Steaua»", in ''Albina. Revistă Enciclopedică Populară'', Nr. 51/1901, p. 1976; "«Steaua»", in ''Albina. Revistă Enciclopedică Populară'', Nr. 22/1915, p. 839&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalinderu was also editor of [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Culture Ministry]]'s newsletter, ''Buletinul Comisiunii Monumentelor Istorice'', and of the forestry magazine, ''Revista Pădurilor'',&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 80, 550&lt;/ref&gt; serving as chairman of the Historical Monuments Commission, the Progress in Forestry Society, and the Royal Geographical Society.&lt;ref name="fp77"/&gt; He was also offered chairmanship of the [[Romanian Atheneum]], but regretfully declined, arguing that he was caught up in his agricultural work. Instead, he promised to bequeath a "handsome sum" of money to the Atheneum upon his death.&lt;ref name="ștci"&gt;Ștefan C. Ioan, "Amintiri din trecutul Ateneului Român", in ''Cele Trei Crișuri'', Nr. 3–4/1944, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, following Sturdza's second fall from office, Kalinderu was again tipped as the likely Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;C. Ulysse, "D. Sturdza la Rege. – Un guvern Kalinderu", in ''Protestarea'', March 8, 1906, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by [[Zigu Ornea]] as a "pseudo-historian", Kalinderu authored "risible" studies on Roman hairstyles,&lt;ref name="z"&gt;[[Titu Maiorescu]] (ed. [[Z. Ornea]]), ''T. Maiorescu și prima generație de maiorescieni'', p. 348. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1978&lt;/ref&gt; which also drew much amusement from contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe I. Bodea, ''Regele Carol al II-lea'', p. 48. Cluj-Napoca: [[Editura Dacia]], 2000.  {{ISBN|978-973-350-925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were published in 1900–1901 as ''Portul barbeĭ și pĕruluĭ la Romanĭ'' ("Beard and Hair Styling among the Romans") and ''Portul perucilor și bărbieriĭ la Romanĭ'' ("Wigs and Barbers of the Romans").&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al850"/&gt; Kalinderu's other publications have been characterized by Maiorescu as "compilations with no value".&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; They include monographs on the ''[[Praetor|praetorium ius]]'' (1885), on Roman municipal law and on the [[Byzantine Senate]] (both 1887), on the [[Twelve Tables]] (1888), on Roman vacationing (1895), on [[Augustus]] and his literary retinue (1897–1898), on [[Caesar's Civil War]] (1902), on [[clothing in ancient Rome]] (1903–1904), and on social life during the times of [[Pliny the Elder]] (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al'', pp. 849–851&lt;/ref&gt; He also published an homage to [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], medieval [[Prince of Moldavia]], studies of succession to the Romanian throne, and an Academy-sanctioned biography of [[Melchisedec Ștefănescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al'', pp. 849, 850, 851&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1888 polemical tract, ''Une poignée de vérités à nos prétendants'' ("A Fistful of Truths for Our Detractors"), Kalinderu and [[Alexandru Candiano-Popescu]], using the shared pseudonym ''Un Paysan du Danube'' ("A Peasant of the Danube"), defended their work alongside the king.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al'', p. 851&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrarian reformer===
Kalinderu largely owed his ascent into prominent positions to his work at the crown domains and his influence with Carol I.&lt;ref name="z"/&gt; However, his activity in agricultural and social improvement earned him respect. As early as 1898, [[Angelo de Gubernatis]] referred to his "powerful and positive work", calling Kalinderu "one of the most noble figures in today's Romania".&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo de Gubernatis]], ''La Roumaine et les roumains. Impressions de voyage et études'', p. 21. Florence: Bernard Seeber libraire-éditeur, 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Another visitor, [[André Bellessort]], joked that the perpetually youthful "Mr. Kalindero" resembled "a rustic god", a patron of the farmers with "nitrogen eyes".&lt;ref&gt;Bellessort, pp. 849–851&lt;/ref&gt; Kalinderu's contributions to agricultural science and his activism, covered in a 1903 monograph by the agrarianist [[Vasile Kogălniceanu]],&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu ''et al.'', p. 877&lt;/ref&gt; were praised by the sociologists: [[Dimitrie Drăghicescu]] saw them as marked by an "entrepreneurial spirit, unrelenting in its activity";&lt;ref&gt;Drăghicescu, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolae Mihăescu-Nigrim called Kalinderu "one of the country's most eminent economists" and an "indefatigable administrator".&lt;ref&gt;Mihaesco, pp. 196, 201&lt;/ref&gt; As chemist Amuliu Proca notes, Kalinderu turned the domains into an "institution for defeating poverty, a factor in educating and culturally improving the villages". It "set an example of what may be accomplished, in a short while, by a country that was taking major steps in her development."&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;

As summarized by the official press of his time, he "put all his efforts into directing peasants toward the cottage industry", created "home economics classes and adult education courses", and "was the first to speak" at educational conferences. He established a dairy factory, as well as shops for weavers, ropemakers, [[wainwright]]s and [[woodturner]]s, and showcased their products at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="nm197"/&gt; Following [[Julius Kühn]], Kalinderu insisted that the precondition of a "rational economy" was good livestock, so he inaugurated a freely accessible [[breeding program]], also providing tenants with [[cultivar]]s, or with beekeeping and [[sericulture]] implements.&lt;ref&gt;Mitu, pp. 309–311&lt;/ref&gt; He also reintroduced [[reforestation]] and [[forest farming]] where bad practices had affected the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Mitu, pp. 310–311&lt;/ref&gt; Kalinderu held the notion that the Romanian peasant was miserable for being illiterate, and that "all it takes is a set of favorable circumstances for him to display [his] talents".&lt;ref&gt;Drăghicescu, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts to educate his tenants were conjugated with those of ''Steaua''{{'}}s Haret, by then National Liberal [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Minister of Education]], providing young students with work experience and [[physical culture]], as well as inculcating in them a patriotic awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Mitu, pp. 311–312, 313–315&lt;/ref&gt; A significant portion of his time was spent on teaching peasants to diversify their diet, including providing hired hands with daily rations of vegetables, meat and milk. This helped to prevent outbursts of [[pellagra]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitu, pp. 315–316&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ludovic Bassarab - In carciuma.jpg|thumb|330px|''In the Tavern'', 1907 painting by [[Ludovic Bassarab]]]]
In 1901, agronomist [[Constantin Sandu-Aldea]] acknowledged that there was a stark difference between "the mass of cultivators, who fall behind progress", and those living and working on crown lands. As he noted, the "intelligent and energetic" Kalinderu was managing his estate and his tenants backed by "all scientific data in modern agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Sandu-Aldea|C. Sandu]], "Les engagements agricoles en Roumanie", in ''Journal d'Agriculture Pratique, de Jardinage et d'Économie Domestique'', Vol. 65, 1901, p. 705&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling his effort on the [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austrian colonization of Bosnia]], Kalinderu financed research projects for his employees, sending many of them to study in [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitu, pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt; On crown estates, management was divided between networks of forestry engineers, agricultural engineers, and accountants, who decided working hours and met budgetary requirements; workers received social security, including [[disability insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitu, pp. 303–306, 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; These and other contracts excluded drunkards and unmarried couples, with a view to promoting a stringent moral code.&lt;ref&gt;Mitu, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; However, his attempts to uproot alcoholism and promote personal hygiene had mixed results, according to the left-wing [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], who noted, sarcastically, "true enough, these days taverns have been replaced by bathhouses and libraries."&lt;ref name="fp84"&gt;Pădurean, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a 1901 project to set up rural theaters was derided and parodied by [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], in ''[[Moftul Român]]''.&lt;ref name="fp84"/&gt; Reportedly, his order to build model libraries on the domains was actively sabotaged by the local curators, who would not allow peasants to consult them, or even to set foot in the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al. Lascarov-Moldovanu]], ''Cruce și naționalism. Însemnările unui trecător'', pp. 72–73. Bucharest: [[Editura Cugetarea]], 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalinderu took over his father's seat at ''Creditul Rural'', which financed the cottage industry and, in 1906, was chaired by Sturdza. The institution was rocked by scandals between its Conservative and National Liberal managers—when Sturdza stepped down in March 1906, Kalinderu became his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa III, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; His belief in self-help and his defense of landed-property rights against another land reform were highlighted after the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasants' revolt of 1907]], during which his own estate at Schitu-Greci was ransacked.&lt;ref name="cvfile39"/&gt; At the Progress in Forestry Society, he condemned the peasants' belief that "the state has a duty to provide them with land", and insisted that the root cause of the revolt was their failure to accept modernity and practicality. As he noted at the time, "on the crown domains, [...] the peasants never rebelled, but quite the contrary, defended property against invaders."&lt;ref&gt;"Dl Kalinderu despre starea țăranilor", in ''Tribuna'', Nr. 105/1907, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediating between the Conservatives and the king, Kalinderu obtained guarantees against the reform, although he and the crown advocated "a credit union under the control of the state, permitting peasants to accumulate more land of their own."&lt;ref&gt;Marghiloman, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; By then, he had resigned from his steering position at ''Creditul Rural'', following an agreement with [[Dinu Brătianu]], who replaced him.&lt;ref&gt;"Din România", in ''Tribuna'', Nr. 235/1907, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908–1911, his ''Albina'' team also put out a weekly "social bulletin", providing Orthodox parsons and rural teachers with guidance in the field social work.&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art collector and courtier===
Kalinderu's other ambitious ideas manifested themselves erratically, including a project for a girls' boarding school in [[Turnu Măgurele]], the "Oteteleșanu Institute",&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, p. 85; Teodorescu ''et al'', p. 849&lt;/ref&gt; which he launched without the Academy's approval.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; He was also involved in the development of the [[Bușteni]] mountain resort, where he built a paper mill and a high school that today bears his name. He promoted ski, and a slope there is also named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sorin Anghel, [http://jurnalul.ro/sport/sporturi/partia-kalinderu-asteapta-schiorii-32728.html "Pârtia Kalinderu așteaptă schiorii"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', November 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His own estate increased by 1907, with the addition of 401 hectares at [[Seaca, Teleorman|Seaca]]—leased out to the Predescu brothers—and other plots in [[Balaci|Tecuci-Kalinderu]].&lt;ref&gt;Steluța Chefani-Pătrașcu, ''Moșieri teleormăneni (1864–1949). Mărire și decădere (Publicațiile Muzeului Județean Teleorman, VI)'', pp. 283, 288, 294. Renaissance: Bucharest, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-606-637-009-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 1906 onward,&lt;ref&gt;"Din România. Știri dela expoziție", in ''Tribuna'', Nr. 132/1906, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; his other pet project was art collecting, with the goal of setting up a museum at his villa on Vasile Sion Street, near the [[Cișmigiu Gardens]]. The house itself, designed by [[Ion D. Berindey]], cost 2 million gold lei to build, and was lavishly furnished.&lt;ref name="tsctit"/&gt; The collection included [[Ancient Greek pottery]] and works of design alongside art by [[Donatello]], [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[Léon Bonnat]], [[Auguste Raffet]], and the complete collection of etchings by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]. These were matched by a Romanian hall, with canvasses by [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], [[Ștefan Luchian]], [[Ion Andreescu]], [[Camil Ressu]] and various others.&lt;ref name="tsctit"/&gt;

The art world was skeptical of his tastes: [[Tudor Arghezi]] and [[Alexandru Lapedatu]] both noted that Kalinderu had amassed his ''[[Objets d'art|objets]]'' without much discernment; later, art historian Petre Oprea concluded that Kalinderu was driven by "vainglory and a thirst for fame."&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, critic [[George Oprescu]] suggests that Ioan's taste in art was eclipsed by that of his physician brother Nicolae, who selected "all that is best" in the Kalinderu collection.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Oprescu]], "Colecția de tablouri a Clubului Tinerimii", in ''Boabe de Grâu'', Nr. 2/1934, pp. 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; According to the fellow collector [[Krikor Zambaccian]]: "dapper, distant and implacable, the Smyrniote was haughty and did not tolerate competition".&lt;ref name="muz"/&gt; Zambaccian found his rival overall "harmless", even though he noted an incident in which an angry Kalinderu "decapitated" a work of sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalideru's other eccentricities attracted attention in their own right. Seen by contemporaries and later historians as excessively vain and hence susceptible, he was decorated with the ribbons of numerous European countries,&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fp78"&gt;Pădurean, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; holding the Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Star of Romania]], the [[Legion of Honour]] as Grand Officer,&lt;ref name="Teodorescu et al, pp. 849, 850"/&gt; and, from 1903, the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of Osmanieh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Quillard]], "Nouvelles d'Orient. Condamnations et décorations", in ''Pro Armenia'', No. 65, July 15, 1903, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his charges, Arghezi claimed that Kalinderu, the "Man with Violet Eyes", was entirely alien to the nation he claimed to rescue, a "purulent flower on the heights of our national life."&lt;ref name="acarg56"/&gt; Lapedatu commented on his "wicked half-closed Oriental eyes", his "black mustache like that of [[Napoleon III]]", and his dress "in the English style, with wide pants, gray jacket, an enormous lapel flower and a tall gray hat".&lt;ref name="muz"/&gt; [[Constantin Argetoianu]] observed that although Kalinderu lacked all inclination toward sport or riding, he would go out every morning on a nag he could barely ride.&lt;ref name="muz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fp79"&gt;Pădurean, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Although this activity bored him, he would not have renounced it for anything, because he had read it was a habit of lords in London.&lt;ref name="muz"/&gt; Later, he became an ardent [[Velocipede|velocipedist]], and was the only person with special permission to ride a velocipede in Cișmigiu.&lt;ref name="muz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fp79"/&gt;

As seen by [[Radu R. Rosetti]], Kalinderu appears "sententious, ridiculous, but very much appreciated by the King".&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he worked for free at the crown domains, refusing to collect his salary: "The only rewards he desires are peasant blessings and his playing billiards with His Majesty."&lt;ref&gt;Bellessort, p. 851&lt;/ref&gt; The king's appreciation was strictly contextual, a fact noticed by the politician [[Ion G. Duca]]: although Kalideru "entertained illusions" that he was personal friends with Carol, the latter "made sure to dispel it"; the courtier could be the king's "servant and useful instrument, but never his friend."&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Carol also ordered Kalinderu to admonish [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Crown Prince Ferdinand]] and [[Marie of Romania|Princess Marie]] for their lavish spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Bulei]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/acum-un-veac-xlii-talentele-mariei-ii-de-ion-bulei-14957096 "Acum un veac (XLII). Talentele Mariei (II)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', January 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The future Queen Marie was much amused by Kalinderu, describing him as "little, round, with a short beard and a pronounced [[Jewish nose|Semitic nose]]; one of his eyes sparkled wickedly, showing an unusually sharp intelligence".&lt;ref name="fp77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrgent"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://jurnalul.ro/special-jurnalul/reportaje/maria-regina-romaniei-un-gentilom-in-care-regele-carol-avea-cea-mai-mare-incredere-644483.html "Maria Regina României. Un gentilom în care regele Carol avea cea mai mare încredere"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', June 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled a visit with him to [[Windsor Castle]], where "it was truly amusing to see the short gentleman very pleased with himself, catching everything with his glimpse, weighing, judging, taking the measure of people and things, with that small, penetrating, almost wicked eye". Even when meeting [[Queen Victoria]], his eye "roved throughout, as if he feared missing something".&lt;ref name="mrgent"/&gt; When he was shown [[Royal Collection|the castle's art treasures]], he observed them "with the superior air of a man in the know, of a man who was familiar with valuable collections".&lt;ref name="mrgent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years, death, and legacy===
As noted by the queen, Kalinderu's "vain, self-satisfied appearance" became "a tireless temptation for caricaturists".&lt;ref name="fp77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrgent"/&gt; During the nine years in which their activity overlapped, the magazine ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'' made him a buffoonish [[stock character]] in prose, poetry, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt; ''Furnica''{{'}}s [[George Ranetti]] also circulated serious charges against Kalinderu, accusing him of having run over a child with his car, and implying that he had used his connections to avoid prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Ranetti|Kiriak Napadarjan]], "Gardiștii și ''Furnica''", in ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'', Nr. 196/1908, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; During the peasants' revolt, ''Furnica'' published a cartoon showing Kalinderu as a personification of Cajolery, interposing himself between Carol and The Truth (personified by a tenant farmer);&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; issues of that period were confiscated by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Kalinderu himself was generally aware of the mockery, but pretended to be "inviolable",&lt;ref name="fp78"/&gt; and even incited Ranetti by riding his horse to his office.&lt;ref name="tsctit"/&gt; However, ''Furnica'' gleefully reported, he lost his temper with the painter [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], who had contributed a set of cartoons to the campaign. According to the magazine, this incident showed his limitations as an art patron.&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Kalinderu's late contributions as a philanthropist was his involvement with the [[Romanian Red Cross]]. From October 1912, he served on its general council, alongside Sturdza, [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]], [[Grigore C. Crăiniceanu]], [[Nicolae Filipescu]], and [[Alexandru Obregia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Parte neoficială. Anunțuri administrative", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 184/1912, p. 8685&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the better part of 1913 in conflict with the Conservative government, headed by his old rival Maiorescu. Against Maiorescu, Kalinderu tried to persuade Carol not to renew the pact tying Romania to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. Arguing that it constituted support for a [[Mitteleuropa|German hegemony]], he managed to postpone its ratification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Memorii. Vol. III: Tristețea și sfârșitul unei domnii'', p. 184. Bucharest: [[Editura Națională Ciornei]], 1931.  {{OCLC|5673988}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his final gestures was the intervention in favor of a protegé scholar, [[Orest Tafrali]], for whom he obtained a chair at [[Iași University]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, pp. 340, 518&lt;/ref&gt; He also made returns to scholarship, publishing in 1912 a commentary on the influence of [[Byzantine art]] on Romanian visual culture. It built on observations made by [[Gabriel Millet]].&lt;ref&gt;Em. E. Kretzulescu, "Dări de seamă. I. Kalinderu, ''Notă despre un studiu al d-lui Millet''", in ''Revista pentru Istorie, Archeologie și Filologie'', Vol. XIII, Parts I–II, 1912, pp. 385–387&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalinderu died in December 1913, and was buried at [[Bellu cemetery]], Plot 5, next to his father and his brother.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', p. 80. Bucharest: [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral witnessed speeches by [[Constantin C. Arion]], [[Constantin Istrati]], [[Basile M. Missir]], and [[Sabba Ștefănescu]].&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al849"/&gt; Kalinderu intended to disinherit his relatives and see his name praised after giving lavish donations to royal and academic institutions of culture; however, none of the wills were written in legal form, so that Kalinderu's wealth largely ended up going to his relatives.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ștci"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, pp. 83–84, 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; The mystery and scandal surrounding Kalinderu's last wish inspired a novella by [[Nicolae M. Condiescu]]. This fictionalizes one theory, according to which Kalinderu ("Conu Enake" in the story) writes down a will donating his fortune to the Academy, then destroys it on a whim.&lt;ref&gt;Pădurean, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1914, Kalideru's job at the crown domains went to [[Barbu Știrbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 125; Mitu, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; A museum bearing Ioan and Nicolae's names, containing their respective art collections, opened the same year. The first private art museum in the country,&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt; it suffered damages [[Romania in World War I|during World War I]]: its Romanian-art section was evacuated during the [[battle of Bucharest]], then confiscated by [[Bolshevik Russia]].&lt;ref name="tsctit"/&gt; Kalinderu's park at Schitu-Greci was vandalized during the war and, by 1934, had still not been repaired.&lt;ref name="Ionașcu, p. 241"/&gt;

Reopened during the interwar with the remainder of its collection,&lt;ref name="tsctit"/&gt; the Kalinderu museum had [[Jean Alexandru Steriadi]] as its last director.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Cioroianu]], ''Pe umerii lui Marx. O introducere în istoria comunismului românesc'', p. 138. Bucharest: [[Editura Curtea Veche]], 2005. {{ISBN|973-669-175-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually closed in 1946,&lt;ref name="muz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dtcenu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Doinel Tronaru, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/fapt-divers/muzeul-kalinderu-va-renaste-din-propria-i-cenusa--60300 "Muzeul Kalinderu va renaște din propria-i cenușă"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', September 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the inauguration of a [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]]. Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Kalinderu's work and legacy were revisited: in 2005, a project to reestablish Kalinderu Museum was being debated.&lt;ref name="muz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dtcenu"/&gt; In January 2014, the centennial of Kalinderu's death was solemnly marked by the General Association of Romanian Engineers, which discussed opening up a museum of the crown domains in [[Segarcea]].&lt;ref name="amp100"/&gt;

'''Julián Juderías y Loyot''' (September 16, 1877 &amp;ndash; June 19, 1918) was a Spanish [[historian]], [[sociologist]], literary critic, [[journalist]], [[translator]] and [[interpreter]].

== Biography ==
[[File:J.Juderías Unterschrift.jpg|thumb|Signature of Julian Juderías]]
Juderías was born in [[Madrid]] to a prominent an cultured family. His father, [[Mariano Juderías]], was a well-known historical author and translator. His mother was French. At 17, he began work with the Spanish Ministry of State. In 1900, after the death of his father, he moved to [[Paris]] to attend the School of Eastern Languages. There and in [[Leipzig]] and [[Odessa|Odesa]] he studied [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and other languages. His main work was a study about the [[Black Legend]], in which he denounced the tendentious, nonobjective historical writing or propaganda about [[Spain]], its people and its culture.

Years after his death, Juderías' works greatly influenced conservative thinkers such as [[Ramiro de Maeztu]] and [[José María de Areilza]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12588">'''Landulf of Saint Paul''' ([[floruit]] 1077–1137), called '''Landulf Junior''' to distinguish him from [[Landulf Senior]],&lt;ref&gt;His name in Italian is ''Landolfo di San Paolo'' or ''Landolfo Iuniore''; in Latin ''Landulphus Iunior''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Milan]]ese historian whose life is known entirely from his main work, the '''''Historia Mediolanensis'''''. He presents a unique and important point of view from the conflict-ridden years of 1097–1137 in Milan. He thrice sojourned in [[Kingdom of France|France]] while his ecclesiastical faction—the [[Pataria]]—was out of favour in Milan, and there learned under some of the leading philosophers of western Europe. After 1113, Landulf's primary ambition was to regain the priesthood in the church of San Paolo which he had lost, and to this end he communicated with popes and emperors. He played a role—large in his own account—in the election of [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] as [[King of Italy]] in 1128.

==Life==

===Travels in France===
Landulf's birth year can be approximated from his statement that he was "sixty years old" (''sexagenariae aetatis'') in 1136.&lt;ref name=Chiesa&gt;Chiesa (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; He was a nephew and student of [[Liprando]], a Milanese priest and one of the leaders of the [[Pataria]] in the last quarter of the eleventh century. Towards the end of the century, Landulf became an [[acolyte]] (''acolitus''), which was recognised as the highest-ranking of the [[minor orders]] in Milan at the time. He held this rank for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; In 1095–96, Landulf studied under master Andrea Dalvolto, a priest of the church of San Tecla. Among his fellow students was Nazario Muricola, later his enemy.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; Later, probably in 1102, he went to [[Orléans]] to study under the masters Alfred and James. He may have been avoiding the conflict between the Patarenes, led by Liprando, and the new Papally-approved archbishop, [[Grosolanus]]. He was absent from Milan in 1103, when his uncle passed a [[trial by ordeal]].&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

Landulf returned to Milan, but left for France again in 1106. There he stayed for a year and a half with the prominent reforming Milanese churchmen [[Anselmo della Pusterla]] and [[Olrico da Corte]], perhaps acting as their secretary. In [[Tours]] he sat under the teaching of a master Alfred, perhaps the same one that had taught him half a decade earlier in Orléans, and in [[Paris]] he received lessons from the philosopher [[William of Champeaux]].&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; In 1107, Landulf returned again to Milan and escorted his uncle back from exile at [[Civate]].

In 1109, Landulf's brother Antelmo died in the war between Milan and [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], and Landulf again went to France with Anselmo della Pusterla and Olrico da Corte. This time he stayed in [[Laon]] and learned under [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] and his brother Ralph. This is the first trip abroad which Landulf characterises as an exile in his ''Historia'', noting that the city magistrate suggested their long absence in order to keep the peace between factions.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

===Marginalisation in Milan===
Landulf returned to Milan in 1110. He looked favourably upon the entry of the [[Emperor Henry V]] into Italy in 1111. That year he fell out with Olrico da Corte upon the latter's abandonment of the Patarene position when he was made an [[archpresbyter]].&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; In 1112–13 Landulf served in his uncle's former church of San Paolo in Compito, since lost, but remembered in the street named Via San Paolo. With his uncle, he founded a church dedicated to the [[Trinity]] at an unidentified place called "Pons Guinizeli".&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; With Liprando and Andrea, ''[[primicerius]]'' and head of the ''[[decumani]]'', Landulf also opposed the election of [[Jordan (archbishop of Milan)|Jordan]] as archbishop in early 1112. When Jordan offered to make Landulf a subdeacon and cancel one of his debts in return for recognition of his legitimacy from the Pataria, Landulf refused.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

With death of Liprando in January 1113 and of Andrea shortly after, Landulf found himself marginalised. He was expelled from San Paolo and from the ranks of the ''decumani'' by Andrea's successor, Nazario Muricola. Thus forced to seek an income outside of the church, he became a teacher and scribe, even working for the municipal government as a "holder of public offices and notary of consular letters" (''publicorum officiorum particeps et consulum epistolarum dictator'').&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; This is the earliest reference to [[consul]]s in medieval Milan.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

For the rest of his life Landulf tried to recover his office in San Paolo. According to him, Jordan made vague promises to get his support at the [[Lateran council of 1116]], but reneged at an assembly (''[[arengo]]'') in 1117. Landulf obtained a letter of recommendation from [[Pope Gelasius II]], which Jordan ignored, in 1118. He went to Rome to plead his case to [[Pope Callistus II]] in 1120, but the pope did not intervene.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; Only with the death of Jordan in October and his replacement by Olrico, Landulf's former companion, did the latter achieve some redress—he returned to the ''decumani'', but was not reinstated in San Paolo. He attempted again to plead with Pope Callistus at the [[First Lateran Council|Lateran council of 1123–24]], but could not get an audience. In 1125 he joined a Milanese embassy to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], hoping to plead his case to Emperor Henry, but the mission was cut short by the latter's death and never got further than [[Trento|Trent]].&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

===Return to power===
In 1126, Olrico was succeeded as archbishop by Anselmo della Pusterla. Landulf's former travelling companion appointed him head of the archiepiscopal chapel, in which capacity he served as a secretary and counsellor. In 1127 [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] was elected king in Germany in opposition to the emperor-elect [[Lothair of Supplinburg]]. Archbishop Anselm charged Landulf with ascertaining whether the Milanese would support Conrad or Lothair, while he himself left the city. Landulf afterwards claimed an important role in the choice of Conrad, who was crowned by Anselmo as [[King of Italy]] in 1128, first at [[Monza]], where the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] was kept, then at Milan.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; In 1130, when Anselmo gave his support to the [[Antipope Anacletus II]], Landulf followed him. In 1135, he was convinced by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to support [[Pope Innocent II]], but when Anselmo was deposed and fled the city, Landulf was again pushed to the margins by a new archbishop, [[Robaldo di Alba]].&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

In November 1136, Landulf renewed his claim on the church of San Paolo before Lothair of Supplinburg, now undisputed emperor, who was holding court at [[Piacenza|Roncaglia]]. The emperor refused to adjudicate the dispute, leaving it to the local authorities. According to Landulf, the machinations of Arnaldo di Rho, chief of a clan traditionally opposed to the Pataria, succeeding in blocking his ambitions once more.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; This is the last notice of Landulf's life. He was still alive in the summer of 1137: he records the [[Battle of Genivolta]], a victory for Milan over [[Cremona]] early that year, and the flight of Bishop [[Oberto di Dovara]] of Cremona, who wound up a prisoner of the Milanese, some months later.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

==''Historia Mediolanensis''==
The title ''Historia Mediolanensis'', meaning "A Milanese History", is not contemporary. It was used as a source by several later medieval historians: [[Bonvesin da La Riva]], [[Goffredo da Bussero]], [[Benzo d'Alessandria]] and perhaps [[Galvano Fiamma]]. Nevertheless, it survives in only one manuscript tradition, at the font of which stands the fifteenth-century manuscript H.89.inf. in the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan. Also at the Ambrosiana are N.296 sup., R.119 sup. and Trotti, 168; at the [[Biblioteca Trivulziana]], also in Milan, is manuscript 348. All these are copies of H.89.inf., a low-quality manuscript littered with errors and gaps.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; The codex contains, besides the ''Historia'' of Landulf Junior, several other histories of Milan: the ''Historia'' of Landulf Senior, the ''Liber gestorum recentium'' of [[Arnulf of Milan]] and a ''Passio'' on the death of [[Arialdo]] in 1066, once though to have been by Landulf Junior. In the manuscript the ''Historia'' is titled "The Book of the Histories of the Milanese City by Landulf of St Paul" (''Liber hystoriarum Mediolanensis urbis Landulfi de S. Paulo''). Medieval writers referred to it as the ''Copia Landulfi'' ("Landulf's Store"), probably based on the last line of the manuscript, ''in hac mea copia''. The term was sometimes applied to Arnulf's ''Liber gestorum recentium'' and the term ''Copia Arnulfi'' was sometimes applied to Landulf's ''Historia'', suggesting perhaps that the four works of Milanese history were treated as a single collection.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

Landulf's ''Historia'' begins with the disputed election of [[Anselmo da Bovisio]] to the see of Milan in 1097. The narrative, which coincides with Landulf's adult life, is compact and circular. It begins with the unjust intervention of a Papal officer, [[Ermanno da Gavardo|Hermann]], in the affairs of the church of Milan and ends with the restoration of good relations between Milan and the Papacy by Bernard of Clairvaux. Landulf places the blame for the Milan's problems on Hermann, and notes with satisfaction that both Archbishops [[Anselm III (archbishop of Milan)|Anselmo III]] and [[Arnulf III (archbishop of Milan)|Arnulf III]] refusd to consecrate him after his election as [[bishop of Brescia]]. He also approves of King [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad II]]'s refusal to have anything to do with Anselmo da Bovisio or Hermann's consecration.&lt;ref&gt;Cowdrey (1968), 292–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Landulf is a partisan narrator and his account judgemental as well as personal, it is historically valuable for its eyewitness testimony and its uncritical attitude.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt; Landulf writes "without thorough understanding and remain[s] disturbed by the progressive breaking apart of the traditional order" that birthed the Milanese ''[[Medieval commune|comune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa (2004): ''senza comprenderlo fino in fondo e rimanendo anzi turbato dalla progressiva frantumazione dell'ordine tradizionale''&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Landulf's writing is unexepectedly poor for one who received an education from the leading philosophers of France.

The ''Historia'' received its ''[[editio princeps]]'' from G. A. Sassi, on behalf of [[Ludovico Muratori]], in 1724. The standard [[critical edition]] is that of [[Ludwig Bethmann]] and [[Philipp Jaffé]] for the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' in 1868.&lt;ref name=Chiesa/&gt;

'''Lilian Hamilton Jeffery''' (5 January 1915 – 29 September 1986) was a British archaeologist, classical philologist and epigraphist best remembered for her 1961 work ''The Local Scripts of Archaic Greece''. Building on the work of [[Adolf Kirchhoff]] and [[Antony E. Raubitschek]], Jeffery surveyed the development of the Greek alphabet from its adoption down to the fifth century BC and in so doing established the chronology of archaic inscriptions.

==Early life==
Lilian (Anne) Jeffery was born at [[Westcliff-on-Sea]] to, Thomas Theophilus Jeffery, a schoolmaster and lecturer in Classics, and Lilian Mary Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/memoire/LHJ.memoire.01.html|title=Epigraphic Sources for Early Greek Writing|website=poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] and in 1933 won a Major Classical scholarship to [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] where she studied under [[Jocelyn Toynbee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/memoire/LHJ.memoire.02.html|title=Epigraphic Sources for Early Greek Writing|website=poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She won the Walton Studenship to the [[British School at Athens]] in 1937, where she contributed to the work of [[Antony E. Raubitschek]] on the sculptural fragments of the Acropolis, co-publishing with him the 1949 book ''Dedications from the Athenian Akropolis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epigraphy.packhum.org/book/434?location=1360|title=Dedications from the Athenian Akropolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]] during [[World War II]]; part of her duties included intelligence interpretation of aerial photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/memoire/LHJ.memoire.04.html|title=Epigraphic Sources for Early Greek Writing|website=poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 she took up the position of research fellow at [[Lady Margaret Hall]], Oxford, where she remained for the rest of her career apart from a period of research at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton from September 1951 to June 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ias.edu/scholars/lilian-hamilton-jeffery|title=Lilian Hamilton Jeffrey on the IAS website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her archaeological work included field study with the British School at Old Smyrna (Bayrakli) in 1949. She also made major contributions to the study of Attic grave monuments&lt;ref&gt;Published in BSA, lvii (1962), 115-53.&lt;/ref&gt; and the epigraphical edition project ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' i&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;IG i3 fasc. 2, with Jeffery's major contribution, was completed and published shortly before D.M. Lewis's death in 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 until 1961 she was an editor of the ''Annual of the British School at Athens.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/memoire/LHJ.memoire.05.html|title=Epigraphic Sources for Early Greek Writing|website=poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was made a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=David|date=1987|title=Lilian Hamilton Jeffrey, 1915-1986|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/73p505.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|volume=73|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ooni of Ile-Ife''' ('''Ọọ̀ni''' of '''Ilè-Ifẹ̀''') is the traditional ruler of [[Ile-Ife]]. This Nigerian town is seen as the cradle of the Yoruba people. The Ooni dynasties go back hundreds of years. Because the oral tradition was only recently transcribed, there are several detailed lists that contradict each other. Nevertheless, some key figures are common to all of them. All the Ooni are traced down to Oduduwa, who is seen as the ancestral father of all the Yoruba people. Ooni Oranmiyan, who is said to have lived between 1200 and 1300 A.D, became legendary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=25: the staff of Oranyan|title= Yoruba Legends|author=M. I. Ogumefu, B.A. | year=1929| publisher=london| url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/yl/yl27.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his role in creating many new towns. One of his sons, Eweka, became the first Oba of Benin. Another son, Ajaka, became the first Alaafin of Oyo. Another, Osile, of Oke-Ona Egba.  Ooni Lajamisan, another descendant of Oranmiyan is often said to have opened the modern Ife history. 
The four actual Ruling Houses&lt;ref name="vanguard-oranmiyan"&gt;{{cite news| work=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)]]| url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/02/the-place-of-oranmiyan-in-the-history-of-ile-ife| title=The Place Of Oranmiyan In The History Of Ile – Ife|date=2016-02-22|accessdate=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; are named from Ooni Lafogido, Ooni Osinkola, Ooni Ogboru and Ooni Giesi. The first three were sons of Ooni Lajodogun, and the later a maternal grandson of Ogboru. The current Ooni is [[Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi]] Ojaja II (born October 17, 1974)

==Various authors have various lists==
The primary sources for the history of the Yoruba are from oral tradition. Since there were not ceremonial recitations of the list of the Oonis (at burial or at crowning), there are in fact several oral traditions, that have generated an unusual number of different written transcriptions. In what follows, #nn is the index of the Ooni in the '''A list''' (see table, column '''LA''').

===Influence on king making===
The filling of the stool of a deceased Ooni of Ife is not a simple local affair as it may seem but has national ramifications. Since Ife is regarded as the cradle of the Yoruba, this town has always been the leading religious center of the Yoruba people. But other roles are also involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/rulers-ife-traditional-and-adaptive-roles-ooni-004055?nopaging=1|date=2015-10-03|title=The Rulers of Ife: The Traditional and Adaptive Roles of the Ooni|work=Ancient Origins}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially, the Ooni of Ife is often presented as the highest ranked Oba&lt;ref name="vanguard-oranmiyan" /&gt; or, even more, as the natural chairman of the Council of Yoruban Chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=LtAkDl3OrQgC|title=Nigerian Chiefs: Traditional Power in Modern Politics, 1890s-1990s|series=Rochester studies in African history and the diaspora|author=Olufemi Vaughan|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2006|isbn=9781580462495|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--|pp=293--&gt;
The rules to fill a vacant stool are the Chiefs Law Cap 25 Laws of Osun State (modified 2002).&lt;ref name=baralpha&gt;{{cite web|title=Erring on the law to fill Ooni stool|author=Dr. Abiola Sanni|work=Bar Alpha (Nigeria)|url=https://baralpha.com/2015/09/22/erring-on-the-law-to-fill-ooni-stool-1|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the Declaration made in 1980 by the traditional Chiefs under Section 4(2) of this Chief Law. In 1957, the former Declaration recognised four ruling houses and established the following order of rotation: 
# The Oshinkola House, Iremo (present) [as of 1957] 
# The Giesi House, More 
# The Ogboru House, Ilare 
#The Lafogido House, Okerewe

In 1977, references to locations in Ife were suppressed. And the January 1980 Declaration confirmed everything just before the death of Adesoji Aderemi.&lt;ref name= baralpha /&gt; These families are tagged in column '''desc''', as sourced from Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)]]|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/the-ooni-stool-yoruba-nation-how-the-geisi-family-joined-the-ruling-class|date=2015-10-31|accessdate=2016-04-26|title=How Giesi Family Joined the Ruling Class}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Lafog, Osink, Ogbor, Giesi. And Newz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newzloaded.com/names-of-ife-king-ooni-from-oduduwa-ascension|title=Names of Ife Ooni, from Oduduwa ascension }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the rest. (Both sources don't give their own sources).

In 2015, it was the turn of the Giesi Family, as confirmed by the Ife kingmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ife kingmakers narrow selection of Ooni to Giesi Family|work=Nigerian Tribune |url=http://tribuneonlineng.com/ife-kingmakers-narrow-selection-ooni-giesi-family|date=2015-09-14|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--confirmed by the  executive secretary of Ife East (Tajudeen Lawal) and Ife Central (A.O. Taiwo) local government areas,  said it would not be the first time 1980 Chieftaincy Declaration would be used to select the Ooni.--&gt;&lt;!--* http://www.sharpedgenews.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=6509:kingmakers-adopt-1980-ife-chieftaincy-declaration-to-choose-new-paramount-monarch-obalufee-of-ife&amp;Itemid=641 Section 19 subsections a (3) ...  1980 Ife Chieftaincy Declaration is the one in existence now and we affirm as follows...--&gt; Nevertheless:
* Olakunle Aderemi (leader of Osinkola) said that, despite having produced Adesoji Aderemi (1930-1980),  Osinkola house deserved to produce the new King because the family produced the least number of the Ooni among the four ruling houses. Ife Chieftaincy Declaration of 1980 technically throws open the contest for filling the stool of Ooni, he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescoopng.com/new-ooni-as-expected-ruling-houses-have-already-started-fighting|accessdate=2016-04-21|title=New Ooni: As expected, ruling houses have already started fighting|date=2015-08-27|work=The Scoop (Nigeria)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Lafogido house went to court, describing the Chieftaincy Declaration as unfair. Lafogido house had been constantly marginalized in chieftaincy reviews in Ife since 1957 they said. 14 Oonis have been enthroned from Lajodogun and only 8 from Lafogido ruling house they added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.thescoopng.com/ife-kingmakers-announce-that-giesi-would-produce-next-ooni-but-one-other-family-is-heading-to-court|title= Ife kingmakers announce that Giesi would produce next Ooni; but one other family is heading to court|date=2015-09-14|accessdate=2016-04-21|work=The Scoop (Nigeria)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adetowo Aderemi (of Osinkola) got even further, faulting the 1957 and 1980 Ife Traditional Council Declarations, describing them as a fraud. That they are against the customary law of succession of the Ife people, he said. He also faulted the inclusion of Giesi Ruling House among eligible royal families to fill the stool of Ooni, saying that Giesi was only invited to complete the term of Ogboru, not being from the male lineage with right to the stool as the grandson of Ogboru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Ooni: Bickering gets worse as Osinkola Ruling House distances self from rotation of crown|url=http://www.thescoopng.com/new-ooni-bickering-gets-worse-as-osinkola-ruling-house-distances-self-from-rotation-of-crown|date=2015-09-06|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi]], from the Giesi house, was elected October 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)]]|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/profile-of-ogunwusi-named-ooni-elect|date=2015-10-27|accessdate=2016-04-21|title=Profile of Ogunwusi Ooni-elect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Avoiding original research when consolidating ==

=== Consolidation at the price of the diacritics ===
The Yoruba language is written using the [[Pan-Nigerian alphabet]]. This alphabet makes use of many diacritic signs.{{citation needed|reason=The table below gives many "examples", but none of them include any diacritics. Pending examination by a Yoruba scholar, a citation to one who at least said the writing system includes diacritics would be satisfactory. UPDATE: Pldx1 added the new phrase "Yoruba alphabet" to the first line after I added this cn template. Searching this phrase on Wikipedia links to the "Pan-Nigerian alphabet" article. I suspect this claim may no longer need a citation per WP:BLUE, but the relevance to THIS article, and why this is a problem, and why NO diacritics appear in the list of examples immediately below, are still in question.|date=May 2016}} Like for the [[McCune–Reischauer]] system for [[Korean language|Korean]], this leads to several variant spellings where the diacritics are omitted for various reasons.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} But the case of Yoruba is worse than that of Korean as what is transcribed is a language that was not previously written down at all apart from Ajami script: the romanization becomes locutor-dependent.{{clarify|reason=What is meant by "locutor-dependent"?|date=May 2016}}{{citation needed|reason=This entire section appears to be an of-topic description of romanization of Yoruba and an even more off-topic comparison to Korean (and a polemic against popular romanization systems thereof). It is not clear what any of this has to do with rulers of Ife specifically.|date=May 2016}} Some examples are (diacritics removed):

In the aggregated table, differences that clearly come only from pronunciation have been ignored.

=== Consolidation at the price of the obvious discrepancies ===

# Dele Awoyinfa (one of the '''list A''' sources) numbers again Obalufon Alayemore when he comes back after the death of Oranmiyan. And all the list becomes shifted. Since no one else proceeds that way (even not L. A. Adetunji), this has been shifted back (obtaining again what is listed in the '''LA''' column). To keep a track, the second reign of Obalufon Alayemore is tagged #4.5 in the LA column.
# Usurper Lajuwa/Lajua/Lejua&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Head of Lajuwa|url=https://africa.uima.uiowa.edu/chapters/ancient-africa/ife/?start=3|author=William Dewey|work=Africa Uima at U-Iowa|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is named but not numbered in the '''list A''', but is taken into account in three other lists. Tagged as # 5.5. 
# Some sources are naming Osinkola the #47 Ooni, elected for two months in 1910. In any case, the identification is clear, while Osinkola is the Ruling House name. Replaced by Adekola.

=== Typographic issues ===
Printing fixes everything, even the typographic issues.
# The two printed quotations&lt;ref name=Ojuade /&gt;&lt;ref name=Obayemi /&gt; of the printed Ojo Bada&lt;ref name=OjoBada/&gt; have discrepancies: Otaataa=Otasasa, Arirereokewe=Arirekewe, Lajamusan=Lajamisan.
#  When Awosemo 1985 (quoted by  Sina Ojuade&lt;ref name=Ojuade/&gt;) says Giesi before Ogboruu, this is probably a typo. Indeed, all other sources are saying that Ogboruu #23 was the maternal grand father of Giesi #24.
# The quotation of Ademakinwa&lt;ref name=Obayemi/&gt; (p158) uses Kworokolokun: this is probably Aworokolokun.
# In column x86, Lagunja is repeated. How to correct ?
# Perhaps Ologundu 2008 ranging Osinkola #18 at place #25 is also a typo ?

=== Remaining discrepancies ===
# In '''list A''', Lajamisan is ranked #11. This can be tracked to the 1973 Daily Sketch kinglist&lt;ref name=Obayemi /&gt; (p158). This is strange since a list from start to Lajamisan should end by Lajamisan. Moving this one just before Otujabiojo #17 would synchronize the ordering of all the kinglists from Oduduwa to Lajamisan. This should be checked in detail.
# While '''list A''' sources put both Aworokolokin and Ajuimuda Ekun before Lajamisan,  most of the '''list B''' sources are saying that Aworokolokin, Ajuimuda and Ekun were three descendants of Lajodoogun. We can only  underline the discrepancy. Moreover, Ologundu don't quote Aworokolokin at all in his lists. (green in the table).
# The same occurs with the only woman that became Ooni. Most of the time, she is quoted as "Luwoo Gbagida" #18 and placed before Lajodogun #19. But also as "Luwo (Female)" and placed after Giesi #24. (green in the table).
# Efon Ayioye #6 in Awoyinfa is quite surely the same person as "Ayioye" in Bada and Fasogbon. But they are not ranked the same by the sources relatively to Ajimuda Ekun #7. Perhaps this was the reason of the comment ''no matter how ripe the okra is, it cannot be older than itself''.
# 9 names aren't part of list A or list B.

"''At least, it can be said that the existence of numerous variants requires explanation, and an interpretation can be assessed according to how satisfactorily it accounts for their existence.

A '''mantle''' ({{lang-el|μανδύας|translit='''mandyas'''}}; [[Church Slavonic]]: мантия, '''''mantiya''''') is an ecclesiastical garment in the form of a very full cape that extends to the floor, joined at the neck, that is worn over the outer garments. 

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], the mantle  is a monastic garment worn by [[bishop]]s, [[hegumen]]s, [[archimandrite]]s, and other monastics in processions and while attending various church services, such as [[Vespers]] or [[Matins]]; but not when vested to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]]. Unlike the Western [[cope]], the mantle is worn only by monastics. The [[klobuk]] is worn over the mantle.

== History ==
[[Image:Antropov Archbishop Gavriil.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[archbishop]] Gavriil wearing an episcopal mandyas (Alexey Andropov, 1774, [[State Russian Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]
[[Image:Isidore of Pelusium (Menologion of Basil II).jpg|thumb|right|Painting of the monk [[Isidore of Pelusium]], wearing a black mantle, from the Menologion of Basil II, 11th Century.]]

The mantle was originally a cape worn simply to ward off the cold. The mantle was first mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], as a garment worn by several prophets including [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]].  In {{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:11-14|KJV}}, the mantle passing from Elijah the prophet, to Elisha, his successor,  symbolizes the passing of prophetic authority: 
:And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
:And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 
:He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 
:And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the {{LORD}} God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. 

Depictions of monks on [[icon]]s show the mantle in use from the earliest Christian times. The original monastic mantle was of simple material: black, brown or grey, depending on what was at hand. As time went on, the use of mantles of a particular color and style came to be established as specific monastic vesture. Over the years distinguishing colors and ornamentation came to be applied to the mantle to distinguish monastics of higher positions within the church, while still reminding them of the need for monastic humility.

In the contemporary practice of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Monks &amp; Nuns wear solid black mantles. They also wear veils, differing between traditions and rank. In common practice, monks wear a black veil that covers a [[Kalimavkion]], a cylindrical hat. Abbesses also wear this same veil and hat while nuns only wear the veil. The practice of wearing a kalimavkion below the veil has only arisen in the last 300 years, and prior to this period, monks either wore no veil, or wore a pointed veil, as seen in many Russians of the old rite and icons of African saints. Nuns have been wearing a veil, in addition to the mantle since at least the 11th Century.

==Monastics==
[[File:Sergius of Radonezh vita icon (17 c., Yaroslavl museum) 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Icon]] of Saint [[Sergius of Radonezh]] wearing the black monastic mantle.]]

The monastic mantle is worn by Orthodox Christian [[monk]]s and [[Nun#Eastern Orthodox Christian|nun]]s of the [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism#Stavrophore|Lesser Schema]] and [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism#Great Schema|Great Schema]]. In the Greek practice the use of the mantle by those of the Lesser Schema is less common. (It is not worn by [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism#Rassaphore|Rassaphores]]). The mantle worn by a simple monk or nun is black (black being the traditional monastic color, symbolizing mourning over one's sins and a reminder of the [[vow of poverty]]), joined at the neck and hanging down to the feet. In the Russian tradition, the mantle is usually pleated (33 pleats for the number of years in the earthly life of [[Jesus]]). It may or may not have a train. Over the centuries, much symbolic meaning has come to be attributed to the mantle: 

"[The] mantle is a monastic vestment, which covers the whole person with the exception of the head. Its freely flowing lines typify the wings of the Angels; hence it is called "the Angelic vestment." The folds of the Mantle are symbolical of the all-embracing power of God; and also of the strictness, piety and meekness of the monastic life; and that the hands and other members of a monk do not live, and are not fitted for worldly activity, but are all dead."&lt;ref&gt;Isabel F. Hapgood, ''Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church'', (Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese, 1975), p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[The mantle] is called 'the garment of incorruption and purity' [in the text of the [[Tonsure]] ceremony], and the absence of sleeves is to remind the monk that he is debarred from worldly pursuits. The mantle is given him in token of the 'exalted angelic state' which he assumes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The mantle is bestowed upon a monk when he becomes as Stavrophore (Lesser Schema), for which reason this rank of monk is sometimes referred to as a "mantle monk". The mantle is bestowed a second time if he becomes a Schemamonk (Greater Schema).

An [[Hegumen]] (Abbot) or [[Hegumenia]] (Abbess) wears the simple monastic mantle.

When an Orthodox monk or nun dies, they are vested in their [[religious habit]]. A strip of cloth is torn from the bottom of their mantle and is used to bind their body three times: around the chest, around the waist, and around the feet.

==Archimandrites==
The mantle worn by an archimandrite will be joined in front at the bottom as well as at the neck, and will have "tablets" or "pectorals" (Greek: πόματα, ''pómata''; Slavonic: ''skrizhali'')&amp;mdash;rectangular pieces of red or green cloth  sewn onto the corners of the mantle (i.e., two at the neck and two at the feet). The upper two tablets (those at the neck) will often be [[embroidery|embroidered]] with [[Christian cross|crosses]]. The tablets symbolize the fact that the Archimandrite will guide the brethren according to the commandments of God.  The four tablets being symbolic of the Old and the [[New Testament]]s, and of the Four Gospels.

When an archimandrite dies, his mantle is laid on his coffin in place of a [[Pall (funeral)|funeral pall]].

==Bishops==
There is also an episcopal mantle which is not worn with the other episcopal [[Vestment#Eastern Church vestments|vestment]]s while celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]], but when the bishop formally enters the church beforehand, or when a bishop is formally attending (i.e., presiding over) a service in which he is not serving.  Among the Greeks, it is common for all bishops regardless of rank, to wear a red mantle; however, many also use purple during [[Great Lent]].  In the Slavic tradition, a more complex color scheme has developed, and hierarchs wear different-colored mantles according to their rank: violet for bishops; plum for [[archbishop]]s; blue for [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s; and green for [[patriarch]]s in the Russian tradition. Different national churches have different traditions regarding the colors worn by bishops.

In the Russian tradition, the episcopal mantiya is characteristically decorated with red and white horizontal ribbons, called "rivers" or "streams" (Greek: ποταμοί, ''potamoí''; Slavonic: ''Istochniki''), symbolizing the word of God going out into the entire world ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:1-12|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||John|7:38|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|22:1|KJV}}). Among the Greeks, these rivers are usually gold.

The tablets on the Bishop's mantle may be more finely embroidered or made of more costly material than those on the mantle of an archimandrite. The upper tablets (those at the neck) may be embroidered with icons; those at the feet may be embroidered with the bishop's monogram. The episcopal tablets symbolise the four [[Gospel]]s which must be the focus of a bishop's teachings. The episcopal mantle always has a train on it,&lt;ref&gt; There may be some parallel between the development of the episcopal mantle and the [[cappa magna]] used in the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have small bells attached as well, recalling the bells attached to the Robe of the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:33-34|KJV}}).

In general, when a bishop celebrates any service other than the Divine Liturgy (or when he is attending, but not celebrating Liturgy), he will wear the mantle with the [[Epitrachelion]], the [[Omophorion]] (the latter being worn outside the mantle), and, in some liturgical traditions, the [[Epimanikia|Cuffs]]. He will also stand on an [[Orlets]].

When a bishop dies, his mantle is laid on his coffin in place of a [[Pall (funeral)|funeral pall]].

'''Max Robert Engman''' (27 September 1945 in [[Helsinki]]), is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[historian]] and [[translator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-EngmanMax Engman, Max.] ''Uppslagsverket Finland.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Engman, who 1968–1973 was an official at the [[National Archives of Finland|Finnish national archive]]s in Helsinki, published 1983 a much noticed dissertation about [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Finland]]. He was appointed professor 1985 in general history at [[Åbo Akademi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landstinget.sormland.se/Startsida/153/Nyheter/Arets-historiepris-till-Max-Engman-/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115000004/http://www.landstinget.sormland.se/Startsida/153/Nyheter/Arets-historiepris-till-Max-Engman-/ |archivedate=2008-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engman has in his research foremost studied the [[Finland-Russia relations|Finnish-Russian relations]] and the European empires. He has also studied constitutional issues and the administration. His contribution as subeditor for ''Historisk Tidskrift för Finland'' 1971–1982 and the journals editor in chief 1982–2000 is considered as great.

'''Merdiban''' was an accounting method used by the [[Ottoman empire]], [[Abbasid empire]], and [[Ilkhanate]]; especially for recording [[Taxation|tax]] payments and liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Napier, Haniffa|title=Islamic Accounting|year=2012|isbn=9781848442207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "Merdiban" is derived from "merdiven", a word of Persian origin, meaning "''staircase''" or "''ladder''". The Ottomans themselves generally called this method "muhasebe usulü" (method of accounting).

==History==
Abbasid accounting techniques were inherited by the [[Ilkhanate]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire]]; spanning several centuries until modern double-entry accounting was adopted post-[[Tanzimat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darling|title=Ottoman Accounting Prehistory|journal=Proceedings of the 12th World Congress of Accounting Historians|date=July 2008|volume=3|pages=2421–2433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merdiban originated in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]; the first likely example has been found in an eighth-century government document.&lt;ref name=Napier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Christopher|title=Defining Islamic accounting: current issues, past roots|journal=Accounting History|volume=14|pages=121–144|doi=10.1177/1032373208098555|url=http://ach.sagepub.com/content/14/1-2/121.full.pdf+html|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the conquest of [[Baghdad]] by Mongol forces in 1258, many Persian and Arab officials were employed by the Ikhanate. As the Mongols lacked strong state institutions, local systems were adopted, including accounting techniques. For instance, the Abbasids had a kind of daily ledger called a Defter-ul Yevmiye; the Ilkhanate adopted the same kind of daily ledger but called it Ruznamce. (The later Ottoman ruznamçe was similar).&lt;ref name="Güvemli"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Güvemli|first=Batuhan|title=: Development of the Merdiban Method in the Ilkhanate State (1251 – 1353 a.d.) and its transition to the Ottoman State  accountancy|journal=Revista Española de Historia de la Contabilidad|date=June 2011|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ghazan]] (1295–1304) made fiscal reforms; these drove more detailed record-keeping and, hence, further development of accounting techniques. Centralised fiscal record-keeping was divided according to provinces, and each team reported to a ''katip'' (which roughly corresponds to "clerk") - the same title used in the Abbasid state. "Katip" continued to be used to describe Ottoman accountants, although their official title was ''halife''.&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt; The Risale-i Felekiyye, written in 1363 by Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Kiya Al-Mazandarani, was a manual of accounting, and is an important source for modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solas|author2=Otar|title=The Accounting System Practiced in the Near East During the Period 1220-1350 Based on the Book Risale-I Felekiyye|date=June 1994|volume=21|issue=1|pages=117–135|jstor=40698133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique set out in the Risale begins to resemble a crude early attempt at [[Double entry accounting|double-entry accounting]], but there is little evidence that this influenced the development of modern double-entry accounting in Italy.&lt;ref name=Napier/&gt;

It is possible that other states used accounting systems based on merdiban, but documentary evidence is sparse.&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt;

==Method==
In the Ottoman empire, accounting was not taught systematically in [[madrasah]]s or other schools; instead, it was taught on a master-apprentice basis in the workplace, especially the [[Hazine-i Amire]] (finance ministry). So, few instruction documents survive from this era.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Merdiban was named because of the descending sequence in which amounts were recorded; a total at the top, and then individual items below. Typically, the last letter of the first word in an entry would be extended all the way across a line from left to right, acting as a separator between entries.&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt;

Mediban was usually recorded in ''[[siyakat]]'' script;&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt; a specialised and condensed form of text, almost stenographic, which was used where much of the content was numerical. Siyakat was so widely associated with accounting and fiscal documents that it became a synonym.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Mid’hat bey Frashëri was the son of prominent Albanian politician and statesman from 19th century [[Abdyl Frashëri]] (who initiated the movement of a wide autonomy from Ottoman Empire) and nephew of the poets and nationalists [[Naim Frashëri]] and [[Sami Frashëri]].&lt;ref name="Skendi185186"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych165"/&gt; He was born in Janina in the Ottoman Empire (present day [[Ioannina]], Greece) in 1880 and was raised in [[Istanbul]],&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mid’hat bey Frashëri:The Epirus Question - the Martyrdom of a People |author=Robert Elsie |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_1/AH1942.html |accessdate=18 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723010338/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_1/AH1942.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where his family worked in the Ottoman administration and organised the [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian nationalist movement]]. In 1897 Mid'hat Frashëri was arrested by Ottoman authorities for having a copy of the newspaper [[Albania (periodical)|Albania]], and was released after intervention by his uncle Sami Frashëri.&lt;ref name="Gawrych91"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=91.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1901, Mid'hat Frashëri published a biography on his uncle Naim Frashëri.&lt;ref name="Gawrych90"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=90.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving up his studies of [[pharmacology]], he worked for the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the vilayet of [[Salonika]] from 1905 to 1910.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt; Frashëri published a yearly [[almanac]] ''Kalendari Kombiar'' (National Calendar) that was printed in [[Sofia]] and distributed in the Balkans from there.&lt;ref name="Skendi185186"/&gt; The publication held moderate positions were Frashëri  advocated for national unity, development of Albanian education, schools and literature and opposed foreign power intervention in Albanian affairs.&lt;ref name="Skendi185186"/&gt; Frashëri also called for government reforms an alliance with [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] to achieve those aims, but he was against armed resistance.&lt;ref name="Skendi185186"/&gt; Regarding the Albanian question and geopolitics, Frashëri was known in Albanian circles of the time to be anti-Austro-Hungarian and anti-Italian.&lt;ref name="Skendi369"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=369.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the pen name Lumo Skendo,&lt;ref name="Skendi185186"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=185–186.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he began publishing the weekly newspaper "''Lirija''" in Salonika, which lasted until 1910.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skend360370"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=360, 370.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych165"/&gt; He participated in the Congress of Monastir in 1908, and in January of the next year, he began editing a monthly magazine entitled "''Diturija''", a magazine based on the cultural, literary and scholarly interest of Albania.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych165"/&gt; In 1908, the Albanian club dealing with cultural and political issues was founded in Salonika and Frashëri was voted by 400 Albanian delegates as its president.&lt;ref name="Skendi331346"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=331, 346.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych165"/&gt; Frashëri favoured the Salonika club being the headquarters of the [[Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language|Bashkimi (Union) Society]] however other Albanian clubs concerned about Young Turk influence in the city rejected that view and instead opted for the Monastir club.&lt;ref name="Skendi350"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=350.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman authorities forbid writing in Albanian that resulted in publications being published abroad and like other writers of the time Frashëri used a pseudonym '''Mali Kokojka''' to bypass those restrictions for his works.&lt;ref name="Skendi128"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=128.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1911, Frashëri had joined the [[Freedom and Accord Party]] which was founded by him and ten others who were opponents of the Young Turks and advocated for [[Ottomanism]], government decentralisation and the rights of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Gawrych190"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=190.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress of Monastir===
{{main|Congress of Manastir}}
[[File:Mit’hat Frashëri (2).jpg|thumb|143px|left|Young Mid’hat Frashëri.]]
Mid’hat Frashëri was one of the fifty delegates that who helped form the modern [[Albanian alphabet]].&lt;ref name="Skendi370372"/&gt; He became vice-chairman of the commission. Frashëri was also elected chairman of the congress which was responsible for the organization of the various alphabet proposals&lt;ref name="Skendi370372"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych165"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=165.}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Parashqevi Qiriazi]] who was chairwoman of the commission of the alphabet. During the alphabet congress Frashëri supported the adoption of the Latin character Istanbul alphabet for writing the Albanian language.&lt;ref name="Skendi370372"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Midhat%20Frash%C3%ABri&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=370–372.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albanian Declaration of Independence===
{{main|Albanian Declaration of Independence}}
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Deklarata e pavarsisë së shqipërisë.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Albanian Declaration of Independence]]]] --&gt;
Mid’hat bey’s political views took on a nationalist character during the [[Balkan Wars]] and in the final collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] when Albania was on the verge of being carved up by its Balkan neighbours. Unlike some of his cousins who remained in what later became Turkey, Frashëri moved to Albania after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Gawrych200"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Midhat%20Frash%C3%ABri&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=200.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid’hat Frashëri was one of the eighty-three leaders meeting in Vlorë in November 1912. He was one of the signers of the declaration of independence and became the Minister of Public Services in the [[Provisional Government of Albania]]. He later became the Albanian consul general in [[Belgrade]] and postmaster general.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt; At the beginning of [[World War I]], Mid'hat was interned in [[Romania]] for a time, but after he was released, he returned to publishing. Mid’hat resided in [[Lausanne]] for a time with his cousin [[Mehdi Frashëri]], where he was author of a number of newspaper articles and essays.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt; On 25 November 1920, he was appointed chairman of the Albanian delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], where he remained until 1922.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt; In Paris, he continued his journalistic activities in the French press to publicize Albania’s position in the postwar restructuring of Europe. He subsequently held other ministerial posts and was Albanian ambassador to Greece and to the United States from 1922 to 1926.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt;

===Quiet period===
[[File:Këlçyra, Frashëri, Orollogaj.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Balli Kombëtar leaders [[Ali Këlcyra]], Mid'hat Frashëri, [[Thoma Orollogaj]] (from left to right) in [[Berat]].]]
Under the [[Zog of Albania|Zog]] regime in 1925, Mid’hat left public life and opened a bookstore in [[Tirana]], and also worked as a pharmacist. He himself possessed an exceptionally large private library of some 20,000 volumes, the largest collection in the country at the time. With the rise of Germany and [[World War II]] looking inevitable, Mid'hat began forming the National Front (Balli Kombëtar) to use in the war to create [[Ethnic Albania]].

===Balli Kombëtar presidency===
{{main|Balli Kombëtar}}
He was the leader of the Balli Kombëtar nationalist movement during the [[Second World War]]. Balli Kombëtar was a political organization that mainly fought for an Ethnic Albania and fought antifascists groups in alliance with the German occupation forces. During 1944 he joined the German Forces as an ally and fought the anti-nazi guerrilla groups.&lt;ref&gt;Petter Abbott, Partisan Warfare 1941 - 45, 27, Owen Pearson, II, 379, Bideleux Robert &amp; Jeffries Ian, The Balkans - A post - communist History, 2007, 525&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin became the prime minister of Albania.

===After World War II and death===
In 1945, the communists won the war in Albania. Mid'hat escaped the communists by fleeing to southern Italy. The early years of the cold war found Mid’hat Frashëri in the West trying to patch together a coalition of anti-communist opposition forces in Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt; In August 1949, he was elected as head of a [["Free Albania" National Committee]]. He died of a heart attack at the Lexington Hotel on Lexington Avenue in New York&lt;ref name="albanianhistory1"/&gt; and was buried in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in New York.

His cousin, [[Mehdi Frashëri]], served as Albanian Prime Minister under a [[Nazi Germany|German]]-backed [[Albania under Germany|Albanian Government]].

==Legacy==
Mid'hat Frashëri was a man of short stature with a speech impediment. He was a beloved leader and also a [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]].&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;Frances Trix, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zyF_-9TtoUsC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Midhat+Frasheri&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mQEOTdeJBJG8vgOP-JzfDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Sufi journey of Baba Rexheb''], University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; His library, one of the finest in the Balkans, became the basis for the Albanian National Library. Frashëri's entire library of some 20,000 volumes, the largest in [[Albania]] at that time, was confiscated by the new regime. The library included significant albanological works inherited from [[Franz Nopcsa von Felsö-Szilvás]].&lt;ref&gt;The issue of Epirus in political writings of Mid'hat bey Frashëri -  Halili, Rigels - Nationalities Affairs – Issue 31/2007.

He was described by an Italian journalist as a man who dressed very properly with very clean white cuffs and very white hair.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Although Frashëri was one of the signers of the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] in 1912, the Communists, after taking over in 1945, deleted his name from the official documents.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

==Quotes==
When Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire:

Now they must live and work for themselves, for their Albania&lt;ref&gt;The Albanians: an ethnic history from prehistoric times to the present by {{Cite book |last = Jacques|first=Edwin E. |title=The Albanians: An Ethnic History from Prehistoric Times to the Present |publisher=McFarland |year=1995| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJ2s9sQ9bGkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Albanians:+an+ethnic+history+from+prehistoric+times+to+the+present&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GrALTYPoO4amcO2CvK0K&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

:"These 'Quislings' are no longer Albanian. They have forgotten how to be Albanian"&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

[[File:Sextant TakiyüddinRasid TopkapiPalaceMuseum.jpg|thumb|150px|Ottoman observatory [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[astrology|astrologers]] headed by the ''[[müneccimbaşı]]'' (chief astrologer) using the [[sextant]].]]
'''Ahmed Lütfullah''' (early 17th century – 27 February 1702), better known by his court title of '''Münejjim Bashi''' ({{lang-tr|Müneccimbaşı}}; "Chief [[Astrologer]]"), was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] courtier, scholar, [[Sufi]] poet and historian. His chief work is the ''Jamiʿ al-Duwal'', a [[world history]] particularly valuable for the history of the medieval Muslim dynasties of the regions around the southwestern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]] ([[Adharbayjan]], [[Shirvan]], [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], [[Derbent]]). In [[Turkish literature]], he is referred to also as Ahmed Lütfullah.

==Biography==
His father Lütfullah was a native of [[Ereğli, Konya]], but Ahmed was born in [[Salonica]] sometime in the first half of the 17th century (in 1631 according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'').{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}}&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{Britannica|397479|Ahmed Dede Müneccimbaşı}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Mevlevi]] [[dervish]] lodge in the quarter of [[Kasımpaşa (quarter)|Kasımpaşa]], spending 15 years there under the supervision of Sheikh Halil Dede.{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}} After studies on [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]], he advanced to the position of chief court astrologer (''[[müneccimbaşi]]'') in 1667/8. He enjoyed his greatest prominence under Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] (reigned 1648–87), who in 1675/6 raised him to the rank of ''musahib-i [[padishah]]i'' ("imperial companion"), signifying his admittance to the innermost circle of the court.{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}}&lt;ref name="Guboglu"&gt;Mihail Guboglu – Cronici turceşti privind ţările române Vol. II –Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste România, Bucureşti 1974&lt;/ref&gt; He retained the post until Mehmed IV's deposition in November 1687, when he was exiled to [[Ottoman Egypt|Egypt]],  where his adopted son [[Moralı Hasan Pasha]] served as governor. After some time he moved to [[Mecca]], where he became the sheikh of the local Mevlevi lodge. In 1693/4 he moved to [[Medina]] for seven years. In 1700, he was recalled to Istanbul to work again as chief astrologer, but declined the offer because of his old age. He returned to Mecca, where he died on 27 February 1702. His tomb was located near the mausoleum of [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]], the first wife of [[Muhammad]].{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}}&lt;ref name="Guboglu"/&gt;

== Works ==
=== ''The Compendium of Nations'' ===
Münejjim Bashi's main work is the ''Jamiʿ al-Duwal'' ("The Compendium of Nations"), written in [[Arabic]].{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}}&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; It was begun at the behest of [[Grand Vizier]] [[Kara Mustafa Pasha|Kara Mustafa]], who instructed him to prepare a comprehensive historical work.&lt;ref name="Hatice"&gt;Hatice Arslan-Sözüdogru -  Müneccimbasi als Historiker - [[Islamkundliche Untersuchungen]] Band 289, Klaus Schwarz Verlag,
{{ISBN|978-3-87997-363-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[world history]], beginning with [[Adam]] and ending in Ottoman times, in the year 1678. It is divided into three parts: the history of Muhammad, the history of pre- and non-Islamic dynasties, and the history of Islamic dynasties, concluding with the history of the Ottoman dynasty until 1678.{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}}&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; His work is especially valuable as it preserves information from several sources now lost, especially on many minor Muslim dynasties overlooked by major historians. This is particularly the case on his use of the lost ''Taʾrikh Bab al-Abwab'' ("History of [[Derbent]]"), which provides much information on the dynasties of eastern [[Transcaucasia]], [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] and [[Adharbayjan]].{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}} His pre-Islamic section is also notable, as he used Roman and Jewish sources, as well as West European chronicles, and was the first Islamic historian to deal with dynasties like the [[Babylonians]], the [[Seleucids]] and the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]]. His work also includes sections on [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and [[History of China|China]].&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Although several manuscript copies of the original Arabic work are known to exist, the ''Jamiʿ al-Duwal'' was for long best known and accessible through a Turkish translation by [[Ahmed Nedim]] in the 18th century, known as ''Saha'if al-Akhbar'' ("The Pages of the Chronicle").{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}}&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Although [[epitomized]], Nedim's version "is very readable and not composed in the highflown literary style that prevailed in his period".{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}} The work notably provided the main material for [[Vladimir Minorsky]]'s magisterial ''Studies in Caucasian history'' (London 1953) and ''A history of Sharvan and Darband'' (Cambridge 1958).{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}} The original manuscript, considered lost for a long time, is kept partly at the Library of the [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] and the rest at the Library of the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Sarayi Museum]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="Guboglu"/&gt;

In his Chistory, Münejjim Bashi follows the method used in Islamic historiography by [[Ibn Khaldun]], indicating his sources and submitting them to a critical investigation.&lt;ref name="Hatice"/&gt;

===Other works===
Although best known for his history, Münejjim Bashi also wrote numerous other works, such as a collection of poems (''[[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]]'') on mystical themes under the [[pen-name]] "Ashik" ("lover"), a ''Lata'if-name'', treatises on geometry, music and mysticism, theological commentaries, and a translation of anecdotes of the bawdy bard and often homoerotic Persian satyrist [[Ubayd Zakani]].{{sfn|Kramers|1993|pp=572–573}}&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guboglu"/&gt;

An important work is ''Hasia'', a commentary of the interpretation of the [[Qur’an]] ''Tafsir al-baydawi al-musamma anwar altanzil wa asrar'' by [[Baidawi|Al Baidawi]].&lt;ref name="Guboglu"/&gt;

Of the other works written by Müneccimbaşi the following are worth mentioning:

* ''Şerh-i kitâb-ı Ahlâk'' - annotations on the [[ethics]] book of [[Qadi Adudun]].
* ''Talikat 'ala Uklidi'' – a treaty of [[geometry]].
* ''Vesilet ül-Vüsûl ilâ Ma'rifet İl-Hamli vel-Mahmûl'' - the science of [[logic]].
* ''Risale-i Mûsikiyye'' - a treaty of music.
* ''Feyz-ül-Harem'' – a presentation of the city of Mecca and its environment, meant mainly as a guide for pilgrims during their  [[Hajj]]
* ''Cayet-ül-Beyân fi Dekaik-i ilm-ül-Beyân'' – a study on the use of the [[metaphor]],

The '''National Day of Catalonia'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencat.cat/diada/eng/ National Day of Catalonia - Generalitat de Catalunya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707085535/http://www.gencat.cat/diada/eng/ |date=7 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ca|Diada Nacional de Catalunya}} {{IPA-ca|diˈaðə nəsi.uˈnal də kətəˈluɲə|}}) is a day-long festival in [[Catalonia]] and one of its official [[National symbols of Catalonia|national symbols]], celebrated annually on 11 September. It commemorates the [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–14)|fall]] of [[Barcelona]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1714 and the subsequent loss of Catalan institutions and laws.&lt;ref&gt;When the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] was signed between April and July, the [[Principality of Catalonia]] remained (alongside Majorca) the only realm of which still fought for the cause of Charles III. By 9 July, the General Estates of Catalonia decided to continue the war in order to defend the Catalan constitutions&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Catalonia}}
The [[Army of Catalonia (1713–14)|Army of Catalonia]] that initially fought in support of the Habsburg dynasty's claim to the Spanish throne were finally defeated at the [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–1714)|Siege of Barcelona]] by the army of the Bourbon king [[Philip V of Spain]] on 11 September 1714 after 14 months of siege. That meant the loss of the [[Catalan constitutions]] and the institutional system of the [[Principality of Catalonia]] under the aegis of the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], and the establishment of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercader, J. ''Felip V i Catalunya.'' (Barcelona, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday was first celebrated on 11 September 1886. In 1888, coinciding with the inauguration of the [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition|Barcelona Universal Exposition]], a statue in honor of [[Rafael Casanova]] was set up, which would become the point of reference of the events of the Diada. The celebration gained popularity over the following years; the Diada of 1923 was a great mass event, with more than a thousand floral offerings, acts throughout Catalonia and a certain institutional participation. But the demonstrations caused 17 wounded, five policemen and 12 protesters, and several arrests. The dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] banned the celebration. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1939), the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] (the autonomous government of Catalonia) institutionalized the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiuhistoric.bcn.cat/onzesetembre/1931/la-commemoracio-durant-la-segona-republica-i-la-guerra-civil La conmemoració durant la Segona República i la Guerra Civil.] arxiuhistoric.bcn.cat&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suppressed by [[Francoist Spain]] in 1939, and relegated to the family and private sphere, but continued to be celebrated clandestinely. The monument of Rafael Casanova was removed. Since 1940 the [[National Front of Catalonia]] took advantage of the day to carry out some propaganda actions: distribution of [[anti-fascist]] leaflets, clandestine hanging of senyeres, etc. It was celebrated publicly for the first time again on 11 September 1976, followed by [[Catalan autonomy protest, 1977|a huge demonstration]] demanding Catalan autonomy in Barcelona the next year, on 11 September 1977, in which the Casanova's statue was repositioned in its place, and the celebration was reinstated officially in 1980 by the Generalitat de Catalunya, upon its restoration after the Francoist State, becoming the first law approved by the restored [[Parliament of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0047406&amp;BATE=l%2520Onze%2520de%2520Setembre "Onze de Setembre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210141646/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0047406 |date=10 December 2011 }}, in: ''[[Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana]]'' (online)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations==
Nationalist organizations, political parties and institutions traditionally lay floral offerings at monuments of those who led the defence of the city such as [[Rafael Casanova]] and [[Josep Moragues i Mas|General Moragues]], marking their stand against the king [[Philip V of Spain]]. Typically, [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]] organize demonstrations and meet at the [[Fossar de les Moreres]] in Barcelona, where they pay homage to the defenders of city who died during the siege and were buried there. Throughout the day, there are patriotic demonstrations and cultural events in many Catalan villages and many citizens wave [[Senyera|senyeres]] and [[estelada|estelades]]. The event has become more explicitly political and particularly focused on independence rallies in the 2010s.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/10/catalans-celebrate-national-day-independence-protests |title= Catalans to celebrate Their National Day with Independence Protests |last=Jones |first=Sam |date=10 September 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Christopher''' (born 1948, Cyprus) is an Australian author and photographer who writes about [[shipwreck]]s and [[riverboat]]s.
He is also a Director of the not for profit organisation, Clipper Ship ''City of Adelaide''  Ltd (CSCOAL), set up to save the 1864 clipper ship, ''[[City of Adelaide (1864)|City of Adelaide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;'Who are we' at http://cityofadelaide.org.au/who-we-are.html, retrieved 20 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter is the author of seven books,co-author of another and co-editor of another.  Australia’s large collection of original operating paddle steamers has been the subject of three decades of research by Peter, and hence the subject of two of his seven books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/14/2216130.htm|title=Dry Murray reveals past secrets|last=Brice|first=Rebecca |date=14 April 2008|work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation - ABC News|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,26125735-5006301,00.html|title= Crusade to solve maritime mystery|last=Kemp|first=Miles|date=26 September 2009 |work=The Advertiser (Adelaide, Australia)|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1967, Peter has been an active [[Scuba Diving|scuba diver]] and volunteer maritime archaeologist who has visited and documented wrecks in [[South Australia]] (SA) in particular, but also around Australia. Peter's contribution to [[maritime archaeology]] was recognised by an Award presented to him by the Australian Government in 1982 and by the award of a life membership by the [[Society for Underwater Historical Research]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;'Editorial', Soundings, October 2000, pp.2 , in Cowan, David (editor), (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Port Adelaide, SA, Society for Underwater Historical Research, ({{ISBN|978 0 9588006 6 2}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1765498?lookfor=subject:%22Australia%20-%20Dept.%20of%20Home%20Affairs.%22&amp;offset=12&amp;max=16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Peter was a member of the South Australian Government's inquiry into scuba diving deaths in fresh water sink-holes and underwater caves in the south east of SA.  The Report of the Committee "appointed to investigate safety precautions for Scuba Divers in Fresh Water Sink Holes and Underwater Caves" which was presented to the Government in January 1974 essentially recommended non-legislative response to the problem.  The subsequent voluntary program of regulation via diver training and certification has been carried out by the [[Cave Divers Association of Australia]].  The success of the program is evident with nearly four decades of low fatality cave diving following the implementation of the Report's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=South Australia.

(Laurence Desmond), 1923- | title=Report | publication-date=1973 | publisher=[The Committee]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Peter is not a full-time author; he worked as a senior Trade Union official, with his role until mid June 2015 being the Chief Industrial Officer of the Public Service Association of South Australia. He retired to focus on a volunteer role developing a seaport village for the historic 1864 clipper ship "City of Adelaide' in Port Adelaide's inner harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Lauren|title=Lunch with ...

'''Richard Harris Leigh''' (16 August 1943 – 21 November 2007) was a novelist and short story writer born in [[New Jersey]], United States to a British father and an American mother, who spent most of his life in the UK. Leigh earned a BA from [[Tufts University]], a master's degree from the [[University of Chicago]], and a Ph.D. from the [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]].

==''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''==
Leigh met his frequent co-author [[Michael Baigent]] while living in the United Kingdom in the 1970s. They subsequently struck a friendship with the writer and British television scriptwriter [[Henry Lincoln]] in 1975 and between them developed a conspiracy theory involving the [[Knights Templar]] and the alleged mystery of [[Rennes-le-Château]], proposing the existence of a secret that Jesus had not died on the Cross, but had married [[Mary Magdalene]] and fathered descendants who continued to exert an influence on European history.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;''The Telegraph'', 'Richard Leigh Obituary', 30 November 2007. Available online at [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1570965/Richard-Leigh.html www.telegraph.co.uk], retrieved (4 July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis was later put forward in their 1982 book, ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]''.

''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' achieved enormous commercial success and has been described as "one of the most controversial books of the 1980s".&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; It popularised the idea that the true object of the quest for the [[Holy Grail]] was to find [[Jesus bloodline|secret descendants of Jesus]] and Mary Magdalene. This bloodline is stated to have later married into a Frankish royal dynasty, the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]], and to be championed and protected by a secret society known as the [[Priory of Sion]]. These notions were later used as a basis for [[Dan Brown]]'s international best-selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

The day after publication, the authors had a public clash on [[BBC]] television with the [[Bishop of Birmingham]] and [[Marina Warner]].&lt;ref name="bishbirm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/arts-literature/news/article.cfm?c_id=18&amp;objectid=10372236 |title=The Kiwi trying to break the Code |author=Milne, Jonathan |date=12 March 2006 |work=[[Herald on Sunday]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book rapidly climbed the best-seller charts, and the authors published a sequel, ''[[The Messianic Legacy]]'', in 1986.

The book has been described as "a work thoroughly debunked by scholars and critics alike".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sherr Sklar, Donald L. Hoffman (editors), ''King Arthur In Popular Culture'', page 214 (McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2002). {{ISBN|0-7864-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthurian scholar [[Richard Barber]] has commented, "It would take a book as long as the original to refute and dissect ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' point by point: it is essentially a text which proceeds by innuendo, not by refutable scholarly debate".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Richard Barber, "The Search for Sources: The Case of the Grail", in [[Norris J. Lacy]], editor, ''A History of Arthurian Scholarship'', page 34 ([[Boydell &amp; Brewer|D. S. Brewer]], 2006). {{ISBN|978-1-84384-069-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
In 1991 Leigh published ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception]]'', co-authored with Baigent. The book follows the controversial theories of [[Robert Eisenman]] regarding the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

Two books of Leigh's fictional works have been published: ''Erceldoune &amp; Other Stories'' (2006), and ''Grey Magic'' (2007).

==Dan Brown suit==
Some of the ideas presented in Baigent's earlier book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'', were incorporated in the best-selling American novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', by [[Dan Brown]].&lt;ref name="stuff2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060629123618/http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3588181a10,00.html NZ author claims copyright breach in Da Vinci Code], 28 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Baigent and Leigh filed suit in a British court against Brown's publisher, [[Random House]], claiming [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070920083908/http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3588485a1860,00.html Kiwi author takes on Dan Brown], 1 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 2006 [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge [[Peter Smith (judge)|Peter Smith]] rejected the claim. On 28 March 2007, Baigent and Leigh lost their appeal, and were faced with legal bills of about £3m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=staff and agencies|title=Authors lose appeal over Da Vinci Code plagiarism|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/danbrown/story/0,,2044644,00.html|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Leigh died on 21 November 2007 in London from causes related to a heart condition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1570965/Richard-Leigh.html The Daily Telegraph 30 Nov 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was made up of military hardliners and settlers (migrants) from [[Sandžak]], a region divided between [[SR Serbia]] and [[SR Montenegro]] (see [[Bosniaks of Serbia]] and [[Bosniaks of Montenegro]]).{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|1999|p=194}} Commander [[Sefer Halilović]] and politician [[Ejup Ganić]] belonged to the faction.

According to Sarajevan writer Željko Vuković, Sandžak immigrants controlled most of the municipal, political and military power during the war.{{sfn|Helms|2016|p=72}} On the eve of the war, some 160,000 people of Sandžak origin lived in Sarajevo.{{sfn|Helms|2016|p=72}} There is a view that Sandžak immigrants were prior to the war second-class citizens, who during the war climbed the social ladder.{{sfn|Helms|2016|p=72}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">'''Self-referencing doomsday argument rebuttal'''s attempt to refute the [[Doomsday argument]] (that there is a credible link between the brevity of the [[human race]]'s existence and its expected [[human extinction|extinction]]) by applying the same reasoning to the lifetime of the Doomsday [[argument]] (DA) itself.

The first researchers to write about this were P. T. Landsberg and J. N. Dewynne in 1997; they applied belief in the DA to itself, and claimed that a paradox results.

== The paradox ==

If the DA's lifetime is governed by the [[principle of indifference]] and the [[Copernican principle]] then based on the length of its current existence, and assuming that it is randomly drawn from a [[reference class]] of probabilistic speculations it is 95% certain that it will be refuted before the year 2500.

If the DA is not itself subject to these principles then its assumption that the human race's survival-time can be modeled using them appears to be a [[paradox]] (to Lansberg &amp; Dewynne).

Alternatively, if the DA is subject to these presumptions, then as it is expected to expire (be refuted) earlier that its own prediction for the likely survival time of humanity there is a second paradox: The predictions of a theory concerning events to occur after it has been refuted (such as human extinction) are not logically meaningful. Conversely, if the DA survives until the end of human civilization (in the year 5000, say) then it will have dramatically beaten the odds against the expectations of the Copernican principle. This can create a paradox for an argument based on probability, as shown if future [[scenario]]s are broken into three groups:
# [[Human extinction]] occurs before the year 2,500 AD.
# Human extinction occurs after the year 2,500 AD and the DA is never refuted.
# Human extinction occurs after the year 2,500 AD but not before the DA is refuted.

The "quick extinction" in possibility 1 is considered fairly likely in those Doomsday arguments using the number of births as a reference class, but comparing like-for-like we should compare the length of time the DA survives before refutation with the length of ''time'' the human race survives before extinction. Therefore, [[J. Richard Gott]]'s (temporal) DA is used to calculate the probabilities of the three scenarios above:

# According to Gott's DA it is extremely unlikely that the human race will become extinct before the year 2,500 AD, as this would make us extremely special observers; applying the indifference principle to the duration of the human race makes the odds around 400:1 against ('''0.25%''' chance).
# If the Copernican principle applies to the lifetime of theories as well as species (depending on the reference class evidence says it does) then the chance of the (relatively young) DA surviving sustained critical analysis for the next 500 years = 22/500 = '''4.4%'''
# By eliminating the other two outcomes we are left with the third, that the human race will survive to see the Doomsday argument refuted. The chance of this = 100 - (4.4 + 0.25) =''' 95.35%'''

=== Paradoxical conclusion ===

If the Doomsday Argument can apply to itself it can be simultaneously right (as a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]]) and probably wrong (as a prediction).

Therefore, Landsberg and Dewynne argue that it is more likely that the Doomsday argument is wrong (even if its logic is correct) than that the human race will become extinct in 9,000 years (which the DA calculates at around 95% likely). The interesting paradox is that the ''Doomsday argument is probably wrong even assuming it to be completely right'' (in its 95% estimate).

== Extensions ==

In 2001 Bradley Monton and [[Sherrilyn Roush]] extended this by arguing that Gott's DA ''inevitably'' refutes itself.

== Critique ==

This "meta"-DA application of the concept to the DA itself, requires some assumptions that are not universally accepted:
# The hypothesis that the same reasoning can be applied to the lifetime of mathematical theories as can be applied to the survival time of a [[species]]. One difference is that evidence exists for the average "lifetime" of a scientific (falsifiable) prediction; there are libraries full of refuted, unrefuted, and forgotten papers published on mathematics. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
# The [[truth-value]] of the DA and the survival of the human race are un-[[correlated]] in the simple calculation above.
# The concept that the DA is susceptible to refutation; if the DA is not [[falsifiable]] then there is no mechanism for refuting it, even if it is false. This would make it incomparable to [[Wikt:mortal|mortal]] survival. (Landsberg &amp; Dewynne say that the DA is a [[physics|physical theory]] rather than a mathematical hypothesis, and that any such theory is inherently falsifiable, as "experience has shown that any theory in physics, however successful, is only an approximation to reality and will eventually be refuted and require modification." {{ref|Falsifiable}})

(A deterministic approach to a probabilistic argument is [[probability|probably]] inappropriate though.)

The annual death toll from terrorist attacks has risen from 164 in 2003 to 3318 in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/sep/29/why-they-get-pakistan-wrong/?pagination=false |title=Why They Get Pakistan Wrong by Mohsin Hamid |work=The New York Review of Books |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Agencies |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/250532/war-on-terror-pakistan-reminds-americans-of-its-sacrifices-with-an-ad/ |title=War on terror: Pakistan reminds Americans of its sacrifices, with an ad |work=The Express Tribune |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacekashmir.org/views-articles/2012/1216-growing-terrorism-in-pakistan.htm |title=Growing Terrorism in Pakistan |publisher=Peace Kashmir |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total of 35,000 Pakistanis killed between [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]] and May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318673 Pakistan: A failed state or a clever gambler?]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government of Pakistan, the direct and indirect economic costs of terrorism from 2000–2010 total $68 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/sep/29/why-they-get-pakistan-wrong/ Why they get Pakistan wrong]| Mohsin Hamid| NYRoB 29 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Asif Ali Zardari]], along with former President ex-[[Pakistan Army]] head [[Pervez Musharraf]], have admitted that terrorist outfits were "deliberately created and nurtured" by past governments "as a policy to achieve some short-term tactical objectives" The trend began with [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s controversial "[[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]]" policies of the 1980s, under which conflicts were started against Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Zia's tenure as president saw Pakistan's involvement in the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], which led to a greater influx of ideologically driven Muslims ([[mujahideen]]) to the [[FATA|tribal areas]] and increased availability of guns such as the [[AK-47]] and drugs from the [[Golden Crescent]].

The state and its [[Inter-Services Intelligence]], in alliance with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, encouraged the "mujahideen" to fight a [[proxy war]] against Soviet forces present in Afghanistan. Most of the mujahideen were never disarmed after the war ended in Afghanistan. 

From the summer of 2007 until late 2009, more than 1,500 people were killed in [[suicide attack|suicide]] and other attacks on civilians&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France Press]] [http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h2jRTJSm-efNfhS_Wm9wP1w_TB5Q Two bomb blasts kill 27 in northwest Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt; for reasons attributed to a number of causes – sectarian violence between [[Sunni]] and [[Shia Muslim]]s; easy availability of guns and explosives; the existence of a "[[Kalashnikov rifle|Kalashnikov]] culture"; an influx of ideologically driven Muslims based [[AfPak|in or near Pakistan]], who originated from various nations around the world and the subsequent war against the pro-Soviet Afghans in the 1980s which blew back into Pakistan; the presence of [[Islamist]] insurgent groups and forces such as the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NIH |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6020923/ |title=Terrorism in Pakistan: the psychosocial context and why it matters |work=British Journal of Psychology |date= |accessdate=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan is the 10th most dangerous country by criminality index.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maplecroft.com/portfolio/new-analysis/2016/12/01/risk-violent-crime-highest-latin-america-afghanistan-guatemala-mexico-top-country-ranking-verisk-maplecroft/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{See also|Pakistan and state terrorism}}
Terrorism in Pakistan originated with supporting the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], and the subsequent civil war that continued for at least a decade. The conflict brought numerous fighters from all over the world to [[South Asia]] in the name of jihad. The [[mujahideen]] fighters were trained by Pakistan's military, American CIA and other western intelligence agencies who carried out insurgent activities inside Afghanistan well after the war officially ended.
                      
Former Pakistan's army chief, Gen Raheel shareef accused longtime regional rival India, ill-focused on Pakistan, of seeking to undermine his country's $46 billion Gawader project to build an economic corridor to transport goods from China's western regions through Pakistan. Though, it is not uncommon for Pakistan and India to accuse one another on all troublesome issues. &lt;ref&gt;http://moderndiplomacy.eu/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1348:india-blatantly-destabilizing-pakistan&amp;Itemid=645&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Imposition of [[martial law]] in 1958, Pakistan's political situation suddenly changed and thereafter saw dictatorship type behaviour at different levels appearing in the civil service, the army and political forces or ''[[Zamindar]]s'' (landlords created by the British) who claimed power, probably because the British originally did not consider Pakistan an independent state, yet did not want to intervene; this trend continued into the 21st century, when finally, the US persuaded General [[Pervez Musharraf]] to hold elections. Other causes, such as political rivalry and business disputes, also took their toll. It was estimated in 2005 that more than 4,000 people had died in Pakistan in the preceding 25 years due to sectarian strife.&lt;ref name=SECTARIAN&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4289740.stm Pakistan 'extremist leader' held] [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==War on terrorism==
{{Main|War in North-West Pakistan}}
In 2004, the Pakistani army launched a pursuit of Al-Qaeda members in the mountainous area of [[Waziristan]] on the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] border, although sceptics question the sincerity of this pursuit. Clashes there erupted into a low-level conflict with Islamic militants and local tribesmen, sparking the [[Waziristan War]]. A short-lived truce known as the [[Waziristan accord]] was brokered in September 2006, This truce was broken by the Taliban. They misinterpreted the conditions of the truce that led to the annoyance of Pakistani government and armed forces that launched a military operation known as operation "Raha-e-Rast" against the Taliban in order to clear the area of Taliban.

In 2012, the Pakistani leadership sat down to sort out solutions for dealing with the menace of terrorism and in 2013, political parties unanimously reached a resolution on Monday 9, September 2013, at the All Parties Conference (APC), stating that negotiation with the militants should be pursued as their first option to counter terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/601864/prior-to-apc-imran-khan-briefly-meets-kayani-nawaz/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the terrorists attaks continuing in late 2013 the political leadership in Pakistan initiated a military operation against terrorists  named [[Operation Zarb-e-Azb]]; a joint military offensive  against various militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jundallah, al-Qaeda, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and the Haqqani network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/786641/us-commander-commends-zarb-e-azb-for-disrupting-haqqani-networks-ability-to-target-afghanistan/ US commander commends Zarb-e-Azb for disrupting Haqqani network's ability to target Afghanistan] 6 November 2014., ''[[The Express Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The operation was launched by the Pakistan Armed Forces on 15 June 2014 in North Waziristan (part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border) as a renewed effort against militancy in the wake of the 8 June attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, for which the TTP and the IMU claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27757264 Gunmen kill 13 at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport] 9 June 2014., [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''Theophilus Evans''' (February 1693 – 11 September 1767) was a Welsh clergyman and historian.

==Life==
Evans' father was from [[Pen-y-wenallt, Wales|Pen-y-wenallt]] and he was christened in the church in [[Llandygwydd]] in [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-EVAN-THE-1693.html Theophilus Evans], Welsh Biography Online, retrieved 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans served curacies in [[Brecknockshire]] and incumbencies in both counties. He is best known for his work ''Drych y Prif Oesoedd'' (Mirror of the Early Centuries) (1716; revised ed. 1740) where with some literary talent but with an absence of critical method (mixing history with legend) he endeavours to justify the independent [[Celtic Christianity|origins of British Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-EVAN-THE-1693.html Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Evans was supported by [[Sackville Gwynne]], the squire of [[Glanbrân]]. In 1727, Evans became the private chaplain of [[Marmaduke Gwynne]], Sackville's heir, but they eventually parted because of Gwynne's support for [[Howell Harris]] and the Methodist cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llgc.org.uk/fileadmin/documents/pdf/The_Journal_Marmaduke_Gwynne_Jason_Evans.pdf ''Marmaduke Gwynne (1691-1769) A Methodist Squire''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513075455/http://www.llgc.org.uk/fileadmin/documents/pdf/The_Journal_Marmaduke_Gwynne_Jason_Evans.pdf |date=13 May 2013 }}, llgc.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Harrison''' (18 April 1534 – 24 April 1593) was an English clergyman, whose ''Description of England'' was produced as part of the publishing venture of a group of [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|London stationers]] who produced [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles|Chronicles]]'' (1577 and 1587).  His contribution to Holinshed's work drew heavily on the earlier work of [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
William Harrison was born in London, in the parish of St. Thomas the Apostle, to John and Anne Harrison. As a boy, Harrison attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and the [[Westminster School]] of [[Alexander Nowell]]. Raised in [[Protestant]] circles, Harrison entered [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and in 1560 was awarded his bachelor's degree. During the reign of Queen [[Mary I of England]], Christ Church became a centre of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] support, and Harrison converted to Catholicism. Harrison claimed that he returned to Protestant belief before Mary's death in 1558 after hearing the words of [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]], [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]], and [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]], three Protestant [[martyr]]s burned at the stake in Oxford.

===Adulthood===
On 15 February 1559, prior to the award of his bachelor's degree at Oxford, Harrison was instituted as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[List of civil parishes in Essex|Radwinter]] in Essex, by the appointment of [[William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], who owned the right,&lt;ref&gt;GL, 9531/12 (Episcopal Register)&lt;/ref&gt; and to whom he was also household chaplain. The living brought with it an income of £40 a year.  Despite being well known to posterity for his description of England, at this time he had only travelled within a small compass in the south of England.&lt;ref&gt;"{{sic|Unt|ill|hide=y}} &lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE that "Untill" is an archaic spelling, correctly reflecting historical usage. --&gt; nowe of late," he wrote to his patron "except it were from the parish where I dwell, unto your Honour in Kent; or out of London where I was borne, unto Oxford and Cambridge where I have bene brought up, I never travelled 40 miles foorthright and at one journey in all my life." (Quoted in [http://www.bartleby.com/213/1503.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'', Vol. III. "Renascence and Reformation", XV. Chroniclers and Antiquaries. 3. Harrison’s Description of England]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison married Marion Isebrand, the daughter of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] immigrants. Continuing his theological studies at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Harrison took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1571. In the same year he was instituted vicar of Wimbish in Essex.&lt;ref&gt;GL, 9531/13 (Register)&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison also held positions at another two London parishes. Near the end of his life, Harrison received an appointment as a [[canon (priest)|canon]] at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St. George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]]. Harrison was buried at Windsor following his death in 1593.

==Works==
Harrison is best known for his ''Description of England'', first published in 1577 as part of ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'', and reissued in revised form in 1587. This work enumerated England's geographic, economic, social, religious and political features and represents an important source for historians interested in life in [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethan]] England. He gathered his facts from books, letters, maps, the notes of [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], and conversations with [[Antiquary|antiquaries]] and local historians like his friends [[John Stow]] and [[William Camden]]. He also used his own observation, experience and wit, and wrote in a conversational tone without pedantry, which has made the work a classic.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's ''Description of England'' found a place among the [[Harvard Classics]], (Vol. 35, Part 3), the "Harvard five-foot shelf".&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a compendium of [[Elizabethan England]] during the youth of [[William Shakespeare]]. "No work of the time contains so vivid and picturesque a sketch," was the assessment of ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'', ''eo. loc.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison also wrote a number of unpublished manuscripts, including ''The Great English Chronologie''. This work traced fortunes of the Christian church in history, stretching from [[Creation myth|creation]] to his own time. In the ''Chronologie'', Harrison revealed his sympathy with the [[Calvinist]] perspective of those seeking to reform the [[Church of England]]. At the same time, Harrison also indicated his distrust of the political intentions of England's [[Puritan]]s and his ultimate loyalty to England's ecclesiastical authorities.
