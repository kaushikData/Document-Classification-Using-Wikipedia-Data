'''Antiquities''' are objects from [[Ancient history|antiquity]]&lt;!-- Don't attempt to disam; most meanings are relevant  --&gt;, especially the [[civilizations]] of the [[Mediterranean]]: the [[Classical antiquity]] of Greece and Rome, [[Ancient Egypt]] and the other [[Ancient Near East]]ern cultures.  Artifacts from earlier periods such as the [[Mesolithic]], and other civilizations from Asia and elsewhere may also be covered by the term.  The phenomenon of giving a high value to ancient artifacts is found in other cultures, notably China, where [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], three to two thousand years old, have been avidly collected and imitated for centuries, and the [[Pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica]], where in particular the artifacts of the earliest [[Olmec civilization]] are found reburied in significant sites of later cultures up to the Spanish Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artworld.uea.ac.uk/cms/index.php?q=node/873 |accessdate=August 10, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of the term is not always precise, and institutional definitions such as [[museum]] "Departments of Antiquities" often cover later periods, but in normal usage [[Gothic art|Gothic]] objects, for example, would not now be described as antiquities, though in 1700 they might well have been, as the cut-off date for antiquities has tended to retreat since the word was first found in English in 1513.  Non-artistic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are now less likely to be called antiquities than in earlier periods. [[Francis Bacon]] wrote in 1605: "Antiquities are history defaced, or some remnants of history which have casually escaped the shipwreck of time".

The art trade reflects modern usage of the term; [[Christie's]] "Department of Antiquities" covers objects "from the dawn of civilization to the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], ranging from Western Europe to the Caspian Sea, embracing the cultures of Egypt, Greece, Rome and the Near East."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/ant/overview.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120013/http://www.christies.com/departments/ant/overview.asp |date=August 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonhams]] use a similar definition: "...4000 B.C to the 12th Century A.D. Geographically they originate from Egypt, the Near East and Europe ..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=usa&amp;Screen=antiquities |title=Antiquities |publisher=Bonhams |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Official cut-off dates are often later, being unconcerned with precise divisions of [[art history]], and using the term for all historical periods they wish to protect: in [[Jordan]] it is 1750,&lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.legadoandalusi.es/en/doa1.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202717/http://conference.legadoandalusi.es/en/doa1.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance|Hong Kong]] 1800, and so on.

The term is no longer much used in formal academic discussion, because of this imprecision. However, a recent attempt to standardise this and other terms has been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://saa.uaic.ro/from-antiquities-to-memorabilia-a-standardised-terminology-for-ancestral-artefacts-according-to-manufacture-date/|title=From antiquities to memorabilia: a standardised terminology for ancestral artefacts according to manufacture date|first=Policarp|last=HORTOLÀ|date=1 December 2017|journal=Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica|volume=23|issue=2|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, but not all, antiquities have been recovered by [[archaeology]].  There is little or no overlap with [[antiques]], which covers objects, not generally discovered as a result of archaeology, at most about three hundred years old, and usually far less.

==History==
The sense of ''antiquitates'', the idea that a civilization could be recovered by a systematic exploration of its [[relic]]s and [[material culture]], in the sense used by [[Varro]] and reflected in [[Josephus]]' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' was lost during the Middle Ages, when ancient objects were collected with other appeals, the rarity or strangeness of their materials or simply because they were thought to be endowed with magical or [[Miracle|miraculous]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Weiss, 1969. ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', p. 2ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Precious [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]]s and other antique [[carved gem]]s might be preserved when incorporated into crowns and diadems and liturgical objects,&lt;ref&gt;The "[[Cup of the Ptolemies]]" was set in Carolingian precious mounting and preserved in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diptych|consular ivory diptych]]s by being used as gospel covers.  Roman columns could be re-erected in churches.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Weiss notes (1969:8) that Ionic columns from the [[Baths of Caracalla]] were used in Innocent II's rebuilding of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], 1139&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] could receive new occupants and [[Urn|cinerary urn]]s could function as holy water [[stoup]]s. Sculptural representations of the human form, feared and reviled as "[[Cult image|idols]]" could be rehabilitated by reidentifying their subjects: the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|equestrian bronze Marcus Aurelius]] of the Campidoglio was respected as a representation of the Christian emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], and in Pavia the [[Regisole]] acquired a civic role that preserved it. In Rome the Roman bronze ''[[Boy with Thorn|Spinario]]'' was admired for itself by the guidebook writer [[Magister Gregorius]]. The classicism of the [[Carolingian renaissance]] was in part inspired by appreciation of [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] manuscripts: the [[Utrecht Psalter]] attempts to recreate such a Late Antique original, both in its handwriting and its illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in this context by Roberto Weiss 1969:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many museums hold these artifacts and keep them safe so that we have access to the knowledge they hold about the past. On September 2nd the National Museum of Brazil was engulfed in flames. This event caused many artifacts to be lost forever. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/08/lessons-from-the-destruction-of-the-national-museum-of-brazil|title=Lessons from the destruction of the National Museum of Brazil|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal trading==
[[Image:Euphronios krater side B MET L.2006.10.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Euphronios krater]] has been returned to Italy by the [[Metropolitan Museum]]]]
The export of antiquities is now heavily controlled by law in almost all countries and by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]] on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property|title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a large and increasing trade in [[Illicit antiquities]] continues.  The [[Euphronios krater]] is an apparent example that has come to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodie|first=Neil|title=Euphronios (Sarpedon) Krater|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/euphronios-sarpedon-krater|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the ambiguous legal case concerning the [[Getty Museum]]'s "Bronze Statue of a Victorious Youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illicit-cultural-property.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/bronze-statue-of-victorious-youth.html|title=The "Bronze Statue of a Victorious Youth"|author=|date=|website=illicit-cultural-property.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The field has been further complicated by the trade in [[Archaeological forgery|Archaeological forgeries]], such as the [[Etruscan terracotta warriors]], the [[Persian Princess]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodie|first=Neil|title=Persian Mummy|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/persian-mummy/|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Getty kouros]].

The '''Bariloche Atomic Centre''' ({{lang-es|Centro Atómico Bariloche}}) is one of the research and development centres of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[National Atomic Energy Commission]]. As its name implies, it is located in the city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]]. Bariloche Atomic Centre is responsible for research in [[physics]] and [[nuclear engineering]]. It also hosts the [[Balseiro Institute]], a collaboration between [[National University of Cuyo]] and the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]]. The Bariloche Atomic Centre opened in 1955 with its first director, [[José Antonio Balseiro]].

== Activity ==
The centre is devoted to basic and applied physics research as well as Nuclear and Mechanical Engineering.

Basic research is focused on deepening understanding of nuclear energy. Applied sciences have provided support for both state- and privately owned companies. The main areas of research include: materials, neutrons, thermodynamics and theoretical physics.

Nuclear Engineering at the Centre is aimed at further developing Argentina's atomic technology. Most of the research is done taking advantage of RA-6, a 1 [[Megawatt|MW]] experimental reactor. Experiments done with the RA-6 include irradiation and radioactive activation of several materials.

Some research groups also focus on refining reactor calculations and performance measurements and designing mechanical devices for those tasks.

Various companies have sprung out of the Bariloche Aromic Center, such as [[INVAP]] y ALTEC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1793">A '''chamber play''' is a play of usually three acts which can be performed with a small cast and practically no sets or costumes in a small space.

There are efforts to use the game of [[chess]] as a tool to aid the intellectual development of young people. Chess is significant in [[cognitive psychology]] and artificial intelligence ([[AI]]) studies, because it represents the domain in which expert performance has been most intensively studied and measured.&lt;ref name=Perloff1996&gt;{{cite journal | title = Individual differences in chess expertise: a psychometric investigation | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 124|issue=3|date=March 2007|pages=398–420 | doi = 10.1016/j.actpsy.2006.07.008 | pmid = 16942740 | last1 = Grabner | first1 = RH | last2 = Stern | first2 = E | last3 = Neubauer | first3 = AC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the results of research studies have failed to produce unambiguous support for the intellectual benefits of playing chess,&lt;ref name="Redman"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Tim Redman]] |title=Chess and education: Selected essays from the Koltanowski conference |publisher=Dallas, TX: Chess Program at the University of Texas at Dallas |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; several local government, schools, and student organizations all over the world are implementing chess programs. 

New York based Chess-In-The-Schools, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessintheschools.org/] chessinschools.org&lt;/ref&gt; has been active in the public school system in the city since 1986. It currently reaches more than 30,000 students annually.  [[America's Foundation for Chess]] has initiated programs in partnership with local school districts in several U.S. cities, including Seattle, San Diego, Philadelphia, and Tampa. The [[Chess'n Math Association]] promotes chess at the scholastic level in [[Canada]]. Chess for Success is a program for at-risk schools in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessforsuccess.org/ Chess for Success]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the [[US Chess Center|U.S. Chess Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] teaches chess to children, especially those in the [[inner city]], "as a means of improving their academic and social skills."

There are a number of [[experiment]]s that suggest that learning and playing chess aids the [[mind]]. The [[Grandmaster Eugene Torre Chess Institute]] in the Philippines, the [[United States Chess Federation]]'s chess [[research]] [[bibliography]], and English educational consultant [[Tony Buzan]]'s Brain Foundation, among others, continuously collect such experimental results. The advent of chess software that automatically record and analyze the moves of each player in each game and can tirelessly play with human players of various levels, further helped in giving new directions to experimental designs on chess as mental training.

== History ==
{{noref|section|date=August 2012}}
As early as 1779&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles370.pdf chesscafe.com] (pdf): ''„It is said that Franklin wrote the essay for the amusement of Anne Louise Brillon de Jouy in 1779 during his stay in France.“''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his article ''[[The morals of chess]]'', has advocated such a view:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn:

1st, Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action ...

2nd, Circumspection, which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: - the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations; ...

3rd, Caution, not to make our moves too hastily...."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alfred Binet]] demonstrated in the late 19th century that good [[chess players]] have superior [[memory]] and [[imagination]]. [[Adriaan de Groot]] concurred with Alfred Binet that visual memory and visual perception are important attributors and that problem-solving ability is of paramount importance. Thus, since 1972, at the collegiate level, the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] and the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] both recruit chessplayer-scholars and run scholastic outreach programs in their respective communities.

[[File:Anschn-citrus.jpg|thumb|Various citrus types in cross section. Some of them are [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between two or more original species. &lt;br /&gt;
The [[botanical classification]] of the species, hybrids, varieties and cultivars belonging to the genus ''Citrus'' is called "citrus taxonomy".]]
'''Citrus taxonomy''' refers to the [[botanical classification]] of the [[species]], [[variety (botany)|varieties]], [[cultivars]], and [[Graft-chimaera|graft hybrids]] within the [[genus]] ''[[Citrus]]'' and related genera, found in cultivation and in the wild.

Citrus taxonomy is complex.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11525837 |title=Oranges and lemons: clues to the taxonomy of ''Citrus'' from molecular markers |author=G. A.

Detailed genomic analysis of wild and domesticated citrus cultivars has suggested that the progenitor of modern citrus species expanded out of the Himalayan foothills in a rapid radiation that has produced at least 10 wild species in South and East Asia and Australia.  Most commercial cultivars are the product of hybridization among these wild species, with most coming from crosses involving [[citron]]s, [[mandarin orange|mandarin]]s and [[pomelo]]s.&lt;ref name="Talon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genomics of the origin and evolution of ''Citrus'' | last1=Wu | first1=Guohong Albert | last2=Terol | first2=Javier | last3=Ibanez | first3=Victoria | last4=López-García | first4=Antonio | last5=Pérez-Román | first5=Estela | last6=Borredá | first6=Carles | last7=Domingo | first7=Concha | last8=Tadeo | first8=Francisco R | last9=Carbonell-Caballero | first9=Jose | last10=Alonso | first10=Roberto | last11=Curk | first11=Franck | last12=Du | first12=Dongliang | last13=Ollitrault | first13=Patrick | last14=Roose | first14=Mikeal L.

Most hybrids express different ancestral traits when planted from seeds ([[F2 hybrid]]s) and can continue a [[cloning|stable]] lineage only through [[vegetative propagation]].  Some hybrids do reproduce [[asexual reproduction|true to type]] via [[nucellar]] seeds in a process called [[apomixis]].&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;  As such, many hybrid species represent the clonal progeny of a single original F1 cross, though others combine fruit with similar characteristics that have arisen from distinct crosses.

==Genetic history==
[[File:Citrus tern cb simplified 1.svg|thumb|500px|right|Citrus fruits clustered by genetic similarity of partial sequences. [[Ternary diagram]] of hybrids of the three major ancestral species. Data from Curk et al. (2016).&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;]]

All of the wild 'pure' citrus species trace to a common ancestor that lived in the Himalayan foothills, where a late-[[Miocene]] citrus fossil, ''Citrus  linczangensis'', has been found.  At that time, a lessening of the [[monsoon]]s and resultant drier climate in the region allowed the citrus ancestor to expand across south and east Asia in a rapid genetic radiation.  After the plant crossed the [[Wallace line]] a second radiation took place in the early [[Pliocene]] (about 4 million years ago) to give rise to the Australian species.  Most modern cultivars are actually hybrids derived from a small number of 'pure' original species.  Though hundreds of species names have been assigned, a recent genomic study by Wu, ''et al.'' identified just ten ancestral species of citrus among those studied.  Of these, seven were native to Asia: pomelo (''Citrus maxima''), the 'pure' mandarins (''C. reticulata'' - most mandarin cultivars were hybrids of this species with pomelo), citrons (''C. medica''), [[Citrus micrantha|micranthas]] (''C. micrantha''), the [[Citrus ichangensis|Ichang papeda]] (''C. ichangensis''), the [[mangshanyegan]] (''C. mangshanensis''), and the oval (Nagami) [[kumquat]] (''Fortunella margarita'' or ''C. japonica'' var. ''margarita'').  In Australia three were identified: the [[Citrus glauca|desert lime]] (''C. glauca''), [[Citrus australis|round lime]] (''C. australis'') and the [[Citrus australasica|finger lime]] (''C. australasica''). Many other cultivars previously identified as species were found to be closely related variants ([[subspecies]] or [[variety (botany)|varieties]]) or hybrids of these species,&lt;ref name="Talon"/&gt; though not all cultivars were evaluated.

Interbreeding seems possible between all citrus plants, and between citrus plants and some plants which may or may not be categorized as citrus. The ability of [[citrus hybrids]] to self-pollinate and to reproduce sexually also helps create new varieties.  The three predominant ancestral citrus taxa are [[citron]] (''C. medica''), [[pomelo]] (''C. maxima''), and [[mandarin orange|mandarin]] (''C. reticulata'').&lt;ref name="Talon"/&gt;  These taxa interbreed freely, despite being quite genetically distinct, having arisen through [[allopatric speciation]], with citrons evolving in northern [[Indochina]], pomelos in the [[Malay Archipelago]], and mandarins in [[Vietnam]], [[southern China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Curk"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-014-0152-1 | title=Next generation haplotyping to decipher nuclear genomic interspecific admixture in Citrus species: analysis of chromosome 2 | journal=BMC Genetics | volume=15 | page=152 | year=2014 | last1=Curk | first1=Franck | last2=Ancillo | first2=Gema | last3=Garcia-Lor | first3=Andres | last4=Luro | first4=François | last5=Perrier | first5=Xavier | last6=Jacquemoud-Collet | first6=Jean-Pierre | last7=Navarro | first7=Luis | last8=Ollitrault | first8=Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrids of these taxa include familiar citrus fruits like [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]], [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and some [[tangerine]]s.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0062574 | title=Phylogenetic Relationships of ''Citrus'' and Its Relatives Based on matK Gene Sequences | last1=Penjor | first1=Tshering | last2=Yamamoto | first2=Masashi | last3=Uehara | first3=Miki | last4=Ide | first4=Manami | last5=Matsumoto | first5=Natsumi | last6=Matsumoto | first6=Ryoji | last7=Nagano | first7=Yukio | journal=PLOS One | year=2013 | volume=8 | page=e62574 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0062574}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citrons have also been hybridized with other citrus taxa, for example, crossed with micrantha to produce the [[Key lime]].&lt;ref name="Talon"/&gt;  In many cases, these crops are propagated [[apomixis|asexually]], and lose their characteristic traits if bred. However, some of these hybrids have interbred with one another and with the original taxa, making the citrus family tree a complicated network.

[[Kumquat|Kumquats]] do not naturally interbreed with core taxa due to different flowering times,&lt;ref name="Froelicher"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New universal mitochondrial PCR markers reveal new information on maternal citrus phylogeny |doi=10.1007/s11295-010-0314-x | volume=7 | journal=Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes |pages=49–61 | year=2011 | last1 = Froelicher | first1 = Yann | last2=Mouhaya | first2=Wafa | last3=Bassene | first3=Jean-Baptiste | last4=Costantino | first4=Gilles | last5=Kamiri | first5=Mourad | last6=Luro | first6=Francois | last7=Morillo | first7=Raphael | last8=Ollitrault | first8=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; but hybrids (such as the [[calamondin]]) exist. [[Australian lime]]s are native to [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], so they did not naturally interbreed with the core taxa, but they have been crossbred with [[mandarin orange|mandarins]] and [[calamondin]]s by modern breeders.  Humans have deliberately bred new citrus fruits by propagating seedlings of spontaneous crosses (e.g. [[clementines]]), creating or selecting mutations of hybrids, (e.g. [[Meyer lemon]]), and crossing different varieties (e.g. 'Australian Sunrise', a [[finger lime]] and [[calamondin]] cross).

==Citrus naming systems==
{{See also|Botanical name}}
Initially, many citrus types were identified and named by individual taxonomists, resulting in a large number of identified species: 870 by a 1969 count.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Citrus halimii: A New Species from Malaya and Peninsular Thailand | last1=Stone | first1=Benjamin C | last2=Lowry | first2=J Brian | last3=Scora | first3=R W | last4=Jong | first4=Kwiton | journal=Biotropica | volume=5 | pages=102–110 | year=1973 | doi=10.2307/2989659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some order was brought to citrus taxonomy by two alternative unified classification schemes, those of [[Chōzaburō Tanaka]] and [[Walter Tennyson Swingle]], which can be viewed as extreme alternative visions of the same genus.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Swingle's system, divided the Citrinae subtribe into three groups, the 'primitive citrus' distant relatives, the closer 'near citrus' including citrus-related genera like ''[[Atalantia]]'', and the 'true citrus', which included ''Poncirus'', ''Citrus'', ''Fortunella'', ''Eremocitrus'', ''Microcitrus'', and ''Clymenia'', all but the first now viewed to fall within ''Citrus''.  His ''Citrus'' he likewise subdivided into two subgenera: citrons, pomelos, mandarins, oranges, grapefruits and lemons were placed in subgenus ''Eucitrus'' (later called simply subgenus ''Citrus''), while the hardy but slow-growing trees with relatively unpalatable fruit he placed in subgenus ''[[Papeda (citrus)|Papeda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wang | first=Xia, ''et al.'' | title=Genomic analyses of primitive, wild and cultivated citrus provide insights into asexual reproduction | journal=Nature Genetics | volume=49 | pages=765–772 | year=2017 | doi=10.1038/ng.3839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Sharma | first1=Girish | last2=Sharma | first2=O.

The Swingle system is generally followed today with much modification; however, there are still large differences in nomenclature between countries and individual scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKlNrSR_8IEC&amp;pg=PA49 | title=Citrus Germplasm Resources | last1=Krueger | first1=R.R. | last2=Navarro | first2=L. | work=Citrus Genetics, Breeding and Biotechnology | editor-last=Kahn | editor-first=Iqrar Ahmad | publisher = CAB International | year=2007| page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis of the 'Tanaka system' (1954) is to provide a separate species name for each cultivar, regardless of whether it is pure or a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of two or more species or varieties, and resulted in 159 identified species.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;  It thus represents an example of taxonomic "[[Lumpers and splitters#Lumping and splitting in biology|splitting]]",&lt;ref name ="splitter"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tk7DaWYvuPAC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22Ty%C3%B4zabur%C3%B4+Tanaka%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=5avHS6arEIXcygSZq9WrCA&amp;cd=35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ty%C3%B4zabur%C3%B4%20Tanaka%22&amp;f=false|page=30|title=Growing Citrus: The Essential Gardener's Guide|first=Martin|last=Page |publisher=Timber Press|year= 2008 |isbn=978-0-88192-906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in assigning separate species names to horticultural variants does not conform to the standard species concept.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;   Tanaka also divides into subgenera, but differently than Swingle, introducing ''Archicitrus'' (which he subdivided into five sections, Papeda, Limonellus, Aruntium, Citrophorum and Cephalocitrus) and ''Metacitrus'' (divided into Osmocitrus, Acrumen and Pseudofortunella).&lt;ref name="Sharma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000"/&gt;  A 1969 analysis by Hodgson intended to harmonize the two schemes accepted 36 species.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2007" /&gt;  These initial attempts at ''Citrus'' systematization all predate the recognition, which began to gain traction in the mid-1970s, that the majority of cultivars represent hybrids of just three species, citron, mandarin and pomelo.&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimuzu"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0166969 | volume=11 | title=Hybrid Origins of Citrus Varieties Inferred from DNA Marker Analysis of Nuclear and Organelle Genomes | journal=PLOS One | page=e0166969 | year=2016 | last1 = Shimizu | first1 = Tokurou | last2=Kitajima | first2=Akira | last3=Nonaka | first3=Keisuke | last4=Yoshioka | first4=Terutaka | last5=Ohta | first5=Satoshi | last6=Goto | first6=Shingo | last7=Toyoda | first7=Atsushi | last8=Fujiyama | first8=Asao | last9=Mochizuki| first9=Takako | last10=Nagasaki | first10=Hideki | last11=Kaminuma | first11=Eli | last12=Nakamura | first12=Yasukazu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phylogenetic analysis confirms the hybrid origin of most citrus cultivars, indicating a small number of founder species.  While the subgenera suggested by Tanaka proved similar to the phylogenetic divisions, Swingle's subgenera were [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]],&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000"/&gt; and hence do not represent [[Valid name (zoology)|valid]] taxonomy.  Historical genera are also dubious.  Kumquats had been placed in a separate genus ''Fortunella'', while two genera were suggested by Swingle for the Australian limes, ''Microcitrus'' and ''Eremocitrus''.  However, genomic analysis has pointed to these groups nesting within the phylogenetic tree of the other citrus plants.  Since their placement in distinct genera would make ''Citrus'' a paraphyletic grouping, it has been suggested that all of these are correctly members of a single genus, ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bayer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bayer |first1=Randall J |last2=Mabberly | first2=David J | last3=Morton | first3=Cynthia | last4=Miller | first4=Cathy H. | last5=Sharma | first5=Ish K | last6=Pfiel | first6=Bernard E | last7=Rich | first7=Sarah | last8=Hitchcock | first8=Roberta | last9=Sykes | first9=Steve | year=2009 |title=A molecular phylogeny of the orange subfamily (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae) using nine cpDNA sequences.|journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=668–685 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0800341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, genomic analysis has suggested that other genera previously split off from ''Citrus'' may likewise belong within this expanded phylogenetic concept of the ''Citrus'' genus, including ''[[Clymenia (plant)|Clymenia]]'', ''[[Oxanthera]]'' and more controversially ''[[Poncirus]]'', along with a genus not previously recognized as a close citrus relative, ''[[Feroniella lucida|Feroniella]]''.&lt;ref name=Kubitzki&gt;{{cite chapter|last1=Kubitzki| first1=K.|last2=Kallinki|first2=J.

[[File:Citrus hybrids.svg|thumb|350px|right|Examples of hybrid ''Citrus'', showing their derivation from the pure founder species]]

==Core species and hybrids==
{{see also|Folk taxonomy}}
Most commercial varieties are descended from one or more of the 'core species', [[citrons]], [[mandarin orange|mandarins]], and [[pomelos]], which share in common a complex floral anatomy that gives rise to more complex fruit.  These core species, and to a lesser extent other citrus, have given rise to a wide variety of hybrids for which the naming is inconsistent.  The same [[common name]]s may be given to different species, [[citrus hybrids]] or mutations. For example, citrus with green fruit tend to be called 'limes' independent of their origin: Australian limes, [[Calamondin|Musk limes]], [[Key lime]]s, [[kaffir lime]]s, [[Rangpur lime]]s, [[sweet lemon|sweet limes]] and [[wild lime]]s are all genetically distinct.  Fruit with similar ancestry may be quite different in name and traits (e.g. grapefruit, common oranges, and [[ponkan]]s, all pomelo-mandarin hybrids).  Many traditional citrus groups, such as true sweet oranges and lemons, seem to be [[bud sport]]s, clonal families of cultivars that have arisen from distinct spontaneous mutations of a single hybrid ancestor.&lt;ref name="Curk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;

===Ancestral species===
[[File:Mandarin Oranges (Citrus Reticulata).jpg|thumb|[[Mandarin orange]] is a true species, it is one of the progenitors of most cultivated [[citrus]].]]

====Mandarins====
[[Mandarin orange]]s (tangerines, satsumas - ''Citrus reticulata'') are one of the basic species, but the name mandarin is also used more generally for all small, easily peeled citrus, including a large range of hybrids.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Genetic diversity and population structure analysis of mandarin germplasm by nuclear, chloroplastic and mitochondrial markers | last1=Garcia-Lor | first1=Andres | last2=Luro | first2=François | last3=Ollitrault | first3=Patrick | last4=Navarro | first4=Luis | journal=Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes | volume=11 | page=e123 | year=2015 | doi=10.1007/s11295-015-0951-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Swingle saw three species of mandarin, while Tanaka identified five groups with a total of 36 species. Webber (1948) divided them into four groups, king, satsuma, mandarin, and tangerine, and Hodgson (1967) saw in them four species.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;  Genomic analysis suggests just one species, ''Citrus reticulata'', with even the divergent [[Tachibana orange]] (Tanaka's ''Citrus tachibana''), native to Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands and southern Japan, nesting within the wild mandarins of the East-Asian mainland,&lt;ref name="Wang2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Lun, et al.|title=Genome of Wild Mandarin and Domestication History of Mandarin|journal=Molecular Plant|volume=11|number=8|pages=1024-1037|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and showing enough similarity to be considered just a [[subspecies]].&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  

All characterized varieties commercially called mandarins are [[mandarin orange#varieties|actually hybrids]].&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-29452005000200037&amp;script=sci_arttext | title=Genetic similarity of citrus fresh fruit market cultivars | last1=de Oliveira | first1=Roberto Pedroso | last2=Radmann | first2=Elizete Beatriz | journal=Revista Brasileira de Fruticultura | volume = 27 | year=2005 | pages=332–334 | doi=10.1590/S0100-29452005000200037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wang, ''et al.'', found that domesticated mandarins fell into two genetic clusters that linked to different branches of the tree of wild mandarins, had different deduced population histories and had distinct patterns of pomelo introgression, suggesting that they derive from separate domestication events.&lt;ref name="Wang2018" /&gt;   Wu, ''et al.'', divided mandarins into three types, based on their degree of hybridization.  In addition to genetically pure mandarins, a second type are the result of hybridization with pomelos followed by subsequent [[backcrossing]] with mandarins to retain only a few pomelo traits.  The third type arose more recently from the crossing of these hybrids again with pomelos or sweet oranges (which are themselves crosses of hybrid mandarins and pomelos). This produces mandarins with more, longer stretches of pomelo DNA.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Some commercial mandarins are hybrids with lemons, while several were found to have a significant contribution (35-65%) from papedas.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;

Mangshan wild mandarin (''C. mangshanensis'') is a name used for the similar-looking wild mandarin-like fruit of the Mangshan area, but has been found to include two genetically-distinct groups, one representing pure, wild 'true' mandarins, and the other the genetically distinct and only distantly related [[mangshanyegan]], akin to another local fruit known as the 'yuanju',&lt;ref name="Wang2018" /&gt; and found to be the most distant branch of all the citrus.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;

In a limited genomic analysis, ''[[Feroniella]]'' was surprisingly found to cluster with ''C. reticulata'' deep within ''Citrus'',&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabberley Feroniella" /&gt; leading botanist [[David Mabberley]] to propose that its sole member, ''F. lucida'', be rechristened ''C. lucida''.&lt;ref name=Kubitzki /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabberley Feroniella" /&gt;

====Pomelos====
[[File:Citrus grandis - Honey White.jpg|thumb|The [[pomelo]].]]
The [[pomelo]] (''Citrus maxima''), a second of the core species from which most citrus hybrids have derived, is native to southeast Asia.  Among the hybrids deriving from mandarin/pomelo crosses, there is a direct correlation between the proportion of pomelo DNA in the hybrid and fruit size, while the more palatable mandarins are those that have received specific genes from pomelos that alter their acidity.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Some of the more common pomelos are genetically pure, while a number have a single small region of [[introgression|introgressed]] mandarin DNA on one chromosome, the result of a cross followed by extensive backcrossing with pomelo.&lt;ref name="Oestlati"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oueslati|first1=Amel|last2=Salhi-Hannachi|first2=Amel|last3=Luro|first3=François|last4=Vignes|first4=Hélène|last5=Mournet|first5=Pierre|last6=Ollitrault|first6=Patrick|title=Genotyping by sequencing reveals the interspecific ''C. maxima'' / ''C. reticulata'' admixture along the genomes of modern citrus varieties of mandarins, tangors, tangelos, orangelos and grapefruits|journal=PLOS One|volume=12|p=e0185618|year=2017|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0185618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Citrons====
[[File:Citron (8448513463).jpg|thumb|These varieties of [[citron]], [[variety etrog|etrog]] and [[fingered citron|fingered]], have distinctly different appearances.]]
[[File:3 etrog.JPG|thumb|3 more varieties of ''Citrus medica'' that are all true non-hybrid [[citron]]s.]]
Varieties of true (non-hybrid) [[Citron]] (''Citrus medica'') have distinctly different forms.  The citron usually propagates by [[cleistogamy]], a [[self-pollination]] within an unopened flower, and this results in the lowest levels of hetero[[zygosity]] among the citrus species.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Because of this, it will generally serve as the male parent of any hybrid progeny. Many [[Citron#Varieties &amp; hybrids|citron varieties]] were proven to be non-hybrids despite their rather dramatic morphological differences;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tjggcl5wyyu6l69d/ | title=Citrus phylogeny and genetic origin of important species as investigated by molecular markers | last1=Nicolosi | first1=E | last2=Deng | first2=Z.

Genetic analysis of citrons has shown that they divide into three groups.  One cluster consists of wild citrons that originated in China and produce non-fingered fruit with pulp and seeds. A second cluster, also native to China, consist of the fingered citrons, most of which are seedless and must be propagated artificially.  The third cluster represents the Mediterranean citrons, thought to have originally been introduced there from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ramadugu | first1=Chandrika | last2=Keremane | first2=Manjunath L | last3=Hu | first3=Xulan | last4=Karp | first4=David | last5=Frederici | first5=Claire T | last6=Kahn | first6=Tracy | last7=Roose | first7=Mikeal L | last8=Lee | first8=Richard F. | title=Genetic analysis of citron (''Citrus medica'' L.) using simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms | journal=Scientia Horticulturae | volume=195 | pages=124–137 | year=2015 | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423815301692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[fingered citron]] varieties are used in [[buddhist offering]]s, and some more common varieties are used as the [[etrog]] in the Jewish harvest festival of [[Sukkot]].  There is also a specific variety of citron called [[Greek citron|etrog]]. The [[Mountain citron]] is a complex citrus hybrid that only includes trace amounts of true citron.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;

====Kumquats====
[[Kumquats]] are a separate species, with few hybrids.  [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] originally classified the [[kumquat]]s as ''Citrus japonica'' in his 1784 book, ''[[Flora Japonica (1784 book)|Flora Japonica]]''. In 1915, Swingle reclassified them in a separate genus, ''[[Fortunella (plant)|Fortunella]]'', named in honor of [[Robert Fortune]]. Seven species of ''Fortunella'' were generally recognized—''F. japonica'', ''F. margarita'', ''F. crassifolia'', ''F. hindsii'', ''F. obovata'' and ''F. polyandra'', as well as the recently described ''F. bawangica''. Since the kumquat is a [[cold hardy citrus|cold hardy species]], there are many hybrids between common citrus members and the kumquat. Swingle coined a separate hybrid genus for these, which he called ''[[× Citrofortunella]]''.

Subsequent study of the many commercial citrus lineages revealed such complexity that the genera could not be separated,&lt;ref name="Mabberley 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=[[David Mabberley|Mabberley]] | first= D. J. | journal=Blumea | volume=49 | pages=481–498 | year=2004 | title=''Citrus'' (Rutaceae): A Review of Recent Advances in Etymology, Systematics and Medical Applications | url=http://repository.naturalis.nl/document/565086}}&lt;/ref&gt; and genomic analysis rooted ''Fortunella'' within the polyphyletic tree of ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt; Consequently, in accordance with the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], the [[correct name (botany)|correct]] genus name reverted to ''Citrus''. [[Flora of China (journal)|''The Flora of China'']] unites all kumquats as the single species, ''Citrus japonica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Zhang | first1=Dianxiang |last2=Hartley | first2=Thomas G. | last3=Mabberley | first3=David J. |title=Rutaceae | work=Flora of China | volume=11 |pages=51–97 | year=2008 | url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=10781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Papedas====
Swingle coined the [[Papeda (citrus)|''Citrus'' subgenus ''Papeda'']] to separate its members from the more edible citrus, that also differ from other citrus in that its stamens grow separately, not united at the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A classification for edible Citrus (Rutaceae) |last=Mabberley | first=David | journal=Telopea | volume=7 | pages=167–172 | year=1997 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b4c6/39c322765afb2d03a9a7f3f5fd1f3ac1c250.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He included in this group the [[kaffir lime]], as well as the Ichang papeda (''Citrus ichangensis'') and the micrantha (''Citrus micrantha'').  Since the latter two species locate to different branches of the citrus phylogenetic tree, the group would be [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] and not a valid division.&lt;ref name="nuclear phylogenetic"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A nuclear phylogenetic analysis: SNPs, indels and SSRs deliver new insights into the relationships in the ‘true citrus fruit trees’ group (Citrinae, Rutaceae) and the origin of cultivated species | last1=Garcia-Lor |first1=Andres | last2=Curk | first2=Franck | last3=Snoussi-Trifa | first3=Hager | last4=Morillon | first4=Raphael | last5=Ancillo | first5=Gema | last6=Luro | first6=François | last7=Navarro | first7=Luis | last8=Ollitrault | first8=Patrick | journal=Annals of Botany | volume=111 | pages=1–19 | year=2011 | doi=10.1093/aob/mcs227| pmc=3523644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000" /&gt;  Papedas have also given rise to hybrids with other citrus.

====Australian and New Guinean species====
[[File:Citrus glauca fruit.jpg|thumb|The [[desert lime]], ''[[Citrus glauca]]'', hangs from a branch.]]
[[Australian lime|Australian and New Guinean citrus species]] had been viewed as belonging to separate genera by Swingle, who placed in ''Microcitrus'' all but the desert lime, for whcih he used ''[[Eremocitrus]]''.  However, genomic analysis shows that though they form a distinct clade from other citrus, this is nested within the citrus phylogenetic tree, most closely related to kumquats, suggesting that all these species should be included in the genus ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Wu, ''et al.'', found that several of the finger lime cultivars were actually hybrids with round lime, and concluded there were just three species among those tested, [[Citrus glauca|desert lime]] (''C. glauca''), [[Citrus australis|round lime]] (''C. australis'') and the [[Citrus australasica|finger lime]] (''C. australasica''), though their analysis did not include other types previously identified as distinct species.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  In more limited genomic analysis, the [[New Guinea wild lime]], ''[[Clymenia (plant)|Clymenia]]'' and ''[[Oxanthera]]'' (false orange) all cluster with the Australian limes as members of ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards a molecular taxonomic key of the Aurantioideae subfamily using chloroplastic SNP diagnostic markers of the main clades genotyped by competitive allele-specific PCR | last1=Oueslati | first1=Amel | last2=Ollitrault | first2=Frederique | last3=Baraket | first3=Ghada | last4=Salhi-Hannachi | first4=Amel | last5=Navarro | first5=Luis | last6=Ollitrault | first6=Patrick | journal=BMC Genetics | volume=17 | page=118 | year=2016 | doi=10.1186/s12863-016-0426-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outback lime is a desert lime agriculturally-selected for more commercial traits, while [[Australian lime#Cultivars|Some commercial varieties]] of the Australian lime are hybrids with mandarins, lemons, and/or sweet oranges.  ''Clymenia'', will hybridize with [[kumquat]]s and some [[lime (fruit)|limes]].

== Genetic hybrids==
'''Citrus hybrids''' include many [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[species]] that have been selected by [[plant breeding|plant breeders]]. This is done not only for the useful characteristics of the fruit, but also for plant size and growth characteristics such as cold-tolerance. Some citrus [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] occurred naturally, and others have been deliberately created, either by [[cross pollination]] and selection among the progeny, or (rarely, and only recently) as [[somatic hybrid]]s. The aim of plant breeding of hybrids is to use two or more different citrus varieties or species, in order to get traits intermediate between those of the parents, or to transfer individual desirable traits of one parent into the other. In some cases, particularly with the natural hybrids, it has been viewed as [[hybrid speciation]] and the new plants have been viewed as different species from any of their parents. Citrus hybrids have often been given unique [[hybrid name (botany)|hybrid names]], marked with a [[multiplication sign]] after the word "Citrus", for example the Key lime is ''Citrus'' × ''aurantifolia'', and also are referred to by joining the names of the crossed species or hybrids that produced them, as with [[sunquat]] – ''Citrus limon'' × ''japonica''. Styling a hybrid as such a cross between two species can present challenges.  In some cases the parental species that gave rise to a hybrid have yet to be determined, while genotyping reveals some hybrids to descend from three or more ancestral species.

===Labelling of hybrids===
Hybrid taxonomy is inconsistent.  There is disagreement over whether to assign species names to hybrids, and even modern hybrids of known parentage are sold under general names that give little information about their ancestry, or even give technically incorrect information.  This can be a problem for those who can eat only some citrus varieties.

===Major citrus hybrids===
[[File:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|The [[orange (fruit)|common orange]]s as well as the [[grapefruit]]s are hybrids between the [[Mandarin orange|mandarin]] and the [[pomelo]].]]
[[File:Castello, collezione degli agrumi 02.jpg|thumb|upright|A variety of [[lumia (citrus)|Lumia]]]]
The most common citrus hybrids that are sometimes treated as a [[species]] by themselves, especially in [[folk taxonomy]], are:
* [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]]: a name used for several distinct crosses between [[pomelo]] and a [[mandarin orange]].  They have the [[orange (color)|orange color]] of the mandarin in their outer peels and segments, and are easier to peel than the pomelos.  Oranges are all intermediate between the two ancestors in size, flavor and shape.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |

* [[Grapefruit]]: Grapefruits, like oranges, include genetic contributions from both mandarin and pomelo, but more of the latter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016332030738|title=Assessment of genetic variability in grapefruits (''Citrus paradisi'' Macf.) and pomelos (''C. maxima'' (Burm.) Merr.) using RAPD and SSR markers | doi=10.1023/A:1016332030738 | volume=126|journal=Euphytica|pages=169–176 | last1 = Corazza-Nunes | first1 = M.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; arising from a natural backcross of a sweet orange with a pomelo.&lt;ref name="Oestlati" /&gt;  The 'cocktail grapefruit', or [[Mandelo]], is distinct, instead the product of a low-acid pomelo variety hybridized with a mandarin that itself was a cross between two distinct mandarin stocks.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;
* [[Lemon]]: 'true' lemons derive from one common hybrid ancestor, having diverged by mutation. The original lemon was a hybrid between a male citron and a female sour orange, itself a pomelo/pure-mandarin hybrid; citrons contribute half of the genome, while the other half is divided between pomelo and mandarin.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gulsen&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/126/3/309.full.pdf | title=Lemons: Diversity and Relationships with Selected Citrus Genotypes as Measured with Nuclear Genome Markers | last1=Gulson | first1=O. | last2=Roose | first2=M. L. | journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science | volume=126 | pages=309–317 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are other hybrids also known as 'lemons'.  [[Rough lemon]]s arose from a cross between citron and mandarin, without the pomelo contribution found in true lemons, while the [[Meyer lemon]] comes from a citron crossed with a sweet (as opposed to sour) orange.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Phylogenetic origin of limes and lemons revealed by cytoplasmic and nuclear markers | last1=Curk | first1=Franck | last2=Ollitrault | first2= Frédérique | last3=Garcia-Lor | first3= Andres | last4=Luro | first4=François | last5=Navarro | first5=Luis | last6=Ollitrault | first6=Patrick | journal=Annals of Botany | volume=11 | pages=565–583 | year=2016 | doi=10.1093/aob/mcw005 | pmc=4817432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lime (fruit)|Limes]]: A highly diverse group of hybrids go by this name.  [[Rangpur (fruit)|Rangpur limes]], like rough lemons, arose from crosses between citron and mandarin.  The [[sweet lemon|sweet limes]], so-called due to their low acid pulp and juice, come from crosses of citron with either sweet or sour oranges, while the Key lime arose from a cross between a citron and a micrantha.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

All of these hybrids have in turn been bred back with their parent stocks or with other pure or hybrid citrus to form a broad array of fruits.  Naming of these is inconsistent, with some bearing a variant of the name of one of the parents or simply another citrus with superficially-similar fruit, a distinct name, or a [[portmanteau]] of ancestral species.  The [[Ponderosa lemon]] (''Citrus limon'' × ''medica'') and [[Florentine citron]] (''Citrus x limonimedica'') are both true lemon/citron hybrids, the [[Bergamot orange]] is a sweet orange/lemon hybrid and the [[Oroblanco]] is a grapefruit/pomelo mix, while [[tangelo]]s are tangerine (mandarin)/pomelo or mandarin/grapefruit hybrids, [[orangelo]]s result from grapefruit backcrossed with sweet orange, and a sweet orange backcrossed with a tangerine gives the [[tangor]].&lt;ref name="Oestlati" /&gt;  One [[Lumia (citrus)|lumia]], a member of the [[sweet lemon]]s, is the product of crossing a lemon with a pomelo/citron hybrid, though another lumia variety, the [[Lumia (citrus)#Pomum Adami|Pomme d'Adam]], is a micrantha/citron cross, like the Key lime.  The most common and commercially popular 'limes', the [[Persian lime]]s, are Key lime/lemon hybrids that combine the genetic lineages of four ancestral citrus species: mandarin, pomelo, citron and micrantha.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

While most other citrus are [[ploidy|diploid]], many of the Key lime hybrid progeny have unusual chromosome numbers.  For example, the Persian lime is [[Polyploid|triploid]], deriving from a diploid Key lime [[gamete]] and a haploid lemon [[ovule]].  A second group of Key lime hybrids, including the Tanepao lime and Madagascar lemon, are also triploid but instead seem to have arisen from a backcross of a diploid Key lime ovule with a citron haploid gamete.  The 'Giant Key lime' owes its increased size to a spontaneous duplication of the entire diploid Key lime genome to produce a [[Polyploid|tetraploid]].&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

Historically, hybrids with similar characteristics have been placed together in a number of hybrid species, yet relatively recent genomic analysis has revealed some hybrids assigned to the same species to be of quite distinct ancestry.  No alternative system of grouping fruit in hybrid species has been adopted.

===Hybrids from other citrus species===
While most citrus hybrids derive from the three core species, hybrids have also been derived from the [[Citrus micrantha|micrantha]], the [[Citrus ichangensis|Ichang papeda]] and the [[kumquat]].  The best known hybrid from micrantha is the [[Key lime]] (or Mexican lime), derived from the breeding of a male citron and a female micrantha.  Several citrus varieties are Ichang papeda/mandarin crosses (for which Swingle coined the term ichandarin&lt;ref name="Shimuzu" /&gt;), including [[Sudachi]] and [[Yuzu]] (which also includes smaller contributions from pomelo and kumquat).&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;  Other more exotic citrus have likewise proved hybrids that include papeda.  For example, the [[Indian wild orange]], once suggested as a possible ancestor of today's cultivated citrus fruits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Malik | first1=S. K. |last2=Chaudhury | first2=R. | last3=Dhariwal | first3=O. P. | last4=kalia | first4=R.

====Citrofortunella====
A large group of commercial hybrids involve the [[kumquat]], ''Fortunella'' in the Swingle system.  ''[[Citrofortunella]]'' was coined as a genus containing intergeneric hybrids between members of the ''Citrus'' and the ''Fortunella'', and is named after its parent genera.&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ingram | first1=J. | last2=Moore | first2= H. e. | title=Rutaceae | journal = Baileya | volume=19 | year=1976 | pages=169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such hybrids often combine the cold hardiness of the ''Fortunella'' with some edibility properties of the ''Citrus'' species.  As members of a hybrid genus, Citrofortunellas were marked with the multiplication sign before the genus name, for example [[calamondin|× ''Citrofortunella microcarpa'']].  With the placement of kumquats within ''Citrus'', Citrofortunella are no longer viewed as being intergeneric hybrids.  All likewise belong in ''Citrus'', while ''Citrofortunella'' as a distinct genus name would no longer be [[Valid name (zoology)|valid]].&lt;ref name="Mabberley 2004" /&gt;  Examples of the Citrofortunella include the [[calamondin]], [[limequat]] and [[yuzuquat]], crossing kumquat with [[tangerine]], [[Key lime]] and [[yuzu]] respectively.

==Graft hybrids==
[[File:Citrus_aurantium_"bizzarria"_frutto_acerbo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bizzaria]], an unusual graft-chimera.]]
Due to the sterility of many of the genetic hybrids as well as disease- or temperature-sensitivity of some ''Citrus'' trees, domesticated citrus cultivars are usually propagated via grafting to the rootstock of other, often hardier though less palatable citrus or close relatives.  As a result, graft hybrids, also called [[graft-chimaera]]s, can occur in ''Citrus''.  After [[grafting]], the [[cell (biology)|cells]] from the [[Grafting|scion]] and [[rootstock]] are not [[somatic fusion|somatically fused]], but rather the cells of the two intermix at the graft site, and can produce shoots bearing fruit with a combination of the characteristics of the two contributing species due to the presence of cells from both.  In an extreme example, on separate branches [[Bizzaria]] produces fruit identical to each of the two contributing species, but also fruit at the junction that appears to be half one species and half the other, unmixed.  Graft hybrids are distinguished from genetic hybrids by designating the two contributing species with a '+' between the individual names (''Citrus medica'' + ''C. aurantium'').

==Citrus relatives==
===Trifoliate orange===
[[File:Poncirusfruits2001HD.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Trifoliate orange]] belongs to the genus ''[[Poncirus]]'', according to [[Walter Tennyson Swingle|Swingle]].]]
The [[trifoliate orange]] is a [[cold hardy citrus|cold hardy plant]] distinguishable by its [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|compound leaves]] with three leaflets and its deciduous nature, but is close enough to the genus ''Citrus'' to be used as a rootstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-59609-4_15|chapter=Genetic Transformation of ''Poncirus trifoliata'' (Trifoliate Orange)| last1=Kaneyoshi | first1=J. | last2=Kobayashi | first2=S. | title=Transgenic Trees | series= Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry  | volume=44 | pages=212–220 | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Swingle moved the trifoliate orange from ''Citrus'' to its own [[genus]], ''[[Poncirus]]''.  It was long thought to be the only member of this genus, until a second species, ''Poncirus polyandra'', was discovered in [[Yunnan]] ([[People's Republic of China|China]]) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="nuclear phylogenetic" /&gt;  Early phylogenetic analysis nested ''Poncirus'' within the citrus, suggesting they all belong to a single genus,&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439609204700537 | doi=10.1078/1439-6092-00058 | title=What is Citrus? Taxonomic implications from a study of cp-DNA evolution in the tribe Citreae (Rutaceae subfamily Aurantioideae) | last1=de Araújo | first1=Edson Freitas |last2=Queiroza | first2=Luciano Paganuccide | last3=Machado |first3=Marcos Antônio  | year=2003 | volume= 1 | pages=55–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt;&lt;ref name="nuclear phylogenetic" /&gt; but the genomic sequencing of Wu, ''et al.'', placed it outside the cluster representing ''Citrus'', and the authors retained a separate ''Poncirus'' genus.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;

====''Citroncirus''====
As with kumquats, the trifoliate orange does not naturally interbreed with core taxa due to different flowering times,&lt;ref name="Froelicher" /&gt; but hybrids have been produced artificially between ''Poncirus'' and members of the genus ''Citrus''. In the Swingle system the name coined for these intra-generic crosses, represented as a hybrid genus, is "× ''Citroncirus''".  The group includes the [[citrange]], a hybrid between the trifoliate and [[sweet orange]]s, and the [[citrumelo]], a hybrid of trifoliate orange and 'Duncan' [[grapefruit]].  Were ''Poncirus'' to be subsumed into ''Citrus'', these hybrids would no longer be intergeneric, and would all likewise fall within ''Citrus''.

'''Computer security''', '''cybersecurity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schatz|first=Daniel|last2=Bashroush|first2=Rabih|last3=Wall|first3=Julie|date=2017|title=Towards a More Representative Definition of Cyber Security|url=https://commons.erau.edu/jdfsl/vol12/iss2/8/|journal=Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=|issn=1558-7215|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''information technology security''' ('''IT security''') is the protection of [[computer system]]s from theft or damage to their [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]] or [[Data (computing)|electronic data]], as well as from [[denial-of-service attack|disruption]] or [[botnet|misdirection]] of the services they provide.

The field is growing in importance due to increasing reliance on computer systems, the [[Internet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], 7 May 2013, The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wireless network]]s such as [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]], and due to the growth of [[smart devices|"smart" devices]], including [[smartphone]]s, [[television]]s and the various tiny devices that constitute the [[Internet of things]]. Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, it is also one of the major challenges of the contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Tim |title=Global Cybersecurity: New Directions in Theory and Methods |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1569 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerabilities and attacks==
{{Main|Vulnerability (computing)}}

A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVE) database.

An ''exploitable'' vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or "[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit"]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Computer Security and Mobile Security Challenges |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979_Computer_Security_and_Mobile_Security_Challenges |website=researchgate.net |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012010519/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979_Computer_Security_and_Mobile_Security_Challenges |archivedate=12 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vulnerabilities are often hunted or exploited with the aid of [[Automated threat|automated tools]] or manually using customized scripts.

To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these [[threat (computer)|threats]] can typically be classified into one of these categories below:

===Backdoor===
A [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in a computer system, a [[cryptosystem]] or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal [[authentication]] or security controls. They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.

===Denial-of-service attacks===
[[Denial of service attacks]] (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attack |url=https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |website=csa.gov.sg |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806080013/https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |archivedate=6 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [[zombie computer]]s of a [[botnet]], but a range of other techniques are possible including [[Distributed Reflection Denial of Service|reflection and amplification attacks]], where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.

===Direct-access attacks===
An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making [[operating system]] modifications, installing software [[computer worm|worms]], [[keystroke logging|keyloggers]], [[covert listening device]]s or using wireless mice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ Wireless mouse leave billions at risk of computer hack: cyber security firm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050123/http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ |date=3 April 2016 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media. [[Disk encryption]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] are designed to prevent these attacks.

===Eavesdropping===
[[Eavesdropping]] is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] and [[Narus (company)|NarusInSight]] have been used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to eavesdrop on the systems of [[internet service provider]]s. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [[electromagnetism|electro-magnetic]] transmissions generated by the hardware; [[TEMPEST]] is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.

=== Multivector, polymorphic attacks ===
Surfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Multi-Vector Attacks Demand Multi-Vector Protection |work=MSSP Alert |date=July 24, 2018 |url=https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-guests/multi-vector-attacks-demand-multi-vector-protection/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; polymorphic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Renee |last=Millman |title=New polymorphic malware evades three quarters of AV scanners |work=SC Magazine UK |date=December 15, 2017 |url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/new-polymorphic-malware-evades-three-quarters-of-av-scanners/article/718757/  }}&lt;/ref&gt; cyber threats surfaced that combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread. These threats have been classified as fifth generation cyberattacks.&lt;ref name=ovum&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Ovum |title=Thinking about cyberattacks in generations can help focus enterprise security plans |first=Rik |last=Turner |date=May 22, 2018 | work=Informa PLC | url=https://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/int003-000164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phishing===
[[Phishing]] is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |title=Identifying Phishing Attempts |publisher=Case |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913200707/http://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phishing is typically carried out by [[email spoofing]] or [[instant messaging]], and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of [[Social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]].

===Privilege escalation===
[[Privilege escalation]] describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to fool the system into giving them access to restricted data; or even to "[[superuser|become root]]" and have full unrestricted access to a system.

===Social engineering===
{{Main|Social engineering (security)}}

[[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arcos Sergio |title=Social Engineering |url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043630/http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scam involves fake CEO emails sent to accounting and finance departments. In early 2016, the [[FBI]] reported that the scam has cost US businesses more than $2bn in about two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scannell|first1=Kara|title=CEO email scam costs companies $2bn|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83b4e9be-db16-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html#axzz41pN5YBV4|accessdate=7 May 2016|work=Financial Times|issue=25 Feb 2016|date=24 Feb 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623105523/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83b4e9be-db16-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html#axzz41pN5YBV4|archivedate=23 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] [[NBA]] team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president [[Peter Feigin]], resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 [[Form W-2|W-2]] tax forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bucks leak tax info of players, employees as result of email scam|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15615363/milwaukee-bucks-leak-tax-information-players-employees-result-email-scam|accessdate=20 May 2016|agency=Associated Press|date=20 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520144908/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15615363/milwaukee-bucks-leak-tax-informatiopn-players-employees-result-email-scam|archivedate=20 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spoofing===
{{Main|Spoofing attack}}
[[Spoofing attack|Spoofing]] is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data (such as an [[IP address]] or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.&lt;ref name="techopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing|title=What is Spoofing? – Definition from Techopedia|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630134737/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199688975.001.0001/acref-9780199688975-e-4987|title=spoofing|access-date=8 October 2017|work=Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several types of spoofing, including:

* [[Email spoofing]], where an attacker forges the sending (''From'', or source) address of an email.
* [[IP address spoofing]], where an attacker alters the source IP address in a [[network packet]] to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.
* [[MAC spoofing]], where an attacker modifies the [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]] of their [[network interface]] to pose as a valid user on a network.
* [[Biometrics|Biometric]] spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Marcel|editor1-first=Sébastien|editor2-last=Nixon|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Li|editor3-first=Stan|year=2014|title=Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing: Trusted Biometrics under Spoofing Attacks|url=https://link-springer-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-6524-8.pdf|format=PDF|language=English|location=London|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-6524-8|isbn=978-1-4471-6524-8|issn=2191-6594|lccn=2014942635|access-date=8 October 2017|via=Penn State University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tampering===
[[Tampering (crime)|Tampering]] describes a malicious modification of products. So-called [[Evil Maid attack|"Evil Maid" attacks]] and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant |publisher=Ars Technica |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804130416/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |archivedate=4 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information security culture==
Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. ″Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture″ provides the following definition of information security culture: ″ISC is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contribute to the protection of information of all kinds.″&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Joo S., et al. "Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture." Australian Information Security Management Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security "effort" and often take actions that ignore organizational Information Security best interests.&lt;ref name=Reimers2017&gt;K. Reimers, D. Andersson (2017) [https://library.iated.org/view/REIMERS2017POS POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION NETWORK SECURITY: THE END USER CHALLENGE AND EVOLVING THREATS], ICERI2017 Proceedings, pp. 1787-1796.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows Information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In ″Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change″, authors commented, ″It′s a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.″ To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: Pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlienger | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Teufel | first2 = Stephanie | year = 2003 | title = Information security culture-from analysis to change | url = | journal = South African Computer Journal | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 46–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policy.
*Strategic Planning: to come up with a better awareness program, clear targets need to be set. Clustering{{definition needed|date=July 2018}} people is helpful to achieve it.
*Operative Planning: a good security culture can be established based on internal communication, management-buy-in, and security awareness and a training program.&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/&gt;
*Implementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. They are:
# Commitment of the management
# Communication with organizational members
# Courses for all organizational members
# Commitment of the employees&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/&gt;

==Systems at risk==
The growth in the number of computer systems, and the increasing reliance upon them of individuals, businesses, industries and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk.

===Financial systems===

The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], SWIFT, investment banks, and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2996896|title=The New Market Manipulation|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=3 July 2017|publisher=|ssrn=2996896|journal= Emory Law Journal |volume=66|p=1253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Web sites and apps that accept or store [[credit card number]]s, brokerage accounts, and [[bank account]] information are also prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Financial Weapons of War |journal=Minnesota Law Review|year= 2016|ssrn=2765010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-store payment systems and [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and [[Personal identification number|PINs]].

===Utilities and industrial equipment===

Computers control functions at many utilities, including coordination of [[telecommunications]], the [[power grid]], [[nuclear power plant]]s, and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks.  The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected, but the [[Stuxnet]] worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable. In 2014, the [[Computer Emergency Readiness Team]], a division of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pagliery |first1=Jose |title=Hackers attacked the U.S. energy grid 79 times this year |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/technology/security/energy-grid-hack/ |website=CNN Money |publisher=Cable News Network |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218070238/http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/technology/security/energy-grid-hack |archivedate=18 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vulnerabilities in [[smart meter]]s (many of which use local radio or cellular communications) can cause problems with billing fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.securestate.com/blog/2012/02/16/vulnerabilities-in-smart-meters | title=Vulnerabilities in Smart Meters and the C12.12 Protocol | date=2012-02-16 | accessdate=4 November 2016 | publisher=SecureState | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100223/https://www.securestate.com/blog/2012/02/16/vulnerabilities-in-smart-meters | archivedate=17 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
The [[aviation]] industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked.&lt;ref name="Computer Security in Aviation"&gt;P. G. Neumann, "Computer Security in Aviation," presented at International Conference on Aviation Safety and Security in the 21st Century, White House Commission on Safety and Security, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;J.

The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity, [[air traffic control]] outages, loss of aircraft, and even loss of life.

===Consumer devices===
Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information, or to construct a [[botnet]] to attack another target. [[Smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[smart watch]]es, and other [[mobile devices]] such as [[quantified self]] devices like [[activity tracker]]s have sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS receivers, compasses, and [[accelerometers]] which could be exploited, and may collect personal information, including sensitive health information. Wifi, Bluetooth, and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors, and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach.&lt;ref name="nestwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/08/06/338334508/is-your-watch-or-thermostat-a-spy-cyber-security-firms-are-on-it|title=Is Your Watch Or Thermostat A Spy?

Some cyberattacks are ordered by foreign governments, these governments engage in [[cyberwarfare]] with the intent to spread their propaganda, sabotage, or spy on their targets.

Vehicles are increasingly computerized, with engine timing, [[cruise control]], [[anti-lock brakes]], seat belt tensioners, door locks, [[airbag]]s and [[advanced driver-assistance systems]] on many models. Additionally, [[connected car]]s may use WiFi and Bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt; [[Self-driving car]]s are expected to be even more complex.

All of these systems carry some security risk, and such issues have gained wide attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | url=http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-02-06_MarkeyReport-Tracking_Hacking_CarSecurity%202.pdf | title=Tracking &amp; Hacking: Security &amp; Privacy Gaps Put American Drivers at Risk | date=2015-02-06 | accessdate=4 November 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109040112/http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-02-06_MarkeyReport-Tracking_Hacking_CarSecurity%202.pdf | archivedate=9 November 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=AOL|title=Cybersecurity expert: It will take a 'major event' for companies to take this issue seriously|url=https://www.aol.com/article/news/2016/12/26/expert-warns-major-event-will-need-to-happen-for-cybersecurity/21632630/|website=AOL.com|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120180918/https://www.aol.com/article/news/2016/12/26/expert-warns-major-event-will-need-to-happen-for-cybersecurity/21632630/|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The problem with self-driving cars: who controls the code?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/the-problem-with-self-driving-cars-who-controls-the-code|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 January 2017|date=23 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316152605/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/the-problem-with-self-driving-cars-who-controls-the-code|archivedate=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples of risk include a malicious [[compact disc]] being used as an attack vector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf|title=Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces|year=2011|conference=SEC'11 Proceedings of the 20th USENIX conference on Security|pages=6–6|publisher=USENIX Association|location=Berkeley, CA, US|author1=Stephen Checkoway|author2=Damon McCoy|author3=Brian Kantor|author4=Danny Anderson|author5=Hovav Shacham|author6=Stefan Savage|author7=Karl Koscher|author8=Alexei Czeskis|author9=Franziska Roesner|author10=Tadayoshi Kohno|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221064614/http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the car's onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping.

=== Energy sector ===
In distributed generation systems, the risk of cyber attacks is real, according to ''Daily Energy Insider''. An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time, and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster. The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Authority within the city, with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility, [[Pepco]], the chance to better estimate energy demand. The D.C. proposal, however, would "allow third-party vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution, which could potentially create more opportunities for cyberattackers to threaten the electric grid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/13110-d-c-distributed-energy-proposal-draws-concerns-of-increased-cybersecurity-risks/|title=D.C. distributed energy proposal draws concerns of increased cybersecurity risks|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|date=2018-06-18|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of security breaches==
Serious financial damage has been caused by [[security breaches]], but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. "Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to [[computer virus|virus]] and [[computer worm|worm]] attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal."&lt;ref&gt;Cashell, B., Jackson, W. D., Jickling, M., &amp; Webel, B. (2004). The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attacks. Congressional Research Service, Government and Finance Division. Washington DC: The Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Security breaches continue to cost businesses billions of dollars but a survey revealed that 66% of security staffs do not believe senior leadership takes cyber precautions as a strategic priority.&lt;ref name="secureworks"/&gt;{{third-party inline|date=October 2017}}

However, reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions. According to the classic [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the [[expected value]] of the loss resulting from a cyber/information [[security breach]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Lawrence |last2=Loeb |first2=Martin |title=The Economics of Information Security Investment |journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security |date=November 2002 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=438–457 |doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacker motivation==
As with [[physical security]], the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandals]], some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced, but started with amateurs such as [[Markus Hess]] who hacked for the [[KGB]], as recounted by [[Clifford Stoll]],  in ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.

A standard part of [[threat modelling]] for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system, and who might be motivated to breach it. The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured. A home [[personal computer]], [[bank]], and [[Classified information|classified]] military [[computer network|network]] face very different threats, even when the underlying technologies in use are similar.

==Computer protection (countermeasures)==
In computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a [[Threat (computer)|threat]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], or an [[attack (computing)|attack]] by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;{{IETF RFC|2828}} Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009&gt;[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227163121/http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf |date=27 February 2012 }} dated 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|title=InfosecToday Glossary|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120041536/http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections:

===Security by design===
{{Main|Secure by design}}

[[Secure by design|Security by design]], or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure.  In this case, security is considered as a main feature.

Some of the techniques in this approach include:
* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.
* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.
* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]], approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.
* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.
* Default secure settings, and design to "fail secure" rather than "fail insecure" (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in [[safety engineering]]). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.
* [[Audit trail]]s tracking system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.
* [[Full disclosure (computer security)|Full disclosure]] of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the "[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]" is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.

===Security architecture===
The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as "the design [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall [[information technology architecture]]. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and [[assurance services]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture Definitions: IT Security Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315012754/http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture |date=15 March 2014 }}. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Techopedia defines security architecture as "a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible." The key attributes of security architecture are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jannsen |first1=Cory |title=Security Architecture |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |website=Techopedia |publisher=Janalta Interactive Inc |accessdate=9 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003064643/http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |archivedate=3 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.
* the determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practice, finances, and legal matters.
* the standardization of controls.

===Security measures===
A state of computer "security" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response.  These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:

* [[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively.
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering.  Firewalls can be both hardware- or software-based.
* [[Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|logs]] serve a similar function for individual systems.
* "Response" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, a complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.

Today, computer security comprises mainly "preventive" measures, like firewalls or an [[exit procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called "physical firewall", which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the [[Internet]].

Some organizations are turning to [[big data]] platforms, such as [[Apache Hadoop]], to extend data accessibility and [[machine learning]] to detect [[advanced persistent threat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|title=Cybersecurity at petabyte scale|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713120506/http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|archivedate=13 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|title=Why ONI May Be Our Best Hope for Cyber Security Now|last=Woodie|first=Alex|date=9 May 2016|work=|access-date=13 July 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015812/https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organized response mechanisms in place. As a result, as Reuters points out: "Companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |title=Firms lose more to electronic than physical theft |publisher=Reuters |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113829/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary obstacle to effective eradication of cyber crime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated "detection" systems. Yet it is basic evidence gathering by using [[packet capture appliance]]s that puts criminals behind bars.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Vulnerability management===
{{main|Vulnerability management}}
Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying, and remediating or mitigating [[Software vulnerability|vulnerabilities]],&lt;ref&gt;Foreman, P: ''Vulnerability Management'', page 1. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-0150-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[software]] and [[firmware]]. Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and [[network security]].

Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a [[vulnerability scanner]], which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities,&lt;ref name="Codenomicon"&gt;Anna-Maija Juuso and Ari Takanen ''Unknown Vulnerability Management'', Codenomicon whitepaper, October 2010 {{cite web |url=http://www.codenomicon.com/solutions/unknown-vulnerability-management/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227073552/http://www.codenomicon.com/solutions/unknown-vulnerability-management/ |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[open port]]s, insecure software configuration, and susceptibility to [[malware]].

Beyond vulnerability scanning, many organisations contract outside security auditors to run regular [[penetration test]]s against their systems to identify vulnerabilities. In some sectors this is a contractual requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1-84928-554-4|title=PCI DSS: A Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition|author=Alan Calder and Geraint Williams|quote=network vulnerability scans at least quarterly and after any significant change in the network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing vulnerabilities===
While [[formal verification]] of the correctness of computer systems is possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/LICS.2003.1210044 |year=2003 |last1=Harrison |first1=J. |pages=45–54|journal=18th Annual IEEE Symposium of Logic in Computer Science, 2003. Proceedings |title=Formal verification at Intel |isbn=0-7695-1884-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Zerksis D. |last=Umrigar |first2=Vijay |last2=Pitchumani |chapter=Formal verification of a real-time hardware design |chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=800667 |title=Proceeding DAC '83 Proceedings of the 20th Design Automation Conference |publisher=IEEE Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-8186-0026-8 |pages=221–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not yet common. Operating systems formally verified include [[seL4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sel4.systems/Docs/seL4-spec.pdf |title=Abstract Formal Specification of the seL4/ARMv6 API |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521171234/https://sel4.systems/Docs/seL4-spec.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SYSGO]]'s [[PikeOS]]&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Baumann, Bernhard Beckert, Holger Blasum, and Thorsten Bormer [http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Ba10EW.pdf Ingredients of Operating System Correctness? Lessons Learned in the Formal Verification of PikeOS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719110932/http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Ba10EW.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganssle.com/rants/gettingitright.htm "Getting it Right"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504191958/http://www.ganssle.com/rants/gettingitright.htm |date=4 May 2013 }} by Jack Ganssle&lt;/ref&gt; – but these make up a very small percentage of the market.

[[Two factor authentication]] is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information. It requires "something you know"; a password or PIN, and "something you have"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.

Social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information.  Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk, but even in a highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.

Enoculation, derived from [[inoculation theory]], seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Treglia, J., &amp; Delia, M. (2017). Cyber Security Inoculation. Presented at NYS Cyber Security Conference, Empire State Plaza Convention Center, Albany, NY, 3–4 June.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates, using a security scanner{{definition needed|date=July 2018}} or/and hiring competent people responsible for security.(This statement is ambiguous. Even systems developed by "competent" people get penetrated) The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced by careful [[backup|backing up]] and [[insurance]].

===Hardware protection mechanisms===
{{see also|Computer security compromised by hardware failure}}

While hardware may be a source of insecurity, such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hacker-in-your-hardware/|title=The Hacker in Your Hardware: The Next Security Threat|work=Scientific American|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312221955/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hacker-in-your-hardware/|archivedate=12 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Waksman |first1=Adam |last2=Sethumadhavan |first2=Simha |title=Tamper Evident Microprocessors |volume= |pages= |periodical=Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy |location=Oakland, California |url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf |year=2010 |issn= |doi= |isbn= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055451/http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Using devices and methods such as [[dongle]]s, [[trusted platform module]]s, intrusion-aware cases, drive locks, disabling USB ports, and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access (or sophisticated [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor access]]) required in order to be compromised.  Each of these is covered in more detail below.

* USB [[dongle]]s are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-spincorp.com/espinv3/index.php/solutions/3-solutions/174-sentinel-hasp-hl |title=Sentinel HASP HL |publisher=E-Spin |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220549/http://www.e-spincorp.com/espinv3/index.php/solutions/3-solutions/174-sentinel-hasp-hl |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device's software.  The dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key.  The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) provides a stronger measure of security, since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it.  Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing web-based content such as cloud software or [[Virtual Private Networks]] (VPNs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5200-token-based-authentication/ |title=Token-based authentication |publisher=SafeNet.com |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320234026/http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5200-token-based-authentication/ |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewindowsclub.com/lock-protect-your-windows-pc-using-a-usb-drive-with-predator |title=Lock and protect your Windows PC |publisher=TheWindowsClub.com |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220321/http://www.thewindowsclub.com/lock-protect-your-windows-pc-using-a-usb-drive-with-predator |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trusted platform module]]s (TPMs) secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices, through the use of microprocessors, or so-called computers-on-a-chip.  TPMs used in conjunction with server-side software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices, preventing unauthorized network and data access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf |title=Intel Trusted Execution Technology: White Paper |year=2012 |accessdate=2013-12-18 |author=James Greene |publisher=Intel Corporation |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611161421/http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Computer case#Intrusion detection|Computer case intrusion detection]] refers to a device, typically a push-button switch, which detects when a computer case is opened.  The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time.
* Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives, making them inaccessible to thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmagazine.com/safenet-protectdrive-84/review/2596/ |title=SafeNet ProtectDrive 8.4 |publisher=SCMagazine.com |date=2008-10-04 |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220133/http://www.scmagazine.com/safenet-protectdrive-84/review/2596/ |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342798,00.asp |title=Secure Hard Drives: Lock Down Your Data |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2009-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202140/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342798,00.asp |archivedate=21 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer.  Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks.
* Disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices ( like camera, GPS, removable storage  etc.), that are not in use. &lt;ref&gt; NIST 800-124  https://www.nist.gov/publications/guidelines-managing-security-mobile-devices-enterprise &lt;/ref&gt;
* Mobile-enabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones.  Built-in capabilities such as [[Bluetooth]], the newer [[Bluetooth low energy]] (LE), [[Near field communication]] (NFC) on non-iOS devices and [[biometrics|biometric]] validation such as thumb print readers, as well as [[QR code]] reader software designed for mobile devices, offer new, secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems.  These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2804966490001/forget-ids-use-your-phone-as-credentials/?playlist_id=937116503001#sp=show-clips |title=Forget IDs, use your phone as credentials |publisher=[[Fox Business Network]] |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320215829/http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2804966490001/forget-ids-use-your-phone-as-credentials/?playlist_id=937116503001#sp=show-clips |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure operating systems===
{{Main|Security-evaluated operating system}}
One use of the term "computer security" refers to technology that is used to implement secure [[operating system]]s. In the 1980s the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) used the [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria|"Orange Book"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Lipner |title=The Birth and Death of the Orange Book |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=19–31 |year=2015 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2015.27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; standards, but the current international standard ISO/IEC 15408, "[[Common Criteria]]" defines a number of progressively more stringent [[Evaluation Assurance Level]]s. Many common operating systems meet the EAL4 standard of being "Methodically Designed, Tested and Reviewed", but the [[formal verification]] required for the highest levels means that they are uncommon. An example of an EAL6 ("Semiformally Verified Design and Tested") system is [[INTEGRITY-178B|Integrity-178B]], which is used in the [[Airbus A380]]&lt;ref name=darkreading&gt;{{cite web |author=Kelly Jackson Higgins |url=http://www.darkreading.com/applications/secure-os-gets-highest-nsa-rating-goes-c/212100421 |title=Secure OS Gets Highest NSA Rating, Goes Commercial |publisher=Dark Reading |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203031833/http://www.darkreading.com/applications/secure-os-gets-highest-nsa-rating-goes-c/212100421 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and several military jets.&lt;ref name="VITA Technologies Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board or bored?

===Secure coding===
{{Main|Secure coding}}
In software engineering, [[secure coding]] aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities. It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure. Such systems are "[[secure by design]]". Beyond this, [[formal verification]]  aims to prove the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] of the [[algorithms]] underlying a system;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanghavi|first=Alok|title=What is formal verification?|journal=EE Times_Asia|date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
important for [[cryptographic protocol]]s for example.

===Capabilities and access control lists===
{{Main|Access control list|Capability (computers)}}

Within computer systems, two of many [[Computer security model|security models]] capable of enforcing privilege separation are [[access control list]]s (ACLs) and [[capability-based security]]. Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations, such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access, an issue known as the [[confused deputy problem]]. It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities. This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems, but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Capabilities have been mostly restricted to research [[operating system]]s, while commercial OSs still use ACLs. Capabilities can, however, also be implemented at the language level, leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object-oriented design. An open source project in the area is the [[E programming language|E language]].

===End user security training===
The end-user is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Studies prove once again that users are the weakest link in the security chain |url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/2137210/security-awareness/studies-prove-once-again-that-users-are-the-weakest-link-in-the-security-chain.html |website=CSO Online |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is estimated that more than 90% of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Role of Human Error in Successful Security Attacks |url=https://securityintelligence.com/the-role-of-human-error-in-successful-security-attacks/ |website=IBM Security Intelligence |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=90% of security incidents trace back to PEBKAC and ID10T errors |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2910316/90-of-security-incidents-trace-back-to-pebkac-and-id10t-errors.html |website=Computerworld |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management, the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments.

As the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Human Component of Cyber Risk |url=https://www.coruscan.com/cyber-risk/human-component |website=The Coruscan Project |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization is facing, security awareness training, at all levels, does not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Risky business: why security awareness is crucial for employees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/feb/12/business-cyber-security-risks-employees |website=The Guardian |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats.

The focus on the end-user represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners, who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective, and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Developing a Security Culture |url=https://www.cpni.gov.uk/developing-security-culture |website=CPNI - Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization, recognizing that a security aware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks.

===Response to breaches===
Responding forcefully to attempted [[security breaches]] (in the manner that one would for attempted physical security breaches) is often very difficult for a variety of reasons:
* Identifying attackers is difficult, as they are often in a different [[jurisdiction]] to the systems they attempt to breach, and operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymizing procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in yet another jurisdiction.  If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|logs]] to cover their tracks.
* The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organisations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated [[vulnerability scanner]]s and [[computer worm]]s.
* [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers.  There are also budgetary constraints.  It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing, and improved [[forensics]] mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.
* The United States government spends the largest amount of money every year on cyber security. The United States has a yearly budget of 28 billion dollars. Canada has the 2nd highest annual budget at 1 billion dollars. Australia has the third highest budget with only 70 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://macategroup.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/top-3-leading-cybersecurity-countries/|title=Top 3 Leading Cybersecurity Countries|date=7 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident response planning==
Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack. An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion, typically escalates to a more impactful event such as a data breach or system failure. The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to limit damage and reduce recovery time and costs. Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities, restore services and processes and minimize impact and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://talatek.com/risk-management-services/incident-response/|title=TalaTek Incident Response Services|last=Alsinawi|first=Baan|work=TalaTek, LLC|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage. Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organization’s response to a cyberattack. Without a documented plan in place, an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles, processes and procedures during an escalation, slowing the organizations response and resolution.

There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan:  

# '''Preparation''': Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises
# '''Detection &amp; Analysis''': Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident, prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident
# '''Containment, Eradication &amp; Recovery''': Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact, pinpointing the genesis of the incident, removing malware, affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains
# '''Post Incident Activity''': Post mortem analysis of the incident, its root cause and the organization’s response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://talatek.com/risk-management-services/incident-response/|title=TalaTek Incident Response Services|last=Alsinawi|first=Baan|work=TalaTek, LLC|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below.
&lt;!-- We don't want to list every breach ever – and please keep the descriptions short --&gt;

===Robert Morris and the first computer worm===
{{Main|Morris worm}}
In 1988, only 60,000 computers were connected to the Internet, and most were mainframes, minicomputers and professional workstations. On 2 November 1988, many started to slow down, because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers – the first internet "[[computer worm]]".&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Jonathan Zittrain, 'The Future of The Internet', Penguin Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The software was traced back to 23-year-old [[Cornell University]] graduate student [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] who said 'he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet'.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

===Rome Laboratory===
In 1994, over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the [[Rome Laboratory]], the US Air Force's main command and research facility. Using [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]], hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Rome's networking systems and remove traces of their activities. The intruders were able to obtain classified files, such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some Defense contractors, and other private sector organizations, by posing as
a trusted Rome center user.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/gao/aim96084.htm Information Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140354/http://fas.org/irp/gao/aim96084.htm |date=6 March 2016 }}. United States Department of Defense, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===TJX customer credit card details===
In early 2007, American apparel and home goods company [[TJX Companies|TJX]] announced that it was the victim of an [[Hacker (computer security)|unauthorized computer systems intrusion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.

===Stuxnet attack===
In 2010 the computer worm known as [[Stuxnet]] reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's [[nuclear centrifuge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stuxnet-was-far-more-dangerous-than-previous-thought-2013-11 |title=The Stuxnet Attack On Iran's Nuclear Plant Was 'Far More Dangerous' Than Previously Thought |publisher=Business Insider |date=20 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509020404/http://www.businessinsider.com/stuxnet-was-far-more-dangerous-than-previous-thought-2013-11 |archivedate=9 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It did so by disrupting industrial [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) in a targeted attack.

===Global surveillance disclosures===
{{Main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}
In early 2013, documents provided by [[Edward Snowden]] were published by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 August 2013|quote=Exclusive: Top secret court order requiring [[Verizon]] to hand over all call data shows scale of domestic surveillance under [[Barack Obama|Obama]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816045641/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|archivedate=16 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ARDinterview&gt;{{cite web |last=Seipel |first=Hubert |title=Transcript: ARD interview with Edward Snowden |url=https://www.freesnowden.is/fr/2014/01/27/video-ard-interview-with-edward-snowden/ |work=La Foundation Courage |accessdate=11 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174333/https://www.freesnowden.is/fr/2014/01/27/video-ard-interview-with-edward-snowden/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; exposing the massive scale of [[NSA]] global surveillance. There were also indications that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor in a [[NIST]] standard for encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lily Hay |last=Newman |date=9 October 2013 |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/can-you-trust-nist |title=Can You Trust NIST? |journal=IEEE Spectrum |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201095426/http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/can-you-trust-nist |archivedate=1 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard was later withdrawn due to widespread criticism.&lt;ref name="nist_abandonment"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/sp800-90-042114.cfm | work=National Institute of Standards and Technology | title=NIST Removes Cryptography Algorithm from Random Number Generator Recommendations | date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA additionally were revealed to have tapped the links between [[Google]]'s data centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2013/10/30/nsa-google-yahoo-data-centers/ "New Snowden Leak: NSA Tapped Google, Yahoo Data Centers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709131535/http://mashable.com/2013/10/30/nsa-google-yahoo-data-centers/ |date=9 July 2014 }}, 31 Oct 2013, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, mashable.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Target and Home Depot breaches===

In 2013 and 2014, a [[Russia]]n/[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] hacking ring known as "Rescator" broke into [[Target Corporation]] computers in 2013, stealing roughly 40 million credit cards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-13/target-missed-alarms-in-epic-hack-of-credit-card-data |title=Target Missed Warnings in Epic Hack of Credit Card Data – Businessweek |author1=Michael Riley |author2=Ben Elgin |author3=Dune Lawrence |author4=Carol Matlack |work=Businessweek.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127015928/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-13/target-missed-alarms-in-epic-hack-of-credit-card-data |archivedate=27 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Home Depot]] computers in 2014, stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/53-million-emails-stolen-in-home-depot-breach/|title=Home Depot says 53 million emails stolen|date=6 November 2014|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209035159/http://www.cnet.com/news/53-million-emails-stolen-in-home-depot-breach/|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Warnings were delivered at both corporations, but ignored;  physical security breaches using [[Self-checkout|self checkout machine]]s are believed to have played a large role.  "The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting," says Jim Walter, director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee – meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing [[antivirus software]] had administrators responded to the warnings.  The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing.

===Office of Personnel Management data breach===
In April 2015, the [[United States Office of Personnel Management|Office of Personnel Management]] [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|discovered it had been hacked]] more than a year earlier in a data breach, resulting in the theft of approximately 21.5 million personnel records handled by the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|title=Millions more Americans hit by government personnel data hack|date=2017-07-09|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2017-02-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228005352/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|archivedate=28 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Office of Personnel Management hack has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888|title=U.S. Suspects Hackers in China Breached About four (4) Million People's Records, Officials Say|last=Barrett|first=Devlin|date=|website=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604215718/http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888|archivedate=4 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data targeted in the breach included [[personally identifiable information]] such as [[Social Security number|Social Security Numbers]], names, dates and places of birth, addresses, and fingerprints of current and former government employees as well as anyone who had undergone a government background check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/05/china-suspected-in-theft-of-federal-employee-records|title=China Suspected in Theft of Federal Employee Records|last=Risen|first=Tom|date=5 June 2015|website=US News &amp; World Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606064331/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/05/china-suspected-in-theft-of-federal-employee-records|archive-date=2015-06-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|title=Estimate of Americans hit by government personnel data hack skyrockets|last=Zengerle|first=Patricia|date=2015-07-19|website=Reuters|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710075449/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed the hack was perpetrated by Chinese hackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html|title=Hacking Linked to China Exposes Millions of U.S. Workers|last=Sanger|first=David|date=5 June 2015|website=New York Times|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605135158/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html|archivedate=5 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashley Madison breach===
{{main|Ashley Madison data breach{{!}}Ashley Madison Data Breach}}

In July 2015, a hacker group known as "The Impact Team" successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison, created by [[Avid Life Media]]. The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well. After the breach, The Impact Team dumped emails from the company's CEO, to prove their point, and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Legal issues and global regulation==
International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature. There is no global base of common rules to judge, and eventually punish, [[Cybercrime|cyber crimes]] and cyber criminals - and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of [[malware]] or form of [[Cyber-Attacks|cyber attack]], often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute.&lt;ref name="ted.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen: Fighting viruses, defending the net |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |publisher=TED |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116010603/http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen – Behind Enemy Lines |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |publisher=Hack In The Box Security Conference |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125075257/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |archivedate=25 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proving attribution for cyber crimes and cyber attacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies. "[[Computer viruses]] switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another – moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone [had] given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world."&lt;ref name="ted.com" /&gt; The use of techniques such as [[dynamic DNS]], [[fast flux]] and [[Bulletproof hosting|bullet proof servers]] add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement.

==Role of government==
The role of the government is to make [[Cyber-security regulation|regulations]] to force companies and organizations to protect their systems, infrastructure and information from any [[cyberattack]]s, but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national [[Power grid|power-grid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ensuring the Security of Federal Information Systems and Cyber Critical Infrastructure and Protecting the Privacy of Personally Identifiable Information |url=http://www.gao.gov/highrisk/protecting_the_federal_government_information_systems/why_did_study |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119221200/http://www.gao.gov/highrisk/protecting_the_federal_government_information_systems/why_did_study |archivedate=19 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government's regulatory role in [[cyberspace]] is complicated. For some, cyberspace was seen [[virtual space]] that was to remain free of government intervention, as can be seen in many of today's libertarian [[blockchain]] and [[bitcoin]] discussions.&lt;ref name="King ref"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/1284178/almost-half-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-bros-identify-as-libertarian/|work=Quartz|first=Georgia |last=King |title=The Venn diagram between libertarians and crypto bros is so close it’s basically a circle |date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Many government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation, mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem. [[Richard A. Clarke|R. Clarke]] said during a panel discussion at the [[RSA Conference|RSA Security Conference]] in [[San Francisco]], he believes that the "industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If the industry doesn't respond (to the threat), you have to follow through."&lt;ref name="Clarke ref"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-02-17/business/17361991_1_rsa-security-conference-cybersecurity-counterpane-internet-security |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |first=Carrie |last=Kirby |title=Former White House aide backs some Net regulation / Clarke says government, industry deserve 'F' in cyber security |date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary, but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently. Daniel R. McCarthy analyzed this public-private partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=Daniel |title=Privatizing Political Authority: Cybersecurity, Public-Private Partnerships, and the Reproduction of Liberal Political Order |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1335 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International actions==
Many different teams and organisations exist, including:

[[China]]'s [[Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization]] ({{lang-zh|中央网络安全和信息化领导小组}}) was established on 27 February 2014. This Leading Small Group (LSG) of the [[Communist Party of China]] is headed by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] himself and is staffed with relevant Party and state decision-makers. The LSG was created to overcome the incoherent policies and overlapping responsibilities that characterized China's former cyberspace decision-making mechanisms. The LSG oversees policy-making in the economic, political, cultural, social and military fields as they relate to network security and IT strategy. This LSG also coordinates major policy initiatives in the international arena that promote norms and standards favored by the [[Chinese government]] and that emphasize the principle of national sovereignty in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;"6.16 Internet security: National IT independence and China’s cyber policy," in: [[Sebastian Heilmann]], editor, [{{cite web |url=https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323234015/https://www.merics.org/en/about-us/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |archivedate=23 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }} China''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Political System'']'','' Lanham, Boulder, New York, London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers (2017)   {{ISBN|978-1442277342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer emergency readiness team====
"[[Computer emergency response team]]" is a name given to expert groups that handle computer security incidents.
In the US, two distinct organization exist, although they do work closely together.
* [[US-CERT]]: part of the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref name=Computerworld&gt;{{cite news |author=Verton, Dan |title=DHS launches national cyber alert system |url=http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,89488,00.html |date=28 January 2004 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG |accessdate=2008-06-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831162039/http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,89488,00.html |archivedate=31 August 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern warfare==
{{Main|Cyberwarfare}}

There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare. As Mark Clayton from the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' described in an article titled "The New Cyber Arms Race":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the future, wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs. They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities, transportation, communications, and energy. Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops, the path of jet fighters, the command and control of warships.&lt;ref name="The new cyber arms race"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clayton |first1=Mark |title=The new cyber arms race |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |website=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416090310/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |archivedate=16 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has led to new terms such as ''[[cyberwarfare]]'' and ''[[cyberterrorism]]''. The [[United States Cyber Command]] was created in 2009&lt;ref name="Nakashima"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nakashima, Ellen |date=13 September 2016 |title=Obama to be urged to split cyberwar command from NSA |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-to-be-urged-to-split-cyberwar-command-from-the-nsa/2016/09/12/0ad09a22-788f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html |archiveurl=

==Terminology==
The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below:
* Access [[authorization]] restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of [[authentication]] systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive [[login]] screen, or individual services, such as a [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[passwords]], [[identification card|identification cards]], [[smart card|smart cards]], and [[biometric]] systems.
* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).
* [[Application software|Applications]] are [[executable|executable code]], so general practice is to [[Superuser|disallow users the power]] to install them; to install only those which are known to be reputable – and to reduce the [[attack surface]] by installing as few as possible. They are typically run with [[least privilege]], with a robust process in place to identify, test and install any released [[security patch]]es or updates for them.
* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.]
* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.
* [[Backup|Backups]] are one or more copies kept of important computer files. Typically, multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged, other copies will still exist.
* [[Capability (computers)|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer security#Capabilities vs. ACLs|Capabilities vs. ACLs]] discusses their use.
* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.
* [[Confidentiality]] is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confidentiality |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidentiality |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] is an internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems.
* [[Data integrity]] is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Integrity |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106055944/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.]]
* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the confidentiality of a message. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher|ciphers]] are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] them infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key|shared keys]], and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate|digital certificates]] can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.
* [[Endpoint security]] software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and USB drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Endpoint Security |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |accessdate=2014-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316021605/http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] serve as a gatekeeper system between networks, allowing only traffic that matches defined rules. They often include detailed [[Logfile|logging]], and may include [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]] and [[Intrusion detection system#Intrusion prevention|intrusion prevention]] features. They are near-universal between company [[local area networks]] and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if [[network segmentation]] is configured.
* A [[Security hacker|hacker]] is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network. 
* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.
* [[Intrusion-detection system|Intrusion-detection systems]] are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.
* A [[microkernel]] is an approach to operating system design which has only the near-minimum amount of code running at the most privileged level – and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, in the safer, less privileged [[user space]].
* [[Ping (networking utility)|Pinging]]. The standard "ping" application can be used to test if an IP address is in use. If it is, attackers may then try a [[port scan]] to detect which services are exposed.
* A [[port scan]] is used to probe an IP address for [[Port (computer networking)|open ports]] with the purpose of identifying accessible network services.
* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security.

'''Configuration graphs''' are a theoretical tool used in [[computational complexity theory]] to prove a relation between [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] [[reachability]] and [[Computational complexity theory#Complexity classes|complexity classes]].{{fact|date=May 2016}}

==Definition==
A theoretical computational model, like [[Turing machine]] or [[finite automata]], explains how to do a computation. The model explains both what is an initial configuration of the machine and which steps can be taken to continue the computation, until we eventually stop. A ''configuration'', also called an ''Instantaneous Description(ID)'' is a finite representation of the machine at a given time. For example, for a finite automata and a given input, the configuration will be the current state and the number of read letters, for a Turing machine it will be the state, the content of the tape and the position of the head. A configuration graph is a directed [[labeled graph]] where the label of the vertices are the possible configurations of the models and where there is an edge from one configuration to another if it correspond to a computational step of the model.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

The initial and accepting configuration(s) of the machine are special vertices of the configuration graph. The computation accepts if and only if there is a path from an initial vertex to an accepting vertex.

==Useful property==
If there exists exactly one initial state, then a computation is deterministic if and only if from any configuration there is at most one possible step, so if and only if the graph is of out-degree 1.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

Once a dummy initial vertex with an edge to every initial vertex and a dummy accepting vertex with an edge from every accepting vertex are added, checking if there is an accepting computation only requires to check if there is a path from the initial vertex to the accepting vertex, which is the [[reachability]] problem.

A computation is said to be unambiguous if there exists at most one path from an initial vertex to an accepting vertex.

A cycle in the graph corresponds to an infinite loop in the computation.

==Size of the graph==
The computational graph can be of infinite size if there are no restrictions on possible configurations; indeed, it is easy to see that there are Turing machines which can reach arbitrarily large configurations.

It is also possible to have finite graphs: on [[Deterministic finite automaton]] with &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; states, for a given word of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the configuration is composed of the position of the head and the current state. So the graph is of size &lt;math&gt;(n+1)s&lt;/math&gt;, and the accessible part from the initial state is of size &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Use of this object==
This notion is useful because it reduces computational problems to graph [[reachability]] problems.

For example, since [[reachability]] is in [[NL (complexity)|NL]] when we can represent configurations in space which is logarithmic in the size of the input, and since the configuration of the Turing Machine in [[NL (complexity class)|NL]] is indeed of logarithmic size, then graph-reachability is [[Complete (complexity)|complete]] for NL.&lt;ref name="papa"&gt;[[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou, Christos H.]]&amp;#32;(1994). ''Computational Complexity'', Reading, Massachusetts:&amp;#32;Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-53082-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other direction, it helps to verify the complexity of a computation model; the decision problem for a (deterministic) model whose configuration are of space which is logarithmic in the size of the input is in ([[L (complexity)|L]]) [[NL (complexity)|NL]]. This is for example the case of finite automata and finite automata with one counter.

The '''Deccan Archaeological and Cultural Research Institute''' is a non-profit organisation operating in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan region]] of [[India]], registered under Act 2 of [[The Indian Trusts Act, 1882]]. It is dedicated to the conservation and preservation of India’s natural, cultural, living, tangible and intangible heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call for common Telugu research centre|website=The Hindu|author= G Venkataramana Rao|date=19 August 2014|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/call-for-common-telugu-research-centre/article6330833.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
DACRI was founded in 2009 in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]  to promote historical and cultural research among the people of the Deccae. Since 2009, it has pioneered the conservation, protection and promotion of the cultural heritage and monumental grandeur of Deccan region. 

In 2012, members of Deccan Archaeological and Cultural Research Institute (DACRI) and other archeologists and historians discovered a series of 20 [[megalithic]] burial cairn circles dating to 1000 BCE on a hillock in Madugala village in [[Mahbubnagar district]], India. The team also discovered a huge [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] site in an extent of 100 acres datable to between the 1st century BCE to 2nd Century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megalithic burial sites found|website=The Hindu|date=11 February 2012|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/megalithic-burial-sites-found/article2881674.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dry dung fuel''' (or '''dry manure fuel''') is animal [[feces]] that has been dried in order to be used as a fuel source. It is used as a fuel in many countries around the world. Using dry [[manure]] as a fuel source is an example of [[reuse of excreta]]. A disadvantage of using this kind of fuel is increased air pollution.&lt;ref name="MudwayDuggan2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mudway|first1=Ian S|last2=Duggan|first2=Sean T|last3=Venkataraman|first3=Chandra|last4=Habib|first4=Gazala|last5=Kelly|first5=Frank J|last6=Grigg|first6=Jonathan|title=Combustion of dried animal dung as biofuel results in the generation of highly redox active fine particulates| journal=Particle and Fibre Toxicology|volume=2|issue=1|year=2005|pages=6|issn=1743-8977|doi=10.1186/1743-8977-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, this kind of fuel source is known as "dung cakes".

== Types ==

===Dry dung and moist dung===
Dry dung is more commonly used than moist dung, because it [[Combustion|burns]] more easily. Dry manure is typically defined as having a moisture content less than 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fs.fed.us/woodybiomass/documents/Yakima_County_Biomass_Report.pdf|title = Biomass Report, Yakima County Public Works Solid Waste Division|format = PDF|date = |accessdate = 2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dung cakes ===
[[File:A Pile of Dung Cakes.JPG|thumb|A pile of dung cakes in the village [[Nihal Singh Wala]] of District [[Moga District|Moga]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]]]
"Dung cakes", made from the by-products of [[animal husbandry]], are traditionally used as fuel in [[India]] for making food in a domestic [[hearth]] called a [[Chulha]]. They are made by hand by village women and are traditionally made from cow or buffalo dung. One dung cake of an average size gives 2100 kJ worth of energy. Dung cakes are also known as ''goitha'', ''uple'', ''kande'', ''gosse'' or ''thepdi''.

These are the cakes of cow dung molded by bare hands with a curvature to be able to keep stuck to the walls. Once dried they are put in a pile and covered with thatch called ''bitauda''. These bitaudas are visible in parts of rural India albeit with different names. The size and shape of the cake might vary with region. Its also not uncommon to see these cakes directly used in earthen ovens.

This bio-fuel has been used primarily for two reasons: for easy disposal of cow dung and as easily available and cheap fuel. 

=== Human feces ===
[[Human feces]] can in principle also be dried and used as a fuel source if they are collected in a type of [[dry toilet]], for example an [[incinerating toilet]]. Since 2011, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] is supporting the development of such toilets as part of their "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" to promote safer, more effective ways to treat human [[excreta]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth von Muench, Dorothee Spuhler, Trevor Surridge, Nelson Ekane, Kim Andersson, Emine Goekce Fidan, Arno Rosemarin (2013) [http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-2042-ssp-17okt20134-10-about-the-gates-sanitation-grants-on-forum.pdf Sustainable Sanitation Alliance members take a closer look at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s sanitation grants], Sustainable Sanitation Practice Journal, Issue 17, p. 4-10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[omniprocessor|omni-processor]] is another example of using human feces contained in [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]] as a fuel source.

'''European studies''' is a field of study offered by many academic [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] that focuses on current developments in [[European integration]].

Some programmes offer a social science or public administration curriculum focusing on developments in the European Union. These programmes usually include a combination of political science, EU public policy, [[European history]], [[European law]], [[economics]] and [[sociology]]. Other universities approach the subject in a broader manner, including topics like [[European culture]], [[European literature]] and [[European languages]]. While all programmes focus on the study of the European Union, they often cover national topics (in a comparative perspective) as well.

The subject combines [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Disciplines that are involved in European studies include:

The ''Field Archaeology Act'' is a state Act legislating the preservation, interpretation and protection of [[archaeology]] in  the state of [[Minnesota]], [[United States of America]]. The Act is divided into twelve sections.

== Passage and revisions ==
The Act was first brought into force in 1963 and has undergone ten revisions since that time.

== Effects ==
The passage of the Field Archaeology Act in 1963 impacted the practice of archaeology in Minnesota in several critical ways. It provided proscriptions related to the practice of archaeology, banned unlicensed practitioners from conducting archaeological investigations on state sites, and enacted penalties for violations of the Act. It also officially established the Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist, and outlined the licensing process and requirements for archaeologists seeking to work on state sites. In terms of physical archaeological remains and data recovered as a result of field archaeology, the Act explicitly granted ownership and title to the state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=138|title=Field Archaeology Act|last=|first=|publisher=Revisor of Statutes|year=1963|isbn=|location=Minnesota, United States|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological protection ==
The Act affords protection to state archaeological sites under Section 138.32, in that the state "reserves to itself the exclusive right and privilege of field archaeology on state sites, in order to protect and preserve archaeological and scientific information, matter, and objects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist ==
The Act defines the position of the State Archaeologist, and dictates the lawful duties thereof. The Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist is charged with the following duties:
* Acts as the agent of the state to enforce the Act. 
* Sponsors, engages in, and directs fundamental archaeological research.
* Cooperates with agencies to preserve and interpret archaeological sites.
* Encourages protection of archaeological sites on private property.
* Retrieves and protects artifacts and data discovered on public property.
* Retrieves and protects archaeological remains disturbed by agency construction.
* Helps preserve artifacts and data recovered by archaeological work.
* Disseminates archaeological information through report publication.
* Approves archaeologist's qualifications for licensing to work on public property.
* Formulates licensing provisions for archaeological work on public property.
* Issues emergency licenses for archaeological work on public property.
* Revokes or suspends archaeological licenses due to good cause
* Approves curation arrangements of artifacts and data from state sites.
* Repossesses artifacts from state sites that are not being properly curated.
* Consults with the Minnesota Historical Society and Minnesota Indian Affairs Council regarding significant field archaeology.
* Completes annual reports about the Office of the State Archaeologist's and licensees' activities.
* Reviews and comments on agency development plans that may affect state sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/|title=Our Role|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Archaeological licensing ==
The Act provides that any archaeological work conducted on non-federal public land in Minnesota, requires a permit issued by the Office of the State Archaeologist. There are four kinds of licenses, including 
* Yearly license for reconnaissance/Phase I survey.
* Site-specific license for site evaluations/Phase II.
* Site-specific license for major excavations/Phase III.
* Site-specific license for burial authentications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/professional-archaeologists/manuals-licenses/license-types/|title=License Types|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State archaeologist provides a review and vetting of an archaeologist's qualifications, and forwards the application onto the Minnesota Historical Society for license issuance.

* [https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/professional-archaeologists/manuals-licenses/apply/ License Application Forms and Information]

== Burial grounds ==
Burial grounds and cemeteries in Minnesota are governed by the ''[[Private Cemeteries Act (Minnesota)|Private Cemeteries Act]]''. The Act was first enacted in 1976, and has been amended eight times, most recently in 2007. The State Archaeologist oversees the implementation of this Act and has the following associated duties: 
* Authenticates all unrecorded burial sites over 50 years old
* Grants permission for disturbances in unrecorded non-Indian cemeteries.
* Allows posting and approves signs for authenticated non-Indian cemeteries.
* Maintains unrecorded cemetery data.
* Provides burial sites data to the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGEO) -- formerly the Land Management Information Center (LMIC).
* Determines the ethnic identity of burials over 50 years old.
* Helps determine tribal affiliation of Indian burials.
* Determines if osteological analysis should be done on recovered remains.
* Helps establish provisions for dealing with unaffiliated Indian remains.
* Reviews development plans that may impact unrecorded burials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/the-public/resources/laws-and-statutes/|title=Laws and Statutes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frugal innovation''' or '''frugal engineering''' is the process of reducing the complexity and cost of a good and its production. Usually this refers to removing nonessential features from a [[durable good]], such as a car or phone, in order to sell it in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Designing products for such countries may also call for an increase in durability&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/cb8074b0-80ef-11e0-8351-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1yOsysypm | title=Supply chain: ‘Frugal engineering’ heads push into manufacturing | work=Financial Times | date=May 19, 2011 | agency=The Financial Times Ltd | accessdate=June 21, 2012 | author=Fontanella-Khan, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, when selling the products, reliance on unconventional [[distribution (business)|distribution]] channels.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; When trying to sell to so-called "[[Bottom of the pyramid|overlooked consumers]]", firms hope volume will offset razor-thin [[profit margin]]s.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web | title=Indian Firms Shift Focus to the Poor | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=Oct 20, 2009 | accessdate=June 25, 2012 | author=Bellman, Eric | pages=A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization&lt;ref name="Bhatti"&gt;Bhatti, Yasser Ahmad, Khilji, Shaista E and Basu, Radha. 2013.

In May 2012 ''[[The Financial Times]]'' newspaper called the concept "increasingly fashionable".&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, James. "More with less." ''FT.com''. May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several US universities have programs that develop frugal solutions. Such efforts include the Frugal Innovation Lab at [[Santa Clara University]] and a two quarter project course at [[Stanford University]], the Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability program.&lt;ref&gt;For Santa Clara University's lab, see {{cite web | url=http://www.scu.edu/socialbenefit/innovation/frugal/about.cfm | title=About Frugal Innovation | publisher=Santa Clara University | accessdate=June 20, 2012}}

==Variety of terms==
Many terms are used to refer to the concept. "Frugal engineering" was coined by [[Carlos Ghosn]], then joint chief of [[Renault]] and [[Nissan]], who stated, "frugal engineering is achieving more with fewer resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcxkkbyW7KMC&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;ots=r7z9uvasu9&amp;dq=Frugal%20engineering%20is%20achieving%20more%20with%20fewer%20resources.&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=India Inside | publisher=Harvard Business Press | author=Nirmalya Kumar, Phanish Puranam | year=2011 | pages=114 | isbn=9781422142400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the words "Gandhian"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/career-and-education/career-guidance/introducing-gandhian-engineering573 | title=Introducing Gandhian Engineering | publisher=IEEE | work=The Institute | date=February 2010 | accessdate=June 20, 2012 | author=Platt, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''jugaad''", [[Hindi]] for a stop-gap solution,&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/21551028 | title=Asian innovation | work=The Economist | date=Mar 24, 2012 | agency=The Economist Newspaper Limited | accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes used instead of "frugal". Other terms with allied meanings include "inclusive innovation", "catalytic innovation", "[[reverse innovation]]", and "[[Bottom of the pyramid|BOP]] innovation", etc.&lt;ref name=Market&gt;Bhatti, Yasser Ahmad and Ventresca, Marc. 2012. The Emerging Market for Frugal Innovation: Fad, Fashion, or Fit? (January 15, 2012) Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2005983&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BKK-0972 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|The Giant Swing in Bangkok]]
The '''Giant Swing''' ({{lang-th|เสาชิงช้า}}, {{RTGS|Sao Chingcha}}, {{IPA-th|sǎw t͡ɕʰīŋ.t͡ɕʰáː|pron}}) is a religious structure in [[Phra Nakhon District|Phra Nakhon]], [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. Located in front of [[Wat Suthat]], it was formerly used in an old [[Brahmin]] ceremony, and is one of Bangkok's tourist attractions.
&lt;!--N 13° 45.097' E 100° 30.072' according to http://www.kutu.com/thai/gps/Bangkok.htm - but MapQuest shows that coordinate as being at Sanam Luang --&gt;

==History==
The Giant Swing was constructed in 1784 in front of the [[Devasathan]] shrine by King [[Rama I]]. During the reign of [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai|Rama II]] the swing ceremony was discontinued as the swing had become structurally damaged by lightning. In 1920 it was renovated and moved to its current location in order to make space for a gas plant. The ceremony was again performed until 1935, when it was discontinued after several fatal accidents.

The last renovations were done in 1959, and after 45 years of exposure to the elements the wooden pillars were showing signs of serious damage. A major reconstruction began in April 2005. Six teak tree trunks were used. The two used for the main structure of the swing are over 3.5 m in circumference and over 30m in height. The remaining four are used for support and are 2.30 m in circumference and 20 m in height.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manager.co.th/Daily/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000067781 Daily News - Manager Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The swing was taken down in late October 2006 and the work finished in December of the same year. The rebuilt swing was dedicated in royal ceremonies presided over by King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in September 2007. The timbers of the original swing are preserved in the [[Bangkok National Museum]].

In 2005, the Giant Swing, together with Wat Suthat, was proposed as a future UNESCO [[World Heritage]] site.

==Surroundings==
'''Wat Suthat Thep Wararam'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Wat Suthat]] Thep Wararam, commonly shortened to "Wat Suthat", is an important temple in Thailand. Inside the grand hall is a Phra Sri Sagaya Munee, its principal Buddha image which was acquired from Wat Mahathat in [[Sukhothai (city)|Sukhothai]]. Wat Suthat was built by King Rama I in the center of his capital, but it was completed in the reign of Rama III.&lt;ref&gt;ThammaThai "WatSuthat" Retrieved 19 October 2013, [http://www.dhammathai.org/watthai/bangkok/watsutat.php], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many people often make pilgrimages to worship the Buddha especially on holy days such as Visakha Bucha Day and Magha Bucha Day.

'''SarnChoa Po Seu or Tiger God Shrine'''
In the quarter there is also a well known and high regarded Chinese shrine, Sarn Choa Po Seu ('tiger shrine'). Originally it was a building on Bamrungmueng Road where the big Chinese communities were. Later, King Rama V expanded the road and had the shrine relocated to the current location on Ta Nao Road near WatMahanaparam.&lt;ref&gt;Travel "PaiWaiSarnJaoPorSeu" Retrieved 19 October 2013, [http://travel.kapook.com/view8796.html], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The site is a place of worship for Thai and Chinese people seeking success in career, money, love, and infant fertility.

It was built in King Rama III reign which is 1834 and now.. Tiger God Shrine is one of the most ancient and famous shrines in Thailand.  Moreover, this shrine has beautiful interior design and has some antiquities. Most people come to pay respect to "Tua Lao Aie", a Chinese God to have good fortune, especially on Chinese New Year's Day.&lt;ref&gt;ศาลเจ้าพ่อเสือ Retrieved 17 April 2017, [http://chaoporseua.blogspot.com/] , 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LanKonMueng'''&lt;br/&gt;
At the heart of the quarter is LanKonMueng in front of city hall. Every evening, this is the recreational area of the locals where they can exercise such as dance aerobics, jogging, stroll around, gather or just relax, bring children or pets out for a walk and enjoy the breeze.&lt;ref&gt;Travel "Sao ching cha" Retrieved 18 October 2013, [http://www.manager.co.th/travel/viewnews.aspx?NewsID=9560000034732], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devasathan'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Devasathan]] Shrine is the most important religious and ancient place for Brahmin-Hindu in Thailand. It was built in 1784. which is in King Rama I's reign. According to ancient tradition, it was built for holding officiating religious ceremony in the past. Devasathan Shrine has three important sanctuaries which are Shiva sanctuary, Ganesha sanctuary, and Narayana sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;เทวสถาน Retrieved 17 April 2017, [http://www.devasthan.org/newweb/%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2], 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swing ceremony==
{{main|Triyampawai ceremony}}
An annual swinging ceremony known as ''Triyampavai-Tripavai'' was held at Giant Swings of major cities until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=M. E. Manickavasagom Pillai |title=Dravidian Influence in Thai Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soFCAAAAYAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=Tamil University |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two [[Tamil language]] Hindu chants: ''[[Thiruvempavai]]'' (a [[Shaivite]] hymn by [[Manikkavacakar]]) and ''[[Thiruppavai]]'' (a [[Vaishnavite]] hymn by Andal). Among Thai people, the ceremony was popularly known as ''Lo Jin Ja'' or ''Lo-Chin-Cha'' ("pulling the swing"). It is known that Tamil verses from ''Thiruvempavai'' — ''poet pratu sivalai'' ("opening the portals of Shiva's home") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai king]].&lt;ref name="Upendra_1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Upendra Thakur |title=Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m42TldA_OvAC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1986 |publisher=Abhinav |isbn=978-81-7017-207-9 |pages=27–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Consider Our Vow: Translation of Tiruppāvai and Tiruvempāvai Into English |author=Norman Cutler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fMOAAAAMAAJ |year=1979 |publisher=Muttu Patippakam |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an ancient [[Hindu]] epic, after [[Brahma]] created the world he sent [[Shiva]] to look after it. When Shiva descended to the earth, [[Nāga|Naga]] serpents wrapped around the mountains in order to keep the earth in place. After Shiva found the earth solid, the Nagas moved to the seas in celebration. The Swing Ceremony was a re-enactment of this. The pillars of the Giant Swing represented the mountains, while the circular base of the swing represented the earth and the seas. In the ceremony Brahmins would swing, trying to grab a bag of coins placed on one of the pillars.

==Bus==
You can go to Giant Swing by bus number 12, 35, 42, and 508. &lt;ref&gt;เสาชิงช้า Retrieved 17 April 2017, [[:th:เสาชิงช้า|เสาชิงช้า]] ,2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hellenistic glass ''' was [[glass]] produced during the [[Hellenistic period]], from the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] (356-323 BC) to the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] (second half of the 1st century BC - 476) in the Mediterranean, Europe, western Asia and northern Africa. Glassmaking at this time was based on the technological traditions of the [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Late Bronze Age]],&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Grose 1981; Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; but was marked by  transition from limited production of luxury objects made for the social elite to mass production of affordable glass vessels used by the broader public to satisfy everyday needs.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1979; Grose 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of translucent and transparent glass, attempts were made to mimic precious and semi-precious stones, as well as [[Quartz|rock crystal]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:1210 - Keramikos Museum, Athens - Glass unguentaria, ca. 150 AD - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 12 20.jpg|thumb|Glass unguentaria]]
{{further information|Hellenistic art}}
Core-formed glass vessels produced in the Mediterranean from 1525 to 50 BC were the most numerous and widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Core-formed vessels were generally small in size,  [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]  and designed to store perfumes, scented oils and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The most common shapes were [[alabastra]], [[amphoriskoi]], [[aryballoi]] and lentoid aryballoi, [[oinochoai]] (jugs), and for the first time in the Hellenistic period [[hudriskai]] (three-handled flasks) and [[unguentaria]] (unguent bottles).&lt;ref&gt;Fossing 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia Antikensammlung Berlin 3.jpg|thumb|A Greek glass [[amphora]], 2nd half of the 2nd century BC, from [[Olbia (archaeological site)|Olbia]], now in the [[Altes Museum]]]]
During the second half of the 3rd century BC, mosaic glass, also known as '[[millefiori]]', literally, a thousand flowers, emerged. The group consists mostly of fused and slumped broad plates and shallow dishes with upright or out-splayed rims or hemispherical bowls. Sub-groups of mosaic glass production are 'network' or 'lacework' hemispherical bowls and vessels with meandering or spiral decorative patterns that imitate onyx. Often these bowls had a rim formed of a single ‘network’ cane of spirally twisted threads which gives a 'striped' effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It is best represented in burial contexts from several large tombs in [[Canosa]] di Puglia (ancient Canusium) in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; They are open vessels since they are made with a mould but still opaque, like the widely produced core-formed vessels.

The origins of the mosaic glassworking technique are traced back in the 15th century BC in the Mesopotamian glassmaking centres, such as Tell-al-Rimah, ΄Aqar Qūf and Marlik. Although the mosaic technique at the time was practiced in a desultory way, it is the predecessor of the elaborated mosaic vessels of high quality of the Alexandrian workshops, after the foundation of the city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt in 332 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], which is said to be the main production centre of these vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Goldstein 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 2nd century BC, monochrome drinking vessels, mainly hemispherical and sub-conical bowls were introduced. They were made in considerable quantities in the Syro-Palestinian coast and were widely traded and exported to several trading centres throughout the Mediterranean. Earlier examples were made of clear greenish, brownish or almost colourless glass, while later on they often had green, amber, blue or wine-purple colour. Usually, they were decorated with linear-cut concentric circles at the bottom or right under the rim either on the inside or the outside (Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004). They were made in an open mould, which is in fact a relatively cheap technique that requires less effort put and it was this that allowed their large-scale production.

Within the production of these drinking vessels, from the mid-2nd century BC onwards, translucent or transparent glass tableware (plates, dishes, bowls, drinking vessels, such as skyphoi, footed bowls or handled cups) was introduced; glass tableware production once established enjoyed several glassworking centres and contributed in the dramatic increase of the Hellenistic glass industry.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1981; Grose 1984; Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that glass vessels were widely consumed by the broader public as a widespread commodity, something that continued ever since and was achieved in a higher degree with the invention of the even more economical [[glassblowing]] technique.

During the 1st century BC, new types of monochrome glass vessels were introduced and ribbed bowls started to be produced. They were mould-press bowls with ribs on the outside and their production centres were concentrated in the [[Levant]] and the Syro-Palestinian coast, like the monochrome hemispherical/conical bowls.

However, the production of luxury glass vessels did not cease and glass vessels imitating precious metal vessels (gold- and silver-ware) were produced with new glassworking techniques to satisfy the needs of the elite social strata market. [[Gold sandwich glass]] vessels and [[gold glass|gold-band]] alabastra were innovations of the late Hellenistic period addressed to a more limited range of wealthy customers. The manufacturing techniques were the same, namely the mould-press and core-form mosaic techniques respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were developed further more in order to achieve a quite elaborate decorative aspect.

==Other glass objects==
Hellenistic glass industry also included a range of other objects, mainly for decorative purposes. The broadest groups of glass objects were these of glass beads and [[inlays]], like in all periods since the introduction of glassmaking in the ancient world. The mass production of glass beads of many varieties is well represented in the context of a Hellenistic glass workshop in Rhodes, where 10,000 beads of 40 different shapes and colours have been found;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Triantafyllidis 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Rings, pendants, gemstones, amulets, small sculptures were also made with the mould-casting technique.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlays were produced to decorate wooden articles, furniture, chests, sarcophagi and jewellery in combination with other, often precious materials, such as gold leaf or ivory.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatiadou 2002&lt;/ref&gt; For example, glass inlays decorated the ionic capitals of north porch of the Erechtheion in the Athenian Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Inlays were deeply rooted in the Egyptian glassmaking industry and their production, with the mosaic technique after the Pharaonic tradition, continued to flourish during the Hellenistic period with old or new repertories inspired from the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Nenna 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Game counters and gaming pieces were made also as one way to recycle scrap glass left over from the manufacture of other articles.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatiadou 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in many other occasions, these objects are well represented and archaeologically found along with various types of glass vessels in rich burial contexts, e.g. this of Amphipolis.&lt;ref&gt;Romiopoulou 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary production centres==
Glassmaking and glassworking were considered two totally separate crafts and took place in different regions (Grose 1981). Each craft was characterized by its own technological tradition, know-how and equipment. Glassmakers and glassworkers did not need to have an understanding of glass vessel manufacture and primary production respectively, in order to carry out their tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Glassmaking had to take place as close as possible to the sources of the raw materials used, namely sand and mineral [[natron]]  when it comes to the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Raw glass was traded throughout the Mediterranean in the form of ingots (Stern 1999) and it was then worked and shaped into vessels, inlays, jewellery, etc., in numerous sites of the Hellenistic world.

Hellenistic glass is the typical '''soda-lime-silica glass''', to which lime was not intentionally added, but it was provided through the agent of sand.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1956a&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it cannot be argued with certainty where the Hellenistic primary production of raw glass was geographically located from the archaeological record, we can hypothesize that a large part of glass production took place in the Syro-Palestinian coast or the broader Levant and Egypt . In favor of this argument are comments of classical writers of the period or a little later, like Strabo (63 BC) who mentioned the [[Belus River|Belus]] river on the Syrian coast to have been used for glassmaking or even by writers other such as [[Pliny the Elder]] (23-79 AD) or [[Tacitus]] (c. 56-c. 117 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1956b&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeological evidence firmly indicate that primary production of glass, as well as glassworking took place on the island of [[Rhodes]] in the Aegean, during the [[Hellenistic period]] and, particularly, after the foundation of the city of Rhodes in 408 BC, and even earlier through the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1983; Triantafyllidis 1998; Rehren 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spatial distribution==
Glassworking took place in several centres of the Hellenistic world. Raw glass was brought to glassworkers in the form of ingots, except from the Rhodian workshop which included both glassmaking and glassworking, and in turn they produced glass vessels, inlays, jewellery, etc., which were then widely traded. Although most probably core-formed vessels were traded for their content, mosaic or monochrome and transparent tableware were traded per se.

Major glassworking centres were located at the Syro-Palestinian coast, e.g. monochrome hemispherical bowls, and in [[Alexandria]], since its foundation in 332 BC, e.g. mosaic glass vessels and inlays.&lt;ref&gt;Nenna 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of the Alexandrian workshop is well understood from luxury glass vessels decorated with Egyptian-style buildings or characteristic scenes found as far as Italy and Afghanistan or, even, produced there (Auth 2001). Glass vessels, both core-formed and mould-press, were also made in Ionia, Cyprus, Sidon, the Levant, [[Tel Anafa]] in [[Upper Galilee]], Rome and Roman Italy, Crete, Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1981; Grose 1984; Barag 1985; Ignatiadou 2002; Jennings 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly interesting is the core-formed vessels’ trade and spatial distribution, since this was the group produced throughout the Hellenistic period from its very beginning to the invention of [[glassblowing]] (c. 50 BC). Core-formed bottles, along with other types of glass vessels, are found throughout the Mediterranean in the Aegean (e.g. Delos, Crete, Athens), throughout Greece, Asia Minor and western Asia (e.g. Ephesus, Sardis, Dura-Europos, Babylon, Nimrud, Nineveh, the Levant, Phoenicia), Magna Greacia (e.g. Rhegium, Morgantina) and Italy, Mesopotamia, the Balkans, Russia, the transalpine lands, Spain (Emporion) and the Balearics, northern Africa (Carthage) and Cerne on the Atlantic coast of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1956; Harden 1969; Harden 1981; Grose 1984; Barag 1985; Jennings 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Glass production of vessels or other glass objects was mainly of two distinct technological traditions, these of core-formed glass and mould-press or cast glass (Grose 1981).
* ''Core-formed glass'': is the best represented and probably the earliest manufacturing technique applied. First, a core with the bottle’s shape was shaped around a metallic rod most probably by a combination of clay, sand, mud and/or animal dung. Then, molten glass was either trailed onto the core with the aid of a second tool or directly from dipping it into a container of molten glass. The surface was smoothed by continual re-heating and rolling on a flat slab. Finally, vessels were removed from the metallic rod, they slowly cooled down in a side chamber of the [[glass melting furnace]] and, then, the core material was scraped out of the interior. Common body colours were translucent dark or cobalt blue, opaque white, brown, red or olive-green and of the decoration opaque yellow, orange, white or turquoise trails in zigzag or feather patterns. This technique limited considerably the size of the vessels, which were mainly close vessels with thick walls.
* ''Mould-press or cast glass'': it was first practiced by the Hellenistic glassworkers from the 3rd century BC onwards. Although different decorative results were achieved by variations in colours, the technique was virtually the same for ''mosaic, monochrome hemispherical bowls, transparent tableware and gold-sandwich vessels'', both luxurious fine ware and more affordable types. Mould-press or cast vessels were mainly open bowls, shallow dishes and jars, but some closed vessels were produced as well. They were made from a single mould on which a piece of glass was [[slumping|slumped]].
* Mosaic glass: vessels, namely bowls and plates, as well as inlays were produced with the mosaic technique. A multicoloured effect is achieved as a result of a variety of diverse cane configurations and colour combinations fused together and then slumped on an open mould.
* Network: a type of mosaic glass made of canes of spirally twisted glass threads of different colours laid side by side.
* Gold-sandwich glass: also found for the first time during the Hellenistic period. It technique consists of a ‘sandwich’ of two [[decolorized glass]] layers which enclose a sheet of gold leaf between them. The vessels were formed of two castings and they were carefully ground and polished.
* Cold-cutting: grinding and polishing by the application of stone-cutting techniques and by using harder materials, such us [[quartz]]. It was used as a supplementary technique to other processes as finishing and decoration.

[[File:Pierre-Simon Laplace.jpg|thumb|250 px|[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis]]

The history of scientific thought about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System]] begins with the [[Copernican Revolution]].
The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=etymoline|title=Solar|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=solar+system&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary view==
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}
The most widely accepted theory of planetary formation, known as the [[nebular hypothesis]], maintains that 4.6 billion years ago, the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a giant [[molecular cloud]] which was [[light year]]s across. Several [[star]]s, including the [[Sun]], formed within the collapsing cloud. The gas that formed the Solar System was slightly more massive than the Sun itself. Most of the mass collected in the centre, forming the Sun; the rest of the mass flattened into a [[protoplanetary disc]], out of which the [[planet]]s and other bodies in the Solar System formed.

There are, however, arguments against this hypothesis.

==Formation hypothesis==
French philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] was the first to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his ''Le Monde'' (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and was on the right track with condensation and contraction. However, this was before Newton's theory of gravity and we now know matter does not behave in this fashion.&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
The vortex model of 1944,&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; formulated by German physicist and philosopher Baron [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], which harkens back to the Cartesian model,  involved a pattern of turbulence-induced eddies in a Laplacian nebular disc. In it a suitable combination of clockwise rotation of each vortex and anti-clockwise rotation of the whole system can lead to individual elements moving around the central mass in Keplerian orbits so there would be little dissipation of energy due to the overall motion of the system but material would be colliding at high relative velocity in the inter-vortex boundaries and in these regions small roller-bearing eddies would coalesce to give annular condensations. It was much criticized as turbulence is a phenomenon associated with disorder and would not spontaneously produce the highly ordered structure required by the hypothesis. As well, it does not provide a solution to the angular momentum problem and does not explain lunar formation nor other very basic characteristics of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Woolfson|Woolfson, Michael Mark]], ''The Origin and Evolution of universe and the Solar System'', Taylor and Francis, 2000 ; completely considered that collision of the two suns produce the solar system and universe in the entire 100,00 years of the evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weizsäcker model was modified&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; in 1948 by Dutch theoretical physicist Dirk Ter Haar, in that regular eddies were discarded and replaced by random turbulence which would lead to a very thick nebula where gravitational instability would not occur. He concluded the planets must have formed by accretion and explained the compositional difference (solid and liquid planets) as due to the temperature difference between the inner and outer regions, the former being hotter and the latter being cooler, so only refractories (non-volatiles) condensed in the inner region. A major difficulty is that in this supposition turbulent dissipation takes place in a time scale of only about a millennium which does not give enough time for planets to form.

The nebular hypothesis was first proposed in 1734 by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. 1734, (Principia) Latin: Opera Philosophica et Mineralia (English: Philosophical and Mineralogical Works), (Principia, Volume 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  and later elaborated and expanded upon by [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1755. A similar theory was independently formulated by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1909| title= The Past History of the Earth as Inferred from the Mode of Formation of the Solar System| journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume=48 | pages=119 | author=See, T. J. J. |jstor=983817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] conceived the idea that the planets were formed when a comet collided with the Sun, sending matter out to form the planets. However, Laplace refuted this idea in 1796, showing that any planets formed in such a way would eventually crash into the Sun. Laplace felt that the near-circular orbits of the planets were a necessary consequence of their formation.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Today, comets are known to be far too small to have created the Solar System in this way.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Solar System: Its Origin and Evolution |author=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |quote=Physics Department, University of New York |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=34 |pages=1–20 |date=1993 |bibcode=1993QJRAS..34....1W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, Immanuel Kant speculated that observed [[nebulae]] may in fact be regions of star and planet formation. In 1796, Laplace elaborated by arguing that the nebula collapsed into a star, and, as it did so, the remaining material gradually spun outward into a flat disc, which then formed the planets.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===Alternative theories===
However plausible it may appear at first sight, the nebular hypothesis still faces the obstacle of [[angular momentum]]; if the Sun had indeed formed from the collapse of such a cloud, the planets should be rotating far more slowly. The Sun, though it contains almost 99.9 percent of the system's mass, contains just 1 percent of its angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=313 |title=Rotation in the Solar System |issue=1524 |date=1984 |pages=5 |bibcode=1984RSPTA.313....5W |doi=10.1098/rsta.1984.0078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Sun should be spinning much more rapidly.

====Tidal theory====
Attempts to resolve the angular momentum problem led to the temporary abandonment of the nebular hypothesis in favour of a return to "two-body" theories.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; For several decades, many astronomers preferred the ''tidal'' or ''near-collision'' hypothesis put forward by [[James Jeans]] in 1917, in which the planets were considered to have been formed due to the approach of some other star to the Sun. This near-miss would have drawn large amounts of matter out of the Sun and the other star by their mutual [[tidal force]]s, which could have then condensed into planets.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; However, in 1929 astronomer [[Harold Jeffreys]] countered that such a near-collision was massively unlikely.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Objections to the hypothesis were also raised by the American astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]], who showed that it ran into problems with [[angular momentum]] for the outer planets, with the planets struggling to avoid being reabsorbed by the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Crowell|title=Conservation Laws|publisher=lightandmatter.com|date=1998–2006|chapter=5|url=http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/2cl/ch05/ch05.html|isbn=0-9704670-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Chamberlin-Moulton model====
Forest Moulton in 1900 had also shown that the nebular hypothesis was inconsistent with observations because of the angular momentum. Moulton and Chamberlin in 1904 originated the planetesimal hypothesis&lt;ref name="Sherrill, T.J 1999"&gt;Sherrill, T.J. 1999. A Career of Controversy: the Anomaly of T.J.J. See. J. Hist. Astrn. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs/1999JHA.&lt;/ref&gt;(see [[Chamberlin–Moulton planetesimal hypothesis]]). Along with many astronomers of the day they came to believe the pictures of "spiral nebulas" from the Lick Observatory were direct evidence of forming solar systems. These turned out to be galaxies instead but the Shapley-Curtis debate about these was still 16 years in the future. One of the most fundamental issues in the history of astronomy was distinguishing between nebulas and galaxies.

Moulton and Chamberlin suggested that a star had passed close to the Sun early in its life to cause tidal bulges and that this, along with the internal process that leads to solar prominences,  resulted in the ejection of filaments of matter from both stars. While most of the material would have fallen back, part of it would remain in orbit. The filaments cooled into numerous, tiny, solid fragments, ‘planetesimals’, and a few larger protoplanets.  This model received favourable support for about 3 decades but passed out of favour by the late '30s and was discarded in the '40s by the realization it was incompatible with the angular momentum of Jupiter, but a part of it, planetesimal accretion, was retained.&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt;

====Lyttleton's scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt;====
In 1937 and 1940, [[Raymond Arthur Lyttleton|Ray Lyttleton]] postulated that a companion star to the Sun collided with a passing star. Such a scenario was already suggested and rejected by Henry Russell in 1935. Lyttleton showed terrestrial planets were too small to condense on their own so suggested one very large proto-planet broke in two because of rotational instability, forming Jupiter and Saturn, with a connecting filament from which the other planets formed. A later model, from 1940 and 1941, involves a triple star system, a binary plus the Sun, in which the binary merges and later breaks up because of rotational instability and escapes from the system leaving a filament that formed between them to be captured by the Sun. Objections of Lyman Spitzer apply to this model also.

====Band-structure model====
In 1954, 1975, and 1978&lt;ref&gt;Alfvén, H. 1978. Band Structure of the Solar System. In Origin of the Solar System, S.F. Dermot, ed, pp. 41–48. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish astrophysicist Hannes  Alfvén included electromagnetic effects in equations of particle motions, and angular momentum distribution and compositional differences were explained. In 1954 he first proposed the band structure in which he distinguished an A-cloud, containing mostly helium, but with some solid- particle impurities ("meteor rain"), a B-cloud, with mostly hydrogen, a C-cloud, having mainly carbon, and a D-cloud, made mainly of silicon and iron. Impurities in the A-cloud form Mars and the Moon (later captured by Earth), in the B-cloud they condense into Mercury, Venus, and Earth, in the C-cloud they condense into the outer planets, and Pluto and Triton may have formed from the D-cloud.

====Interstellar cloud theory====
In 1943, the Soviet astronomer [[Otto Schmidt]] proposed that the Sun, in its present form, passed through a dense [[interstellar cloud]], emerging enveloped in a cloud of dust and gas, from which the planets eventually formed. This solved the angular momentum problem by assuming that the Sun's slow rotation was peculiar to it, and that the planets did not form at the same time as the Sun.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Extensions of the model, together forming the Russian school, include Gurevich and Lebedinsky (in 1950), Safronov (in 1967,1969), Safronov and Vityazeff (in 1985), Safronov and Ruskol (in 1994), and Ruskol (in 1981), among others&lt;ref&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis was severely dented by [[Victor Safronov]] who showed that the amount of time required to form the planets from such a diffuse envelope would far exceed the Solar System's determined age.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

[[Raymond Arthur Lyttleton|Ray Lyttleton]] modified the theory by showing that a 3rd body was not necessary and proposing that a mechanism of line accretion described by Bondi and Hoyle in 1944 would enable cloud material to be captured by the star (Williams and Cremin, 1968, loc. cit.)

====Hoyle's hypothesis====
In this model&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; (from 1944) the companion went nova with ejected material captured by the Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova.  In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength would have to be 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. It was Alfvén who formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines.

====Kuiper's theory====
[[Gerard Kuiper]] (in 1944)&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; argued, like Ter Haar, that regular eddies would be impossible and postulated that large gravitational instabilities might occur in the solar nebula, forming condensations. In this, the solar nebula could be either co-genetic with the Sun or captured by it. Density distribution would determine what could form: either a planetary system or a stellar companion. The 2 types of planets were assumed to be due to the Roche limit. No explanation was offered for the Sun's slow rotation which Kuiper saw as a larger G-star problem.

====Whipple's theory====
In [[Fred Whipple]]'s 1948 scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; a smoke cloud about 60,000 AU in diameter and with 1 [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) contracts and produces the Sun. It has a negligible angular momentum thus accounting for the Sun's similar property. This smoke cloud captures a smaller one with a large angular momentum. The collapse time for the large smoke and gas nebula is about 100 million years and the rate is slow at first, increasing in later stages. The planets would condense from small clouds developed in, or captured by, the 2nd cloud, the orbits would be nearly circular because accretion would reduce eccentricity due to the influence of the resisting medium, orbital orientations would be similar because the small cloud was originally small and the motions would be in a common direction. The protoplanets might have heated up to such high degrees that the more volatile compounds would have been lost and the orbital velocity decreases with increasing distance so that the terrestrial planets would have been more affected. The weaknesses of this scenario are that practically all the final regularities are introduced as a priori assumptions and most of the hypothesizing was not supported by quantitative calculations. For these reasons it did not gain wide acceptance.

====Urey's model====
American chemist [[Harold Urey]], who founded cosmochemistry, put forward a scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; in 1951, 1952, 1956, and 1966 based largely on meteorites and using Chandrasekhar's stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. In order that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. In order to form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, Moon-size objects, gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable, would have to form in the disk with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions considerable ionization would be present and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun. He postulated that these lunar-size bodies were destroyed by collisions, with the gas dissipating, leaving behind solids collected at the core, with the resulting smaller fragments pushed far out into space and the larger fragments staying behind and accreting into planets. He suggested the Moon was just such a surviving core.

====Protoplanet theory====
In 1960, 1963, and 1978,&lt;ref&gt;McCrea, W. H.  1978.  The Formation of the Solar System: a Protoplanet Theory (Chp. 5). In: S.F. Dermot, Ed. Origin of the Solar System. John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William McCrea (astronomer)|W. H. McCrea]] proposed the ''protoplanet theory'', in which the Sun and planets individually coalesced from matter within the same cloud, with the smaller planets later captured by the Sun's larger gravity.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; It includes fission in a protoplanetary nebula and there is no solar nebula. Agglomerations of floccules (which are presumed to compose the supersonic turbulence assumed to occur in the interstellar material from which stars are born) formed the Sun and protoplanets, the latter splitting to form planets. The 2 portions can not remain gravitationally bound to each other,  are at a mass ratio of at least 8 to 1, and for inner planets they go into independent orbits while for outer planets one of the portions exits the Solar System. The inner protoplanets were Venus-Mercury and Earth-Mars. The moons of the greater planets were formed from "droplets" in the neck connecting the 2 portions of the dividing protoplanet and these droplets could account for some of the asteroids. Terrestrial planets would have no major moons which does not account for Luna.  It predicts certain observations such as the similar angular velocity of Mars and Earth with similar rotation periods and axial tilts. In this scheme there are 6 principal planets: 2 terrestrial, Venus and Earth, 2 major, Jupiter and Saturn, and 2 outer, Uranus and Neptune; and 3 lesser planets: Mercury, Mars, and Pluto.

This theory has a number of problems, such as explaining the fact that the planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction, which would appear highly unlikely if they were each individually captured.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

====Cameron's hypothesis====
In American astronomer [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]]'s hypothesis (from 1962 and 1963),&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; the protosun has a mass of about 1–2 Suns with a diameter of around 100,000 AU is gravitationally unstable, collapses, and breaks up into smaller subunits. The magnetic field is of the order of 1/100,000 gauss. During the collapse the magnetic lines of force are twisted. The collapse is fast and is done by the dissociation of H molecules followed by the ionization of H and the double ionization of He. Angular momentum leads to rotational instability which produces a Laplacean disk.  At this stage radiation will remove excess energy and the disk will be quite cool in a relatively short period (about 1 mln. yrs.) and the condensation into what Whipple calls cometismals takes place. Aggregation of these produces giant planets which in turn produce disks during their formation from which evolve into lunar systems. The formation of terrestrial planets, comets, and asteroids involved disintegration, heating, melting, solidification, etc. He also formulated the Big Splat or Giant Impactor Hypothesis for the origin of the Moon.

====Capture theory====
The ''capture theory'', proposed by [[Michael Woolfson|Michael Mark Woolfson]] in 1964, posits that the Solar System formed from [[Tidal force|tidal]] interactions between the Sun and a low-density [[protostar]]. The Sun's gravity would have drawn material from the diffuse atmosphere of the protostar, which would then have collapsed to form the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The capture theory and planetary condensation |author1=J. R. Dormand |author2=Michael Mark Woolfson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=307 |date=1971 |bibcode=1971MNRAS.151..307D |doi=10.1093/mnras/151.3.307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the capture theory predicts a different age for the Sun than for the planets,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} whereas the similar ages of the Sun and the rest of the Solar System indicate that they formed at roughly the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Weidenschilling, S.

As captured planets would have initially eccentric orbits Dormand and Woolfson in 1974 and 1977 and Woolfson&lt;ref&gt;Woolfson, Michael Mark, "The Evolution of the solar system", in S. F. Dermot, Ed., ''Origin of the Solar System'', Wiley, New York (NY), 1978, pp.199–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the possibility of a collision.  A filament is thrown out by a passing proto-star which is captured by the Sun and planets form from it. In this there were 6 original planets, corresponding to 6 point-masses in the filament,  with planets A and B,  the 2 innermost, colliding, the former at twice the mass of Neptune, and ejecting out of the Solar System, and the latter at 1/3 the mass of Uranus, and splitting into Earth and Venus. Mars and the Moon are former moons of A. Mercury is either a fragment of B or an escaped moon of A. The collision also produced the asteroid belt and the comets.

T.J.J. See was an American astronomer and Navy Captain who at one time worked under Ellery Hale at the Lowell Observatory. He had a cult following largely because of his many (some 60) articles in ''Popular Astronomy'' but also in ''Astronomische Nachrichte'' (Astronomical News) (mostly in English). While at the USNO's Mare Island, Cal. station, he developed a model which he called capture theory, published in 1910, in his  "Researches on the Evolution of the Stellar Systems: v. 2. The capture theory of cosmical evolution, founded on dynamical principles and illustrated by phenomena observed in the spiral nebulae, the planetary system, the double and multiple stars and clusters and the star-clouds of the Milky Way",  which proposed that the planets formed in the outer Solar System and were captured by the Sun; the moons were formed in thus manner and were captured by the planets. This caused a feud with Forest Moulton, who co-developed the planetesimal hypothesis. A preview was presented in 1909 at a meeting of the ASP (Astronomical Society of the Pacific) at the Chabot Observatory in Oakland, Cal., and newspaper headlines blared "Prof. See's Paper Causes Sensation" (San Francisco Call) and "Scientists in Furore Over Nebulae" (San Francisco Examiner). Our current knowledge of dynamics makes capture most unlikely as it requires special conditions.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, T.J 1999"/&gt;

====Solar fission====
Swiss astronomer Louis Jacot (in 1951, 1962, 1981),&lt;ref&gt;Jacot, Louis. 1986. Heretical Cosmology (transl. of Science et bon sense, 1981). Exposition-Banner.&lt;/ref&gt; like Weisacker and Ter Haar, continued the Cartesian idea of vortices but proposed a hierarchy of vortices or vortices within vortices, i.e., a lunar system vortex, a Solar System vortex, and a galactic vortex.  He put forward the notion that planetary orbits are spirals, not circles or ellipses. Jacot also proposed the expansion of galaxies (stars move away from the hub),  and that moons move away from their planets.

He also maintained that planets were expelled, one at a time, from the Sun, specifically from an equatorial bulge caused by rotation, and that one of them shattered in this expulsion leaving the asteroid belt. The Kuiper Belt was unknown at the time, but presumably it, too, would be the result of the same kind of shattering. The moons, like the planets, originated as equatorial expulsions, but, of course,  from their parent planets, with some shattering, leaving the rings, and Earth is supposed to eventually expel another moon.

In this model there were 4 phases to the planets: no rotation and keeping the same side to the Sun "as Mercury does now" (we've known, of course, since 1965, that it doesn't),  very slow, accelerated, and finally, daily rotation.

He explained the differences between inner and outer planets and inner and outer moons through vortex behaviour. Mercury's eccentric orbit was explained by its recent expulsion from the Sun and Venus' slow rotation as its being in the "slow rotation phase", having been expelled second to last.

The [[Tom Van Flandern]] model&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, T. 1999. Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets. North Atlantic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, T. 2007. The challenge of the exploded planet hypothesis. Intl. J. Astrobiol. 6: 185- 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, T. 2008. Our Original Solar System-a 21st Century Perspective. MetaRes. Bull. 17: 2–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MetaResearch ({{cite web |url=http://www.metaresearch.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527164707/http://metaresearch.org/ |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was first proposed in 1993 in the first edition of his book. In the revised version from 1999 and later, the original Solar System had 6 pairs of twin planets each fissioned off from the equatorial bulges of an overspinning Sun (outward centrifugal forces exceed the inward gravitational force) at different times so having different temperatures, sizes, and compositions, and having condensed thereafter with the nebular disk dissipating after some 100 million years, with 6 planets exploding. Four of these were helium dominated, fluid, and unstable (helium class planets). These were V (Bellatrix) (V standing for the 5th planet, the first 4 including Mercury and Mars), K (Krypton), T (transneptunian), and Planet X. In these cases, the smaller moons exploded because of tidal stresses leaving the 4 component belts of the 2 major planetoid zones.  Planet LHB-A, the explosion for which is postulated to have caused the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] (about 4 eons ago), was twinned with Jupiter, and LHB-B, the explosion for which is postulated to have caused another LHB, was twinned with Saturn. In planets LHB-A, Jupiter, LHB-B, and Saturn,  being gigantic, Jovian planets, the inner and smaller partner in each pair was subjected to enormous tidal stresses causing it to blow up. The explosions took place before they were able to fission off moons. As the 6 were fluid they left no trace. Solid planets fission off only one moon and Mercury was a moon of Venus but drifted away because of the Sun's gravitational influence. Mars was a moon of Bellatrix.
	
One major argument against exploding planets and moons is that there would not be an energy source powerful enough to cause such explosions. 
====Herndon's model====
In [[J. Marvin Herndon]]'s model,&lt;ref&gt;
Herndon, J. Marvin. 2013. New indivisible planetary science paradigm. ''Current Science'' 105: 450–461 (nuclearplanet.com).
&lt;/ref&gt;
inner (large-core) planets form by condensation and raining-out from within giant gaseous protoplanets at high pressures and high temperatures. Earth's complete condensation included a c. 300 Earth-mass gas/ice shell that compressed the rocky kernel to about 66% of Earth's present diameter (Jupiter equates to about 300 Earth masses, which equals c. 2000 trillion trillion kg; Earth is at about 6 trillion trillion kg). T Tauri (see [[T Tauri type stars]]) eruptions of the Sun stripped the gases away from the inner planets. Mercury was incompletely condensed and a portion of its gases were stripped away and transported to the region between Mars and Jupiter, where it fused with in-falling oxidized condensate from the outer reaches of the Solar System and formed the parent material for ordinary chondrite meteorites, the Main-Belt asteroids, and veneer for the inner planets, especially Mars.  The differences between the inner planets are primarily the consequence of different degrees of protoplanetary compression. There are two types of responses to decompression-driven planetary volume increases: cracks, which form to increase surface area, and folding, creating mountain ranges,  to accommodate changes in curvature.

This planetary formation theory represents an extension of the Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics (WEDD) model,&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite web

which includes natural nuclear-fission reactors in planetary cores; Herndon elaborates, expounds, and elucidates it in 11 articles in ''Current Science'' from 2005 to 2013 and in five books published from 2008 to 2012. He refers to his model as "indivisible" – meaning that the fundamental aspects of Earth are connected logically and causally, and can be deduced from its early formation as a Jupiter-like giant.

In 1944 the German chemist and physicist [[Arnold Eucken]] considered the thermodynamics of Earth condensing and raining-out within a giant protoplanet at pressures of 100–1000 atm. In the 1950s and early 1960s discussion of planetary formation at such pressures took place, but Cameron's 1963 low-pressure (c. 4–10 atm.) model largely supplanted the idea.

====Classification of the theories====
Jeans, in 1931,  divided the various models into 2 groups: those where the material for planet formation came from the Sun and those where it didn't and may be concurrent or consecutive.&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. [http://ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 	
	
William McCrea, in 1963, divided them into 2 groups also: those that relate the formation of the planets to the formation of the Sun and those where it is independent of the formation of the Sun, where the planets form after the Sun becomes a normal star.&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"/&gt;

Ter Haar and Cameron&lt;ref&gt;Ter Haar, D. and Cameron, A.G.W. 1963. Historical Review of the Origin of the Solar System. In: Origin of the Solar System, Robert Jastrow and A. G. W. Cameron, eds., pp. 1–37. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished between those theories that consider a closed system, which is a development of the Sun and possibly a solar envelope, that starts with a protosun rather than the Sun itself, and state that Belot calls these theories monistic; and those that consider an open system, which is where there is an interaction between the Sun and some foreign body that is supposed to have been the first step in the developments leading to the planetary system, and state that Belot calls these theories dualistic.

Hervé Reeves' classification&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H. 1978. Origin of the Solar System. In: The Origin of the Solar System, S.F. Dermott, ed., pp. 1–18. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  also categorizes them as co-genetic with the Sun or not but also as formed from altered or unaltered stellar/interstellar material. He as well recognizes 4 groups:  1) models based on the solar nebula, originated by Swedenborg, Kant, and Laplace in the 1700s; 2) the ones proposing a cloud captured from interstellar space, major proponents being Alfvén and Gustaf Arrhenius (in 1978) and Alfvén and Arrhenius; 3) the binary hypotheses which propose that a sister star somehow disintegrated and a portion of its dissipating material was captured by the Sun, principal hypothesizer being Lyttleton in the '40s; 4) and the close-approach-filament ideas of Jeans, Jeffreys, and Woolfson and Dormand.

In Williams and Cremin&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"/&gt; the categories are: (1) models that regard the origin and formation of the planets as being essentially related to the Sun, with the 2 formation processes taking place concurrently or consecutively, (2) models that regard formation of the planets as being independent of the formation process of the Sun, the planets forming after the Sun becomes a normal star; this has 2 subcategories: a) where the material for the formation of the planets is extracted either from the Sun or another star, b) where the material is acquired from interstellar space. They conclude that the best models are Hoyle's magnetic coupling and McCrea's floccules.

Woolfson&lt;ref&gt;Woolfson, Michael Mark, ''The Origin and Evolution of the Solar System'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; recognized 1) monistic, which included Laplace, Descartes, Kant, and Weisacker, and 2) dualistc, which included Leclerc (comte de Buffon), Chamberlin-Moulton, Jeans, Jeffreys, and Schmidt-Lyttleton.

===Reemergence of the nebular hypothesis===
[[File:HST betaPictoris comb.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Beta Pictoris seen by the Hubble Space Telescope]]
In 1978, astronomer A. J. R. Prentice revived the Laplacian nebular model in his Modern Laplacian Theory by suggesting that the angular momentum problem could be resolved by drag created by dust grains in the original disc which slowed down the rotation in the centre.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Prentice, A.

The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation—the Solar Nebular Disk Model (SNDM)—can be traced to the works of Soviet astronomer [[Victor Safronov]].&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100|title=Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table|publisher=New Scientist|author=Nigel Henbest|date=1991|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Viktor Sergeevich | last=Safronov | title= Evolution of the Protoplanetary Cloud and Formation of the Earth and the Planets | isbn= 0-7065-1225-1 | date=1972 | publisher=Israel Program for Scientific Translations }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists thought about the formation of the planets.&lt;ref name=Safronov&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1989Metic..24..347W|title=Leonard Medal Citation for Victor Sergeevich Safronov|journal=Meteoritics|author=George W.

Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of [[George Wetherill]], who discovered ''runaway accretion''.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; By the early 1980s, the nebular hypothesis in the form of SNDM had come back into favour, led by two major discoveries in astronomy. First, a number of apparently young stars, such as [[Beta Pictoris]], were found to be surrounded by discs of cool dust, much as was predicted by the nebular hypothesis. Second, the [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]], launched in 1983, observed that many stars had an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared radiation]] that could be explained if they were orbited by discs of cooler material.

The refined nebular model was developed entirely on the basis of observations of the Solar System because it was the only one known until the mid-1990s.

The detailed features of the planets are another problem. The solar nebula hypothesis predicts that all planets will form exactly in the ecliptic plane. Instead, the orbits of the [[classical planets]] have various (but small) inclinations with respect to the ecliptic. Furthermore, for the gas giants it is predicted that their rotations and moon systems will also not be inclined with respect to the ecliptic plane. However, most gas giants have substantial axial tilts with respect to the ecliptic, with [[Uranus]] having a 98° tilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apl.ucl.ac.uk/iopw/uworkshop_060905.pdf|title=Uranus nears Equinox|author=Heidi B.

==Solar evolution hypotheses==
Attempts to isolate the physical source of the Sun's energy, and thus determine when and how it might ultimately run out, began in the 19th century. At that time, the prevailing scientific view on the source of the Sun's heat was that it was generated by [[gravitational contraction]]. In the 1840s, astronomers J. R. Mayer and J. J. Waterson first proposed that the Sun's massive weight causes it to collapse in on itself, generating heat, an idea expounded upon in 1854 by both [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Lord Kelvin]], who further elaborated on the idea by suggesting that heat may also be produced by the impact of meteors onto the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sun: A Biography|author=David Whitehouse|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-470-09296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Sun only has enough [[gravitational potential energy]] to power its [[luminosity]] by this mechanism for about 30&amp;nbsp;million years—far less than the age of the Earth. (This collapse time is known as the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Carl J. Hansen |author2=Steven D. Kawaler |author3=Virginia Trimble | title=Stellar interiors: physical principles, structure, and evolution | date=2004 | publisher=Springer | location=New York  | isbn=0-387-20089-4 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]]'s development of the [[theory of relativity]] in 1905 led to the understanding that nuclear reactions could create new elements from smaller precursors, with the loss of energy. In his treatise ''Stars and Atoms'', [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested that pressures and temperatures within stars were great enough for hydrogen nuclei to fuse into helium; a process which could produce the massive amounts of energy required to power the Sun.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements might also form within stars.&lt;ref name=hoyle&gt;{{cite book|title=Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science|author=Simon Mitton|publisher=Aurum|date=2005|chapter=Origin of the Chemical Elements|pages=197–222|isbn=0-309-09313-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral evidence collected after 1945 showed that the distribution of the commonest chemical elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, iron etc., was fairly uniform across the galaxy. This suggested that these elements had a common origin.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt; A number of anomalies in the proportions hinted at an underlying mechanism for creation. Lead has a higher atomic weight than gold, but is far more common. Hydrogen and helium (elements 1 and 2) are virtually ubiquitous yet lithium and beryllium (elements 3 and 4) are extremely rare.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt;

===Red giants===
{{main|Red giant}}
While the unusual spectra of red giant stars had been known since the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=s process in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars|author1=Oscar Straniero |author2=Roberto Gallino |author3=Sergio Cristallo |journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=777 |date= 17 October 2006|pages= 311–339|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2005.01.011|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037594740500028X|arxiv = astro-ph/0501405 |bibcode = 2006NuPhA.777..311S }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[George Gamow]] who, in the 1940s, first understood that they were stars of roughly solar mass that had run out of hydrogen in their cores and had resorted to burning the hydrogen in their outer shells.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This allowed [[Martin Schwarzschild]] to draw the connection between red giants and the finite lifespans of stars. It is now understood that red giants are stars in the last stages of their life cycles.

[[Fred Hoyle]] noted that, even while the distribution of elements was fairly uniform, different stars had varying amounts of each element. To Hoyle, this indicated that they must have originated within the stars themselves. The abundance of elements peaked around the atomic number for iron, an element that could only have been formed under intense pressures and temperatures. Hoyle concluded that iron must have formed within giant stars.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt; From this, in 1945 and 1946, Hoyle constructed the final stages of a star's life cycle. As the star dies, it collapses under its own weight, leading to a stratified chain of fusion reactions: carbon-12 fuses with helium to form oxygen-16; oxygen-16 fuses with helium to produce neon-20, and so on up to iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fred Hoyle, Red Giants and beyond|author=J. Faulkner|bibcode=2003Ap&amp;SS.285..339F|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=285|issue=2|pages= 339–339|date=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1025432324828}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, no known method by which carbon-12 could be produced. Isotopes of beryllium produced via fusion were too unstable to form carbon, and for three helium atoms to form carbon-12 was so unlikely as to have been impossible over the age of the Universe. However, in 1952 the physicist [[Ed Salpeter]] showed that a short enough time existed between the formation and the decay of the beryllium isotope that another helium had a small chance to form carbon, but only if their combined mass/energy amounts were equal to that of carbon-12. Hoyle, employing the [[anthropic principle]], showed that it must be so, since he himself was made of carbon, and he existed. When the matter/energy level of carbon-12 was finally determined, it was found to be within a few percent of Hoyle's prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Bent Chains, and the Anthropic Principle|author=The Nuclear Physics Group|work=The University of Birmingham|url=http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm|accessdate=2008-04-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812061136/http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm |archivedate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White dwarfs===
{{main|White dwarf}}
The first white dwarf discovered was in the [[triple star system]] of [[40 Eridani]], which contains the relatively bright [[main sequence]] star [[40 Eridani A]], orbited at a distance by the closer [[binary star|binary system]] of the white dwarf [[40 Eridani B]] and the [[main sequence]] [[red dwarf]] [[40 Eridani C]]. The pair 40 Eridani B/C was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on January 31, 1783;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/106749 Catalogue of Double Stars], William Herschel, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' '''75''' (1785), pp. 40–126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;73&lt;/sup&gt; it was again observed by [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] in 1825 and by [[Otto Wilhelm von Struve]] in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926BAN.....3..128V The orbit and the masses of 40 Eridani BC], W. H. van den Bos, ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands'' '''3''', #98 (July 8, 1926), pp. 128–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974AJ.....79..819H Astrometric study of four visual binaries], W. D. Heintz, ''Astronomical Journal'' '''79''', #7 (July 1974), pp. 819–825.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1910, it was discovered by [[Henry Norris Russell]], [[Edward Charles Pickering]] and [[Williamina Paton Stevens Fleming|Williamina Fleming]] that despite being a dim star, 40 Eridani B was of [[stellar classification|spectral type]] A, or white.&lt;ref name="holberg"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AAS...20720501H How Degenerate Stars Came to be Known as White Dwarfs], J. B. Holberg, ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society'' '''37''' (December 2005), p. 1503.&lt;/ref&gt;

White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery. If a star is in a [[binary star|binary]] system, as is the case for Sirius B and 40 Eridani B, it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit. This was done for Sirius B by 1910,&lt;ref&gt;''Preliminary General Catalogue'', L. Boss, Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Institution, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; yielding a mass estimate of {{Solar mass|0.94|link=y}}.  (A more modern estimate is {{Solar mass|1.00}}.)&lt;ref name="apj_630"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/w2005ApJ...630L..69L The Age and Progenitor Mass of Sirius B], James Liebert, Patrick A. Young, David Arnett, J. B. Holberg, and Kurtis A. Williams, ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''630''', #1 (September 2005), pp. L69–L72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since hotter bodies radiate more than colder ones, a star's surface brightness can be estimated from its [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]], and hence from its [[spectrum]]. If the star's distance is known, its overall luminosity can also be estimated. Comparison of the two figures yields the star's radius. Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius B and 40 Eridani B must be very dense. For example, when [[Ernst Öpik]] estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the [[Sun]]'s, which was so high that he called it "impossible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916ApJ....44..292O The Densities of Visual Binary Stars], E. Öpik, ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''44''' (December 1916), pp. 292–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such densities are possible because white dwarf material is not composed of [[atom]]s bound by [[chemical bond]]s, but rather consists of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of unbound [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[electron]]s. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer to each other than [[atomic orbital|electron orbital]]s—the regions occupied by electrons bound to an atom—would normally allow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924MNRAS..84..308E On the relation between the masses and luminosities of the stars], A. S. Eddington, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''84''' (March 1924), pp. 308–332.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddington, however, wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy which kept the atoms ionized was no longer present.&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926MNRAS..87..114F On Dense Matter], R. H. Fowler, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''87''' (1926), pp. 114–122.&lt;/ref&gt;  This paradox was resolved by [[R. H. Fowler]] in 1926 by an application of the newly devised [[quantum mechanics]]. Since electrons obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no two electrons can occupy the same [[quantum state|state]], and they must obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2990270 The Development of the Quantum Mechanical Electron Theory of Metals: 1900–28], Lillian H. Hoddeson and G. Baym, ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences'' '''371''', #1744 (June 10, 1980), pp. 8–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  At zero temperature, therefore, electrons could not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ''[[ground state|ground]]'', state; some of them had to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the ''[[Fermi sea]]''. This state of the electrons, called ''[[degenerate matter|degenerate]]'', meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.

===Planetary nebulae===
{{main|Planetary nebula}}
&lt;!---[[File:NGC7293 (2004).jpg|thumb|150px|left|NGC 7293, [[Helix Nebula]]]]---&gt;
Planetary nebulae are generally faint objects, and none are visible to the [[naked eye]]. The first planetary nebula discovered was the [[Dumbbell Nebula]] in the constellation of [[Vulpecula]], observed by [[Charles Messier]] in 1764 and listed as M27 in his [[Messier object|catalogue]] of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae somewhat resembled the gas giants, and [[William Herschel]], discoverer of [[Uranus]], eventually coined the term 'planetary nebula' for them, although, as we now know, they are very different from planets.

The central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot. Their [[luminosity]], though, is very low, implying that they must be very small. Only once a star has exhausted all its nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size, and so planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding, and so the idea arose that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.

==Lunar origins hypotheses==
{{main|Geology of the Moon#Formation}}
[[File:George Darwin sepia tone.jpg|thumb|George Darwin]]
Over the centuries, many scientific hypotheses have been advanced concerning the origin of [[Moon|Earth's Moon]]. One of the earliest was the so-called ''[[Geology of the Moon#Co-accretion hypothesis|binary accretion model]]'', which concluded that the Moon accreted from material in orbit around the Earth left over from its formation. Another, the ''[[Geology of the Moon#Fission hypothesis|fission model]]'', was developed by [[George Darwin]] (son of [[Charles Darwin]]), who noted that, as the Moon is gradually receding from the Earth at a rate of about 4&amp;nbsp;cm per year, so at one point in the distant past it must have been part of the Earth, but was flung outward by the momentum of Earth's then–much faster rotation. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the Moon's density, while less than Earth's, is about equal to that of Earth's rocky [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], suggesting that, unlike the Earth, it lacks a dense iron core. A third hypothesis, known as the ''[[lunar capture|capture model]]'', suggested that the Moon was an independently orbiting body that had been snared into orbit by Earth's gravity.&lt;ref name=moon&gt;{{cite book|title=The Once and Future Moon|author=Paul D. Spudis|chapter=Whence the Moon?|pages=157–169|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|date=1996|isbn=0-522-84826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Apollo'' missions===
However, these hypotheses were all refuted by the late 1960s and early 1970s ''[[Apollo program|Apollo]]'' lunar missions, which introduced a stream of new scientific evidence; specifically concerning the Moon's composition, its age, and its history. These lines of evidence contradict many predictions made by these earlier models.&lt;ref name=moon /&gt; The rocks brought back from the Moon showed a marked decrease in water relative to rocks elsewhere in the Solar System, and also evidence of an ocean of magma early in its history, indicating that its formation must have produced a great deal of energy. Also, oxygen [[isotope]]s in lunar rocks showed a marked similarity to those on Earth, suggesting that they formed at a similar location in the solar nebula. The capture model fails to explain the similarity in these isotopes (if the Moon had originated in another part of the Solar System, those isotopes would have been different), while the co-accretion model cannot adequately explain the loss of water (if the Moon formed in a similar fashion to the Earth, the amount of water trapped in its mineral structure would also be roughly similar). Conversely, the fission model, while it can account for the similarity in chemical composition and the lack of iron in the Moon, cannot adequately explain its high orbital inclination and, in particular, the large amount of angular momentum in the Earth–Moon system, more than any other planet–satellite pair in the Solar System.&lt;ref name=moon /&gt;

===Giant impact hypothesis===

For many years after ''Apollo'', the binary accretion model was settled on as the best hypothesis for explaining the Moon's origins, even though it was known to be flawed. Then, at a conference in Kona, Hawaii in 1984, a compromise model was composed that accounted for all of the observed discrepancies. Originally formulated by two independent research groups in 1976, the ''giant impact'' model supposed that a massive planetary object, the size of Mars, had collided with Earth early in its history. The impact would have melted Earth's crust, and the other planet's heavy core would have sunk inward and merged with Earth's. The superheated vapour produced by the impact would have risen into orbit around the planet, coalescing into the Moon. This explained the lack of water (the vapour cloud was too hot for water to condense), the similarity in composition (since the Moon had formed from part of the Earth), the lower density (since the Moon had formed from the Earth's crust and mantle, rather than its core), and the Moon's unusual orbit (since an oblique strike would have imparted a massive amount of angular momentum to the Earth–Moon system).&lt;ref name=moon /&gt;

===Outstanding issues===
However, the giant impact model has been criticised for being too explanatory; it can be expanded to explain any future discoveries and as such, is unfalsifiable. Also, many claim that much of the material from the impactor would have ended up in the Moon, meaning that the isotope levels would be different, but they are not. Also, while some volatile compounds such as water are absent from the Moon's crust, many others, such as manganese, are not.&lt;ref name=moon/&gt;

===Other natural satellites===
While the co-accretion and capture models are not currently accepted as valid explanations for the existence of the Moon, they have been employed to explain the formation of other natural satellites in the Solar System. [[Jupiter]]'s [[Galilean satellites]] are believed to have formed via co-accretion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Formation of the Galilean Satellites: Conditions of Accretion|author1=Robin M.

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Hyperthermia''' is elevated body temperature due to failed [[thermoregulation]] that occurs when a  body produces or absorbs more [[heat]] than it dissipates.  Extreme temperature elevation then becomes a [[medical emergency]] requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
The most common causes include [[heat stroke]] and adverse reactions to drugs.  The former is an [[body temperature|acute temperature elevation]] caused by exposure to excessive heat, or combination of heat and humidity, that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms.  The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the [[central nervous system]]. [[Malignant hyperthermia]] is a rare complication of some types of [[general anesthesia]].

Hyperthermia differs from [[fever]] in that the body's [[Human thermoregulation#Thermoregulation in humans|temperature set point]] remains unchanged. The opposite is [[hypothermia]], which occurs when the  temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism. The term is from [[Greek language|Greek]]  ὑπέρ, ''hyper'', meaning "above" or "over", and  θέρμος, ''thermos'', meaning "hot".

==Classification== 
{{HumanTemperature}}
In humans, hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than {{convert|37.5|–|38.3|C|F}}, depending on the reference used, that occurs without a change in the body's  [[Thermoregulation#In humans|temperature set point]].&lt;ref name=NC08/&gt;&lt;ref name=CC09/&gt;

The [[normal human body temperature]] can be as high as {{convert|37.7|C|F}} in the late afternoon.&lt;ref name=Harrisons/&gt;  Hyperthermia requires an elevation from the temperature that would otherwise be expected.  Such elevations range from mild to extreme; body temperatures above {{convert|40|C|F}} can be life-threatening.

==Signs and symptoms==
An early stage of hyperthermia can be "heat exhaustion" (or "heat prostration" or "heat stress"), whose symptoms include heavy sweating, rapid breathing and a fast, weak pulse.  If the condition progresses to heat stroke, then hot, dry skin is typical&lt;ref name=Harrisons/&gt; as [[blood vessel]]s dilate in an attempt to increase heat loss.  An inability to cool the body through [[perspiration]] may cause the skin to feel dry.

Other signs and symptoms vary.  Accompanying dehydration can produce [[nausea]], vomiting, [[headaches]], and [[low blood pressure]] and the latter can lead to [[fainting]] or [[dizziness]], especially if the standing position is assumed quickly.

In severe heat stroke, there may be confused, hostile, or seemingly intoxicated behavior.  Heart rate and respiration rate will increase ([[tachycardia]] and [[tachypnea]]) as blood pressure drops and the heart attempts to maintain adequate [[Circulatory system|circulation]].  The decrease in blood pressure can then cause blood vessels to contract reflexively, resulting in a pale or bluish skin color in advanced cases.  Young children, in particular, may have [[seizures]]. Eventually, [[organ failure]], [[unconsciousness]] and [[death]] will result.

==Causes==

[[Heat stroke]] occurs when thermoregulation is overwhelmed by a combination of excessive metabolic production of heat (exertion), excessive environmental heat, and insufficient or impaired heat loss, resulting in an abnormally high body temperature.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  In severe cases, temperatures can exceed {{convert|40|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=EMS&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, Sixth edition |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith  |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1187 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heat stroke may be ''non-exertional'' (classic) or ''exertional''.

===Exertional===
Significant physical exertion in hot conditions can generate heat beyond the ability to cool, because, in addition to the heat,  humidity of the environment may reduce the efficiency of the body's normal cooling mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Harrisons&gt;{{cite book| authorlink = Anthony Fauci| author     = Fauci, Anthony| title      = [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]| edition    = 17th| publisher  = McGraw-Hill Professional| year       = 2008| isbn       = 978-0-07-146633-2| pages      = 117–121|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human heat-loss mechanisms are limited primarily to sweating (which dissipates heat by [[evaporation]], assuming sufficiently low [[humidity]]) and [[vasodilation]] of skin vessels (which dissipates heat by [[convection]] proportional to the [[temperature]] difference between the body and its surroundings, according to [[Newton's law of cooling]]).  Other factors, such as insufficient water intake, consuming alcohol, or lack of [[air conditioning]], can worsen the problem.

The increase in body temperature that results from a breakdown in thermoregulation affects the body biochemically. [[Enzyme]]s involved in metabolic pathways within the body such as cellular respiration fail to work effectively at higher temperatures, and further increases can lead them to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]], reducing their ability to catalyse essential chemical reactions. This loss of enzymatic control affects the functioning of major organs with high energy demands such as the heart and brain.

===Situational===
[[File:heat-related deaths.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|right]]
Situational heat stroke occurs in the absence of exertion. It mostly affects the young and elderly.  In the elderly in particular, it can be precipitated by medications that reduce vasodilation and sweating, such as [[anticholinergic]] drugs, antihistamines, and diuretics.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  In this situation, the body's tolerance for high environmental temperature may be insufficient, even at rest.

Heat waves are often followed by a rise in the death rate, and these 'classical hyperthermia' deaths typically involve the elderly and infirm.  This is partly because thermoregulation involves cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems which may be inadequate for the additional stress because of the existing burden of aging and disease, further compromised by medications.  During the July 1995 heat wave in Chicago, there were at least 700 heat-related deaths.  The strongest risk factors were being confined to bed, and living alone, while the risk was reduced for those with working air conditioners and those with access to transportation.  Even then, reported deaths may be underestimates as diagnosis can be misclassified as stroke or heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Heat-related deaths during the July 1995 heat wave in Chicago |vauthors=Semenza JC, Rubin CH, Falter KH, Selanikio JD, Flanders WD, Howe HL, Wilhelm JL | date=July 1996 | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=335 | issue = 2  | pages=84–90 | pmid=8649494 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199607113350203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
Some drugs cause excessive internal heat production.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  The rate of drug-induced hyperthermia is higher where use of these drugs is higher.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

* Many psychotropic medications, such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), and [[tricyclic antidepressants]], can cause hyperthermia.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  [[Serotonin syndrome]] is a rare adverse reaction to overdose of these medications or the use of several simultaneously.  Similarly, [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is an uncommon reaction to [[neuroleptic]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, Sixth edition |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith  |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1818 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These syndromes are differentiated by other associated symptoms, such as tremor in serotonin syndrome and "lead-pipe" muscle rigidity in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;
* Various stimulant drugs, including [[amphetamines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location= |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2894 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cocaine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location= |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2388 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hallucinogenic drugs, including [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[LSD]], and [[MDMA]] can produce hyperthermia as an [[adverse effect]].&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;
* [[Malignant hyperthermia]] is a rare reaction to common anesthetic agents (such as [[halothane]]) or the paralytic agent [[succinylcholine]].  Those who have this reaction, which is potentially fatal, have a genetic predisposition.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;
* The use of [[anticholinergic]]s, more specifically [[muscarinic antagonist]]s are thought to cause mild hyperthermic episodes due to its parasympatholytic effects. The sympathetic nervous system a.k.a. the "Fight or Flight Response" dominates by raising catecholamine levels by the blocked action of the Rest and Digest System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patel|first=R.J.|pmid=14751484|title=Prevalence of autonomic signs and symptoms in antimuscarinic drug poisonings|journal=J. Emerg. Med.|date=January 2004|volume=26|number=1|pages=89–94|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drugs that decouple [[oxidative phosphorylation]] may also cause hyperthermia. From this group of drugs the most well known is [[2,4-Dinitrophenol]] which was used as a weight loss drug until dangers from its use became apparent.

===Personal protective equipment===
Those working in industry, in the military, or as [[Certified first responder|first responder]]s may be required to wear [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) against hazards such as chemical agents, gases, fire, small arms and even [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)]].  PPE includes a range of hazmat suits, firefighting turnout gear, body armor and [[bomb suit]]s, among others.  Depending on design, the wearer may be encapsulated in a microclimate,&lt;ref name=MicroclimateCooling&gt;{{cite web |title=Microclimate Conditioning Systems |publisher=US Army Natick Soldier RD&amp;E Center |url=http://nsrdec.natick.army.mil/media/print/MCC_Systems_Trifold.pdf |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an increase in thermal resistance and decrease in vapor permeability.  As physical work is performed, the body’s natural  thermoregulation (i.e., sweating) becomes ineffective.  This is compounded by increased work rates, high ambient temperature and humidity levels, and direct exposure to the sun.  The net effect is that desired protection from some environmental threats inadvertently increases the threat of heat stress.

The effect of PPE on hyperthermia has been noted in fighting the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|2014 Ebola virus epidemic]] in Western Africa. Doctors and healthcare workers were only able to work 40 minutes at a stretch in their protective suits, fearing heat strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/07/354230895/ebola-protective-suits-are-in-short-supply |title=Ebola Protective Suits Are In Short Supply |first=Jackie |last=Northam |publisher=National Public Radio |date=7 October 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Other rare causes of hyperthermia include [[thyrotoxicosis]] and an [[adrenal gland]] tumor, called [[pheochromocytoma]], both of which can cause increased heat production.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  Damage to the central nervous system, from brain hemorrhage, [[status epilepticus]], and other kinds of injury to the hypothalamus can also cause hyperthermia.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:fever-conceptual.svg|thumb|A summary of the differences between hyperthermia, [[hypothermia]], and fever.&lt;br /&gt;'''Hyperthermia''': Characterized on the left. Normal body temperature (thermoregulatory set-point) is shown in green, while the hyperthermic temperature is shown in red. As can be seen, hyperthermia can be considered an increase above the thermoregulatory set-point.&lt;br /&gt;'''Hypothermia''': Characterized in the center: Normal body temperature is shown in green, while hypothermic temperature is shown in blue. As can be seen, hypothermia can be conceptualized as a decrease below the thermoregulatory set-point.&lt;br /&gt;'''Fever''': Characterized on the right: Normal body temperature is shown in green. It reads "New Normal" because the thermoregulatory set-point has risen. This has caused what was the normal body temperature (in blue) to be considered hypothermic.]]

A [[fever]] occurs when the [[body temperature|core temperature]] is set higher, through the action of the pre-optic region of the [[anterior hypothalamus]]. For example, in response to a  [[bacteria]]l or [[virus|viral]] infection, certain white blood cells within the blood will release [[pyrogens]] which have a direct effect on the anterior hypothalamus, causing body temperature to rise, much like raising the temperature setting on a [[thermostat]].

In contrast, hyperthermia occurs when the body temperature rises without a change in the heat control centers.

Some of the gastrointestinal symptoms of acute exertional heat stroke, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding, may be caused by barrier dysfunction and subsequent [[endotoxemia]]. Ultraendurance athletes have been found to have significantly increased plasma endotoxin levels. Endotoxin stimulates many inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may cause multiorgan dysfunction. Experimentally, monkeys treated with oral antibiotics prior to induction of heat stroke do not become endotoxemic.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Patrick.  Role of gastrointestinal permeability in exertional heatstroke. ''Exercise and Sport Science Reviews.'' 32(4): 185-190. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

There is scientific support for the concept of a temperature set point; that is, maintenance of an optimal temperature for the metabolic processes that life depends on. Nervous activity in the [[Preoptic area|preoptic-anterior hypothalamus]] of the brain triggers heat losing (sweating, etc.) or heat generating (shivering and muscle contraction, etc.) activities through stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. The pre-optic anterior hypothalamus has been shown to contain warm sensitive, cool sensitive, and temperature insensitive neurons, to determine the body's temperature setpoint. As the temperature that these neurons are exposed to rises above 37&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of electrical discharge of the warm-sensitive neurons increases progressively. Cold-sensitive neurons increase their rate of electrical discharge progressively below 37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=J.H.|title=Neuroscience Online: An Electronic Textbook for the Neurosciences|url=http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/|publisher=Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, The University of Texas Medical School at Houston (UTHealth)|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Hyperthermia is generally diagnosed by the combination of unexpectedly high body temperature and a history that supports hyperthermia instead of a fever.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  Most commonly this means that the elevated temperature has occurred in a hot, humid environment (heat stroke) or in someone taking a drug for which hyperthermia is a known side effect (drug-induced hyperthermia).  The presence of signs and symptoms related to hyperthermia syndromes, such as extrapyramidal symptoms characteristic of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and the absence of signs and symptoms more commonly related to infection-related fevers, are also considered in making the diagnosis.

If [[antipyretic|fever-reducing drugs]] lower the body temperature, even if the temperature does not return entirely to normal, then hyperthermia is excluded.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

==Prevention==
When ambient temperature is excessive, humans and many animals cool themselves below ambient by [[evaporative cooling]] of [[sweat]] (or other aqueous liquid; [[saliva]] in dogs, for example); this helps prevent potentially fatal hyperthermia. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling depends upon [[humidity]]. [[Wet-bulb temperature#Wet-bulb temperature and health|Wet-bulb temperature]], which takes humidity into account, or more complex calculated quantities such as [[wet-bulb globe temperature]] (WBGT), which also takes [[solar radiation]] into account, give useful indications of the degree of heat stress and are used by several agencies as the basis for heat-stress prevention guidelines. (Wet-bulb temperature is essentially the lowest skin temperature attainable by evaporative cooling at a given ambient temperature and humidity.)

A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding {{convert|35|C|F}} is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at this temperature, environmental heat gain instead of loss occurs. {{As of|2012}}, wet-bulb temperatures only very rarely exceeded {{convert|30|C|F}} anywhere, although significant [[global warming]] may change this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thermogeddon: Too hot for humans |first=Hazel |last=Muir |journal=New Scientist |volume=208 |issue=2783 |pages=36–39 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(10)62649-8 |date=23 October 2010 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of heat stress caused by physical exertion, hot environments, or protective equipment, prevention or mitigation by frequent rest breaks, careful hydration, and monitoring body temperature should be attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics: Heat Stress|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, in situations demanding one is exposed to a hot environment for a prolonged period or must wear protective equipment, a personal cooling system is required as a matter of health and safety.  There is a variety of active or passive personal cooling systems;&lt;ref name=MicroclimateCooling/&gt; these can be categorized by their power sources and whether they are person- or vehicle-mounted.

Because of the broad variety of operating conditions, these devices must meet specific requirements concerning their rate and duration of cooling, their power source, and their adherence to health and safety regulations. Among other criteria are the user's need for physical mobility and autonomy. For example, active-liquid systems operate by chilling water and circulating it through a garment; the skin surface area is thereby cooled through conduction. This type of system has proven successful in certain military, law enforcement, and industrial applications. Bomb-disposal technicians wearing special suits to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) use a small, ice-based chiller unit that is strapped to one leg; a liquid-circulating garment, usually a vest, is worn over the torso to maintain a safe core body temperature. By contrast, soldiers traveling in combat vehicles can face microclimate temperatures in excess of 65&amp;nbsp;°C and require a multiple-user, vehicle-powered cooling system with rapid connection capabilities. Requirements for hazmat teams, the medical community, and workers in heavy industry vary further.

==Treatment==
The underlying cause must be removed.  Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion on a hot day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased [[water consumption]] and resting in a cool place.  Hyperthermia that results from [[drug]] exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures.

[[Antipyretics]] (e.g., [[acetaminophen]], [[aspirin]], other [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]) have no role in the treatment of [[heatstroke]] because antipyretics interrupt the change in the [[hypothalamic]] [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]] caused by [[pyrogens]]; they are not expected to work on a healthy [[hypothalamus]] that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop [[hepatic]], [[hematologic]], and [[renal]] [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] because they may aggravate [[bleeding]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|166320|Heatstroke|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When body temperature is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used to remove heat and to restore the body's ability to regulate its own temperatures.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;  Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately.  Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]] with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures.  Drinking water and turning a fan or dehumidifying [[air conditioning]] unit on the affected person may improve the effectiveness of the body's evaporative cooling mechanisms ([[sweating]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Sitting in a bathtub of tepid or cool water (immersion method) can remove a significant amount of heat in a relatively short period of time.  It was once thought that immersion in very cold water is counterproductive, as it causes [[vasoconstriction]] in the skin and thereby prevents heat from escaping the body core.  However, a British analysis of various studies stated: "this has never been proven experimentally.  Indeed, a recent study using normal volunteers has shown that cooling rates were fastest when the coldest water was used."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=J E |title=Cooling methods used in the treatment of exertional heat illness |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=39 |issue=8 |pages=503–7; discussion 507 |year=2005 |pmid=16046331 |pmc=1725271 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.013466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis concluded that iced water immersion is the most-effective cooling technique for exertional heat stroke.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  No superior cooling method has been found for ''non-exertional heat stroke''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouchama |first1=Abderrezak |last2=Dehbi |first2=Mohammed |last3=Chaves-Carballo |first3=Enrique |title=Cooling and hemodynamic management in heatstroke: practical recommendations |journal=Critical Care |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=R54 |year=2007 |pmid=17498312 |pmc=2206402 |doi=10.1186/cc5910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, aggressive ''ice-water'' immersion remains the gold standard for ''life-threatening heat stroke''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Exerc Sport Sci Rev |date=July 2007 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=141–149 |title=Cold water immersion: the gold standard for exertional heatstroke treatment |authors=Casa DJ, McDermott BP, Lee EC, Yeargin SW, Armstrong LE, Maresh CM |pmid=17620933 |doi=10.1097/jes.0b013e3180a02bec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4085/1062-6050-44.1.84 |title=Acute Whole-Body Cooling for Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia: A Systematic Review |year=2009 |last1=McDermott |first1=Brendon P. |last2=Casa |first2=Douglas J. |last3=Ganio |first3=Matthew S. |last4=Lopez |first4=Rebecca M. |last5=Yeargin |first5=Susan W. |last6=Armstrong |first6=Lawrence E. |last7=Maresh |first7=Carl M. |journal=Journal of Athletic Training |volume=44 |pages=84–93 |pmid=19180223 |issue=1 |pmc=2629045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the body temperature reaches about {{convert|40|C|F}}, or if the affected person is unconscious or showing signs of confusion, hyperthermia is considered a [[medical emergency]] that requires treatment in a proper medical facility.  In a hospital, more aggressive cooling measures are available, including [[intravenous]] [[Fluid replacement|hydration]], [[gastric lavage]] with iced [[Saline water|saline]], and even [[hemodialysis]] to cool the blood.&lt;ref name=Harrisons /&gt;

==Epidemiology== &lt;!-- see similar section in Heat stroke --&gt;
The frequency of environmental hyperthermia can vary significantly from year to year depending on factors such as [[heat wave]]s. Statistically, outdoor workers, including [[Farmworker|agricultural workers]], are at increased risk of experiencing heat stress and the resulting negative health effects. Between 1992 and 2006 in the United States, 68 crop workers died from heat stroke, representing a rate 20 times that of US civilian workers overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Heat-Related Deaths Among Crop Workers – United States, 1992–2006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5724a1.htm |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |volume=57 |issue=24 |pages=649–653 |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter Institute''' ('''JCVI''') is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[genomics]] [[research]] institute founded by [[Craig Venter|J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter]], Ph.D. in October 2006. The Institute was the result of consolidating four organizations: the Center for the Advancement of Genomics, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives, and the J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter Science Foundation Joint Technology Center. It has facilities in [[Rockville, Maryland]] and [[La Jolla, California]].

The Institute studies the [[Society|societal]] implications of genomics in addition to genomics itself. The Institute's research involves genomic medicine; environmental genomic analysis; [[clean energy]]; [[synthetic biology]]; and ethics, law, and economics. The Institute employs over 200 people, including Nobel laureate [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]].

== History ==
In 2004, the Center for the Advancement of Genomics (TCAG), the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA) and the J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter Institute Joint Technology Center (JTC) were merged and to form the J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter Institute (JCVI).&lt;ref name="JCVI2004"&gt;{{cite press release|title=J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter Announces Consolidation of Three Research Organizations Into One New Not-For-Profit Organization — The J.Craig Venter Institute|date=29 September 2004|publisher=J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter Institute|url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/press/press-releases/full-text/article/j-craig-venter-announces-consolidation-of-three-research-organizations-into-one-new-not-for-profit/|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

in 1992, Craig Venter was a researcher at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).

The '''Kasepuhan''' or '''Kasepuhan Banten Kidul''' are a traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] community of approximately 5,300 people, who live in the southern part of [[Gunung Halimun National Park]], in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Java]]. Gunung Halimun National Park is located within the borders of the [[Sukabumi Regency]], [[Bogor]] and southern [[Banten]] province. The Kasepuhan is called "Kasepuhan Banten Kidul" (Kasepuhan of Southern Banten), their main village is Ciptagelar in the Cisolok subdistrict (''kecamatan'') in the western part of the [[Sukabumi Regency]]. The current head of the community, Abah Ugih, inherited the position of leader when his father, Abah Anom, died at the age of 54.&lt;ref&gt;J. Adiguna, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/11/living-harmony-with-nature.html-3 Living in harmony with the nature'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514223326/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/11/living-harmony-with-nature.html-3 |date=2014-05-14 }}, ''The Jakarta Post'', 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''kasepuhan'' is formed on ''sepuh'', which means "old" in the [[Sundanese language]]. It refers to a way of living based on ancestral traditions and eventually, to the local community who lives according to these traditions.

==History and tradition==
According to oral information, the Kasepuhan have lived in this area (''Banten Kidul'', or ''south Banten'') since 1368.   The ancestors of the Kasepuhan are said to have lived in the area of Bogor, east of Gunung Halimun. At that time, their ancestors were part of a kingdom that encompassed the province of West Java and Banten.

The people of the Kasepuhan claim they are linked with the [[Baduy people|Baduy]], another traditional group in West Java. The main belief system of Kasepuhan people is [[Sunda Wiwitan]]. Nowadays, the Kasepuhan are influenced by [[Islam]].  However they do not strictly follow all rules of Islam but, rather, combine their beliefs with [[animism]] and [[Sundanese (people)|Sundanese]] traditions. Just as their ancestors, they have combined several traditions and religions with their own Kasepuhan tradition; that is, they are influenced by Islam, Sundanese traditions, Pajajaran traditions and thus Hinduism and also animism.

The main ritual of Kasepuhan community is ''[[Seren Taun]]'', or rice harvest thanksgiving as well as marking the new agriculture year in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] tradition. Seren Taun festival also celebrated by other Sundanese traditional communities in other areas such as Sundanese community in Cigugur [[Kuningan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.kompas.com/read/2011/01/23/09340353/Hari.Ini.Puncak.Seren.Taun.di.Bogor Seren Taun Bogor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kasepuhan history existed since 1368 (note: the years allowed to write down) their believe before that time also they still have story, but enough to lets other peoples known only from that time.
the areas of the kingdom called " Banten Kidul" its a territories  before the government age, and now this Banten Kidul area on three sub district areas ( Lebak, Bogor and Sukabumi)
The peoples in Kasepuhan still living in the tradition and ancient cultures role of custom, following what the ancestor said for their life and living on rice plantation. the rice they have to plan is only rice seed from the ancestor ( data 2014: there are 167 original varieties) planting till today, and more than 300 new varieties from natural mixing on the rice field.

By far the most important way of subsistence for the Kasepuhan is agriculture, which can split into two categories: ' Huma'' (Dry rice cultivation), ''Sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). the Dry system rice plantation is the original way plantation from the ancestor, and since the Dutch time then they have wets system rice plantation called "Sawah".

About 85% of Kasepuhan agricultural land is ''sawah'', 10% consists of ''ladang'', and 5% ''kebun''.  There is a strong emphasis on eco-friendly techniques of farming within the community.and the other land is Forestry, living in the forest also message from the ancestor to keep the tradition safely, make distance with the city from outside influence, they have three categories forestry for : Leuweung  Tutupan (forbidden forest), Leuweung Titipan (forbidden forest) and Leuweung Garapan ( the plots forest), and the peoples living in the plots lands &lt;ref&gt;Sri Wahyuni, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/10/25/painting-campaign-calls-justice-climate-change.html Painting campaign calls for justice on climate change'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 25 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krotona''' was one of three important [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] centers in the United States during the early part of the 20th century. Originally built in [[Hollywood]] during 1912, the colony was eventually relocated to [[Ojai]], [[California]] in 1926, where it operates today as the '''Krotona Institute of Theosophy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corbu2.caed.kent.edu/architronic/v8n1/v8n106.pdf |title=A Survey of Surviving Buildings of the Krotona Colony in Hollywood |accessdate=2007-10-07 |last= Willis |first= Alfred |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Located just off of [[California State Route 33|State Route 33]], the Krotona Institute holds regular classes and workshops on Theosophy, maintains an extensive library on the occult, and has a small bookstore.

The Hollywood Krotona building located at Primrose and Vista Del Mar was erected in 1919.&lt;ref name="Meares 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Meares | first=Hadley | title=The Creation of Beachwood Canyon's Theosophist "Dreamland" | website=Curbed LA | date=2014-05-22 | url=https://la.curbed.com/2014/5/22/10099768/the-creation-of-beachwood-canyons-theosophist-dreamland-1 | access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenants have included Annie Sullivan Knudsen (sugar cane heiress), New Yorker Grace Shaw Duff, Henry Hotchener, [[Marie Russak]], silver screen stars [[Mary Astor]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]], and record producer Joshua Rumer of Invengo Records. When the Krotonians, spurred by [[Madame Blavatsky]], found Hollywood suffocating their peace-filled theosophies, they decided to move to Ojai California and that is where they have been ever since.

It was about a year before the Primrose building went up that [[Alice Bailey]], subsequently a Theosophical and Spiritualist leader and author, moved to a "cottage on Beechwood Drive," to be near the Krotona colony, from Pacific Grove, CA, near Monterey.  She had joined the Theosophical Lodge in Pacific Grove and was teaching and holding classes.  Not long before, she tells, she had left her original traditional Christian beliefs behind and soon after "discovered" "that there was a great and divine Plan," and that there are those "who are responsible for the working out of that Plan" by leading mankind, "stage by stage," down the centuries.  This "hierarchy of spiritual leaders" she calls the "Masters of the Wisdom," and they all report to and work with Christ, Jesus of Nazareth.  Her own Master, Lord K. H. or Koot Hoomi, had made visits to her every few years, starting she said in 1895, this being one of his many duties in his role as a pupil or assistant to the Christ.  K. H. was a master of love-wisdom.  Bailey said about 500 people were then part of the Krotona community, some living on the premises, and she began work there by emptying the garbage.  Soon she worked in the vegetarian kitchen and noted that some of the vegetarians felt smugly superior to carnivores, while others had no such notions.  She remained with the Theosophical Society until 1920.&lt;ref name="Bailey 1951"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Alice |title=The unfinished autobiography of Alice A.

'''LADSS''', or '''land allocation decision support system''', is an agricultural [[land-use planning]] tool developed at [[The Macaulay Institute]].  More recently the term LADSS is used to refer to the research of the team behind the original planning tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spatial Decision Support Systems: Principles and Practices|author=Ramanathan Sugumaran, John Degroote|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of research==
The focus of the research of the LADSS team has evolved over time from land use decision support towards policy support, climate change and the concepts of resilience and adaptive capacity.

==Recent studies==
The team has recently published a study which examines, from a Scottish perspective, a number of alternative scenarios for reform of CAP Pillar 1 Area Payments.  It focuses on two alternative classifications: the Macaulay Land Capability for Agriculture classification; and Less Favoured Area Designations; and includes analysis of the redistribution of payments from the current historical system.  The study is entitled: [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/LADSS/cap_flattening.html Modelling Scenarios for CAP Pillar 1 Area Payments using Macaulay Land Capability for Agriculture (&amp; Less Favoured Area Designations)] and was used to inform the [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/farmingrural/Agriculture/inquiry Pack Inquiry].

The EU [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/smile/ SMILE] (Synergies in Multi-scale Inter-Linkages of Eco-social Systems) project, focuses on the concept of [[social metabolism]] that draws attention to how energy, material, money and ideas are utilised by society.

The [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/aquarius/ Aquarius] project, which is aims is to find and implement sustainable, integrated land-water management through engaging with land managers.

The [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/copenhagen/ COP15] website which provides a series of briefing and scoping papers produced by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and contributed to by [[The Macaulay Institute]] to raise the profile of the ecosystems approach in the UNFCC 15th Conference of the Parties meeting in Copenhagen to tackling not just climate change mitigation and adaptation, but also poverty alleviation, disaster risk reduction, [[biodiversity loss]] and many other environmental issues.

==LADSS planning tool==
The LADSS planning tool is implemented using the programming language G2 from Gensym alongside a [[Smallworld]] GIS application using the [[Magik (programming language)|Magik programming language]] and an [[Oracle database]].  LADSS models crops using the [[CropSyst]] simulation model.  LADSS also contains a [[livestock]] model plus social, environmental and economic impact assessments.

LADSS has been used to address [[climate change]] issues affecting agriculture in [[Scotland]] and [[Italy]].  Part of this work has involved the use of General Circulation Models (also known as [[Global climate model]]s) to predict future climate scenarios.  Other work has included a study into how [[Common Agricultural Policy]] reform will affect the uplands of [[Scotland]], an assessment of agricultural [[sustainability]] and rural development research within the AGRIGRID project.

==Resources==
Peer reviewed papers produced by LADSS are available for [http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/LADSS/papers.html download] in PDF format.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6738">{{about|the crop growth principle|the "Law of the Maximum" established during the French Revolution|general maximum}}

The '''Law of Maximum''' also known as '''Law of the Maximum''' is a principle developed by [[Arthur Wallace]] which states that total growth of a crop or a plant is proportional to about 70 growth factors. Growth will not be greater than the aggregate values of the growth factors. Without the correction of the limiting growth factors; nutrients, waters and other inputs are not fully or judicially used resulting in wasted resources.&lt;ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The growth factors are arithmetically additive. The factors range from 0 for no growth to 1 for maximum growth. Actual growth is calculated by the total multiplication of each growth factor. For example, if ten factors had a value of 0.5, the actual growth would be:

{|
|
*0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x0.5 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 or 0.001 of optimum (0.1%).
|}

If each of ten factors had a value of 0.9 the actual growth would be:
{|
|
*0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x0.9 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 or 0.349 of optimum (34.9%).
|}

Hence the need to achieve maximal value for each factor is critical in order to obtain maximal growth.

== Demonstrations of "Law of the Maximum" ==

The following demonstrates the Law of the Maximum. For the various crops listed below, one, two or three factors were limiting while all the other factors were 1. When two or three factors were simultaneously limiting, predicted growth of the two or three factors was similar to the actual growth when the two or three factors were limits individually and then multiplied together.

[[File:Witness impeachment.jpg|thumb|Mock trials allow researchers to examine [[confirmation bias]]es in a realistic setting]]

A '''mock trial''' is an act or imitation [[trial (law)|trial]]. It is similar to a [[moot court]], but mock trials simulate lower-court trials, while moot court simulates [[appellate court]] hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/court-moot-court-mock-court-and-mock.html Court, Moot Court, Mock Court and Mock Trial], Available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawyer|Attorneys]] preparing for a real trial might use a mock trial consisting of volunteers as role players to test theories or experiment with each other.  Mock trial is also the name of an [[extracurricular]] program in which [[student]]s participate in rehearsed trials to learn about the legal system in a competitive manner. Interscholastic mock trials take place on all levels including [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[high school]], [[college]], and [[law school]].  Mock trial is often taught in conjunction with a course in [[trial advocacy]] or takes place as an after school enrichment activity. Some gifted and talented programs may also take place in one.

==Litigation related mock trials==
Litigators may use mock trials to assist with trial preparation and settlement negotiations of actual cases. Unlike school-related mock trials, these mock trials can take numerous forms depending on the information sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelawinsider.com/mock-trial-lawschool/what-is-a-mock-trial/ scholastic mock trials]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when faced with complex fact issues in a particular case, attorneys might convene a mini mock trial to try different methods of presenting their evidence, sometimes before a jury.

==Competitive school-related mock trials around the world==

===Asia Pacific===
[[Guam]] has been hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition. In 2011 and 2012, there were 14 teams from Guam, [[South Korea]], and [[Saipan]] in its 4th annual competition. The competition was held at [[Government of Guam#The Superior Court of Guam|the Superior Court of Guam]]. The teams made up of mostly junior and senior students from [[high school]]s. The Champion of the 4th Annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition was Marianas Baptist Academy of Saipan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MBA is Asia-Pacific invitational mock trial competition champion |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |accessdate=29 December 2012 |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526073517/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2005, the [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot]] was conceived as one of its kind  with the aim of promoting skills of trial advocacy. In its 10th successful year (2014), this national moot trial is one of the most appreciated for its innovation and structure. Popular demand led to the creation of three more editions of this unique trial competition [India North, India South, India North East &amp; India West (from 2014–15) rounds.] This competition  has the distinction of being the first ever to be held in the North Eastern region of India in 2012. The structure is such that  law students from the host institution participate by enacting the role of  witnesses for the oral rounds. The students and faculty welcome this, as it provides a unique opportunity to learn practical aspects of a trial, first hand.

===Australia===
Mock trial competitions in Australia are held regionally. These include:
* The Law Society of South Australia Mock Trial Competition comprises a series of simulated court cases by students [[Education in Australia|years 10, 11 and 12]] from 32 schools in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/other/mock_trial.asp|publisher=The Law Society of South Australia|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Law Society of Western Australia Interschool Mock Trial Competition is held each year for students enrolled in years 10, 11 and 12 in [[Western Australia]]. There were 773 students representing 68 teams from 38 schools participated in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trials Competition |url=http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |publisher=The Law Society of Western Australia |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101085042/http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Capital Region Mock Trial Competition is organized by [[University of Canberra]]. There were teams of schools in [[Australian Capital Territory]] region with year 10, 11 and 12 students.
* The New South Wales Mock Trial Competition has been running since 1981 for students years 10 and 11 in [[New South Wales]] initially with 28 schools. There have also been international events with mock trial competitions between Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2008, schools from this region also traveled to [[New York City]] to compete in the Empire Mock Trial Competition. The first Asia-Australia mock trial competition via video conference between Australian teams and a Korean team was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/forschools/mocktrial/Mocktrial|publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Jodie|title=First Asia-Australia mock trial|journal=The National Legal Eagle|date=10 January 2009|volume=15|issue=2|page=18|url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=nle|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
Mock trials in continental Europe are less coordinated than their UK or US counterparts, but there are a few isolated examples. In Germany, the Faculty of Legal Sciences of the [[University of Regensburg]] organizes the REGINA Mock Trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA Mock Trial: Der Gerichtssimulator|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/rechtswissenschaft/fakultaet/medien/regina/mock_trial_flyer_hp.pdf|website=University of Regensburg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] organizes a mock trial specialized in administrative law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial im Verwaltungsprozessrecht|url=https://www.jura.rw.fau.de/mock-trial-im-verwaltungsprozessrecht-2/|website=Fachbereich Rechtswissenschaft|publisher=Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, there is a mock trial program specialized in [[insurance law]] coordinated by the [[Fernando Peña López|Fundacion INADE-UDC Chair of Risk Management and Insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veredicto Ejemplar|url=https://catedrafundacioninade.org/veredicto-ejemplar/2018|website=Cátedra Fundación INADE-UDC|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Bar Mock Trial}}
The Bar National Mock Trial Competition involves students to take on the roles of [[barrister]]s and [[witness]]es and present their case against teams from other schools. It has been running annually since 1991 with regional tournaments and the national final. There are 2,000 students in years 10 to 13, 300 barristers and advocates, and 90 judges involved in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bar National Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/main/comps.php?175|publisher=Citizenship Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School Mock Court Case Project runs both primary and secondary school competitions primarily in Scotland, although has undertaken a number of international competitions. Currently some 100 schools, circa 3,000 students are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Mock Court Project- Background|url=https://www.mockcourt.org.uk/background.php|publisher=School Mock Court Case Project SCIO|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|publisher=Scottish Legal News|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition/|publisher=DC Thomson Co Ltd|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competition framework====
Competitive mock trial functions in yearly cycles.  Each year, a case packet is distributed to all participating schools in late summer to early fall.  The case packet is a series of documents including the charges, penal code, stipulations, case law, and jury instructions as well as all [[Exhibit (legal)|exhibits]] and [[affidavit]]s relevant to the case.  During a mock trial, competitors are restricted to only the materials provided in the case packet and may not reference any outside sources.  In order to prepare for competition, teams thoroughly read and analyze the case packet.

National mock trial teams consist of a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve official members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/AMTA%20Rulebook%202012%20HL.pdf |title=American Mock Trial Association Rulebook, Page 16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of state mock trial teams can vary; California, for example, allows up to 25 official team members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crf-usa.org/images/stories/mt_la/2014-15_mock_trial_team_rulebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each team prepares both sides of the case:  prosecution and defense in a criminal trial, plaintiff and defense in a civil action.  Each side is composed of two or three attorneys as well as two or three witnesses, all played by members of the team. Teams must be organized into two sides of five to six players for the prosecution/plaintiff and defense.&lt;ref name = "rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/fullrules.cfm |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm NYSBA Mock Trial] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that high school mock trial is governed by state bar associations, meaning that cases, rules, and competition structure vary from state to state whereas all of college mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association, meaning that every school uses the same case and is subject to the same rules.

====Procedure====
[[Image:Mock trial closing.jpg|thumb|A [[student]] giving his closing argument during a mock trial]]

The mock trial begins with the judge entering the courtroom. The judge then gives out the instructions to the jury (about what they are to listen to). Then if there is a pretrial motion, the defense and prosecution give their respective pretrial arguments. The judge then lets the prosecution or plaintiff give an opening statement. Following the prosecution/plaintiff's opening statement, the judge may offer the defense to deliver the opening statement during that time as well, or to wait until after the prosecution has presented all of its witnesses. After the opening statements, examination of the witnesses begins. The prosecution/plaintiff calls their witnesses first. Witnesses are sworn in by their team's bailiff/timekeeper. A student competitor attorney for the prosecution/plaintiff does a direct examination of the witness. Once the direct examination is complete, the opposing team may cross-examine the witness. After the cross-examination, if the first team chooses, they may redirect the witness and, likewise, the other team may do a re-cross after this. However, redirect and re-cross examinations are only limited to the scope of the previous examination conducted by opposing counsel. This process is repeated for the two remaining plaintiff witnesses. Once the prosecution/plaintiff have finished with their witnesses, the defense may give their opening statement if not delivered before, and then the process is repeated with the defense witnesses, having the defense attorneys direct and the plaintiff attorneys cross-examine.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt;

Once all of the witnesses have been examined, the trial moves to closing arguments. The prosecutor/plaintiff again goes first and has the option to reserve time before hand for rebuttal. After the defense finishes their closing argument, the plaintiff may give their rebuttal argument if they still have time remaining. In some competitions, the rebuttal is limited to the scope of the defense’s closing argument.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; Time limits are set at each level of competition to prevent the trials from running too long and to keep rounds of competition running smoothly. Time limits are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Time Limits of Mock Trial Competition
!Statement/Examination/Argument
!Time Limit
|-
|Opening Statement
|5 minutes
|-
|Direct and Redirect Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Cross and Recross Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Pre-Closing Preparation
|2 minutes
|-
|Closing Argument
|9 minutes
|-
|Rebuttal (Prosecution only)
|Amount of time reserved before closing
|}
Time limits may vary from state-to-state competitions. Please note that time is kept track of by the bailiff/timekeeper, who times their co-counsel's statements, examinations, and arguments. Time is stopped for objections.

==== Objections ====
A main part of Mock Trial is the raising and arguing of objections given by opposing teams. Objections are raised when the opposing counsel attempts to bring in evidence or testimony that go against the rules of evidence. When an objection is raised, the judge may either overrule or sustain it immediately, or ask opposing counsel for their argument about why the testimony/evidence is admissible. Time is paused for objections, so an objection "battle" could go on for hours at a time until the judge makes a ruling. Mock Trial students receive an abridged version of [[Rules of evidence|Rules of Evidence]] to base their objections on in the case packet that contains the witness affidavits and other elements of the court case.

====Judging====
[[Image:Mock trial critique.jpg|thumb|left|Attorney evaluators give a critique at the end of a mock trial competition.]]

There are several different ways that a mock trial can be judged. In one, the judges for scoring the mock trial consist of the presiding judge and two scoring judges, all of whom score the teams. In a second method, there are two scoring judges and the presiding judge, as in the first method, but the presiding judge does not score the teams, rather the judge simply votes or casts a ballot for one team or another.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; In yet another method of judging, there are three scoring judges and the presiding judge is not involved in the scoring of the teams. Often at college invitationals, there are two scoring judges, one of whom doubles as the presiding judge. Since enticing attorneys to judge is notoriously difficult (as judges are rarely compensated with more than a free lunch), it is rare to see more than two judges in a round at most competitions.

Unlike real law, the victorious team does not necessarily have to win on the merits of the case. Instead, evaluators score individual attorneys and witnesses on a 1-10 scale (though some states use different scales for high school competitions) based on each stage of the trial. These consist of the opening statements for the plaintiff and defense, each of the witnesses’ testimony, direct and cross-examination by attorneys, and the closing statements for both sides. The team with the highest total number of points is often, but not always, the team that wins the judge's verdict. Given this method of scoring, it is possible for the defendant to be found guilty or lose the case but for the defense team to still win the round.

In some competitions, points can be deducted from a team’s score for testifying with information outside the scope of the mock trial materials and for unsportsmanlike conduct or abuse of objections. However, scores are completely at a judge's discretion, meaning that scores are subjective based on different evaluation criteria.

====Power matching====
In the first round of the tournament, all of the teams are randomly matched to compete with each other. After the first round of some tournaments, teams are “power matched” to go up against other teams with similar records (e.g. in the second round, a 1-0 team will be matched with another 1-0 team).&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; If there is a tie in record, the judges will use the number of ballots and total points earned to decide the matching.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This allows for teams to compete with other teams of similar skill.

=====National championship format=====
In the national championship format, which is also employed by invitationals across the country, the tournament is power matched through the last round. While this determines the strongest team at the tournament overall, it does not provide an accurate representation of 2nd, 3rd, 4th place teams, etc., because they might have lost multiple ballots to a strong team who placed first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation.php |title=The American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Exceptions=====
Of course, there are practical exceptions to the theory of power matching. Tab room coordinators who are creating brackets for each round may deviate from the rules of power matching in order to 1. allow each team to alternate between prosecution/plaintiff and defense between rounds, 2. avoid two teams from the same school competing against each other (Maryland Rule), 3. avoid having a team compete against a team it played in a prior round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tba.org/mocktrial/2010_stateforms/powermatching.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Power protection=====
When tournaments are power protected, it means that the first rounds of competition are power matched as stated above. In the last round(s), however, the team with the strongest record is paired against the team with the weakest record. This ensures that the best teams do not knock each other out of the running for a rank. Rather, it's anticipated that the stronger team will win and protect their chance at a rank, while there is no harm done to the weaker team who is already out of reach of a trophy. Additionally, this method gives weaker teams exposure to stronger programs that they can learn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation_files/0809tabmanualfebruaryupdate_2-3-09.doc |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Levels of competition====

=====Elementary school=====
At the elementary school level, the mock trial guide by [[American Bar Association]] suggests to use role-playing from scripted mock trials such as [[fairy tale]] mock trials as a way to introduce the concept of conflicts, trials, jury verdicts in civil trials, vocabulary of the court, damages, and the roles of individuals portrayed in the trial. Therefore, most of mock trials at this level are non-competitive classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Putting on mock trials.|year=2002|publisher=Division for Public Education, American Bar Association|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=1-59031-154-X|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/media/27617684/mocktrialguide.pdf|edition=[Rev. ed.].}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no national competition for this level. However, a few states offer intrastate competitions. There are a couple difference formats of competitions for this level.

The first format focuses on how the cases are developed such as ''New Jersey Law Fair'' competitions. Students grades 3 to 6 are asked to generate, develop and write the case from their own idea to include details of the facts, issue, witnesses, statements, instructions, sub-issues, concepts and law. As the students at this age range may not know the details of applicable law, students are allowed to create their own law. There are no specific themes, students can choose any age-appropriate topics. The students are encouraged to do a role-playing in a mock trial based on the script that they have developed to involve other students in the classroom as juries in order to refine their case. Each team plays the roles of both side in their case during the mock trial. The winners will perform their case in the real court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Fair for 3rd through 6thgraders|url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|publisher=The New Jersey State Bar Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204030526/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, the competition has a different format which focuses more on presentation skills. All teams are given the same case which has been written prior to the competition and students are asked to perform role-playing on the case. ''North Carolina Elementary School Mock Trial Competition'' uses the winning entries from New Jersey Law Fair in the prior year as the cases for students to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Elementary School Mock Trial Competition|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|publisher=North Carolina Bar Association|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180514/http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|archive-date=28 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another format is to follow the standard format similar to the high school level but with less technical restriction. All teams are given the same material related to a case and prepare for the competition. Two teams compete in a live mock trial to represent two sides of the case. This format is used in the ''New Hampshire Bar Association's Mock Trial Competition''. However, the first round of the competition is done by video submission where each team performs in both sides of the case. The qualified teams will be invited to the live competition with each team on each side of the case.&lt;ref name="nh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition Handbook|url=http://www.nhbar.org/uploads/pdf/LRE-MT-CompetitionHandbook.pdf|publisher=New Hampshire Bar Association’s Law-Related Education Program|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Middle school=====
Although there is no national competition for middle/junior high school level, there are many intrastate competitions held by state/county level organizers:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; With the exception of New Jersey, all competitions have similar format as in high school competitions with some rules relaxed. In New Jersey, the format is similar to the ''New Jersey Law Fair'' at the elementary school level with two specific themes that the teams can choose to develop their cases.

=====High school=====
The mock trial program was started to allow high school students to experience the courtroom in a hands-on role. The mock trials are set up and structured just like a real court, bound by the same rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Mock Trial Education |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can help the students to know exactly what role each of the different people in a court (judges, lawyers, witnesses, etc.) do in the judicial system. High school competitions are even held in functional court rooms in the local City Hall to lend additional authenticity to the trial. Cases typically have to do with problems faced by teens, and will usually involve teenagers as witnesses. Each year the case for pre-Nationals competitions alternates between a [[Civil case]] and a [[Criminal case]].

[[File:Mock trial team - Benet Academy.JPG|right|thumb|A high school mock trial team in [[Illinois]]]]
The [[National High School Mock Trial Championship]] started in 1984.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This first competition consisted of teams from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; The competition since has grown and now is considered to be an All-State tournament. Each year, various participating states around the country take turns hosting the tournament. The 2011 Championship was held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]  hosted in 2012, [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] hosted in 2013, [[Madison, Wisconsin]] hosted in 2014, and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] is hosting in 2015. New York State does not participate in the national competition; rather, it has its own intrastate competition consisting of over 350 teams throughout the state. It follows similar rules to that of the national competition. New York has three levels of play, county competition, regional competition, and the finals, which is held in [[Albany, New York]] in May. The state of Maryland also does not compete in the National High School tournament, and thus has their own [[Maryland High School Mock Trial Competition|statewide mock trial competition]] similar to that of New York. New Jersey and North Carolina both pulled out of the NHSMTC competition following the 2005 season due to a refusal by the organization to accommodate an Orthodox Jewish team, Torah Academy of Bergen County, that had won New Jersey's state championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm |accessdate=October 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states rejoined in 2010 after their concerns regarding accommodation had been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/about/history-and-winners/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has its own case every year that is different from the national case. This means that the winners of the state competitions, who move on to nationals, must study and prepare a completely different case in time for the National High School Mock Trial Competition in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Law-related Education: Mock Trial main |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national competition is governed by National Mock Trial Championship, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmocktrial.org |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship, Inc |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====College=====
Inter-collegiate mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association or AMTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegemocktrial.org |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization was founded in 1985 by Dean Richard Calkins of Drake Law School and serves as a regulator of mock trial competition at the collegiate level.  AMTA sponsors regional and national-level competitions, writes and distributes case packets and rules, and keeps a registry of mock trial competitors and alumni.&lt;ref name="cooke1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooke |first=Jason |title=American Mock Trial Association |url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222093720/http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |archivedate=2012-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case packet is generally written and distributed prior to the scholastic year in August, and case changes are made throughout the season, usually in September, December, and finally in February after Regional competitions and prior to the Opening Round of Championships. Approximately 600 teams from over 350 universities and colleges will compete in AMTA tournaments.  In total, AMTA provides a forum for over 5,300 undergraduate students each academic year to engage in intercollegiate mock trial competitions across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/|title=History of AMTA|publisher=American Mock Trial Association|accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the inter-collegiate circuit, a mock trial team consists of three attorneys and three witnesses on each side of the case (plaintiff/prosecution and defense). The attorneys are responsible for delivering an opening statement, conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses and delivering closing arguments. Witnesses are selected in a [[draft (sports)|sports draft]] format from a pool of approximately eight to 10 available witnesses prior to the round. Typical draft orders are DPDPDP, PPPDDD, or DDPPPD but this may vary substantially between cases. Witnesses may be available only to the plaintiff/prosecution, only to the defense, or to both sides of the case. Witnesses consist of both experts as well as lay witnesses. Judges are usually attorneys or coaches, and in some occasions, practicing judges.

All collegiate mock trial cases take place in the fictional state of Midlands, USA.  Midlands is not geographically situated and falls under the protection of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="cooke1"/&gt;

======Tournament competition======
A tournament consists of four rounds, two on each side of the case, typically scored by two to three judges in each round.  The season runs in two parts: the invitational season and the regular season. Invitational tournaments are held throughout the fall semester and into early spring across the country.  At invitationals, teams have the opportunity to test out particular case theories and improve as competitors before facing the challenge and pressure of regular season competition.

The regular season begins in late January, starting with regional tournaments. There are typically more than 600 teams spread across 24 regional tournaments. Each school is limited to two post-regional bids to the "Opening Round Championship Series." Though there were once direct bids from Regionals to the National Championship Tournament, these bids no longer exist. 192 teams advance to the Opening Round Championship, which is held at eight different tournament sites. The top teams at each Opening Round Championship Tournament qualify for a berth in the National Championship Tournament. There are 48 total bids to the final tournament.

For 22 years, the National Championship Tournament was held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the city in which collegiate mock trial began. The tournament left Iowa for the first time in 2007 when [[Stetson University]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] hosted the Championship. The 2008 National Championship Tournament was held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Between 2009-2011, the Championship returned to Des Moines in odd-numbered years, while even-numbered years featured a different venue. The 2010 Championship was hosted by [[Rhodes College]] at courthouses in downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee]], while the 2012 Championship was held in Minneapolis.  Beginning in 2013, future Championships will be awarded solely on a competitive bidding process, although Des Moines, if it bids, will be given preference during "landmark" years, such as anniversaries of AMTA's founding in 1985.  The 2013 Championship was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] with the [[University of Virginia]] handling hosting duties.  The 2014 Championship was held in [[Orlando, Florida]] at the [[Orange County Courthouse (Florida)|Orange County Courthouse]], with the [[University of Central Florida]] serving as the host institution. The 2015 Championship was hosted by the [[University of Cincinnati]], with trials held at the [[Hamilton County Courthouse (Ohio)|Hamilton County Courthouse]] in [[Cincinnati]]. The 2016 Championship was hosted by Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2017, the Championship tournament will be hosted by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] (Stanley Mosk Courthouse) in downtown LA.

======Past championship results======
In 2006, the University of Virginia beat Harvard University to win the National Championship.&lt;ref name="cav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |title=Mock Trial team wins national championship |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=The Cavalier Daily |year=2006 |author=Jacqueline Minneman, Cavalier Daily Associate Editor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310182406/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was the closest final round in AMTA history, the University of Virginia won the championship by a single point using a tiebreaker, after a three judge panel split with one judge choosing Virginia as the winner, one choosing Harvard, and one calling the round a draw. The University of Virginia's victory ended the then-recent run by UCLA, which had won the two previous national championships.

In 2007, the University of Virginia again defeated Harvard University. This marked the first ever re-match of a previous year's final round. Virginia again won via a split decision, winning two of the three ballots in the final round. Virginia also became the 4th school to repeat as champions, joining UCLA, the University of Iowa, and Rhodes College, which accomplished the feat twice. Harvard University became the second program to finish as runner up in consecutive years, joining the University of Maryland, College Park. Maryland, however, had the distinction of losing to themselves in one of those two defeats.

In 2008, the University of Maryland prevailed over the George Washington University in a split-ballot decision (2-1). This was Maryland's fifth title, giving them more total wins than any other university in AMTA history.

In 2009, Northwood University defeated George Washington University 5-0 to claim its first National Championship.

In 2010, New York University defeated Harvard University 3-1-1 to win its first National Championship. This was Harvard's third championship round appearance in the last five years following its consecutive losses to Virginia.

In 2011, UCLA defeated defending champion New York University 4-1 to claim the Bruins' third title, the third-most in the history of the American Mock Trial Association.

In 2012, Duke defeated Rutgers 2-1, in what was the first championship round appearance for both squads.

In 2013, Florida State University defeated Rhodes College in FSU's first championship round appearance by a 4-1 ballot decision. This was Rhodes' eighth championship round appearance to date.  2013 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 3 scoring judges per round (instead of 2).

In 2014, UCLA defeated Princeton University in a 3-2 ballot decision.  With this victory, UCLA tied Rhodes for the second-highest record of championships (4 wins), behind University of Maryland, College Park (5 wins).  This round was also Princeton's first championship round appearance.

In 2015, Harvard defeated Yale in a 4-0-1 ballot decision.  This marked Harvard's first championship win, despite having been the runner-up 3 times previously (in 2006, 2007, and 2010).  2015 also marked Yale's first championship round appearance.  Finally, 2015 marked the first year that the case problem for the National Championship Tournament was different from the case schools had been using in competition for the earlier elimination rounds.  (I.e. In the past colleges had argued the same case all year long, but starting in 2015 any team that qualified for the championship tournament was given a brand new case to learn and argue in the span of just a few weeks.)

In 2016, Yale won its first national championship in an 11-3-1 ballot decision, defeating the University of Virginia in the final trial. Yale is one of only nine schools to have competed in the final trial of the National Championship Tournament two years in a row.  2016 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 5 scoring judges per round, and 15 scoring judges in the final championship round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/national-championship-trial-results/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Virginia defeated Yale in a 6-1 ballot decision in a rematch of the 2016 final. Yale's appearance marked the first time in collegiate championship history the same school has appeared three consecutive times in the final championship round.

In 2018, Miami University of Ohio defeated Yale in a 4-3 ballot decision. This was Miami's second championship, the first having been in 2001. Yale extended its record of consecutive championship round appearances to 4, having been the champion in 2016 and the runner-up in 2017 and 2015.

* From 1992 until 2010, the "Maryland Rule" was in effect, which placed both teams from the same school in the same division in order to ensure there wouldn't be another championship round between two teams from the same school. The Maryland Rule was repealed before the 2010-11 season.

======Forums and social media======
Beyond merely competitive interactions, collegiate mock trial has established a presence in cyberspace. Some mock trial teams have created forums for themselves on [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Stanford Mock Trial|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/2200023395/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Miami Mock Trial|url=http://www.facebook.com/groups/2200142332/?ref=ts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoofs of characters from various cases have even made their way onto Facebook with their very own profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Joey Davis|url=https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001739776485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Brett Miller|url=http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001742140118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the American Mock Trial Association has a [[Twitter]] feed which provides updates on procedures and tournament results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter:  College Mock Trial @AMTAMockTrial|url=https://twitter.com/amtamocktrial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable presence of collegiate mock trial on the internet is Perjuries [http://www.perjuries.com], the national online mock trial community. On Perjuries, mock trial competitors, coaches, and alumni can create user accounts and post in a wide range of forums about mock trial and mock trial related issues.  Here, participants can discuss everything from case strategy to incidents in competition that they found humorous.  Furthermore, Perjuries provides a space for competitors to post tournament results and rank their competition.  The site is wildly popular boasting over 5,000 registered users, 2,000 discussions, and nearly 88,000 posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perjuries.com|url=http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|access-date=2012-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307045832/http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|archive-date=2012-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Law school=====
In the United States, law schools participate in interscholastic mock trial/trial advocacy. Teams typically consist of several "attorneys" and several "witnesses" on each side. A round consists of two law students acting as "attorneys" for each side.

The trial typically, although not always, begins with motions in limine and housekeeping matters, then moves through opening statements, witness testimony (both direct examination and cross examination), and finishes with a closing argument, sometimes called a summation. Throughout the trial, rules of evidence apply, typically the Federal Rules of Evidence, and objections are made applying these rules.

Every team in a tournament is given the same "problem" or "case", typically several months in advance, but for some tournaments only a few weeks ahead of the tournament's start. The problems can be criminal or civil, which affects many procedural aspects of the trial, for instance the increased rights of a criminal defendant not to testify against himself. The cases are written in an attempt to create an equal chance of either side prevailing, since the main objective is not to identify the winner of the case, but rather the team with superior advocacy skills.

Occasionally the winners of mock trial tournaments receive special awards such as money or invitations to special events, but the status of winning a tournament is significant in and of itself.

In addition, a university may require a mock trial course or courses as a requirement for graduation; among such universities is [[Baylor Law School]], whose third-year Practice Court courses are mandatory for all students and have been since the school's reopening in the 1920s.

==In fiction==
* In an episode of the American television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', a once-famed attorney and current law professor named G. Stanley Lazer claims that he [[acquittal|could reverse Richard Kimble's criminal conviction]] if the case went back to trial. To Kimble's chagrin, Lazer decides to prove his theory by conducting a mock trial with his students playing the prosecutor, defense lawyer, and jury in front of a live TV audience.
* In an episode of the American television show "[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]", Mike Ross, an employee of one of New York's top law firms, goes head-to-head with one of his co-workers in a mock trial.
* In the American television series ''[[Shark (U.S. TV series)|Shark]]'', the protagonist had a room on his house specially designed like a courtroom to make Mock trials before important cases. It was used in a couple of episodes.
* In the [[The Good Wife (season 1)|season 1 episode]] "Mock" of the American television show ''[[The Good Wife]]'', Will Gardner, a partner at Lockhart Gardner, presides as a judge over a law school mock trial. Additionally, in the [[The Good Wife (season 4)|season 4 episode]] "Red Team, Blue Team", Alicia and Cary, employees of Lockhart &amp; Gardner, go head-to-head with their co-workers, Will and Diane, in a mock trial. [[The Good Wife (season 6)|Season 6 episode]] "Loser Edit" also featured a mock trial involving Diane as a prosecutor.
* In an episode of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', [[Judge Reinhold]] has a [[Court show|courtroom TV show]] called [[Mock Trial with J. Reinhold]], in which he is a fake [[Judge]] and the Bluth family uses it as a trial run for their legal defense against the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]].
*In [[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies]] (Gyakuten Saiban 5 in [[Japan]]), there is a case called "Turnabout Academy" in which a mock trial ends up becoming an actual trial. The teacher that decided which script was going to be used for the mock trial was found dead after the mock trial. Juniper Woods was accused of murdering her teacher, but her friend, Athena Cykes, decided to defend her old friend in court.

'''Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database (MMPND)''' is a multilingual database of names of taxa of plants.

It is located at the University of Melbourne and it is managed and maintained by Michel H. Porcher. This database includes the names of taxa of more than 900 genera of higher plants (not counting mushrooms). In addition to the scientific name and synonyms, it contains the names of the taxa in 82 major languages (its website says it includes 70 languages) in which 40 languages or dialects more are included).

MMPND is mentioned in many taxa of [[Germplasm Resources Information Network|GRIN-Global (Germplasm Resources Information Network)]], “References” as a: Porcher, M. H. et al. Searchable World Wide Web Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database (MMPND) (on-line resource).

Regarding the aims of MMPND, the following is said:“[...]the intention is to cover as many useful plants as possible. What is useful in one part of the world however can be a weed, even a noxious weed, in another. Our political stand is that, whether it is a selection or a species, if it is declared useful by some people, provided that we can get a minimum of information about it and that we can handle the data, it is in. We basically foresee 8 categories of plants. In order of decreasing importance we will consider: Vegetables, Cereals, Fruits, Mushrooms / Fungi, Herbs, Pasture / Fodder Crops, Medicinal plants, and what may be termed "Utilitarian crops" such as fibre, oil crops, stimulants etc. We feel that in the last fifty years the first 3 categories have been attracting far too little attention from taxonomists, especially below the species level. These three groups of edible plants include all the world staple foods and their related cultivars and selections. These have been bred and improved over centuries. They are the basic ingredients of the world ethnic cuisines[...]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/new/Sorting/Admin.html|title=MMPND, Aims|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first objective was to focus on useful plants, the cultivated ones, but the database currently contains the names of plants of economic importance as well as names of savage plants. For each genus,the last updating is indicated.

These multilingual names are presented by genera, as follows:

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

'''Nikkur''' is the process of making an animal kosher by removing [[chelev]] (forbidden fats) and the [[gid hanasheh]] (sciatic nerve).&lt;ref name=Zivotofsky&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/whats-the-truth-about-nikkur-achoraim/|title=What’s the Truth about Nikkur Achoraim?|author=Zivotofsky, Ari Z.|year=2007|website=OUKosher.org|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for this practice is Leviticus 7:23, "You shall not eat of any fatty suet, whether from cattle, sheep, or goats."

It is much easier to perform ''nikkur'' on the front part of the animal. It is also easier to perform on non-domestic animals such as deer as the chelev does not need to be removed from such animals.

Since it is difficult to perform ''nikkur'' on the hind part of domestic animals, the entire hind part is usually sold to the non-Jewish market in [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish communities. However, among [[Yemenite Jews]], ''nikkur'' on the hind part of the animal is still practised. This tradition goes back for centuries.&lt;ref name=Zivotofsky/&gt; While many Muslims today (e.g. in the Middle East) do accept food from [[people of the book]] based on the Quranic precept, not all Muslim communities accept Kosher-slaughtered meat, including those hindquarters, as [[halal]]; communities that do not accept it include many [[Indian Muslims|on the Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halalpak.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=1 HalalPAK comparison between halal and kosher] {{Dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in countries like Israel, specially trained men are hired to prepare the hindquarters for sale as kosher.

==Translated texts on ''Nikkur''==
The following document (click to open), translated here from the original Hebrew, has been the basis for ritual slaughterers in Yemen when excising the fatty tissue ([[suet]]) known as "chelev" from the butchered animal, in accordance with a biblical injunction in Leviticus 3:3–4.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Saadi, Yemenite Jewish manuscript, early eighteenth century, Yemen (with Hebrew original). Printed in: ''Pisqei Maharitz'', vol. 6 (ed. Yitzhak Ratzaby), Benei Barak 1993, pp. 495–524. Printed also by Avihai Yitzhak in: ''Yemenite Jewish Tradition with Animals'' ('''מסורת יהודי תימן בבהמה'''), Zichron Yaakov 2011, pp. 185–188; as also printed by Yehuda Levi Nahum in: ''Mikhmanim miḥasifath ginzei teiman'' ('''מכמנים מחשיפת גנזי תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1990, pp. 220–221; and by Rabbi Shelomo Mahfud, in: ''Yad Shelomo'' ('''יד שלמה'''), Benei Barak 2012, pp. 325–335.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Hilchot Nikkur'''&lt;/big&gt; (the excision of fatty tissue known as "suet" from the slaughtered animal) - by Rabbi Yehuda Sa'adi{{efn|name=a}} 
[[File:Ruminant Stomach.jpg|thumb|A diagram showing the four ruminant stomachs (Click to Enlarge)]]
Insomuch that I have seen in this, our orphaned generation, all of us groping like blind men to find{{efn|name=b}} the suet and its [appointed] places, and its [required] removal by excision, [not knowing] which of these [places] are to be judged strictly, and which of them are to be judged leniently; as also the [required] removal of the [[Gid hanasheh|sinew]] [of the two hind legs],{{efn|name=c}} and the membranes,{{efn|name=d}} as also the "threads" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which are forbidden under the category of "[[Chelev|suet]]," my heart has, [therefore], taken it upon itself to write what I have known about them, perchance those seeing my writing will give answer and show me the way of truth, and cause me to understand where I may have erred.

All of the exponents of our laws whom I have known agree to [this] one opinion, that there are three fatty tissues (suet) which, [by eating], men would become liable to extirpation, and they are that which men offer to God [upon the altar]. They are the suet which lies upon the innards,{{efn|name=e}} and the suet (fat) which is upon the [[kidneys]], and the suet which is upon the [[Flank (anatomy)|flanks]]. The suet which is upon the innards is that which is spread as a blanket over the inner [[Rumen|ruminant stomach]] (Heb. ''Kores''), which includes that which is upon the [[omasum]] (Heb. ''Messos'') and the [[reticulum]] (Heb. ''Beith Hakossoth''). That which is upon the kidneys is as it is implied, whose place is known; while that which is upon the flanks is that which is below the kidneys towards the hind side of the animal, attached to the fat of the kidneys, and which is [called in Aramaic] ''Tarba de-Aqlivusta'',{{efn|name=f}} where the joint of the hind legs (Aramaic: ''Deleifan Atmatha'') is located, and which is the suet at the root of the thighs from within. Thus is it written by [[Maimonides]], and by Rabbi [[Yitzhak Alfasi]], as also the author of ''[[Halachot Gedolot]]''. Included in this [category] is the suet which [clings] to its side, spreading itself upon the [[Flank (anatomy)|flanks]] at both sides of the animal.

As for the meaning of "Aqlivusta," [[Rashi]] has explained{{efn|name=g}} [it as being] the small bone lying on that bone which, [in French], is called ''hanche'' (haunch or hip), and [which is] connected to the [[Tail vertebrae|vertebrae of the tail]] [of the sheep]. But Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi explained [it as] that bone which holds fast all the [other] bones, while the ''[[Kol Bo]]'' has written Rashi's explanation under his name. Yet, the  [book known as] ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Gadol|Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot]]'' (''Hasemag'') has written [under] the prohibitive command # 138, ''Tarba de-Aqlivusta'': Rashi has explained the ''Qaliboseth'' (i.e. tail bone) as being  the small bone lying on that bone which is called [in French] ''hanche'' (haunch or hip), and [which is] connected to the vertebrae of the tail [of the sheep] from above, upon which there is suet beneath the loin, and which is among that suet found on the flanks.
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Regions of a vertebral column.jpg|thumb|Regions of vertebral column in ruminants (Click to Enlarge)]]
Now these are the words used by Rabbi A. of Meitze: "Near the tail can be found the [edible] fat of the [[Fat-tailed sheep|sheep's tail]], upon which is the suet of the ''Qaliboseth'' (i.e. tail bone), and that same suet and [edible] fat of the sheep's tail cling one to another, etc." But in [the book] ''Sheiltot'' of Rabbi [[Ahai Gaon]], and in [the book] ''Halachot Gedolot'', they have written: "The suet which is upon the flanks is the suet of the ''Qaliboseth'' (i.e. tail bone), where the hind legs attach themselves." Likewise has Maimonides, of blessed memory, written: "[It is] the suet which is at the joints of the hind legs from within." Yet, in [the book] ''Sefer Hazikkaron'',{{efn|name=h}} he explained ''Tarba de-Aqlivusta'' as the place where the thighs are attached, etc., while in an Arabic commentary on the laws governing Ritual Slaughter [we find] that ''Qaliboseth'' [means] "''al-falakh''."{{efn|name=i}}

Now what we have received as being the way to surgically remove all fatty tissue [is as follows]: After undressing the animal, they tear away the outer ruminant stomach from the hind legs unto the chest-wall cavity, and they take out the inner stomach, and remove, in its entirety, the blanket-like covering [of suet] which is spread out over it. And they take special precautions over the thin [layer of] [[Chelev|suet]] which is connected to the large intestines, which is at the end of [that place called], the "coils of the [[ileum]]" (Heb. ''Hadar Hakanoh''), near the place where he excretes excrement, [and] which, on the one side, the "suet of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|innards]]"{{efn|name=j}} is attached, while on the other side, the fat of the ''kanoh'' ([[ileum]]).{{efn|name=k}} That suet which lies next to it is the suet of the small intestines, which is prohibited according to the ''[[Geonim]]'', of blessed memory. They take precaution, likewise, over that side which clings somewhat unto the ileum (Heb. ''Senei Dhebei'' = "hatred of wolves"), surgically removing all of it thoroughly. They also take precaution to remove all of the suet that is found upon the [[abomasum]]{{efn|name=l}} (Heb. ''Kevah'') externally, which is known as the ''ḥūmṣā'',{{efn|name=m}} until nothing remains of it. Moreover, they take away the suet which is inside the abomasum, from within, which distinctively adheres itself to the abomasum. Yet, that which is not spread out like a blanket is that which is permitted, it being that which is ritually clean, and it is called ''bar ḥūmṣā''.{{efn|name=n}} Now that which is spread over the [[omasum]] (Heb. ''Messos'') [and the reticulum] like a blanket is forbidden, which is an even layer of fat covered with a membrane and easily peeled, and which happens to be included among the "suet which lies upon the innards."{{efn|name=j}} Now they scrape away [all suet] from the intestine which comes out of the abomasum (the fourth ruminant stomach) for the space of about a cubit (ca. 54 cm.),{{efn|name=o}} it also being the suet of the [[small intestines]] which is prohibited according to [Maimonides], (Nachmanides){{efn|name=p}} and Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, seeing that it is a close neighbour to the suet which lies upon the innards. Afterwards, they take out all of the entrails ([[intestines]]), and the inner [[Rumen|ruminant stomach]] (Heb. ''Kores''), as well as the liver, aside from the [[mesentery]] (Heb. ''Ḥalūḥelet''),{{efn|name=q}} for he still needs to clean it from the suet which is upon it. Afterwards, they peel away all of that lining membrane which is upon the flanks, which is forbidden on account of suet. They are scrupulous about its removal that nothing remains of it. The beginning of its place is from where there is the white [tissue] which is in the centre of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] (Heb. ''Tarfash'') [which divides the [[digestive organs]] from the [[respiratory organs]]],{{efn|name=r}} extending downwards unto the thighs [of the hind legs and] running width-wise along all the flanks, unto the [[spinal column]] (vertebrae). They remove it (i.e. the lining membrane) with the suet that lies upon it which is situate at the end of the thighs and which lies upon that flesh which is beneath the [[loins]], which is called "''lonbel''"{{efn|name=s}} in the foreign, [French] language and ''mutemaziqah''{{efn|name=t}} in Arabic. Now this suet is categorically included among the suet which lies upon the flanks. 
[[File:Ruminant digestive tract.jpg|thumb|Ruminant's digestive tract (Click to Enlarge)]]
Afterwards, they pull out the five "threads" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are upon the flanks,{{efn|name=u}} these being three on the right side and two on the left. The three on the right side, each one branches off into two separate [veins], while the two ["threads"] on the left side, each one of them branches off into three separate [veins],{{efn|name=v}} while one of its heads is attached to the spinal column, and they are called the "threads (nerves) that are in the hip,"{{efn|name=w}} the "threads of the walls [of the chest],"{{efn|name=x}} and the "threads that are upon the flanks," their prohibition being on account of suet. Now if they are pulled off while they are still warm, they can be pulled off altogether. However, if they have become cold, they can no longer be pulled off, and one must then poke around after them. Afterwards, they rend with a knife the thin membrane that is conspicuously located upon the two sides of the [[spinal column]], beneath the loins and extending as far as the ribs. It is the place that appears to the eyesight as a whitish colour by the light of the sun or by the light of a candle from the hind side of the animal, and which can be seen on its inside, and where there is no flesh that lies upon it. After the membrane has been rent, they remove the [forbidden] fat (suet) that is beneath it, extending down as far as the [edible] fat that lies beneath that same suet, it being that which divides between the hide of the animal and the said suet, and it is permitted. Now he removes this suet from [the two sides of]{{efn|name=y}} the spinal column, its length extending from beneath the loins all the way up to the ribs; while its breadth extending [outwards] until it becomes covered over in flesh, and once it has been covered over in flesh, [it is permitted].{{efn|name=z}} They scrape away the suet that is upon the spinal column from within, where lies the flesh of the loins which is called [in Arabic] ''mutemaziqah'', and they excise [the fatty tissue from] the ''mutemaziqah'', [surgically removing] all of the [forbidden] fat (suet) that lies upon it externally. Then they dislodge the fat of the [[kidneys]] from the place of its attachment on the spine, above the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] (Heb. ''Tarfash'') [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs],{{efn|name=aa}} towards the side of the animal's loins, surgically removing all suet beneath it, or else they remove the central bone of the spinal column entirely. Afterwards, he opens up the [pelvic] bone that joins together the two thighs, [separating the two thighs], taking out all fat that is within it [and which] lies over the fat of the kidneys, it being the [forbidden] "[[Chelev|fat]] that is upon the flanks," or what is also called [in Aramaic] ''Tarba de-Aqlivusta''.  They surgically remove it up to the place where the tail begins in large domesticated animals, but in sheep they continue to scrape away the outer part of the [[Fat-tailed sheep|fatty tail]] (rump) towards its inner side which knocks upon the thighs, with the fat of the kidneys and the flanks, all that which is high up at the top of the fatty tail (rump), at the place where it excretes excrement, extending as far as the bones of the fatty tail (rump). Now beneath it there is a marked difference in the thin membrane between the said suet and the suet in the fatty tail, as well as between the "threads" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which draw nourishment from the fat of the kidneys and the flanks. Now they scrape away all the fat (suet) which is between the sinews (Heb. ''Peqoqeloth'') [in the loins],{{efn|name=ab}} which in Arabic is [known as] ''al-falakh'' ([[Coccyx]]), along with the "threads (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that enter inside the [[Foramen|perforations]] in the bones which join together the loins of the animal above, wherein ends the [[spinal cord]]. He then dismembers the thighs, each one individually, and opens up each one from its flesh on that side where the hide is attached, until the [[Gid hanasheh|displaced tendon]] (Heb. ''Gid Hanasheh'') can be seen which is on the hollow of the thigh, removing it and digging up after it in all the flesh of the thighs. Now on [that part of] the [hollow of the] thigh which is called [in Arabic] ''mukheh'', [it requires removing the tendon] from without and from within, and on the [[Calf (leg)|calf [of leg]]] which is called [in Arabic] ''sā‘ed'', [it requires removing the tendon] from without and from within, and on the flesh which is upon it, which grows from the bunch of converging sinews [in the calf] (Heb. ''Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm''),{{efn|name=ac}} called [in Arabic] ''suqleh'', with all of the fat of the tendon, in every place where it is to be found. Now there are found on the two sides of the [hollow of the] thigh which is called [in Arabic] ''mukheh'' and in its socket [what are known as] stems (Heb. ''Qenuqenoth''),{{efn|name=ad}} as well as the [[fat]] (Heb. ''Shoman'') of the displaced tendon, [both] being virtually impossible to clean them very well. Therefore, let him remove them and cast them away.{{efn|name=ae}} Now there are in the calf, underneath its flesh, three small tendons, they being of the displaced tendon. Therefore, let him open up the flesh and remove them. And as for the [[spleen]], let him peel away the membrane which is upon it, and pull away the "threads" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are inside of it which are three, their prohibition being on account of suet, and one is required to dig-up after them.{{efn|name=af}} The inner [[Rumen|ruminant stomach]] (Heb. ''Kores''), the [[omasum]] (Heb. ''Messos'') and the [[reticulum]] (Heb. ''Beith Hakossoth''), (as well as the rump of sheep),{{efn|name=ag}} require being cleaned of all suet that clings to them. The membrane which is upon the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] (Heb. ''Tarfash'') [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs],{{efn|name=ah}} alongside the liver, is forbidden on account of [[Chelev|suet]], and that which is alongside the lung is customarily removed lest he who sees it becomes skeptical, although it is permitted. They [also] remove the lower membrane which is upon the kidneys, it being forbidden on account of suet, [as also the [[Tunica albuginea of testis|tunic membrane]] that envelope the [[testes]]]. As for the "threads" (i.e. veins and arteries) that are forbidden on account of blood, they do not have it as a practice in these countries to remove them,{{efn|name=ai}} seeing that they cut up the animal in several pieces.{{efn|name=aj}} Now may God deliver us from errors, and instruct his servants in the way of truth. Amen, may it even be His will.

דיני ניקור שחיבר הרב הגדול כמהר"ר יהודה בן כמהר"ר שלמה צעדי זצוק"ל וזה לשונו

לפי שראיתי בדורינו הדור היתום הזה, כולנו מגששים כעורים בהכרת החלבים ומקומותיהם וניקורם, ואיזה מהם החמור ואיזה מהם הקל. וניקור גיד הנשה והקרומות והחוטים, שאסורים משום חלב. מלאני לבי לכתוב מה שידעתי מהם, אולי הרואים כְתבי ישיבוני ויורוני דרך האמת, ומה ששגיתי יבינו לי

כל הפוסקים שידעתי מסכימים לדעת אחת, ששלשה חלבים שחייבים עליהם כרת, והם שקריבים לגבוה. והם חלב שעל הקרב, וחלב שעל הכליות, וחלב שעל הכסלים. חלב שעל הקרב, הוא הפרוש כשמלה על הכרס  הפנימי, ובכללו שעל המסוס ובית הכוסות. ושעל הכליות, כמשמעו, ומקומו ידוע. ושעל הכסלים, הוא שלמטה מן הכליות כלפי אחורי הבהמה, מחובר לחלב הכליות, והוא תרבא דאקליבוסתא. היכא דילפינן אטמתא מקום חיבור הירכיים, והוא החלב שבעיקרי היריכיים מבפנים, כ"כ הרמב"ם והרי"ף ובעל הלכות גדולות. ובכללו החלב שבצדו המתפשט על הכסלים משני צידי הבהמה

ופירוש אקליבוסתא, פירש רש"י עצם קטן מונח על עצם הנקרא הנק"א, ומחובר לחוליות האליה. והרי"ף פירש, אותו עצם המחבר העצמות. והכלבו כתב פירוש רש"י בשמו. וסמ"ג כ' לאוין קל"ח, תרבא דאקליבוסתא, פירש רש"י הקליבוסת שהוא עצם קטן ומונח על העצם הנקרא הנק"א, ומחובר לחוליות האליה מלמעלה, ועליו יש חלב תחת המותן, ומחלב שעל הכסלים הוא. וז"ל ר"א ממי"ץ, סמוך לזנב יש שומן האליה, ועליה יש חלב הקליבוסת, ואותו חלב ושומן האליה דבוקים זה בזה וכו'. ובשאלות דרב אחא ובעל ה"ג כתבו, חלב שעל הכסלים הוא חלב הקליבוסת, במקום שהיריכיים מתחברות. וכ"כ הרמב"ם ז"ל, חלב שבעיקרי היריכיים מבפנים. ובספר הזכרון פירש, תרבא דאקליבוסתא, מקום חיבור וכו'. ובפירוש הל' שחיטה בלשון ערבי, קליבוסת, אלפלך'

וסדר הניקור שקיבלנו, אחר שמפשיטין הבהמה, קורעין הַכרס החיצונה מבין היריכיים עד החזה, ומוציאים הכרס הפנימי, ומסירים שמלה הפרוסה עליו כולה. ונזהרים על החלב הדק המחובר במעי, שהוא סוף הדַּר הכּנָה הקרוב למוצא הרעי, שמצדו אחד מחובר חלב הקרב, ומצדו השני שומן הכנה. וזה החלב שמצדו, הוא חלב הדקין האסור לדעת הגאונים ז"ל. וכן נזהרים בצד הדבוק בקצת סיני דיבי ומנקרין הכל היטב. וכן נזהרים להסיר חלב שעל הקיבה מבחוץ, והוא חומצא, עד שלא ישאר ממנו שום דבר. ונוטלים חלב שבתוך הקיבה מבפנים המחובר לקיבה ממש. ושאינו פרוש כשמלה הוא המותר והוא הטהור, והוא הנקרא בר חומצא. והפרוס על המסוס (ובית הכוסות) כשמלה, אסור שהוא תותב קרום ונקלף, והוא מכלל חלב שעל הקרב. וגוררים מהמעי היוצא מהקיבה כמו אמה, וגם הוא חלב הדקין האסור לד' הרמב"ם (הרמב"ן) והרי"ף (וה"ג), מפני שהוא שכן לחלב שעל הקרב. ואח"כ מוציאים כל בני מעיים והכרס והכבד, חוץ מחלוחלת, שעדיין צריך לנקותה מחלב שעליה. ואח"כ קולפין כל הקרום שעל הכסלים שאסור משום חלב. ומדקדקים עליו שלא ישאר ממנו כלום. ותחלתו מהמקום הלבן שבאמצע הטרפש עד היריכיים לרוחב כל הכסלים עד השדרה. ומסירים אותו עם החלב שעליו שבסוף היריכיים, ועל הבשר שתחת המתניים הנקרא בלע"ז לונבי"ל, ובערבי מֻתמאזק"ה. וזה החלב, הוא מכלל חלב הכסלים. ואח"כ מושכים חמשה חוטים שבכסלים, שהם ג' מהימין ושנים מהשמאל. השלשה שמימין, מתפצלים לשנים שנים, והשנים שבשמאל, כל אחד מהם מתפצל לשלשה שלשה, וראשו האחד מחובר לשדרה, והם נקראים חוטי העוקץ וחוטי הדפנות וחוטי הכסלים ואיסורן משום חלב. ואם שולפן כשהם חמין, נשלפין כולם. ואם נתקררו, אינם נשלפים וצריך לחטט אחריהם. ואח"כ קורעים בסכין קרום דק שאצל השדרה ממש משני צדדיה, מתחת המתנים עד הצלעות. והוא המקום שייראה למראית העין כעין לבן לאור החמה או לאור הנר מאחורי הבהמה, ויראה מבפנים ועליו אין בשר. ואחר שקורע הקרום, נוטלים החלב שתחתיו עד השומן שתחת אותו חלב, והוא המפסיק בין עור הבהמה ובין זה החלב, והוא מותר. ונוטל זה החלב [משני צידי] השדרה, ארכו מתחת המתנים עד הצלעות. ורחבו עד שיתכסה בבשר, ומשנתכסה בבשר [מותר]. גוררים החלב שעל השדרה מבפנים אצל בשר המתנים הנקרא מתמאזק"ה, ומנקרין המתמאזק"ה מכל חלב שעליה מבחוץ. ועוקרין חלב הכליות ממקום חיבורו בשדרה מעל הטרפש לצד מתני הבהמה, ומנקרין תחתיו מכל חלב, או מסירין עצם השדרה האמצעי כולו. ואח"כ פותח העצם המחבר שני היריכיים ומוציא כל החלב שבתוכו על חלב הכליות, והוא חלב שעל הכסלים, והוא תרבא דאקליבוסתא. ומנקרין אותו עד תחלת הזנב בבהמה גסה, ובכבשים מוסיפין לגרור פני האליה כלפי פנים הנוקש על היריכות, עם חלב הכליות והכסלים כל הגבוה בראש האליה מקום מוצא הרעי, עד עצמות האליה. ולמטה ממנו יש הבדל בקרום דק בין זה החלב ובין חלב האליה, ובין החוטין היונקים מחלב הכליות והכסלים. וגוררין כל החלב שבין הפקוקלות, שהוא בערבי אלפלך', עם החוטים הנכנסים בנקבי העצמות המחברות מתני הבהמה מלמעלה שבהם כּוֹלֶה חוט השדרה, ומפריד היריכיים כל אחד לבדו. ופותח כל אחד מהבשר של צד העור, עד שייראה גיד הנשה שעל כף הירך, ונוטלו ומחטט אחריו בכל בשר היריכיים. ובירך הנקרא מוכ'ה מבחוץ ומבפנים. ובשוק הנקרא סאעד מבחוץ ומבפנים, ובבשר שעליו הגדל מִצּוּמּת הגידים הנקרא סוקלה, עם כל שומן הגיד בכל מקום שימצא. ויש משני צדי הירך הנקרא מוכ'ה ובכף שלה, קנוקנות (וראשי הקנוקנות נכנסים בראשי העצמות וצריך המנקר לשבור ראשי העצמות כדי להסיר הקנוקנות מעיקרם (ב"י), ואין ללמוד סדר הניקור רק במראית העין מן המומחה הבקי בניקור) ושומן גיד הנשה שאי אפשר לנקותם היטב. לכך יתירם וישליכם. ויש בשוק תחת בשרו ג' גידים קטנים, והם מגיד הנשה, לכך יפתח הבשר ויסירם. והטחול יקלוף כל הקרום שעליו וימשוך החוטים שבתוכו שהם ג' ואיסורם משום חלב. אם נמשכו, הרי טוב. ואם לאו, צריך לחטט אחריהם. והכרס והמסוס ובית הכוסות (והאליה) צריך לנקותם מכל החלב הדבוק בהם. והקרום שעל הטרפש מצד הכבד, אסור משום חלב. ומה שמצד הריאה, נהגו להסירו שמא יסתפק הרואה. אבל הוא מותר. ומסירים הקרום התחתון שעל הכליות והוא אסור משום חלב. והחוטים שאסורים משום דם, לא נהגו באלו הארצות לנטלם, מפני שמחתכין את הבהמה לכמה חתיכות.
(טבח שדרכו לנקר בשר ונמצא אחריו חוט או קרום, מלמדין אותו שלא יזלזל באיסורין. אבל אם נמצא אחריו חלב אם הוא כשעורה מעבירין אותו, ואם נמצא אחריו כזית ואפילו בהרבה מקומות מכין אותו מכת מרדות ומעבירין אותו.) וה' יצילנו משגיאות ויורה עבדיו דרך האמת אכי"ר

'''Notes:'''
{{notelist|notes=
{{efn|name=a|Perhaps the most profound authority on this subject in Yemen during the beginning of the 18th-century CE. He passed away in ''anno'' 1740 CE.}}
{{efn|name=b|Literally: "to recognise".}}
{{efn|name=c|The Torah (Genesis 32:32) teaches: "Therefore will the children of Israel not eat of the sinew which shrank ([[Gid hanasheh|displaced tendon]]), which is upon the cavity of the thigh, unto this very day." By way of an oral tradition, it has been passed down that the prohibition of eating the sinew or tendon applies to the two hind legs of the animal that is to be eaten. Even to this day, the Yemenite Jews who are expert in the removal of all hard, white fat, or suet (Heb. ''chelev''), found on the internal organs and hind parts of the slaughtered animal, abstain from eating these tendons by carefully having them removed. (Other communities forfeit the hind part altogether, choosing not to eat this part of the animal out of concern for their unintentional eating of ''chelev'', or thereby becoming liable to extirpation.) The tradition, however, still stands with a small minority. The sinew runs down the leg from the upper thigh bone, reaching as far as the feet. That which is required to be removed is actually all of the sinew (tendon) which is located on the upper thigh bone of both hind legs, as also the greater part of that which runs down the calf-muscle of both hind legs. It is a common practice among those expert in "nikkur" (the removal of fatty tissue) to poke around the tendon with a knife, removing all excessive fat (''chelev'') which he finds running parallel to the long sinew that is taken away. The commandment to remove the sinew applies to, both, domesticated animals and to wild animals, but it does not apply to birds.}}
{{efn|name=d|Such as the membrane that envelopes the omasum, the reticulum, the rumen and the abomasum, the thin membrane that envelopes the two kidneys, and the membrane that envelopes the spleen, etc.}}
{{efn|name=e|The reference here is to the [[Omentum majus|Greater]] and [[Omentum minus|Lesser Omentum]]. Cf. Leviticus 3:3 and 4:5, or what is known in layman's terms as "tallow."}}
{{efn|name=f|Literally meaning "the suet of the tail bone." See: Rashi's commentary in ''Hullin'' 93a.}}
{{efn|name=g|Babylonian Talmud, ''Hullin'' 93a.}}
{{efn|name=h|''Sefer ha-Zikkaron'' of Rabbi Ishmael Cohen Tanuji, on Tractate ''Hullin'', chapter seven.}}
{{efn|name=i|The fat of the [[coccyx]] at the lowest end of the vertebrae. (Cf. ''infra'', where our author says the "Peqoqeloth," or the ramification of sinews in the loins near the tail, is called in Arabic ''al-falakh''.)}}
{{efn|name=j|The phrase, "suet of the innards," or "inwards," is taken from Leviticus 3:3. The word "innards" is a generic word for the forbidden fat that is found in the animal's gastrointestinal tract, and which would include the fat on such organs as the [[rumen]] (first ruminant stomach), the [[omasum]] (third ruminant stomach), the [[reticulum]], the [[abomasum]] (fourth ruminant stomach), and the fat upon the small intestines, specifically the [[duodenum]]. The fat upon the innards is characteristic in that it is covered with a membrane which can be easily peeled off. Maimonides (''Hil. Maachalot Asurot'' 7:6), describing the forbidden fat of this part, writes that it is "on the stomach which is bent like a bow in shape, although whatsoever is like a cord extending outwards is permitted."}}
{{efn|name=k|This same organ corresponds with that organ which is also called "the Hatred of Wolves."}}
{{efn|name=l|i.e. the fourth stomach.}}
{{efn|name=m|See: Babylonian Talmud, ''Hullin'' 49b.}}
{{efn|name=n|See: Babylonian Talmud, ''Hullin'' 49b. The permitted fat, known as ''bar ḥūmṣā'', is a more limpid fat found on one side of the greater curvature of the [[abomasum]] (fourth ruminant stomach), whereas on the other side there is to be found the forbidden fat, known as ''ḥūmṣā'', and which is more brittle and whitish in nature.}}
{{efn|name=o|The reference here is to the [[duodenum]]. After food is broken down in the abomasum (the fourth ruminant stomach), it passes into the intestines. Before reaching the curly, small intestines, it passes through a long straight tube that is called in the language of the Talmud, "''reish ma'aya''," or "beginning of the intestines," and which same organ is known anatomically as the duodenum. The fat on the duodenum is primarily the edge of the [[greater omentum]], which is stretched under the stomachs and intestines and is attached to the duodenum on the animal's right side. The very beginning of the duodenum also has part of the lesser omentum attached to it. Any fat, or suet, beyond the first cubit is considered "fat of the curly intestine" and is permitted. (cf. Maimonides' ''Hil. Ma'achalot Asurot'' 7:9 and the ''Maggid Mishneh'' ibid).}}
{{efn|name=p|Our manuscript has been emended to read Maimonides instead of Nachmanides, seeing that the original document had inadvertently written Nachmanides instead of Maimonides.}}
{{efn|name=q|See: Babylonian Talmud, ''Hullin'' 50a. The mesentery is a membrane keeping the entrails in position.}}
{{efn|name=r|i.e. the [[midriff]] ([[Thoracic diaphragm]]).}}
{{efn|name=s|Old French word copied down in Rashi's commentary on ''Hullin'' 93a, having simply the meaning of "loin," or what is called in modern French, "lombe."}}
{{efn|name=t|Translated, this word means "the flesh of the loins," as well as a portion of the area around the backbone (spine).}}
{{efn|name=u|See: Babylonian Talmud, ''Hullin'' 93a.}}
{{efn|name=v|These blood vessels and nerves are only prohibited by a rabbinic prohibition, either because they pass through sections of the forbidden fat, or suet, or because they are blood vessels whose walls are saturated with blood.}}
{{efn|name=w|i.e. that branch out of the lower spinal column and extend into the flanks.}}
{{efn|name=x|Which wall encloses the lungs and the ribs.}}
{{efn|name=y|"[the two sides of]," so amends the text Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby of Benei Barak, based upon another manuscript written by Rabbi Yehuda Sa'adi.}}
{{efn|name=z|"[it is permitted]," so amends the text Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby of Benei Barak, based upon another manuscript written by Rabbi Yehuda Sa'adi, adding that the ''Tur'' has said in the name of Maimonides that there is a sign for detecting edible fat, namely, "any fat that is under the flesh and where the flesh completely enfolds it on all its sides until it can no longer be seen without tearing through the flesh, that fat is permitted."}}
{{efn|name=aa|i.e. the [[midriff]] ([[Thoracic diaphragm]]), the internal muscular partition that separates the chest (thoracic cavity) from the abdomen (abdominal cavity) in mammals.}}
{{efn|name=ab|See: [[Tosefta]] ''Hullin'' 9:14. The "Peqoqeloth," or "ramification of sinews," is the tissue which covers and connects the walls of the flank and muscles, the fat of which branches out between the sinews in the loins, and runs near the tail or rump of the sheep.}}
{{efn|name=ac|Cf. [[Mishnah]] ''Hullin'' 4:6. [[Maimonides]], in his Code of Jewish Law ([[Mishne Torah]], ''Hil. Sheḥiṭa'' 8:12 [13]) describes the ''Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm'' (lit. juncture of the tendons) as follows: “''Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm'' are situated in domesticated and wild animals above the [[heel]], in the place where butchers hang-up the animal [after its slaughter]. They are three white [[tendons]], one of which is thick, and the other two are thin. From the place where they commence, they are hard and white in colour, until the white disappears and they begin to appear a reddish colour and become softer to the touch, that is ''Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm'', and which is approximately the length of sixteen finger-breadths (ca. 36 cm.) in a bull.” Rabbi [[Eli Cashdan]] thinks that this description refers to [[Achilles Tendon]], the name given to the aggregated tendons in the distal part of the [[tibia]]. Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]], describes the ''Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm'' as follows ([[Shulhan Arukh]], ''Yoreh De'ah'' § 56:2–3): “''Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm'' in an animal are [tendons] found in the middle bone outward, whereon falls the tail. Others say they [are located more] inwards, in the direction of the  hollow part of the animal's [leg], etc.”}}
{{efn|name=ad|By "Qenuqenoth" are meant the thin sinews that run lengthwise along the hollow of the thigh, beneath the flesh, from the outer sinew to the inner sinew.}}
{{efn|name=ae|This entire section is worded differently in the printed edition of ''Hilchot Nikkur'' used by Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby. According to that version, here it is written: "Now there are found on the two sides of the thigh which is called "mukha" and in its socket [what are known as] stems (Heb. ''Qenuqenoth''), and the heads of the stems enter inside the nodules of the bones, requiring of him that surgically removes all fat to break the nodules of the bones in order to remove the stems from their root (''[[Beit Yosef (book)|Beit Yosef]]''). No one is permitted to learn the order of excision (Heb. ''Nikkur'') simply by way of passive eye inspection from an expert that is skilled in the excision of fatty tissue. [Along with the stems of the hollow of the thigh, one finds] the fat (Heb. ''Shoman'') of the displaced tendon, [both] being virtually impossible to clean them very well. Therefore, let him remove them and cast them away."}}
{{efn|name=af|In the version used by Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby, here it is worded:  "If they can be pulled-away, then well, but if not, one is required to dig-up after them."}}
{{efn|name=ag|So adds Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby in his printed edition of ''Hilchot Nikkur''.}}
{{efn|name=ah|i.e. the [[midriff]] ([[Thoracic diaphragm]]), the internal muscular partition that separates the chest (thoracic cavity) from the abdomen (abdominal cavity) in mammals.}}
{{efn|name=ai|The sense here is to the [[Tunica albuginea of testis|tunic membrane]] that envelopes the [[testes]] in male animals. This membrane is forbidden, not because of forbidden fat (suet), but because of the blood vessels that run through it. In Yemen, the custom was to cut in half each testicle following the animal's slaughter, without removing the tunic membrane. In this way, the blood drained from the veins running through the tunic membrane (Yosef Qafih, ''Halikhot Teman'' [Jewish Life in Sanà], Jerusalem 1982, p. 95). Other Jewish communities, however, did not cut the membrane, for which reason they entirely removed the membrane after the animal's slaughter.}}
{{efn|name=aj|In the version used by Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby, here it is added: "The ritual slaughterer who is used to surgically removing all fatty tissue from the flesh and there was found after him an artery or membrane, they teach him not to despise matters of prohibition. However, if there was found after him suet, if it were a barley's bulk [in size], they remove him [from his position so that he no longer acts as one who excises tissue]. Yet, if there were found after him an olive's bulk [in size], they flog him with the flogging meant for the rebellious, as do they remove him [from his position]."}}

The {{Nihongo|'''Noshiro Rocket Testing Center'''|能代ロケット実験場|Noshiro Roketto Jikkenjo}} is a facility of the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), located on the coast of the [[Sea of Japan]] in the city of [[Noshiro, Akita|Noshiro]] in [[Akita Prefecture]], [[Japan]].

==History==
The Noshiro Rocket Testing Center (NTC) was established in 1962 as one of the affiliated facilities of the Institute of Industrial Science of the [[University of Tokyo]], which became the [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] (ISAS) in 1964. The testing center was involved in the development and testing of [[sounding rocket]]s and the [[solid-fuel rocket]] engines which were used on the [[Mu (rocket)|Mu series]] of launch vehicles.

From 1975, the Noshiro Testing Center was involved in the research, development and testing of [[liquid-fuel rocket]] engines. With the [[M-V]] launch vehicle program, the facilities were extensively upgraded with a large solid motor air combustion test building and an upper motor high altitude performance test facility completed by 1992. The static firing test for the M-V rocket engines took place at Noshiro.

In addition, a successful static test firing of the [[ATREX]], an experimental precooled [[jet engine]] that works as a [[turbojet]] at low speeds and a [[ramjet]] up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 6.0 occurred in 1992. From 1998, the site has been active in the [[Reusable Vehicle Testing]] program to develop an air-breathing engine which uses less fuel than a rocket and can therefore transport a larger payload.

'''Purine metabolism''' refers to the [[metabolic pathway]]s to synthesize and break down [[purine]]s that are present in many organisms.

==Biosynthesis==
Purines are biologically synthesized as [[nucleotide]]s and in particular as ribotides, i.e. bases attached to [[ribose 5-phosphate]]. Both [[adenine]] and [[guanine]] are derived from the nucleotide [[Inosinic acid|inosine monophosphate]] (IMP), which is the first compound in the pathway to have a completely formed purine ring system.

===IMP===
[[Image:Nucleotides syn1.png|thumb|400px|&lt;div style="border-width: 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid black; text-align: left;"&gt;'''The synthesis of IMP'''.&lt;/div&gt;The color scheme is as follows: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;enzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(219,155,36);"&gt;coenzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(151,149,45);"&gt;substrate names&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(227,13,196);"&gt;metal ions&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(128,0,0);"&gt;inorganic molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;]]

Inosine monophosphate is synthesized on a pre-existing ribose-phosphate through a complex pathway (as shown in the figure on the right). The source of the [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] atoms of the purine ring, 5 and 4 respectively, come from multiple sources. The amino acid [[glycine]] contributes all its carbon (2) and nitrogen (1) atoms, with additional nitrogen atoms from glutamine (2) and [[aspartic acid]] (1), and additional carbon atoms from [[formyl group]]s (2), which are transferred from the [[coenzyme]] [[tetrahydrofolate]] as [[10-formyltetrahydrofolate]], and a carbon atom from [[bicarbonate]] (1). Formyl groups build carbon-2 and carbon-8 in the purine ring system, which are the ones acting as bridges between two nitrogen atoms.

A key regulatory step is the production of 5-phospho-α-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-ribosyl 1-pyrophosphate ([[PRPP]]) by ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase, which is activated by [[inorganic phosphate]] and inactivated by purine ribonucleotides. It is not the committed step to purine synthesis because PRPP is also used in pyrimidine synthesis and salvage pathways.

The first committed step is the reaction of PRPP, [[glutamine]] and water to [[5'-phosphoribosylamine]] (PRA), [[glutamate]], and [[pyrophosphate]] - catalyzed by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]], which is activated by PRPP and inhibited by [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], [[Guanosine monophosphate|GMP]] and [[Inosinic acid|IMP]].

PRPP + L-Glutamine + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → PRA + L-Glutamate + PPi

In the second step react [[Phosphoribosylamine|PRA]], [[glycine]] and ATP to create [[Glycineamide ribonucleotide|GAR]], ADP, and pyrophosphate - catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylamine—glycine ligase]] (GAR synthetase). Due to the chemical lability of PRA, which has a half-life of 38 seconds at PH 7.5 and 37&amp;nbsp;°C, researchers have suggested that the compound is channeled from amidophosphoribosyltransferase to GAR synthetase ''in vivo.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Substrate specificity of glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase from chicken liver|date = April 5, 1996|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|doi = 10.1074/jbc.271.14.8192|pmid = 8626510|access-date = |volume=271 |pages=8192–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRA + Glycine + ATP → GAR + ADP + Pi

The third is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase]].

GAR + [[10-Formyltetrahydrofolate|fTHF]] → [[Phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide|fGAR]] + [[Tetrahydrofolic acid|THF]]

The fourth is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase]].

fGAR + L-Glutamine + ATP → [[5'-Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine|fGAM]] + L-Glutamate + ADP + Pi

The fifth is catalyzed by [[AIR synthetase (FGAM cyclase)]].

fGAM + ATP → [[5-Aminoimidazole ribotide|AIR]] + ADP + Pi + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The sixth is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase]].

AIR + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[5'-Phosphoribosyl-4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole|CAIR]] + [[Proton|2H+]]

The seventh is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthase]].

CAIR + [[Aspartic acid|L-Aspartate]] + ATP → [[Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide|SAICAR]] + ADP + Pi

The eight is catalyzed by [[adenylosuccinate lyase]].

SAICAR → [[AICA ribonucleotide|AICAR]] + [[Fumaric acid|Fumarate]]

The products AICAR and fumarate move on to two different pathways. AICAR serves as the reactant for the ninth step, while fumarate is transported to the citric acid cycle which can then skip the carbon dioxide evolution steps to produce malate. The conversion of fumarate to malate is catalyzed by fumarase. In this way, fumarate connects purine synthesis to the citric acid cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914290655|title=Biochemistry|last=H.,|first=Garrett, Reginald|publisher=|others=Grisham, Charles M.,|year=|isbn=9781305577206|edition= Sixth|location=Boston, MA|pages=666 &amp; 934|oclc=914290655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth is catalyzed by [[phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase]].

AICAR + fTHF → [[5-Formamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide|FAICAR]] + THF

The last step is catalyzed by [[Inosine monophosphate synthase]].

FAICAR → IMP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In [[eukaryote]]s the second, third, and fifth step are catalyzed by [[trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3]], which is encoded by the GART gene.

Both ninth and tenth step are accomplished by a single protein named Bifunctional purine biosynthesis protein PURH, encoded by the ATIC gene.

===GMP===
* [[Inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase|IMP dehydrogenase]] (IMPDH) converts [[Inosine monophosphate|IMP]] into [[Xanthosine monophosphate|XMP]]
* [[GMP synthase]] converts XMP into [[guanine monophosphate|GMP]]
* [[GMP reductase]] converts GMP back into IMP

===AMP===
* [[adenylosuccinate synthase]] converts IMP to [[adenylosuccinate]]
* [[adenylosuccinate lyase]] converts adenylosuccinate into [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]]
* [[AMP deaminase]] converts AMP back into IMP

==Degradation==
Purines are metabolised by several [[enzyme]]s:

===Guanine===
* A [[nuclease]] frees the [[nucleotide]]
* A [[nucleotidase]] creates [[guanosine]]
* [[Purine nucleoside phosphorylase]] converts [[guanosine]] to [[guanine]]
* [[Guanase]] converts guanine to [[xanthine]]
* [[Xanthine oxidase]] (a form of xanthine oxidoreductase) catalyzes the [[oxidation]] of xanthine to [[uric acid]]

===Adenine===
* A [[nuclease]] frees the [[nucleotide]]
** A [[nucleotidase]] creates [[adenosine]], then [[adenosine deaminase]] creates [[inosine]]
** Alternatively, [[AMP deaminase]] creates [[inosinic acid]], then a [[nucleotidase]] creates [[inosine]]
* [[Purine nucleoside phosphorylase]] acts upon inosine to create [[hypoxanthine]]
* [[Xanthine oxidase]] catalyzes the biotransformation of hypoxanthine to xanthine
* [[Xanthine oxidase]] acts upon xanthine to create [[uric acid]]

===Regulations of purine nucleotide biosynthesis===
The reactions which is the formation of 5'-phosphoribosyalamine from glutamine and PRPP catalysed by PRPP amino transferase is the site point for purine synthesis.The enzyme is an allosteric enzyme, so it can be converted from IMP, GMP and AMP in high concentration binds the enzyme to exerts inhibition while PRPP is in large amount binds to the enzyme which causes activation  So IMP, GMP and AMP are inhibitors while PRPP is an activator. Between the formation of 5'-phosphoribosyl, aminoimidazole and IMP, there is no known regulation step.

==Salvage==
Purines from turnover of cellular nucleic acids (or from food) can also be salvaged and reused in new nucleotides.

* The enzyme [[adenine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (APRT) salvages [[adenine]]. 
* The enzyme [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (HGPRT) salvages [[guanine]] and [[hypoxanthine]].&lt;ref name="pmid26616453"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ansari MY, Equbal A, Dikhit MR, Mansuri R, Rana S, Ali V, Sahoo GC, Das P | title = Establishment of Correlation between In-Silico &amp;In-Vitro Test Analysis against [[Leishmania]] HGPRT to inhibitors | journal = International Journal of Biological Macromolecules | date = Nov 2015  | pmid = 26616453 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.051 | volume=83 | pages=78–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Genetic deficiency of HGPRT causes [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]].)

==Disorders==
When a defective gene causes gaps to appear in the metabolic recycling process for purines and pyrimidines, these chemicals are not metabolised properly, and adults or children can suffer from any one of twenty-eight hereditary disorders, possibly some more as yet unknown. Symptoms can include [[gout]], anaemia, epilepsy, delayed development, deafness, compulsive self-biting, kidney failure or stones, or loss of immunity.

Purine metabolism can have imbalances that can arise from harmful nucleotide triphosphosphates incorporating into DNA and RNA which further lead to genetic disturbances and mutations, and as a result, give rise to several types of diseases. Some of the diseases are:

1.    Severe Immunodeficiency by loss of adenosine deaminase.

2.    Hyperuricemia and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome by the loss of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.

3.    Different types of cancer by an increase in the activities of enzymes like IMP dehydrogenase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pang|first=Bo|last2=McFaline|first2=Jose L.|last3=Burgis|first3=Nicholas E.|last4=Dong|first4=Min|last5=Taghizadeh|first5=Koli|last6=Sullivan|first6=Matthew R.|last7=Elmquist|first7=C.

==Pharmacotherapy==
Modulation of purine metabolism has pharmacotherapeutic value.

''Purine synthesis inhibitors'' inhibit the proliferation of cells, especially [[leukocytes]].  These inhibitors include [[azathioprine]], an immunosuppressant used in [[organ transplant]]ation, [[autoimmune disease]] such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] or inflammatory bowel disease such as [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]].

[[Mycophenolate mofetil]] is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation; it inhibits purine synthesis by blocking inositol monophosphate dehydrogenase.
Also [[Methotrexate]] indirectly inhibits purine synthesis by blocking the metabolism of [[folic acid]] (it is an inhibitor of the [[dihydrofolate reductase]]).

[[Allopurinol]] is a drug that inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase and, thus, lowers the level of uric acid in the body. This may be useful in the treatment of gout, which is a disease caused by excess uric acid, forming crystals in joints.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}

In [[secular]] usage, '''religious education''' is the [[teaching]] of a particular [[religion]] (although in the United Kingdom the term ''religious instruction'' would refer to the teaching of a particular religion, with ''religious education'' referring to teaching about religions in general) and its varied aspects: its [[belief]]s, [[doctrine]]s, [[ritual]]s, [[Norm (sociology)|customs]], [[rite]]s, and personal roles. In [[Western culture|Western]] and secular culture, religious education implies a type of education which is largely separate from [[academia]], and which (generally) regards religious belief as a fundamental tenet and operating modality, as well as a prerequisite for attendance.

The secular concept is substantially different from societies that adhere to [[religious law]], wherein "religious education" connotes the dominant [[academic]] study, and in typically religious terms, teaches doctrines which define [[social custom]]s as "laws" and the violations thereof as "[[crimes]]", or else misdemeanors requiring [[punishment|punitive correction]].

The free choice of religious education by parents according to their conviction is protected by [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious education is controversial worldwide. Some countries, such as the United States, do not publicly fund religious education nor make it part of compulsory schooling. In other contexts, such as the United Kingdom, an 'open' religious education has emerged from Christian confessionalism that it is intended to promote religious literacy without imparting a particular religious perspective. This kind of religious education has drawn criticism because, it is argued, there is no neutral perspective from which to study religions and any kind of compulsory schooling is likely to impact on the formation of a student's religious identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniel|first=Moulin,|title=Doubts about Religious Education in public schooling|url=https://www.academia.edu/12861140/Doubts_about_Religious_Education_in_public_schooling|journal=International Journal of Christianity &amp;amp; Education|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|issn=2056-9971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
&lt;!-- Needs lots of work... --&gt;
Since people within a given country often hold varying religious and non-religious beliefs, government-sponsored religious education can be a source of conflict. Countries vary widely in whether religious education is allowed in government-run schools (often called "[[public school (government funded)|public schools]]"). Those that allow it also vary in the type of education provided.

People oppose religious education in public schools on various grounds. One is that it constitutes a state sponsorship or establishment of whatever religious beliefs are taught. Others argue that if a particular religion is taught in school, children who do not belong to that religion will either feel pressure to conform or be excluded from their peers. Proponents argue that religious beliefs have historically socialized people's behavior and morality. They feel that teaching religion in school is important to encourage children to be responsible, spiritually sound adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first1=Robert |title=Religion, Education, Dialogue and Conflict: Perspectives on Religious Education Research |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |accessdate=2016-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious education by religion ==

In [[Christianity]], [[catechesis]] refers to the religious instruction of children and adult [[conversion to Christianity|converts]].

The [[Church Educational System]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) provides religious education for the youth and adults in 145 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seminary.lds.org/about/history "History of Seminary"], seminary.lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional [[Muslim]] education, children are taught to read and sometimes speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and memorize the major [[sura]]s of the [[Qur'an]]. Many countries have state-run schools for this purpose (known as [[Madrasah|Madrasah Islamiyyah]] in Arabic; meaning "Islamic school"). Traditionally, a settlement may pay a [[mullah]] to teach children. There is a historic tradition of Sufi mullahs who wander and teach, and an ancient tradition of religious universities. However, the study of Islam does not suffice. Students must pass the state mandated curriculum to pass. Religious scholars often serve as judges, especially for criminal and family law (more rarely for commercial law).

Pertaining to Jewish religious education in a secular society, [[Michael Rosenak]], an Israeli philosopher of Jewish education,  asserts that even when non-religious Jewish educators insist that the instruction of Judaism is not only a religious matter, they agree that  “the religious factor” was very important to its culture before secularism dawned on society, and that “an understanding of natural history and literature requires a sense of historical Jewish sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Michael |first1=Rosenak |title=Commandments and Concerns: Jewish Education in Secular Society |work=2011 |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |accessdate=2016-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches in various regions==

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, "Religious Education" refers to the academic teaching of religious studies. "Religious Instruction" refers to religious faith teaching, which occurs in private religious schools, integrated (religious) state schools or sometimes within Secular NZ State Primary Schools if directed by the individual schools' Board of Trustees. In 2017 around 40% of NZ State Primary Schools carried out religious instruction classes. There are no officially recognised syllabuses as the school has to be officially closed in order to allow the classes to go ahead. There are organised groups such as the Secular Education Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religioninschools.co.nz/|title=Secular Education Network|last=|first=|date=|website=Religion In Schools|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://religiouseducation.co.nz|title=Religious Instruction In NZ Primary Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=Religious Education - Religious Instruction In NZ Primary Schools|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the NZ Association of Rationalists and Humanists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rationalists.nz/|title=NZ Association of Rationalists and Humanists|last=|first=|date=|website=NZ Association of Rationalists and Humanists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are actively lobbying Government to have legislation changed to remove the classes from state primary schools.

===China===

In the [[People's Republic of China]], formal religious education is permitted. Religious education usually occurs in scheduled sessions in private homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aasianst.org/absts/2009abst/China/C-93.htm |title=China and Inner Asia Sessions |publisher=Aasianst.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}} Religious teachers usually move on a weekly or monthly circuit, staying as guests in private houses in exchange for teaching.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===India===

{{See also|International Society for Krishna Consciousness}}[[ISKCON]]

In [[India]], there are a number of private schools run by religious institutions, especially for [[Hindus]], [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Christians]], [[Jainism|Jains]] and [[Buddhists]]. During the era of [[British raj|British rule]], Christian private schools were quite prominent and widely attended by both UK ([[United Kingdom|British]]) and [[India]]n students. Many of the schools established during this era, especially in areas with a heavy Christian population, are still in existence today.

The school teaches academic education according to the standard UK curriculum, alongside devotional subjects of [[bhajan]]/[[kirtan]] singing and instrumentation and also [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="mayapurschool1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayapurschool.com/ |title=Sri Mayapur International School |publisher=MayapurSchool.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISKCON has instituted a number of seminaries and schools of tertiary higher education. In addition to typical formal education, ISKCON also offers specialized religious/spiritual instructional programs in scriptural texts, standardized by the ISKCON Ministry for Educational Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iskconeducation.org/ |title=ISKCON Ministry for Educational Development |publisher=ISKCONEducation.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Governing Body Commission|GBC]] committee on Vaisnava Training &amp; Education, categorized by level and difficulty; in India, they are primarily provided by the Mayapur Institute for Higher Education and Training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mihet.org/ |title=Mayapur Institute for Higher Education and Training |publisher=MIHET.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vrindavan Institute for Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vihe.org/ |title=Vrindavan Institute for Higher Education |publisher=VIHE.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISKCON also offers instruction in [[Archana (Hinduism)|archana]], or [[murti]] worship and devotional ceremony, through the Mayapur Academy.&lt;ref name="mayapurschool1"/&gt;

In addition to regular formal education, a number of religious institutions have instituted regular informal religious/spiritual education programs for children and adults. ISKCON temples have established a number{{Clarify|how many?|date=June 2011}} of such

===Japan===

{{See also|List of schools in Japan}}
In [[Japan]], there are many [[Christian]] schools and universities with mandatory religious education. Any religious education at private middle and high schools requires the teacher to be accredited by a university teaching the religious education standards.&lt;ref&gt;[中学校・高等学校教員（宗教）の免許資格を取得することのできる大学 http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/kyoin/daigaku/detail/1287068.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Private schools with a traditional connection to Buddhist sects generally do not mandate any religious study. Religious or political education, or clubs that promote a specific religious or political group, are prohibited at public schools.

===Pakistan===

In [[Pakistan]], Muslim students must take [[Islamic studies]] from primary to higher education. The subject is optional for non-Muslim students, who can choose the subject of ethics instead.

===South East Asia===

In [[Thailand]], [[Burma]] and other majority [[Buddhist]] societies, Buddhist teachings and social decorum are sometimes taught in public school. Young men are expected to live as monks for several months at one time in their lives during which they can receive religious education.

===Europe===

====Austria====
Because of [[Austria]]'s history as a multinational empire that included the largely Islamic [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], Sunni Islam has been taught side by side with Roman Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox classes since the 19th century. However, children belonging to minority religions, like [[Jewish]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]] also study religious education in their various denominations. At many schools, secular classes in Ethics can be attended alternatively.

==== Finland ====
In [[Finland]] religious education is mandatory subject both in comprehensive schools (7–16 years) and in senior/upper secondary schools (16-18/19 years). Most of Finnish students study Evangelical Lutheran religious education. A student can receive religious education according to his or her own religion if the denomination is registered in Finland. Since religious education is a compulsory subject, pupils who do not belong to any religious group are taught Ethics.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Also some non-Lutheran pupils participate in the Evangelical Lutheran religious education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suol.fi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=75|title=Religious Education in Finland|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In [[France]], the state recognizes no religion and does not fund religious education. However, the state subsidizes private teaching establishments, including religious ones, under strict conditions of not forcing religion courses on students and not discriminating against students according to religion. An exception is the area of [[Alsace-Moselle]] where, for historical reasons (it was ruled by Germany when this system was instituted in the rest of France) under a specific [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], the state supports public education in some religions (Catholic, Protestant, Jewish) mostly in accord with the German model.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====Germany====
Historically, the various confessions in [[Germany]] have contributed to primary and secondary education and do so still. [[Education in Germany]] still embodies the legacy of the [[Prussian education system]] introduced by [[Frederick the Great]] in 1763. The curricula of the various [[states of Germany]] since then have included not only basic technical skills but also music (singing) and religious (Christian) education in close cooperation with the churches. This has led to the churches being assigned a specific status as legal entity of public law, "Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts" in Germany, which is a legacy of a 1919 Weimar compromise still in force today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Verfassung/Staat-Religion/Religionsverfassungsrecht/koerperschaftsstatus/koerperschaftsstatus_node.html Bedeutung und Voraussetzungen für den Erwerb des Status der Körperschaft öffentlichen Rechts für Religions- und Weltanschauungsgemeinschaften gem. Art. 140 GG in Verbindung mit Art. 137 Abs. 5 WRV] (BMI Website of the German Ministry of Interior about of the legal background of the corporation status of religions and other [[World view]] associations)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the federal states of Germany, which has a long history of almost even division between [[Roman Catholic]]ism and [[Protestantism]], have an arrangement whereby the religious bodies oversee the training of mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious education teachers.

In one of the federal states this includes Orthodox Christian teachers as well. In Berlin, Bremen (see [[Bremen clause]]) and Brandenburg, religious education is not mandatory. E.g. in Bremen, state-authorized "Bible studies" were offered which were not supervised by a specific confession.

The training is supposed to be conducted according to modern standards of the [[humanities]], and by teachers trained at mostly state-run colleges and universities. Those teachers teach religion in public schools, are paid by the state and are bound to the German constitution, as well as answerable to the churches for the content of their teaching. Children who are part of no mainstream religion (this applies e.g. to [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and members of the [[New Apostolic Church]]) still have to take part in the classes of one of the confessions or, if they want to opt out, attend classes in Ethics or Philosophy instead. The [[Humanistischer Verband Deutschlands]], an atheist and agnostic association, has adopted to the legal setup of the churches and is now allowed to offer such classes. From the age of 14, children may decide on their own if they want to attend religion classes and, if they do, which of those they are willing to attend. For younger children it is the decision of their parents. The state also subsidizes religious and [[Waldorf education]] schools by paying up to 90% of their expenses. These schools have to follow the same curricula as public schools of their federal state, though.

The introduction of [[Islam]]ic religious education in Germany has faced various burdens and thresholds, but it is being introduced currently.{{When|date=February 2016}} While there are around three million Muslims, mostly of Turkish origin, now in the country (see [[Islam in Germany]]), not many of them are members of a legal entity with which the states could arrange such matters (unlike the Christian churches' representatives and the humanists). In 2013, for the first time in German history, the state of Hessen acknowledged a Muslim community, the reform-oriented [[Ahmadiyya]], as ''Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts'' for all of Germany, which has been deemed a historical milestone.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; Ahmadiyya applied for the status just to be able to offer religious education in state schools, but is allowed now to maintain its own cemeteries and have its members' fees collected by the state's [[church tax]] system.&lt;ref name=welt&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article117076904/Der-Islam-gehoert-nun-offiziell-zu-Deutschland.html Der Islam gehört nun offiziell zu Deutschland] (Islam is a part of Germany now, quoting a famous speech of President [[Christian Wulff]]), by Freia Peters, ''Die Welt'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
In [[Greece]], students at public schools typically learn the basics of the [[Greek Orthodox]] faith. Students can opt out of these classes, if their parents state, in paper, that their children are not of the Greek Orthodox dogma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pi-schools.gr/lessons/religious/apallagi_thr.pdf "Ρύθμιση μαθητικών θεμάτων", Υπουργείο Εθν. Παιδείας &amp; Θρησκευμάτων, 10/07/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latvia====
In [[Latvia]], since 2004 parents of the primary school students (grades 1 to 3) can choose Christian classes or the ethics.
Christian classes are interdenominational (based on common [[Lutheran]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]], [[Baptist]], [[Old Believer]] grounds).

====Poland====
In Poland, religious education is optional in [[state schools]]. Parents decide whether children should attend religion classes or ethics classes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cke.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/ustawa_ujednolicona.pdf Art.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poradnikdyrektora.pl/aktualnosci/organizowanie-zajec-z-etyki-dzu199236155-pozn-zm/&lt;/ref&gt; or none of them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nauczaniefilozofii.uni.wroc.pl/pliki/podstawaprawna.pdf §3&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, grades from religion (or ethics) classes are counted towards the [[Grade (education)|grade point average]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Romania====
{{main|Religious education in Romania}}
Religious education is optional in Romanian state schools. Parents can freely choose which religion their children will study, but a majority of religious classes focus on the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] faith, which is the majority religion in the country.

====Turkey====
Institutional education in general, and religious education in particular, is centralized in Turkey. This approach began with the Unity of Education Law, which was first drafted in 1924 and preserved in subsequent legal reforms and constitutional changes. Due to the secular revolution, previous practices of the Ottoman education system were abandoned. The newer Unity of Education Law was interpreted as totally excluding religious instruction from public schools.{{clarify|reason=does not seem to take into account the military's attempt to remove religion and the new government's attempt to reinsert it. All blended together. Or vague|date=December 2014}}

In 1956, as a result of multiparty democracy, a new government led by the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, historical)|former Democratic Party]] was established. This new government introduced a religion course into secondary schools. After the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|military coup in 1980]], religious education in school was transformed. The new program of the "Culture of Religion and Knowledge of Ethics" integrated the course with the purposes and principles of general education to educate students to be critical and active participants in the educational process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iarf.net/REBooklet/Turkey.htm|title=International Association for Religious Freedom|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of religious education is still prepared by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/116510/religious-education-in-turkey|title=Religious education in Turkey -  Worldbulletin News|work=World Bulletin|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state ensures that children are first exposed to accepted interpretations of Islam before exposing them to other religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Shively, R. L. (2008). page 702 Politeness and social interaction in study abroad: Service encounters in L2 Spanish. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], Catholic, Church of England (in England) and Jewish schools have long been supported within the state system, with all other state-funded schools having a duty to provide compulsory religious education. Until the introduction of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], religious education was the sole compulsory subject in state schools. State school religious education is non-proselytising and covers a variety of faiths, although the legislation requires it to include more Christian content than other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmiweb.org.uk/publications/re/NSNF.pdf Religious Education] Department for Education and Skills, QCA. p. 10. "The Education Act 1996 states that an agreed syllabus must reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian, while taking account of the teachings and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scotland does not have schools, although it does often have a presence in Scottish non-denominational institutions. There is no National Curriculum for Religious Education in state schools in England. In England and Wales, the content of the syllabus for state schools is agreed on by local education authorities (LEAs), with the ratification of a [[Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education]] (SACRE) comprising members of different religious groups, teachers and local councilors. Parents with children in state schools can withdraw them from all or part of the lessons on religious, sex and relationship education if they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The National Curriculum - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects|website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale research suggests religious education may be unpopular with students of minority religious backgrounds because it distorts and misrepresents religious traditions and their adherents &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|date=2016|title=Reported Experiences of Anti-Christian Prejudice among Christian Adolescents in England|url=https://www.academia.edu/25082790/Reported_experiences_of_anti-Christian_prejudice_among_Christian_adolescents_in_England|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–238|doi=10.1080/13537903.2016.1152679|issn=1353-7903|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|date=2015|title=Reported schooling experiences of adolescent Jews attending non-Jewish secondary schools in England|url=https://www.academia.edu/24387768/Reported_schooling_experiences_of_adolescent_Jews_attending_non-_Jewish_secondary_schools_in_England|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=683–705|doi=10.1080/13613324.2015.1013459|issn=1361-3324|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|date=2014|title=Religious identity choices in English secondary schools|url=https://www.academia.edu/8788434/Religious_identity_choices_in_English_secondary_schools|journal=British Educational Research Journal|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=489–504|doi=10.1002/berj.3151|issn=0141-1926|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===North America===
====Canada====
In [[Canada]], religious education has a varying status. On the one hand, publicly funded and organized [[separate schools]] for Roman Catholics and Protestants are mandated in some provinces and in some circumstances by various sections of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_93 Constitution Act, 1867]'', s. 93;  ''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html Alberta Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 17;  ''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/sa_1905.html Saskatchewan Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, with a growing level of [[multiculturalism]], particularly in [[Ontario]], debate has emerged as to whether publicly funded religious education for one group is permissible. For example, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] withdrew funding for Protestant and Roman Catholic schools in 1995, after a constitutional amendment. [[Quebec]] abolished religious education funded by the state through the ''Education Act, 1998'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/rsq-c-i-13.3/latest/rsq-c-i-13.3.html#DIVISION_I_ESTABLISHMENT_OF_FRENCH_LANGUAGE_AND_ENGLISH_LANGUAGE_SCHOOL_BOARDS_274803 Education Act]'', R.S.Q., c. I-13.3, chap. 5, Division 1:  Establishment of French Language and English Language School Boards&lt;/ref&gt; which took effect on July 1 of that same year, again after a constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_93 Constitution Act, 1867]'', s. 93A.&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec re-organized the schools along linguistic rather than religious lines. In Ontario, however, the move to abolish funding has been strongly resisted. In the 2007 provincial election, the topic of funding for faith-based schools that were not Catholic became a major topic. The provincial conservative party was defeated due, in part, to their support of this topic.

====United States====
In the [[United States]], religious education is often provided through supplementary "[[Sunday school]]", "Hebrew school", or [[catechism]] classes, taught to children at their families' places of worship, either in conjunction with worship services or some other time during the week, after weekday school classes. Some families believe supplementary religious education is inadequate, and send their children to private religious schools, called [[parochial school]]s when they are affiliated with a specific parish or congregation. Many faiths also offer private college and graduate-level religious schools, which may be accredited as [[college]]s. Under U.S. law, religious education is forbidden in public schools, except from a neutral, academic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.uncw.edu/lowery/pls203/religion-public-schools.pdf RELIGION AND THE COURTS: THE PILLARS OF CHURCH-STATE LAW] The Pew Forum May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For a teacher or school administration to endorse one religion is considered an infringement of the "establishment clause" of the First Amendment. The boundaries of this rule are frequently tested, with court cases challenging the treatment of traditional religious holidays, displays of religious articles and documents such as the [[Ten Commandments]], the recitation of the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] (which since 1954 has described the U.S. as "one nation under God"), and how prayer should be accommodated in the classroom.

The '''Science of Aging Knowledge Environment''' ('''SAGE KE''') was an [[online]] [[science|scientific]] resource provided by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).

==History and organization==
The American Association for the Advancement of Science established a [[collaboration]] with [[Stanford University]] Libraries  and The Center for Resource Economics/Island Press (Island Press) in 1996 to find means to utilize [[internet]]-based technologies to enhance access to scientific information and improve the effectiveness of information transfer.  The collaborative coined the term '''Knowledge Environment (KE)''' to describe the collection of [[Computer network|electronic networking]] tools they were seeking to develop.

'''SAGE KE''' is the third in a series of Knowledge Environments developed by ''Science'' and [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]], after the [[Signal transduction|Signal Transduction]] Knowledge Environment (STKE) and AIDScience. Funding for SAGE KE comes from [[The Ellison Medical Foundation]], founded and supported by [[Oracle Corporation]] [[CEO]] [[Larry Ellison]].

'''SAGE KE''' published its final issue on 28 June 2006 due to lack of funding. The interactive content was discontinued during the summer of 2006, leaving the SAGE KE site as an archive by August 2006.

==Activities==
The focus of '''SAGE KE''' was to provide timely access to information about advances on basic mechanisms of [[aging]] and age-related [[disease]]s through the [[internet]], to provide searchable [[database]]s of information on aging and to provide an active environment in which [[Gerontology|biogerontologists]] could share and debate their understandings.

==Ouroboros==
Ouroboros is a [[WordPress]] community [[weblog]] devoted to research in the [[senescence|biology of aging]]. It was established in July 2006 in reaction to the termination of the SAGE KE. The primary mission of the site is to provide timely commentary and review of recently published articles in the scholarly literature, either directly or indirectly related to aging. Articles on the site discuss a range of scientific topics, including [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[bioinformatics]], [[calorie restriction]], regulation of [[gene expression]], the role of [[mitochondria]] in the aging process, and [[evolution]]ary theories of aging.

[[File:Sewer overflow RI EPA.jpg|thumb|right|A [[manhole]] cover unable to contain a sanitary sewer overflow]]
'''Sanitary sewer overflow''' ('''SSO''') is a condition in which untreated [[sewage]] is discharged from a [[sanitary sewer]] into the environment prior to reaching [[sewage treatment]] facilities. When caused by rainfall it is also known as '''wet weather overflow'''. It is primarily meaningful in [[developed countries]], which have extensive treatment facilities. Frequent causes of SSO spills include:

* Blockage of sewer lines
* [[Infiltration/Inflow]] of excessive [[stormwater]] into sewer lines during heavy [[rainfall]]
* Malfunction of [[pumping station]] lifts or electrical [[power failure]]
* Broken sewer lines.

SSOs can cause [[gastrointestinal illness]]es, beach closures and restrictions on fish and shellfish consumption.

==Magnitude of the problem==
Developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], most [[Western Europe]]an nations (e.g. [[Italy]] and [[France]]), [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are struggling with public health problems of SSO prevention. However, the magnitude of the problem is much greater in most developing countries.

===United States===
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates that at least 23,000 to 75,000 SSO events occur in the United States each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/sanitary-sewer-overflows-ssos |title=Sanitary Sewer Overflows |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-16 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA estimated that upgrading every municipal treatment and collection system to reduce the frequency of overflow events to no more than once every five years would cost about $88 billion as of 2004.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress: Impacts and Control of CSOs and SSOs |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-R-04-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cost would be in addition to approximately $10 billion already invested. Although the volume of untreated sewage discharged to the environment is less than 0.01 percent of all treated sewage in the United States, the total volume amounts to several billion gallons per annum and accounts for thousands of cases of gastrointestinal illness each year.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 6}}

===Worldwide perspective===
Developed European countries and Japan have similar or somewhat larger percentages of SSO events compared to the U.S.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In [[developing countries]], most wastewater is still not treated when discharged into the environment. The [[People's Republic of China]] discharged about 55 percent of all sewage without treatment of any type, as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[[World Bank]] Supports China's Wastewater Treatment", ''The People’s Daily'', November 30, 2001, Beijing&lt;/ref&gt; In a relatively developed [[Middle East]]ern country such as [[Iran]], the majority of [[Tehran]]'s population has totally untreated sewage injected to the city’s groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;Massoud Tajrishy and Ahmad Abrishamchi, "Integrated Approach to Water and Wastewater Management for [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]", [[Water Conservation]], Reuse, and Recycling: Proceedings of the Iranian-American Workshop, National Academies Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Venezuela]], a below-average country in [[South America]] with respect to wastewater treatment, 97 percent of the country’s sewage is discharged untreated into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Appropriate Technology for Sewage Pollution Control in the Wider [[Caribbean]] Region, Caribbean Environment Programme Technical Report #40 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries there are obligations to measure and report SSO occurrence using real-time [[telemetry]] to warn the public, bathers and shellfishery operators.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Causes ==
===Engineering aspects===
[[Image:Aparissewer.jpg|thumb|230px|Sanitary sewer line in [[Paris]] more than two meters in diameter.]]
Sewers that were built in the early stages of urbanization were usually built before [[sewage treatment]] was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[History of water supply and sanitation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Early sewers were simple drainage systems to remove [[surface runoff]] with any waste material it might contain. These drainage systems became [[combined sewers]] when sewage from kitchens, baths, and toilets was added; and the discharge became offensive.  Early sewage treatment plants were built to treat the sewage during dry weather; but it was infeasible to treat the larger volume of mixed sewage and precipitation runoff from combined sewers during wet weather. Sanitary sewers were built to keep sewage from being mixed with surface runoff so the sewage could be efficiently treated during both wet and dry weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Okun |first=Daniel A. |authorlink = |title =Sewage Treatment Plant Design |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1959 |location = |page =6 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blockages===
Decentralized failures in dry weather mainly occur from collection sewer line blockages, which can arise from a [[debris]] clog or tree root intrusion into the line itself. Approximately half of SSOs in the United States are caused by blockage.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–26}} [[Brown grease|Grease]] is the blocking agent in approximately half of U.S. SSOs attributed to blockage, and solid debris is the blocking agent for another 25 percent. [[Root]]s are a contributing factor in approximately one-quarter of United States SSOs attributed to blockage.  Grease deposits are caused by cooking fats liquified with hot water for discharge to sanitary sewers. These fats congeal as solid deposits in the cooler sewer. Solid debris includes soiled clothing, [[diaper]]s, and [[sanitary napkin]]s flushed down the toilet rather than being put in a waste bin.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–28}}

One of the main problems of a decentralized line failure is the difficulty of defining the location of overflow, since a typical urban system contains thousands of miles of collection pipes, and the central treatment plant has no way of communicating with all the lines, unless expensive monitoring equipment has been installed. Companies in the UK have widely deployed bulk dielectric [[transducer]]s suspended in the sewers to detect high levels and to report the events back over fixed wireless data networks. In certain locations this practice has permitted the reduction of pollution events by up to 60 percent.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Dry weather blockage is less likely within combined sewers; because combined sewers designed for the additional volume of surface runoff are much larger than sanitary sewers. Combined sewer storm water regulators may be vulnerable to blockage by debris, but overflow from such blockage typically enters the diversion [[outfall]] to avoid flooding private or public property.

===Infiltration/inflow===
Approximately one-quarter of United States SSOs occur during heavy [[rainfall]] events, which can cause inflow of [[stormwater]] into sanitary sewers through damage, improper connections, or flooding buildings and [[lift station]]s in low-lying areas of the collection system. The combined flow of sewage and stormwater exceeds the capacity of the sanitary sewer system and sewage is released into homes, businesses and streets.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–26}} This circumstance is most prevalent in older cities whose subsurface infrastructure is quite old; [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Stockholm]],&lt;ref&gt;Monica Spendilow, ''Impeller Magazine'', ITT Flygt AB, SE-174 87 Sundbyberg, Sweden (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[Oakland, California]]&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Impact Statement for the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]] Wet Weather Overflow Project'', Earth Metrics Incorporated, prepared for the U.S. EPA and East Bay Municipal Utility District, Oakland, Ca. (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; are typical examples of such locations. Inflow into the sanitary lines can be caused by tree root rupture of subsurface lines or by mechanical fracture due to age and overpressure from trucks and buildings.

===Malfunctions===
Another mode of system failure can include [[power outage]]s, which may disable [[lift station]] pumps and cause sewage overflow from the lift station wet well. Lift station mechanical or power failure causes approximately ten percent of United States SSOs. This type of discharge is uncommon from combined sewers, because the combined volume of sewage and storm water discourages use of lift stations. Broken sewer lines are responsible for approximately ten percent of U.S. SSOs.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–27}}

Power failure, [[human error]], or mechanical failure may cause similar discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from a sewage treatment plant; but this is typically regarded as a sewage treatment plant malfunction rather than a sanitary sewer overflow. Sewage treatment plants may be designed to capture overflow from malfunctioning units and discharge it to alternative treatment facilities.  Flooding of private or public property is typically avoided by discharging the overflow to an outfall designed for discharge of treated sewage.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. ES–3}}

==Human health and ecological consequences==
[[Image:Overflowepa.gif|thumb|230px|Decentralized wet weather overflow event]]

Human health impacts include significant numbers of [[gastrointestinal illness]] each year, although death from one overflow event is uncommon. Additional human impacts include [[beach]] closures, [[human swimming|swimming]] restrictions and prohibition of the consumption of certain aquatic animals (particularly certain [[mollusc]]s) after overflow events. Ecological consequences include [[fish kill]]s, harm to [[plankton]] and other aquatic microflora and microfauna. Turbidity increase and dissolved oxygen decrease in receiving waters can lead to accentuated effects beyond the obvious [[pathogen]]ic induced damage to aquatic [[ecosystem]]s. It is possible that higher life forms such as [[marine mammal]]s can be affected since certain seals and [[sea lion]]s are known to experience peaks in pathogenic harm.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. P., Jang, S., Gulland, F.M.D., Miller, M., Casper, D., Lawrence, J., Herrera, J., [http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/39/1/136.pdf "Characterization and clinical manifestations of Arcanobacterium phocae infections in marine mammals stranded along the central California coast"], ''Journal of Wildlife Diseases'', 39:136-144 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation techniques==
The concept of SSO containment valves has been pioneered in the UK and they are installed to mitigate dry spills, by correlating rainfall data with SSO spill activity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==History==
[[Image:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sewage treatment plant]] used to create the Wonga Wetlands, [[Australia]]]]
Since medieval times rulers have been aware of the impact of raw sewage improperly discharged to the environment. Before treatment systems existed in 16th century [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] decreed that sewage troughs should be kept flowing so that they would not stagnate in [[London]] prior to reaching the [[River Thames]] ([[London sewer system]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In the 19th century, sewage treatment plants were first developed and installed in the U.S. and parts of Europe, and the concept of SSO was identified. However, SSOs were not recognized as a widespread environmental problem until the rise of environmental awareness in the 1960s. Around that time government agencies in the U.S. began identifying locations and frequencies of SSOs in a systematic way. Local governments heard complaints of citizens, and beach closure protocols were systematised to reduce risks to public health.

After passage of the [[Clean Water Act]] in 1972, the U.S. spent billions of dollars on upgrades to sewage treatment plants, with some associated repairs and improvements to the associated collection systems, where the overflows occur. EPA continues to provide funding for low-interest loans to communities for addressing SSO problems, through the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/sanitary-sewer-overflow-sso-frequent-questions |title=Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO) Frequent Questions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s [[Japan]], the [[UK]] and a number of other European countries began earnest investigation of some of their countries’ overflow issues.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Satellite crop monitoring technology allows to perform online crop monitoring on different fields, located in different areas, regions, even countries and on different continents. The technology's significant advantage is a high automation level of sown area condition and its interpretation in an interactive map which can be read by different groups of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.cropio.com/#top/|title=Cropio – Change the way of farming with Cropio|website=about.Cropio.com|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrium-geo.com/en/84-deimos-1-optical-satellite-imagery/|title=DMC Constellation : Airbus Defence and Space|website=www.Astrium-Geo.com|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precisionagriculture.com.au/|title=For Farmers - Precision Agriculture|website=www.PrecisionAgriculture.com.au|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''science fair''' experiment is generally a competition where contestants present their [[science project]], results in the form of a report, [[display board]], and/or models that they have created. Science fairs allow students in elementary, middle and high schools to compete in science and/or technology activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eduplace.com/science/profdev/science_fair/whatis.html|title=What is a science fair project?|last= Fredericks |first=Anthony D.|date=2000|website=Science Fair Handbook|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main motive of a science fair is for students to answer a question or task, not from a textbook but found out themselves by conducting a range of experiments and ongoing research in the short amount of time allocated to them. In order that the questions or tasks spark a true interest in the student they should be able to have an interesting, eye catching project often portrayed on a [[display board]].

Science fairs also provide a mechanism for students with intense interest in the sciences to be paired with mentors from nearby colleges and universities, so that they can access to instruction and equipment that the local schools can not provide.

== History ==
Science fairs date back to 1942, when [[William Emerson Ritter]] and [[Edward W. Scripps]] created "[[The Science Talent Search]]" for high school students. 
The first American National Science Fair was won by '''Alan J. Fletcher''' when he was 18, winning with a display on the [[laws of motion]].
In the [[United States]], science fairs became popular in the early 1950s. Interest in the sciences was at a new high after the world witnessed the use of the first two [[atomic weapon]]s and the dawn of [[television]]. As the decade progressed, science stories in the news, such as [[Jonas Salk]]'s [[vaccine for polio]] and the launch of [[Sputnik]], brought science fiction to reality and attracted increasing numbers of students to fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/118515/science/a_history_of_science_fairs.html|title=A History of Science Fairs|last=Cox|first=Jimmy|date=|website=|publisher= Streetdirectory|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science fair competitions ==
Most countries have regional science fairs in which interested students can freely participate. Winners of these regional fairs send students to national fairs such as [[ISEF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findafair.societyforscience.org/|title=Student Science - Find a Fair|website=findafair.societyforscience.org|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada-Wide Science Fair|CWSF]]. National science fairs typically send winners to international fairs such as ISEF (which is a national and an international science fair) and [[EUCYS]].

[[File:Old view moon.jpg|thumb|upright|"Lunar Day", from the book ''Recreations in Astronomy'' by H. D. Warren D. D., 1879. This represents a historical concept of the lunar surface appearance. Robotic missions to the Moon later showed that the surface features are much more rounded due to a long history of impacts.]]

'''Selenography''' is the study of the surface and physical features of the [[Moon]]. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar [[Lunar mare|maria]], [[Impact crater|crater]]s, mountain ranges, and other various features. This task was largely finished when high resolution images of the [[near side of the Moon|near]] and [[far side of the Moon|far]] sides of the Moon were obtained by orbiting spacecraft during the early space era. Nevertheless, some regions of the Moon remain poorly imaged (especially near the poles) and the exact locations of many features (like [[crater depth]]s) are uncertain by several kilometers. Today, selenography is considered to be a subdiscipline of [[selenology]], which itself is most often referred to as simply "lunar science." The word selenography is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] lunar deity Σελήνη ''[[Selene]]'' and [[wiktionary:γράφω|γράφω]] graphō, "I write".

== History ==
{{see also|Exploration of the Moon}}

The idea that the Moon is not perfectly smooth originates to at least ''circa'' 450 BC, when [[Democritus]] asserted that the Moon's "lofty mountains and hollow valleys" were the cause of its markings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=democritus+moon+valleys+and+mountains&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SPKVGK7dL0&amp;sig=clKAWfiJ7RJm6EJ0z3aN9hPNIr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2_qG1uejeAhVjRN8KHYSlBp8Q6AEwFHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=democritus%20moon%20valleys%20and%20mountains&amp;f=false|title=The Moon and the Condition and Configurations of Its Surface|last=Neison|first=Edmund|last2=Nevill|first2=Edmund Neville|date=1876|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not until the end of the 15th century AD did serious study of selenography began. ''Circa'' AD 1603, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] made the first lunar drawing based on naked-eye observation. Others soon followed, and when the [[telescope]] was invented, initial drawings of poor accuracy were made, but soon thereafter improved in tandem with [[optics]]. In the early 18th century, the [[libration]]s of the Moon were measured, which revealed that more than half of the lunar surface was visible to observers on Earth. In 1750, Johann Meyer produced the first reliable set of lunar [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] that permitted astronomers to locate lunar features. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter|Johann Schröter]] began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar [[topography]]. In 1834 [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]] published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published ''The Universal Selenography''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reese.org/duneroller/content/unexplained/Oddities/wax_honeymoon.htm Wax and the Honey Moon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070724101724/http://www.reese.org/duneroller/content/unexplained/Oddities/wax_honeymoon.htm |date=2007-07-24 }}; an account of Maedler's work and the creation of the first wax model of the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when [[J.W. Draper]], using a 5 inch reflector, produced a [[daguerreotype]] of the Moon and thus introduced photography to [[astronomy]]. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the [[telescope]] 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of [[astronomy]].

The 20th century witnessed more advances in selenography. In 1959, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft [[Luna 3]] transmitted the first photographs of the [[far side of the Moon]], giving the first view of it in history. The [[United States of America]] launched the [[Ranger program|Ranger]] spacecraft between 1961 and 1965 to photograph the lunar surface until the instant they impacted it, the [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]]s between 1966 and 1967 to photograph the Moon from orbit, and the [[Surveyor program|Surveyors]] between 1966 and 1968 to photograph and softly land on the lunar surface.  The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod]]s [[Lunokhod 1|1]] (1970) and [[Lunokhod 2|2]] (1973) traversed almost 50&amp;nbsp;km of the lunar surface, making detailed photographs of the lunar surface.  The [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] spacecraft obtained the first nearly global cartograph (map) of the lunar [[topography]], and also [[multispectral images]].  Successive missions transmitted photographs of increasing resolution.

==Lunar cartography and toponymy==
[[File:Hevelius Map of the Moon 1647.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Map of the Moon by [[Johannes Hevelius]] (1647)]]
The oldest known illustration of the Moon was found in a [[passage grave]] in [[Knowth]], [[County Meath]], [[Ireland]]. The tomb was [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] to 3330–2790 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] made a drawing of the Moon in which he denominated a dozen surface features in the late 16th century; it was published posthumously In ''De Mondo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova''. After the invention of the [[telescope]], [[Thomas Harriot]] (1609), [[Galileo Galilei]] (1609), and [[Charles Scheiner]] (1614) made drawings also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first serious denominations of the surface features of the Moon, based on telescopic observation, were made by [[Michael van Langren|Michel Florent van Langren]] in 1645. His work is considered the first true cartograph (map) of the Moon because it demarcated the various [[lunar mare|lunar maria]], [[Impact crater|crater]]s, and mountains and ranges. Many of his denominations were distinctly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], denominating craters in honor of Catholic [[Royal family|royalty]] and capes and promontories in honor of Catholic [[saint]]s. The lunar ''maria'' were denominated in [[Latin]] for terrestrial seas and oceans. Minor craters were denominated in honor of astronomers, mathematicians, and other famous scholars.[[File:Micrographia Schem 38.jpg|thumb|A study of the Moon from [[Robert Hooke|Robert Hooke's]] ''[[Micrographia]]'' of 1665]]

In 1647, [[Johannes Hevelius]] produced the rival work ''Selenographia'', which was the first lunar atlas. Hevelius ignored the nomenclature of Van Langren and instead denominated the lunar [[topography]] according to terrestrial features, such that the names of lunar features corresponded to the toponyms of their geographical terrestrial counterparts, especially as the latter were denominated by the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] civilizations. This work of Hevelius influenced his contemporary European astronomers, and the ''Selenographia'' was the standard reference on selenography for over a century.

[[Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], a [[Catholic priest]] and scholar who lived in northern [[Italy]] authored the present scheme of [[Latin]] lunar nomenclature. His ''Almagestum Novum'' was published in 1651 as a defense of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] views of the [[Counter Reformation]]. In particular he argued against the views espoused by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Copernicus]] of a heliocentric universe with perfectly circular orbits. ''Almagestum Novum'' contained scientific reference matter based on contemporary knowledge, and contemporary [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] educators widely used it. However, the only significant component of the work that is presently authoritative is his system of lunar nomenclature.

The lunar illustrations in the ''Almagestum Novum'' were drawn by a fellow [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] educator named [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi, SJ]]. The nomenclature was based on a subdivision of the visible lunar surface into octants that were numbered in Roman style from I to VIII. Octant I referenced the northwest section and subsequent octants proceeded clockwise in alignment with compass directions. Thus Octant VI was to the south and included [[Clavius (crater)|Clavius]] and [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho]] Craters.

The [[Latin]] nomenclature had 2 components: the first denominated the broad features of ''terrae'' (lands) and ''maria'' (seas) and the second denominated the craters. Riccioli authored lunar [[toponym]]s derived from the names of various conditions, including climactic ones, whose causes were historically attributed to the Moon. Thus there were the seas of crises ("Mare Crisium"), serenity ("Mare Serenitatis"), and fertility ("Mare Fecunditatis"). There were also the seas of rain ("Mare Imbrium"), clouds ("Mare Nubium"), and cold ("Mare Frigoris"). The topographical features between the ''maria'' were comparably denominated, but were opposite the [[toponym]]s of the ''maria''. Thus there were the lands of sterility ("Terra Sterilitatis"), heat ("Terra Caloris"), and life ("Terra Vitae"). However, these names for the highland regions were supplanted on later cartographs (maps). See [[List of features on the Moon#Terra]] for a complete list.

[[File:Schröter selenotopographische fragmente beispiel karten.png|thumb|upright|Samples of lunar maps in the ''Selenetopographische Fragmente'' by [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter]].]]
Many of the craters were denominated topically pursuant to the octant in which they were located. Craters in Octants I, II, and III were primarily denominated based on names from [[ancient Greece]], such as [[Plato]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], and [[Archimedes]]. Toward the middle in Octants IV, V, and VI craters were denominated based on names from the ancient [[Roman Empire]], such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], and [[Lucius Taruntius Firmanus|Taruntius]]. Toward the southern half of the lunar cartograph (map) craters were denominated in honor of scholars, writers, and [[philosophy|philosophers]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] and Arabic regions. The outer extremes of Octants V, VI, and VII, and all of Octant VIII were denominated in honor of contemporaries of [[Giambattista Riccioli]]. Features of Octant VIII were also denominated in honor of [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], and [[Galileo]]. These persons were "banished" to it far from the "ancients", as a gesture to the [[Catholic Church]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Many craters around the [[Mare Nectaris]] were denominated in honor of [[Catholic]] [[saint]]s pursuant to the nomenclature of Van Langren. All of them were, however, connected in some mode with [[astronomy]]. Later cartographs (maps) removed the "St." from their [[toponym]]s.

The lunar nomenclature of [[Giambattista Riccioli]] was widely used after the publication of his ''Almagestum Novum'', and many of its [[toponym]]s are presently used. The system was scientifically inclusive and was considered eloquent and poetic in style, and therefore it appealed widely to his contemporaries. It was also readily extensible with new [[toponym]]s for additional features. Thus it replaced the nomenclature of Van Langren and Hevelius.

Later astronomers and lunar cartographers augmented the nomenclature with additional [[toponym]]s. The most notable among these contributors was [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter|Johann H. Schröter]], who published a very detailed cartograph (map) of the Moon in 1791 titled the ''Selenotopografisches Fragmenten''. Schröter's adoption of [[Giambattista Riccioli|Riccioli's]] nomenclature perpetuated it as the universally standard lunar nomenclature. A vote of the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 1935 established the lunar nomenclature of [[Giambattista Riccioli|Riccioli]], which included 600 lunar [[toponym]]s, as universally official and doctrinal.

The IAU later expanded and updated the lunar nomenclature in the 1960s, but new [[toponym]]s were limited to [[toponym]]s honoring deceased scientists. After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft photographed the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the Moon, many of the newly discovered features were denominated in honor of Soviet scientists and engineers. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] assigned all subsequent new lunar [[toponym]]s. Some craters were [[List of lunar craters named for space explorers|denominated in honor of space explorers]].

===Satellite craters===
[[Johann Heinrich Mädler|Johann H. Mädler]] authored the nomenclature for satellite craters. The subsidiary craters surrounding a major crater were identified by a letter. These subsidiary craters were usually smaller than the crater with which they were associated, with some exceptions. The craters could be assigned letters "A" through "Z", with "I" omitted. Because the great majority of the [[toponym]]s of craters were masculine, the major craters were generically denominated "[[patronymic]]" craters.

The assignment of the letters to satellite craters was originally somewhat haphazard. Letters were typically assigned to craters in by order of significance rather than location. Precedence depended on the angle of illumination from the [[Sun]] at the time of the telescopic observation, which could change during the lunar day. In many cases the assignments were seemingly random. In a number of cases the satellite crater was located closer to a major crater with which it was not associated. To identify the patronymic crater, Mädler placed the identifying letter to the side of the midpoint of the feature that was closest to the associated major crater. This also had the advantage of permitting omission of the [[toponym]]s of the major craters from the cartographs (maps) when their subsidiary features were labelled.

Over time, lunar observers assigned many of the satellite craters an [[eponym]]. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) assumed authority to denominate lunar features in 1919. The commission for denominating these features formally adopted the convention of using capital Roman letters to identify craters and valleys.

When suitable cartographs (maps) of the far side of the Moon became available by 1966, Ewen A. Whitaker denominated satellite features based on the angle of their location relative to the major crater with which they were associated. A satellite crater located due north of the major crater was identified as "Z". The full 360° circle around the major crater was then subdivided evenly into 24 parts, like a 24-hour clock. Each "hour" angle, running clockwise, was assigned a letter, beginning with "A" at 1 o'clock. The letters "I" and "O" were omitted, resulting in only 24 letters. Thus a crater due south of its major crater was identified as "M".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">The '''significand''' (also '''mantissa''' or '''coefficient''', sometimes also '''argument''' or '''fraction''')&lt;ref name="Savard_2005"/&gt; is part of a number in [[scientific notation]] or a [[floating point|floating-point number]], consisting of its [[significant digit]]s.  Depending on the interpretation of the [[exponent]], the significand may represent an [[integer]] or a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. The word ''mantissa'' seems to have been introduced by [[Arthur Burks]] in 1946&lt;ref name="Burks_1946"/&gt; writing for the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], although this use of the word is discouraged by the [[IEEE floating-point standard]] committee{{citation needed|reason=It seems the only evidence for this statement is anecdotal from user mfc on the talk page|date=September 2017}} as well as some professionals such as the creator of the standard, [[William Kahan]].&lt;ref name="Kahan_2002"/&gt;

==Example==

The number 123.45 can be represented as a [[decimal]] floating-point number with the integer 12345 as the significand and a 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; power term, also called [[characteristic (exponent notation)|characteristic]]s,&lt;ref name="Burks_1946"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1983"/&gt; where −2 is the exponent (and 10 is the base). Its value is given by the following arithmetic:

: 123.45 = 12345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

This same value can also be represented in [[scientific notation|normalized form]] with 1.2345 as the fractional coefficient, and +2 as the exponent (and 10 as the base):

: 123.45 = 1'''.'''2345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Schmid, however, called this representation with a significand ranging between 1.0 and 10 a '''modified normalized form'''.&lt;ref name="Schmid_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1983"/&gt;

For base 2, this 1.xxxx form is also called a '''normalized significand'''.

Finally, the value can be represented in the format given by the [[Language Independent Arithmetic]] standard and several programming language standards, including [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Fortran]] and [[Modula-2]], as

: 123.45 = 0'''.'''12345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Schmid called this representation with a significand ranging between 0.1 and 1.0 the '''true normalized form'''.&lt;ref name="Schmid_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmid_1983"/&gt;

This later 0.xxxx form is called a '''normed significand'''.

==Significands and the hidden bit==

For a [[normalized number]], the most significant digit is always non-zero.  When working in [[binary number system|binary]], this uniquely determines this digit to always be 1; as such, it doesn't need to be explicitly stored, being called the ''[[hidden bit]]''.  The significand is characterized by its width in ([[binary digits|binary]]) digits, and depending on the context, the hidden bit may or may not be counted towards the width of the significand.  For example, the same [[IEEE 754]] [[double-precision]] format is commonly described as having either a 53-bit significand, including the hidden bit, or a 52-bit significand, excluding the hidden bit.  IEEE 754 defines the precision ''p'' to be the number of digits in the significand, including any implicit leading bit (e.g., ''p'' = 53 for the double-precision format).

==Use of "mantissa"==

In American English, the original word for this seems to have been ''mantissa'' ([[Arthur Burks|Burks]]&lt;ref name="Burks_1946"/&gt; ''et al.''), and this usage remains common in computing and among [[computer science|computer scientists]]. However, the term ''significand'' was introduced by [[George Elmer Forsythe|George Forsythe]] and [[Cleve Barry Moler|Cleve Moler]] in 1967,&lt;ref name="Forsythe_Moler_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterbenz_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg_1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Savard_2005"/&gt; and the use of ''mantissa'' for this purpose is discouraged by the [[IEEE floating-point standard]] committee{{citation needed|reason=It seems the only evidence for this statement is anecdotal from user mfc on the talk page|date=September 2017}} and by some professionals such as [[William Kahan]]&lt;ref name="Kahan_2002"/&gt; and [[Donald Knuth]], because it conflicts with the pre-existing use of ''mantissa'' for the [[fractional part]] of a [[logarithm]] (see also [[common logarithm]]). For instance, Knuth adopts the third representation 0'''.'''12345 × 10&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; in the example above and calls 0'''.'''12345 the ''fraction'' part of the number; he adds:&lt;ref name="Knuth_1969"/&gt; "it is an abuse of terminology to call the fraction part a mantissa, since this concept has quite a different meaning in connection with logarithms".

The confusion is because scientific notation and floating-point representation are log-linear, not logarithmic. To multiply two numbers, given their logarithms, one just adds the characteristic (integer part) and the mantissa (fractional part). By contrast, to multiply two floating-point numbers, one adds the exponent (which is logarithmic) and ''multiplies'' the significand (which is linear).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7551">'''Somnophilia''' (from [[Latin]] "somnus" = sleep and [[Greek language|Greek]] φιλία, "-philia" = love), also known as '''sleeping princess syndrome'''&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; and '''sleeping beauty syndrome''',&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt; is a [[paraphilia]] in which an individual becomes [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] by someone who is [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="laws" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flora"&gt;Flora 2001, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexology]] scholar [[John Money]] stated that the condition has a high degree of correlation throughout history with [[incest]] and may progress to [[necrophilia]].&lt;ref name="money21" /&gt;  ''The Dictionary of Psychology'' categorized somnophilia within the classification of predatory paraphilias.&lt;ref name="corsini747" /&gt;

==Origin==
The term ''somnophilia'' was coined by John Money in 1986.&lt;ref name="carey"&gt;Carey 2014, p. D7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laws"&gt;Laws 2008, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized the condition as a type of [[sexual fetishism]].&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; Money described it as a type of syndrome: "of the marauding-predatory type in which erotic arousal and facilitation or attainment of orgasm are responsive to and dependent on intruding upon" someone who is unable to respond.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="money270"&gt;Money 1986, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that often the condition then subsequently involves the individual waking the unresponsive sexual partner after the act has been committed.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="money270" /&gt; 

According to Money, somnophilia may progress to [[necrophilia]], the desire to have sexual relations with a dead body.&lt;ref name="money55" /&gt; He characterized it as a form of "stealth and stealing paraphilias" including [[kleptophilia]].&lt;ref name="money92"&gt;Money 1986, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Money wrote that somnophilia has a high degree of correlation with acts of [[incest]] throughout history.&lt;ref name="money21"&gt;Money 1986, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse may follow from the condition including use of force or [[Kidnapping|abduction]].&lt;ref name="money55"&gt;Money 1986, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the individual upon whom the sex act is committed by the somnophiliac is a stranger not previously known intimately to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nusbaum 2005, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The somnophiliac may create an unconscious state in the victim by drugging them, or may engage in sex with someone who is inebriated or asleep.&lt;ref name="ferguson139"&gt;Ferguson 2010, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator becomes attracted to the idea of a sexual participant who is unable to resist their advances.&lt;ref name="ferguson139" /&gt;

''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' classified the term in 2000 under DSM-IV TR code 302.9 and in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] under [[ICD-10]] code F65.9.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 2010, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dictionary of Psychology'' categorized somnophilia within the classification of predatory paraphilias.&lt;ref name="corsini747"&gt;Corsini 2001, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Physicians have attempted to treat somnophilia with forms of [[psychotherapy]], as well as with medications used for [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; However, [[James Cantor]], psychologist and editor-in-chief of ''[[Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment]]'' stated: "There are occasional claims for treatment, but no one has presented meaningful, compelling evidence that someone with a paraphilia can be turned into someone without a paraphilia. As far as we can tell, it’s like sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; The condition can be thought of as a fetish or sexual preference which could be incorporated into a healthy partnership based upon consent.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt; Somnophilia rises to the level of [[diagnosis]] when it causes "significant impairment", specifically, when the individual performing the sex act does so with a partner who does not give their consent.&lt;ref name="carey" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Somnophilia has presented itself as a recurring phenomenon in [[popular culture]], including in the [[French film]] influenced by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] movies, ''[[Who Killed Bambi? (2003 film)|Who Killed Bambi?]]'' ({{lang-fr|Qui a tué Bambi ?}}).&lt;ref name="ferguson156"&gt;Ferguson 2010, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of the [[horror film]] involves a surgeon who drugs his female patients in order to subsequently engage in sexual intercourse with them without their consent.&lt;Ref name="ferguson156" /&gt; The assailant resorts to [[murder]] after one of the women wakes up from her unconscious state as he begins to remove her clothing.&lt;ref name="ferguson156" /&gt; The title character attempts to warn the board of directors at the hospital of the murderer's activity.&lt;ref name="ferguson156" /&gt;

[[Image:Station biologique de Roscoff.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Station biologique de Roscoff]]The '''Station biologique de Roscoff (SBR)''' is a French [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]] research and teaching center. Founded by [[:fr:Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers|Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers]] (1821&amp;ndash;1901) in 1872, it is at the present time affiliated to the [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]] (UPMC), the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers et de l'Environnement (INSU) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ([[CNRS]]).

== Overview ==
The Station biologique is situated in [[Roscoff]] on the northern coast of [[Brittany]] ([[France]]) about 60&amp;nbsp;km east of Brest. Its location offers access to exceptional variety of biotopes, most of which are accessible at low tide. These biotopes support a large variety of both plant (700) and animal (3000) marine species. Founded in 1872 by Professor Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers (then Zoology Chair at the Sorbonne University ),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVhAvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Hybrid+Shore+The+Marine+Station+Movement+and+Scientific+Uses+of+the+Littoral&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibtcmNu5vTAhUh_4MKHQnqCu0Q6AEIIzAA|title=Soundings and Crossings: Doing Science at Sea, 1800-1970|last=Anderson|first=Katharine|last2=Rozwadowski|first2=Helen M.|date=2016-09-01|publisher=Watson Publishing International, LLC|year=|isbn=9780881351446|location=|pages=145–178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SBR constitutes, since March 1985, the Internal School 937 of the Pierre and Marie Curie University (UPMC). In November 1985, the SBR was given the status of Oceanographic Observatory by the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers et de l'Environnement (National Institute for the Cosmological and Environmental Sciences; INSU). The SBR is also, since January 2001, a Research Federation within the Life Sciences Department of the CNRS.

The personnel of the SBR, which includes about 200 permanent staff, consists of scientists, teaching scientists, technicians, postdoctoral fellows, PhD students and administrative staff. These personnel is organized into various research groups within research units that are recognised by the Life Sciences Department of the CNRS (the current research units have the following codes: FR 2424, UMR 7139, UMR 7144, UMR 7150 and UPS 2682). The various research groups work on a wide range of topics, ranging from investigation of the fine structure and function of biological macromolecules to global oceanic studies. Genomic approaches constitute an important part of many of the research programmes, notably via the European Network of Excellence "Marine Genomics" which is coordinated by the SBR. With the accommodation facilities at its hotel and its teaching facilities and equipment, the SBR provides conditions for teaching a range of subjects including [[zoology]], [[phycology]] and coastal [[oceanography]]. Teaching at the SBR includes courses that form part of the UPMC Master's program and the European Socrates. The SBR is part of the genomics network "OUEST-genopole" and runs a genomics platform "sequencing and mass spectrometry applied to biology". The station publishes (since 1960) a bilingual scientific journal, the ''Cahiers de Biologie Marine'' (CBM). The SBR also hosts between 12 and 15 national and international conferences per year, including the Jacques Monod Conferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16152">'''Ultra-high vacuum''' ('''UHV''') is the [[vacuum]] regime characterised by [[pressure]]s lower than about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] or 100 nanopascals (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[milli|m]][[Bar (unit)|bar]], ~10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the [[mean free path]] of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km, so the gas is in [[free molecular flow]], and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber.

UHV conditions are integral to scientific research. [[Surface science]] experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted [[Adsorption|adsorbates]]. Surface analysis tools such as [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] and [[low energy ion scattering]] require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] are kept at UHV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Concepts involved ==
* [[Sorption]] of gases
* [[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]] of gases
* Gas transport and pumping
* [[Vacuum pump]]s and [[vacuum system|system]]s
* [[Vapour pressure]]

== Material limitations ==
Maintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100&amp;nbsp;°C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which [[adsorption|adsorb]] on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon "cycling" the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an "interlock" is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a "puff" of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.

Many common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: "through-gassing"):
* Majority of [[organic compounds]] cannot be used:
** [[Plastics]], other than [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] and [[Polyether ether ketone|PEEK]]: [[gasket]]s are made of copper, and are single-use; plastics in other uses are replaced with [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] or metals.  Limited use of fluoroelastomers (such as [[Viton]]) and perfluoroelastomers (such as [[Kalrez]]) as gasket materials can be considered if metal gaskets are inconvenient, though these polymers can be expensive.
** [[Glue]]s: special glues for high vacuum must be used.
* Some [[steels]]: due to oxidization of [[carbon steel]], which greatly increases adsorption area, only [[stainless steel]] is used.  Particularly, non-leaded and low-sulfur [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] grades such as [[304 stainless steel|304]] and [[316 stainless steel|316]] are preferred.  These steels include at least 18% chromium and 8% nickel.  Variants of stainless steel include low-carbon grades (such as [[304L]] and [[316L]]), and grades with additives such as [[niobium]] and [[molybdenum]] to reduce the formation of [[chromium carbide]] (which provides no corrosion resistance).  Common designations include 316L (low carbon), and 316LN (low carbon with nitrogen).  Chromium carbide precipitation at the [[grain boundaries]] can render a stainless steel less resistant to oxidation.  
* [[Lead]]: Soldering is performed using [[Solder#Lead-free solder|lead-free solder]].
* [[Indium]]: Indium is sometimes used as a deformable gasket material for vacuum seals, especially in cryogenic apparatus, but its low melting point prevents use in baked systems.
* [[Zinc]], [[cadmium]]: High vapor pressures during system bake-out.
* Cleaning is very important for UHV.  Common cleaning procedures include degreasing with detergents, [[organic solvents]], or [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]].  [[Electropolishing]] is often used to reduce the surface area from which adsorbed gases can be emitted. Etching of stainless steel using hydrofluoric and nitric acid forms a chromium rich surface, followed by a nitric acid [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] step, which forms a chromium oxide rich surface.  This surface retards the diffusion of hydrogen into the chamber.

Technical limitations: 
* [[Screws]]: Threads have a high surface area and tend to "trap" gases, and therefore, are avoided.  Blind holes are especially avoided, due to the trapped gas at the base of the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a "virtual leak".  This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vented Screws - AccuGroup|url=https://www.accu.co.uk/en/971-vented-screws|publisher=accu.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Welding]]: Processes such as [[gas metal arc welding]] and [[shielded metal arc welding]] cannot be used, due to the deposition of [[slag|impure material]] and potential introduction of voids or porosity. [[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as [[electron beam welding]] or [[laser beam welding]], are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential [[slag]] inclusions (such as [[submerged arc welding]] and [[flux-cored arc welding]]) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.

== Typical uses ==

Ultra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as:
* [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS)
* [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES)
* [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS)
* [[Thermal desorption spectroscopy]] (TPD)
* [[Thin film]] growth and preparation techniques with stringent requirements for purity, such as [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), UHV [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD) and UHV [[pulsed laser deposition]] (PLD)
* [[Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES)
* [[Field emission microscopy]] and [[Field ion microscopy]]
* [[Atom Probe|Atom Probe Tomography]] (APT)

UHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period.  At 0.1 mPa (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Torr), it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments.

UHV is also required for:
* [[Particle accelerator]]s The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has three UH vacuum systems. The lowest pressure is found in the pipes the proton beam speeds through near the interaction (collision) points. Here helium cooling pipes also act as cryopumps. The maximum allowable pressure is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) 
* [[Gravitational wave detector]]s such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], [[GEO 600]], and [[TAMA 300]]. The [[LIGO]] experimental apparatus is housed in a 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (353,000 cu.ft.) vacuum chamber at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) in order to eliminate temperature fluctuations and sound waves which would jostle the mirrors far too much for gravity waves to be sensed. 
* [[Atomic physics]] experiments which use cold atoms, such as [[ion trap]]ping or making [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s
and, while not compulsory, can prove beneficial in applications such as:
* [[Molecular beam epitaxy]], [[Electron beam evaporation|E-beam evaporation]], [[sputtering]] and other deposition techniques.   
* [[Atomic force microscopy]]. High vacuum enables high [[Q factor]]s on the cantilever oscillation.
* [[Scanning tunneling microscopy]]. High vacuum reduces oxidation and contamination, hence enables imaging and the achievement of atomic resolution on clean metal and [[semiconductor]] surfaces, e.g. imaging the [[surface reconstruction]] of the unoxidized [[silicon]] surface.
* [[Electron-beam lithography]]

== Achievement ==
Typically, UHV requires:
*High pumping speed &amp;mdash; possibly multiple [[vacuum pump]]s in series and/or parallel
*Minimize surface area in the chamber
*High conductance tubing to pumps &amp;mdash; short and fat, without obstruction
*Use low-[[outgassing]] materials such as certain stainless steels
*Avoid creating pits of trapped gas behind bolts, welding voids, etc.
*[[Electropolishing|Electropolish]] all metal parts after machining or welding
*Use low vapor pressure materials (ceramics, glass, metals, teflon if unbaked)
*Bake the system to remove water or hydrocarbons [[adsorbed]] to the walls
*Chill chamber walls to [[cryogenic]] temperatures during use
*Avoid all traces of hydrocarbons, including skin oils in a fingerprint &amp;mdash; always use gloves

[[Outgassing]] is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, [[stainless steel]], and [[ceramic]]s) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as [[palladium]] (which is a high-capacity [[hydrogen]] sponge) create special outgassing problems.

Outgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce outgassing further.

[[Hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] are the most common background gases in a well-designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the [[grain boundaries]] in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere.

There is no single [[vacuum pump]] that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. Pumps commonly used to achieve UHV include:
*[[Turbomolecular pump]]s (especially compound and/or [[magnetic bearing]] types)
*[[Ion pump]]s
*[[Titanium sublimation pump]]s
*[[Non-Evaporable Getter|Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps]]
*[[Cryopump]]s

UHV pressures are measured with an [[ion gauge]], either a hot filament or an inverted magnetron type.

Metal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket. This all-metal seal can maintain pressures down to 100 pPa (~10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; Torr).

== UHV manipulator ==
A '''UHV manipulator''' allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned.  It may provide rotary
motion, linear motion, or a combination of both.  The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes.  To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, two basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling), or a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side.  Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, [[stepping motor]]s, [[piezoelectric motor]]s, and [[pneumatics]].

The manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field.  Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the
electrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat.  For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.

'''World energy consumption''' is the total [[energy]] used by the entire human [[civilization]]. Typically measured per year, it involves all energy harnessed from every [[energy development|energy source]] applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector, across every country. It does not include energy from food, and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented.  Being the power source metric of civilization, World Energy Consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere.

Institutions such as the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA), and the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA) record and publish energy data periodically. Improved data and understanding of World Energy Consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns, which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions.

Closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total [[primary energy]] supply (TPES), which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes. Since changes of energy storage over the year are minor, TPES values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption. However, TPES ignores conversion efficiency, overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency (e.g. [[coal]], gas and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]) and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms (e.g. [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic]] or [[hydroelectricity]]). The IEA estimates that, in 2013, total primary energy supply (TPES) was 1.575 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Watt hour|Wh]] (= 157.5 PWh, 157,500 TWh, 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s, or 13,541 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) or about 18 TW-year.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title= IEA - Key world energy statistics, 2015 |url=ftp://ftp.energia.bme.hu/pub/energetikai_alapismeretek/KeyWorld_Statistics_2015.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth. The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth, followed by hydropower and renewable energy. Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period. The demand for nuclear energy decreased, in part due to nuclear disasters (e.g. [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] 1979, [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] 1986, and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] 2011).&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="undp"&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf World Energy Assessment] (WEA). UNDP, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, World Energy Council, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion USD, or about 10% of the world [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Europe spends close to one-quarter of the world's energy expenditures, North America close to 20%, and Japan 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Desbrosses, [http://www.leonardo-energy.org/blog/world-energy-expenditures World Energy Expenditures], Leonardo Energy, Nov. 28 2011 (accessed 30 January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

World [[primary energy|total primary energy supply]] (TPES), or "primary energy" differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers. For instance, when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline, so that it can be used in a car, and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers. World final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity.

Also, one needs to bear in mind that there are different [[Energy quality|qualities of energy]]. Heat, especially at a relatively low temperature, is low-quality energy, whereas electricity is high-quality energy. It takes around 3&amp;nbsp;kWh of heat to produce 1&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity. But by the same token, a kilowatt-hour of this high-quality electricity can be used to pump several kilowatt-hours of heat into a building using a heat pump. And electricity can be used in many ways in which heat cannot. So the "loss" of energy incurred when generating electricity is not the same as a loss due, say, to resistance in power lines

In 2014, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481&amp;nbsp;terawatt-hour (TWh) or 13,541&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]], while the world final energy consumption was 109,613&amp;nbsp;TWh or about 29.5% less than the total supply.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2016"/&gt; World final energy consumption includes products as lubricants, asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel. This non-energy use amounted to 
9,723 TWh (836 Mtoe) in 2015.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2017"/&gt;

The United States [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources. For 2013, estimated world energy consumption was 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; joules, or 157,481&amp;nbsp;TWh. According to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] the total world energy consumption in past years was 143,851 TWh in 2008, 133,602&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, 117,687&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000, and 102,569&amp;nbsp;TWh in 1990.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015" /&gt; In 2012 approximately 22% of world energy was consumed in North America, 5% was consumed South and Central America, 23% was consumed in Europe and Eurasia, 3% was consumed in Africa, and 40% was consumed in the Asia Pacific region.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

===Electricity generation===
The total amount of electricity consumed worldwide was 19,504&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2013, 16,503&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2008, 15,105&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, and 12,116&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000. 
By the end of 2014, the total installed electricity generating capacity worldwide was nearly 6.142 [[Terawatt|TW]] (million MW) which only includes generation connected to local [[electricity grid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Electricity - Installed generating capacity, 2014 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2236.html#xx|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition there is an unknown amount of heat and electricity consumed off-grid by isolated villages and industries. 
In 2014, the share of world energy consumption for electricity generation by source was coal at 40.8%, natural gas at 21.6%, nuclear at 10.6%, hydro at 16.4%, other sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) at 6.3% and oil at 4.3%. 
Coal and natural gas were the most used energy fuels for generating electricity. 
The world's electricity consumption was 18,608&amp;nbsp;TWh {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} in 2012. 
This figure is about 18% smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and self-consumption from power plants ([[gross generation]]). 
[[Cogeneration]] (CHP) power stations use some of the heat that is otherwise wasted for use in buildings or in industrial processes.

In 2016 while total world energy came from 80% fossil fuels, 10% biofuels, 5% nuclear and 5% renewable (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal), only 18% of that total world energy was in the form of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenarios-energy-models/world-energy-model/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1510344160326/d62f12b8fe88e85dc3349c38b1ca5e44cc22c5ccc6f70beed634020cfb527c82/shell-world-energy-model.pdf pg4&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other 82% was used for heat and transportation.

Recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Global energy: perspectives"&gt;{{cite book |last= Nakićenović |first= Nebojša |last2= Grübler|first2= Arnulf |last3= McDonald|first3= Alan | date= 1998 |title= Global energy: perspectives |location= Cambridge, New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0521642000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt; From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, oil, coal, and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

The energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2% in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth. For several years now, the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish Chinese and Indian markets, while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies, high oil prices, resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/energy-press-releases/sluggish-growth-world-energy-demand-in-2011.php|title=Sluggish growth of World energy demand in 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10% while world population increased 27%. Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by 170%, China by 146%, India by 91%, Africa by 70%, Latin America by 66%, the USA by 20%, the EU-27 block by 7%, and world overall grew by 39%.

In 2008, total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours ([[TWh]]) or 474 exajoules ([[exajoules|EJ]]).&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web |work= Statistical Review of World Energy 2009 |publisher= [[BP]] |url= http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |title= Consumption by fuel, 1965–2008 |format= XLS |date= 8 June 2009 |accessdate= 24 October 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130726202544/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |archivedate= 26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, primary energy demand increased to 158,000 TWh (567&amp;nbsp;EJ).&lt;ref name=EIAIES2015&gt;{{cite web |title= International Energy Statistics|accessdate= 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy consumption in the [[Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors|G20]] increased by more than 5% in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. In 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1%, or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent ([[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]), as a result of the financial and economic crisis, which reduced world GDP by 0.6% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/publications/world-energy-statistics-supply-and-demand.php|title=World Energy Statistics – Energy Supply &amp; Demand |publisher= Enerdata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This evolution is the result of two contrasting trends: Energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries, specifically in Asia (+4%). Conversely, in OECD, consumption was severely cut by 4.7% in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels. In North America, Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], consumptions shrank by 4.5%, 5% and 8.5% respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity. China became the world's largest energy consumer (18% of the total) since its consumption surged by 8% during 2009 (up from 4% in 2008). Oil remained the largest energy source (33%) despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time. Coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption: in 2009, it accounted for 27% of the total.

Most energy is used in the country of origin, since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials. In 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was: oil 50% (1,952/3,941&amp;nbsp;Mt), gas 25% (800/3,149&amp;nbsp;bcm) and hard coal 14% (793/5,845&amp;nbsp;Mt).&lt;ref name=IEA20109&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] and [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2009/key_stats_2009.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2009] oil page 11, gas p.13, hard coal (excluding brown coal) p. 15 and electricity p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy, some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter ''(see [[solar constant]])'', though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of [[Solar energy#Energy from the Sun|solar energy]] received by the planet; about half, 89,000&amp;nbsp;TW, reaches the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= William |last= Schreiber |url= http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/196/schreiber.html |title= Solving the Energy Problem |work= MIT Faculty Newsletter |date=May–June 2007 |accessdate= 2016-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary, with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4&amp;nbsp; yottajoule ([[Yottajoule|YJ]]) or 4 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules, and the available nuclear fuel such as [[uranium]] exceeding 2.5&amp;nbsp;YJ. Fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3&amp;nbsp;YJ if estimates of reserves of [[methane clathrates]] are accurate and become technically extractable. The total power flux from the sun intercepting the Earth is 5.5&amp;nbsp;YJ per year, though not all of this is available for human consumption. The IEA estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of $48 trillion and "credible policy frameworks."&lt;ref name="IEAreport"&gt;{{cite news |title= IEA estimates $48tn investments till 2035 to meet global energy demands |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-03/energy-supply-requires-40-trillion-investment-to-2035-iea-says.html |accessdate= 4 June 2014 |publisher= [[Bloomberg News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IEA (2012) the goal of limiting warming to 2&amp;nbsp;°C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes. If action is not taken before 2017, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017.

=== Emissions ===
[[Global warming]] [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] resulting from energy production are an [[environmental problem]]. Efforts to resolve this include the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (1997) and the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015), international governmental agreements aiming to [[Climate change mitigation|reduce harmful climate impacts]], which a number of nations have signed. Limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, thought to be a risk by the [[Stockholm Environmental Institute|SEI]], is now doubtful.

To limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in [[carbon emissions]] in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Energiläget 2050 by prof. Cristian Azar and Kristian Lindgren [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers]] [[Göteborg]] {{sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem. Hypothetically, according to [[Robert Engelman]] (Worldwatch institute), in order to prevent collapse, human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).&lt;ref&gt;''State of the world 2009'', [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenhouse gases]] are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption. Large amounts of pollutants such as [[sulphurous oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[particulate matter]] (PM) are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; the [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] [[combustion]] is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to producing air pollution like [[fossil fuel]] combustion, most biomass has high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PFPI-biomass-carbon-accounting-overview_April.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil fuels ===
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

The twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels. Between 1980 and 2006, the worldwide annual growth rate was 2%.&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; According to the US [[Energy Information Administration]]'s 2006 estimate, the estimated 471.8&amp;nbsp;EJ total consumption in 2004, was divided as given in the table above, with fossil fuels supplying 86% of the world's energy:

====Coal====
{{Main article|Coal|List of countries by coal production}}

In 2000, China accounted for 28% of world coal consumption, other Asia consumed 19%, North America 25% and the EU 14%. The single greatest coal-consuming country is China. Its share of the world coal production was 28% in 2000 and rose to 48% in 2009. In contrast to China's ~70% increase in coal consumption, world coal use increased 48% from 2000 to 2009. In practice, the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other Asia.&lt;ref name="energisve2010Coal"/&gt; China's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector, the majority of which comes from coal consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Damien. "China's Coming Decade of Natural Gas". ''Asia's Uncertain LNG Future, NBR Special Report''. November 2013. Retrieved 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

World annual coal production increased 1,905&amp;nbsp;Mt or 32% in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005, of which over 70% was in China and 8% in India. Coal production was in 2011 7,783&amp;nbsp;Mt, and 2009 6,903&amp;nbsp;Mt, equal to 12.7% production increase in two years.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012, 2010 and 2006 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

If production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years. This is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe. Coal is the largest source of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in the world. According to [[James Hansen]] the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from [[Coal mining|coal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/true-cost-coal.pdf The True Cost of Coal] 27 November 2008 pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Energy in Australia|Australia]] exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of all the world coal import in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oil ====
{{Main article|Petroleum|List of countries by oil production|List of countries by oil consumption}}

Coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity, [[Petroleum|oil]] became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century. The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. After the oil shocks of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]], during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; Coal, natural gas, and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency. In the U.S. the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon. Japan, which bore the brunt of the oil shocks, made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world.&lt;ref name = "IEAKey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= International Energy Agency |title= Key World Energy Statistics |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 }} pp. 48–57&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. From 2003 to 2008, coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers needed on book sources --&gt;

It is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090507072830.htm How Much Oil Have We Used?], [[Science Daily]], 8 May 2009. Retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natural Gas ====
{{Main article|Natural Gas|List of countries by natural gas production|List of countries by natural gas consumption}}

In 2009, the world use of natural gas grew 31% compared to 2000. 66% of this growth was outside EU, North America, Latin America, and Russia. Others include the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The gas supply increased also in the previous regions: 8.6% in the EU and 16% in the North America 2000–2009.&lt;ref name="energiläget2010G"/&gt;

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like [[Renewable energy in China|China]] and the [[Renewable energy in the United States|United States]] heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title= Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author= [[REN21]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate= 4 September 2014 |year= 2014 |pages= 13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.

From 2000 to 2013 the total renewable energy use has increased 6,450 TWh and total energy use 40,500 TWh.

==== Hydro ====
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower}}

Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which continues the rapid rate of increase experienced between 2003 and 2009.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with {{convert|721|TWh|PJ|abbr=on|order=flip}} of production in 2010, representing around 17% of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10&amp;nbsp;GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] in Brazil, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title= Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |publisher= Worldwatch Institute |date= January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|worlds top 10 renewable electricity producers]] are primarily hydroelectric, one is wind.

==== Marine energy ====
{{Main article|Ocean energy}}
[[Marine energy]], also known as ''ocean energy'' and ''marine and hydrokinetic energy'' (MHK) includes [[tidal power|tidal]] and [[wave power|wave]] power and is a relatively new sector of renewable energy, with most projects still in the pilot phase, but the theoretical potential is equivalent to 4–18 million tonne of oil equivalent (toe). MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream [[turbine]]s in fast-moving [[river]]s, ocean current turbines in areas of strong [[marine current]]s, and [[ocean thermal energy converter]]s in deep tropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tethys |url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Solar ====
{{Main article|Solar energy|Solar power|Solar power by country}}

Solar energy, radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], has been harnessed by humans since [[ancient history|ancient times]] using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] and [[solar architecture]], which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces. The [[International Energy Agency]] projected that solar power could provide "a third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be reduced to very low levels."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s and [[solar thermal collector]]s to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. From 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3% of global energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bio energy ====
{{Main article|Biomass|Biogas|Biofuel}}

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from [[biomass]] sources was estimated at 44&amp;nbsp;GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220&amp;nbsp;GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264&amp;nbsp;GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; World production of [[Ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] increased by 8% in 2005 to reach {{convert|33|GL|usgal|lk=on}}, with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; [[Biodiesel]] increased by 85% to {{convert|3.9|GL|usgal}}, making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005. Over 50% is produced in Germany.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt;

[[File:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|World energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]]

Energy consumption is loosely correlated with [[Gross National Product#Gross National Product|gross national product]] and climate, but there is a large difference even between the most highly developed countries, such as Japan and Germany with an energy consumption rate of 6&amp;nbsp;kW per person and the [[Energy use in the United States|United States]] with an energy consumption rate of 11.4&amp;nbsp;kW per person. In developing countries, particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as India, the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7&amp;nbsp;kW. Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

The US consumes 25% of the world's energy with a share of global GDP at 22% and a share of the world population at 4.59%.&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://esa.un.org/UNPP/ |title= World Population Prospects |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= 7 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070321013235/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |archive-date= 21 March 2007 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China, which has been growing at 5.5% per year over the last 25 years. Its population of 1.3 billion people (19.6% of the world population&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects" /&gt;) is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

One measurement of efficiency is [[energy intensity]]. This is a measure of the amount of energy it takes a country to produce a dollar of gross domestic product.

The table to the right shows the amounts of energy consumed worldwide in 2012 by four sectors, according to the [[Energy Information Administration]] of the [[US Department of Energy]]:
*Residential (heating, lighting, and appliances)
*Commercial (lighting, heating and cooling of commercial buildings, and provision of water and sewer services)
*Industrial users (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction)
*Transportation (passenger, freight, and pipeline)
Of the total 120 PWh ({{val|120e15|ul=Wh}}) consumed, 19.4 were in the form of electricity, but this electricity required 61.7 PWh to produce. Thus the total energy consumption was around 160 PWh (ca {{val|550e15|ul=Btu}}).&lt;ref name=EIA2016/&gt; The efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy efficiency measures and technological improvements. |url= http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |publisher= e8.org |accessdate= 21 January 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204112155/http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |archivedate= 4 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }} Article by group of ten leading electricity companies&lt;/ref&gt; The new generation of gas-fired plants reaches a substantially higher efficiency of 55%.

Another report gives different values for the sectors, apparently due to different definitions. According to this, total world energy use per sector in 2008 was industry 28%, transport 27% and residential and service 36%. Division was about the same in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="energisve2010xS"/&gt;

===European Union===
The [[European Environmental Agency]] (EEA) measures final energy consumption (does not include energy used in production and lost in transportation) and finds that the transport sector is responsible for 31.8% of final energy consumption, households 26.2%, industry 25.6%, [[service (economics)|services]] 13.5% and agriculture 2.9% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;European Environmental Agency. {{Cite web|url = http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/final-energy-consumption-by-sector-8/assessment-2|title = Final energy consumption by sector and fuel (CSI 027/ENER 016) - Assessment published Jan 2015|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }} Retrieved 21 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of energy is responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions (79%), with the energy sector representing 31%, transport 19%, industry 13%, households 9% and others 7%.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Hoos [[European Commission]] 2011. [http://eme2.eu/cust/documentrequest.aspx?DocID=148 A new Directive on Energy Efficiency]. Retrieved 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[efficient energy use]] and resource efficiency are growing as public policy issues, more than 70% of [[coal plants]] in the [[European Union]] are more than 20 years old and operate at an efficiency level of between 32–40%.&lt;ref name=EC1&gt;[[European Commission]] 2011. [http://eme2.eu/cust/documentrequest.aspx?DocID=152 Impact Assessment Accompanying the document Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC]. p. 106.

[[Image:Yde_bog_girl.jpg|thumb|Location where the Yde Girl was found]]

'''Yde Girl''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ɪ|d|ə|audio=Yde IPA.ogg}}) is a [[bog body]] found in the ''Stijfveen'' [[peat]] bog near the village of [[Yde]], [[Netherlands]]. She was found on 12 May 1897 and was reputedly uncannily well-preserved when discovered (especially her [[hair]]), but by the time the body was turned over to the authorities a [[fortnight]] later it had been severely damaged and deteriorated.&lt;ref name=deem&gt;{{cite web|last=Deem|first=James M.|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|title=Drents Museum in Assen, the Netherlands: The Yde Girl|accessdate=16 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152742/http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her teeth had been pulled from the skull by villagers as well as a large amount of hair.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt; The peat cutting tools had also been reported to have severely damaged the body.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

==Examination==
[[Image:DrentseBody.jpg|thumb|left|The Yde Girl's body]]

[[Carbon-14]] tests have indicated that Yde Girl died between 54 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 128 CE at an approximate age of 16 years.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; She had long reddish blond hair, but one side of her head was initially thought to have been shaved before she died. Recent studies of [[Windeby I]], however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest to one side of the head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from [[scoliosis]]. She stood at {{convert|137|cm|ftin}}, which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

The body was found clad in a woolen cape and with a woolen band, made in a braiding technique known as [[sprang]], wrapped around the neck, suggesting she was executed or sacrificed.&lt;ref name=city&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper|title=BEST MUSEUM EXHIBIT: THE MYSTERIOUS BOG PEOPLE|date=7 December 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dan&gt;{{cite news|last=Nephin|first=Dan|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=AP Online|title=Mummy Exhibit Shows Off Interactive Side|date=6 July 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a stab wound in the area of her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the [[Kayhausen Boy]], who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the [[tannic acid]] in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools.

[[Image:Yde Face Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|1992 facial reconstruction by artist [[Richard Neave]]]]

The Yde Girl was put on display and further study was not carried out on the remains until 1992. [[Richard Neave]], of University of Manchester, took a [[CT scan]] of the skull of Yde Girl and determined her age, both anatomically and historically.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohd Isa|first=Marisa|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82747279.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=News Straits Times|title=Unveiling mummy secrets|date=6 January 2006}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yde Girl became internationally known when Neave made a reconstruction of her head, using techniques from [[plastic surgery]] and criminal [[pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Prag | first1 = John | last2 = Neave | first2 = Richard | title = Making faces: using forensic and archaeological evidence |trans-title=Bodies from the Bog | year = 1997 | publisher = British Museum | location = London | language = | isbn = 0-7141-1743-9 | pages = 157–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the state of the body, the work on the reconstruction included some guesswork, for example, the nose.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the [[Drents Museum]] in [[Assen]].

Yde Girl, along with [[Roter Franz]] and the [[Weerdinge Men]], were transported across the world for a museum tour in both the early and mid 2000s.&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Sue Ellen|title=Visit the mummies before they leave for L.A.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-71012131.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Sunday Gazette-Mail|date=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref name=dan/&gt; Due to the intensity of the girl's death, protests in [[Canada]] prevented the tour from traveling through several locations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CULTURE-CANADA: 'BOG PEOPLE' MUMMIES PROVOKE PROTESTS|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Inter Press Service English News Wire|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2003/01/arts-weekly-culture-canada-bog-people-display-provokes-protest/|first=Mark|last=Bourrie|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
