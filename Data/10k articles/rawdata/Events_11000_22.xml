The '''1932 Changma earthquake''' occurred at 10:04:27 local time (02:04:07 [[Coordinated universal time|UTC]]) on 25 December. With an estimated magnitude of 7.6 on the [[surface wave magnitude]] scale, and a maximum felt intensity of X (''Extreme'') on the [[Mercalli intensity scale]], the quake destroyed 1,167 houses, and 275 people were killed with a further 320 injured.&lt;ref name="NGDC"/&gt;

==Tectonic setting==
The [[earthquake]] was located close to the northern margin of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. This area of thickened crust is a result of the ongoing collision of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The way in which this zone accommodates the collision remains unclear with two end-member models being proposed. The first regards the crust as being made up of a mosaic of strong blocks separated by weak [[Fault (geology)|fault zones]], the microplate model. The second regards the deformation as being continuous within the mid to lower crust, the continuum model. The change in width of the deformed zone along the collisional belt, with the narrow zone of western Tibet compared to the main part of the Tibetan Plateau, is explained as either lateral escape to the east along the [[Altyn Tagh fault|Altyn Tagh]] and [[Karakorum fault]]s in the microplate model or as the effect of the rigid Tarim Basin block causing heterogeneous deformation within a generally weaker lithosphere in the continuum model.&lt;ref name="Cowgill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowgill |first=E. |author2=Yin, A. |author3=Harrison T.M. |author4=Xiao-Feng, W. |year=2003 |title=Reconstruction of the Altyn Tagh fault based on U-Pb geochronology: Role of back thrusts, mantle sutures, and heterogeneous crustal strength in forming the Tibetan Plateau |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=108 |issue=B7 |page=2346 |doi=10.1029/2002JB002080 |url=http://sims.ess.ucla.edu/PDF/Cowgill_et_al_2003_Jour%20Geophys%20Res.pdf |accessdate=3 November 2010 |bibcode=2003JGRB..108.2346C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718114705/http://sims.ess.ucla.edu/PDF/Cowgill_et_al_2003_Jour%20Geophys%20Res.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2010 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.458.2239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its northern end, the Altyn Tagh fault progressively loses displacement by its interaction with a series of WNW–ESE trending structures, mostly with components of reverse displacement and sinistral (left lateral) strike-slip. The Changma fault is one of those structures.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-246X.1998.00567.x |last=Meyer |first=B. |author2=Tapponnier, P. |author3=Bourjot, L. |author4=Métivier, F. |author5=Gaudemer, Y. |author6=Peltzer, G. |author7=Shunmin, G. |author8=Zhitai, C.|year=1998 |title=Crustal thickening in Gansu-Qinghai, lithospheric mantle subduction, and oblique, strike-slip controlled growth of the Tibetan plateau |journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]] |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=1–47 |bibcode=1998GeoJI.135....1M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damage==
The region stricken by this earthquake included the entire [[Changma Basin]] and the western part of the [[Hexi Corridor]] in [[Gansu province]].&lt;ref name="NGDC"/&gt; The greatest damage occurred in Changma. In [[Gaotai County|Gaotai]], [[Jinta County|Jinta]], [[Guazhou County|Anxi]] and [[Dingxing County|Dingxin]] part of the city walls and some buildings collapsed and many houses were damaged. In the town of Changma all 800 families were affected, 270 people died and at least another 300 were injured; deaths were also recorded in Gaotai (3) and Jinta (2).&lt;ref name="NGDC"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
A [[surface rupture]] of about 116&amp;nbsp;km was identified after the earthquake, including five separate fault segments,&lt;ref name="NGDC"/&gt; the largest rupture observed for a reverse-slip event in Asia in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=Y.-G. |author2=Chen, W.-S. |author3=Wang, Y. |author4=Lo, P.W. |author5=Liu, T.K. |author6=Lee, J.C. |year=2002 |title=Geomorphic evidence for prior earthquakes: Lessons from the 1999 Chichi earthquake in central Taiwan |journal=Geology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=171–174 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030&lt;0171:GEFPEL&gt;2.0.CO;2 |url=http://ashan.gl.ntu.edu.tw/publication/Publication-info_20100423/43.%20Geomorphic%20evidence%20for%20prior%20earthquakes%20Lessons%20from%20the%201999%20Chichi%20earthquake%20in%20central%20Taiwan.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2010|bibcode = 2002Geo....30..171C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the segments that ruptured were reverse faults, the fifth was a strike-slip fault. Vertical offsets of more than a metre were observed on most of the segments, with a maximum of 5 m.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=C.M. |year=1996 |title=Systematic underestimation of earthquake magnitudes from large intracontinental reverse faults: Historical ruptures break across segment boundaries |pages=989 |journal=Geology |volume=24 |issue=11 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0989:SUOEMF&gt;2.3.CO;2 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/11/989 |accessdate=18 November 2010|bibcode = 1996Geo....24..989R |hdl=2060/19980029715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic hazard implications ==
The 1932 Changma earthquake shows that apparently separate mapped intracontinental reverse faults may rupture simultaneously in an earthquake. Estimates of the [[seismic hazard]] in an area based on the rupture of single reverse faults may lead to a major underestimate of the magnitudes of the largest possible earthquake.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

On January 16, 1998 five [[Americans|American]] students were raped while on a school sponsored trip to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=balsun&gt;{{cite news |title=5 students raped in Guatemala St. Mary's College tour group's bus overtaken by bandits |first=Timothy |last=Wheeler |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-01-19/news/1998019082_1_guatemala-students-mary-college |newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=January 19, 1998 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case led to attention from the highest levels of the American and Guatemalan governments, including then-US president [[Bill Clinton]], and led to concerns about whether the safety of students was adequately protected while traveling abroad.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Guatemala Rapes Raise Concerns Over Study Trips |first=James |last=Risen |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/20/news/mn-10163 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 20, 1998 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students were studying at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=balsun /&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt;

==Background==
The college at the time conducted annual tours for students to Guatemala.  The 17-day tours were conducted during the winter recess and were offered for college credit.  The school was conducting its third such tour and noted that there had been no problems on either of the previous tours.  However, violence against women had been rising in the area.  In July 1997, a public bus was hijacked with everyone being robbed and five women, including two American citizens, being raped.  Four other American women were raped in Guatemala in other incidents in July and August 1997.&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news |title=5 From Md.

==Details==
A group of 13 students—12 women and 1 man—along with 2 faculty members and 1 administrator from St. Mary's College were returning to [[Guatemala City]] after an excursion on an educational tour of Guatemala.  At about 3:30pm on January 16, 1998, their bus was forced off the road by at least four gunmen.  Gunshots were fired to force the driver to pull into a ditch alongside the road.  The bus was forced into a nearby sugar cane field where it wasn't visible from the road.  All of the group were robbed, but the gunmen were disappointed that they weren't carrying more cash.  Five women were then selected to be raped.&lt;ref name=balsun /&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt;  One was raped on the bus in front of classmates and the other four were raped in the field.&lt;ref name=deseret&gt;{{cite news |title=Are We All Dead?

The women who were raped were aged 19 and 20.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost2&gt;{{cite news |title=Traveling in a Troubled Land |first=John |last=Anderson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/stmarysrape/stmarysrape.htm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=January 22, 1998 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rape victims returned to the United States on January 17, 1998 with the rest of the group following the next day.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost2/&gt;

==Criminal trial==
Two of the rape victims returned to Guatemala in January 1999 to testify against their attackers.  The men accused were Cosby Urias, a 37-year-old laborer; Rony Polanco, a 25-year-old driver; and Reyes Guch Ventura, a 25-year-old peddler.&lt;ref name=cbcnews&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. students testify in Guatemala rape trial |last=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-students-testify-in-guatemala-rape-trial-1.178819 |newspaper=[[CBC News]] |date=January 21, 1999 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three men were convicted and sentenced to 28 years in prison:  18 years for rape and 10 years for robbery.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |title=3 Guatemalans Get Jail in Tourist Rapes |last=NY Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/09/world/3-guatemalans-get-jail-in-tourist-rapes.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=February 9, 1999 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil lawsuit==
Three of the students sued the college, alleging that the college failed to take reasonable steps to protect them.  Included as additional defendants were the board of trustees, the college president Jane Margaret O'Brien, and the two professors and administrator who accompanied the group.  One victim sued for $5 million;  another for $500,000;  and third for $250,000.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost3&gt;{{cite news |title=College Sued Over Attack on Trip |first=Annie |last=Gowen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2001/02/01/college-sued-over-attack-on-trip/29547d50-5ba8-49d0-8553-ce0749cbe160/ |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 1, 2001 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit was eventually settled with one student receiving $100,000 (the maximum amount allowed by law);  another $65,000;  and the third $30,000.  O'Brien claimed that the college was not responsible but was willing to settle the lawsuit to avoid the pain to all of going to trial.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost1&gt;{{cite news |title=Students Settle Suit Over Guatemala Attack |first=Annie |last=Gowen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/07/03/students-settle-suit-over-guatemala-attack/6a3255ea-7b78-4f37-aae8-5a1e43988592/ |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=July 3, 2002 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice Chandrasekhara Menon Committee==
A Judicial commission headed by Justice Chandrasekhara Menon, was constituted to investigate the tragedy. Justice Chandrasekhara Menon, in his report found the State Government guilty of "negligence in ensuring the safety of the pilgrims coming from different parts of the country".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/the-sabarimala-tragedy-in-1999-79424&lt;/ref&gt; The report pointed out the need to provide basic amenities on the Pullumedu route through which a large number of pilgrims from Tamil Nadu travel. Since over 60% of devotees coming to Sabarimala during the pilgrimage season are from other states and this route provides them easy access to temple towns like Madurai on their return journey, the report said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala/sabarimala-govt-temple-board-draw-flak-for-neglecting-reports/article1-651038.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143606/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala/sabarimala-govt-temple-board-draw-flak-for-neglecting-reports/article1-651038.aspx |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the proposals of the committee were not enacted and led to huge public outcry after [[2011 Sabarimala stampede]].&lt;ref name="HT 20110116"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabarimala: Govt, temple board draw flak for neglecting reports |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-govt-temple-board-draw-flak-for-neglecting-reports/article1-651038.aspx |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |accessdate=6 July 2014 |location=Thiruvananthapuram |date=16 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714175853/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-govt-temple-board-draw-flak-for-neglecting-reports/article1-651038.aspx |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2002 [[WAFU Nations Cup]]''' was supposed to be the first edition of the tournament, but was eventually canceled.

==Overview==
The tournament featured players from local leagues only. The qualifying phase was competed during April 7–July 7, 2001. The final phase was originally scheduled for [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], Sep 28–Oct 7, 2001. It was first postponed to October after CAF had refused to give approval claiming it was too close to the [[2002 African Nations Cup]] (set to kick off on January 19, 2002). After WAFU argued that their tournament was for home-based players only, approval was obtained, and the tournament then moved to [[Abidjan]], to be held in October 2001. It was then postponed again because the main sponsors, [[TV Africa]], pulled out.

The tournament was finally arranged for Sep 18–29, 2002, to be held in [[Ivory Coast]] (in [[Abidjan]] and [[Bouaké]]; the latter venue being added at the last moment). Unfortunately, one day into the match, on September 19, the [[First Ivorian Civil War]] broke out, leading to an indefinite postponement of the tournament with the teams stranded in the country. The teams lodged in Bouaké were trapped there for over a week before being able to leave. And the tournament was eventually canceled.

After 8 years, the first successful WAFU Nations Cup was [[2010 WAFU Nations Cup|played in 2010]].

==Canceled Matches==
Eight teams participated in the final tournament. The groups are
* Group A: [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone national football team|Sierra Leone]], [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], [[Gambia national football team|Gambia]]
* Group B: [[Togo national football team|Togo]], [[Mali national football team|Mali]], [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], [[Cape Verde national football team|Cape Verde]]

Only two matches were played on September 18, 2002: Senegal 1–0 Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast 5–0 Gambia. All other matches were canceled due to the civil war.

==Reception==
''Aligarh'' had its European première at the 59th BFI [[London Film Festival]] on 10 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aligarh-gets-standing-ovation-in-busan-director-hansal-mehta-elated/ |title=‘Aligarh’ gets standing ovation in Busan, director Hansal Mehta elated |publisher=[[The Indian Express]]|date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response was generally superlative and the film garnered excellent reviews. ''[[Screen International]]'' in its review called it a "A subtle, sensitive take on a controversial real-life court case involving the victimization of a gay college professor, Aligarh underscores the growing strength and diversity of Indian independent cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halligan |first=Fionnuala |url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/aligarh-review/5095752.article |title='Aligarh': Review &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Screen |publisher=Screendaily.com |date=21 October 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Film Institute]], in its 'Whats On' review of ''Aligarh'' called it "Probably the best film yet on the [[Indian gay]] male experience, Hansal Mehta directs a riveting and nuanced tale that is as touching as it is powerful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Customer |url=https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=aligarh&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id= |title=Buy cinema tickets for Aligarh &amp;#124; 2015 BFI London Film Festival |publisher=Whatson.bfi.org.uk |date= |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aligarh'' had its India première in Mumbai at the 17th [[Mumbai Film Festival|Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival]] on 30 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mumbai film festival announces eclectic line-up|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/mumbai-film-festival-announces-eclectic-line-up/|website=The Indian Express|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the honour of being the only Indian film to open the festival since its inception. The response was once again overwhelming. Meenakshi Shedde, South Asia Consultant to the [[Berlin Film Festival]] and award-winning critic, had this to say about in her ''[[Mid-Day]]'' review: "''Aligarh'' is masterfully directed: it is that rare film that courageously stands for human rights, including those of homosexuals, yet offers a quiet, distilled perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/a-different-marathi-manoos/16631184#sthash.mR5YYrvO.dpuf |title=A different 'Marathi manoos' - News |publisher=Mid-day.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Columnist Aseem Chhabra in his [[rediff.com]] review said "Aligarh is a very important film, a milestone in the history of Indian cinema that should start the much needed conversation about how India treats a visible and yet often ignored minority group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/column/why-aligarh-is-a-very-important-film/20151105.htm |title=Why Aligarh is a very important film - Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Rediff.com |date=5 November 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights activist and editor of ''Bombay Dost'' magazine, [[Ashok Row Kavi]], in his Firstpost.com review called ''Aligarh'' "a masterpiece of cinematic skills" and went on to say "What Mehta and writer Apurva Asrani have done is pluck out a commonplace professor in a commonplace university and weave a true life story into a tapestry of terrifying, compelling drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/aligarh-what-this-compelling-drama-tells-us-about-our-approach-to-homosexuals-2493926.html |title=A masterpiece of cinematic skills, 'Aligarh' has a lot to say about the way we perceive homosexuals |publisher=[[Firstpost]] |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Indian Express]]'' gave 3.5 rating out of 5.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express"/&gt;

'''Baron Hirsch Cemetery''' is a large [[List of Jewish cemeteries in New York City|Jewish cemetery]] in the neighborhood of [[Graniteville, Staten Island|Graniteville]], on [[Staten Island]], in [[New York City]], and named for Baron [[Maurice de Hirsch]].

==History==

Baron Hirsch was established in 1899.&lt;ref name=ALD/&gt;

In January, 1960, the cemetery drew national attention when 87 headstones were smeared with yellow paint and the words “Fuhrer,” and the German words for death and fatherland. That incident and others led President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to declare that freedom and decency could be destroyed everywhere if Americans ignored the "virus of bigotry" or permitted it "to spread one inch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Scores 'Virus of Bigotry' — Warns It Must Be Stemmed as Peril to Freedom|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/01/13/286138972.html?pageNumber=1|accessdate=5 January 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 13, 1960|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, continued vandalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two 200-Pound Doors Stolen From Cemetery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/25/nyregion/two-200-pound-doors-stolen-from-cemetery.html|accessdate=5 January 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 25, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Headstones Overturned In S.I.

A major cleanup of the grounds was started in March 2011 with the help of the [[Community Alliance for Jewish-affiliated Cemeteries]],&lt;ref name=Grunlund/&gt; and a fence was built to enclose the cemetery. The 121st precinct house of the [[New York Police Department]], which adjacent to the cemetery and overlooks it, opened in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=N.Y.P.D. — New York's Finest — 121st Precinct|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_121.shtml|website=nyc.gov|publisher=City of New York|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have helped curb vandalism as well.

The cemetery is composed of about 500 plots or sections belonging to synagogues, Jewish associations, family circles, and most commonly, [[landsmanshaftn]]. Most plots are entered via gates or pairs of stone columns. Some of the landsmanshaftn plots have monuments dedicated to Holocaust victims of the Nazis in their ancestral town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/hm-wodzislaw-bh.htm|title=hm/wodzislaw/bh|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/hm-gvardeyskoye-bh.htm|title=hm/gvardeyskoye/bh|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/hm-nadvirna-bh.htm|title=hm/nadvirna/bh|newspaper=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/hm-hlusk-bh.htm|title=hm/hlusk/bh|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Second Messenian War}}

The '''Battle of the Great Foss''' occurred in 682 BC during the [[Second Messenian War]] (685–668 BC). The word "foss" derives from the Latin [[wiktionary:fossa#Latin|fossa]], meaning "ditch" or "trench."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsEtm9CNCc0C&amp;lpg=PP156&amp;ots=Z3DAanOdU4&amp;dq=foss%20trench%20ancient%20greek&amp;pg=PP156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=The Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences.

The Spartans bribed Aristocrates, the king of the [[Arcadia (ancient region)#Arcadians|Arcadians]], to withdraw his men just as the battle was beginning. This resulted in the slaughter of the Messenians.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, ''Battles of the Greek and Roman Worlds'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Although the principles behind the building block approach are very similar to the principles in many other regulatory regimes around the world (especially the UK), the first use of the term in Australia was in 1998 by the Office of the Regulator General (ORG) in Victoria (the predecessor of the [[Essential Services Commission (Victoria)|Essential Services Commission of Victoria]]). The ORG issued a consultation paper on the framework for setting price controls under the 1995 Victorian Electricity Supply Tariff Order, to apply to electricity distribution networks in Victoria from the beginning of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esc.vic.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/EAF11B82-707D-4123-BDD1-A7CEA9E5BF38/0/electric_2001pric.pdf Essential Services Commission (Victoria) Electricity Distribution Price Review Consultation Paper No. 1 June 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122828/http://www.esc.vic.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/EAF11B82-707D-4123-BDD1-A7CEA9E5BF38/0/electric_2001pric.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tariff Order required the ORG to "utilise price based regulation adopting a CPI-X approach and not rate of return regulation". In a subsequent application for judicial review in the Supreme Court of Victoria, the regulator described the 'building block approach' that it had used to drive the X factor as follows:&lt;ref name="2001 VSC 153"&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=TXU Electricity Limited (formerly known as Eastern Energy Ltd) v Office of the Regulator-General|VSC|153|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at [352]}}

{{cquote|(a) Establishing forward looking cost or expenditure benchmarks for each of the distributors for operating expenditure, capital expenditure, and cost of capital;

(b) establishing an amount for depreciation;

(c) determining an additional allowance called the efficiency carry over amount for operating and capital costs savings achieved by the distributors in the first period;

(d) establishing a benchmark revenue comprising the amounts derived in accordance with the steps (a) to (c) above, which is known as the building blocks approach;

(e) establishing demand projections for each distributor for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005;

(f) modelling the X factors to produce a price path for the basket of Network Tariffs whereby an efficient distributor, based on the demand projection, can be expected to earn the benchmark revenue;}}

The court accepted that this 'building block approach' was not rate-of-return regulation:&lt;ref name="2001 VSC 153"/&gt;{{rp|at [379]}}

{{cquote|The building block approach adopted by the Office in its price fixing review is forward looking, in that it looked at expected reasonable expenditure ... . Further, it did not determine the specific operating costs for a particular distributor, but create a benchmark forecast of what the efficient firm might spend, which created an incentive to earn more than what might be described as a reasonable rate of return for a particular distributor.}}

The [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] adopted a building block approach in its 1999 draft guideline on how it would set electricity transmission revenue caps under the 1998 National Electricity Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/659998 ACCC draft Statement of Regulatory Principles for the regulation of Electricity Transmission Revenues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310112806/http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/659998 |date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was subsequently adopted in other sectors regulated by the ACCC and by other state regulators around Australia. Following the replacement of the National Electricity Code with the National Electricity Rules in 2005, the building block approach was confirmed (with various modifications) in a 2006 review carried out by the [[Australian Energy Market Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aemc.gov.au/Market-Reviews/Completed/Review-of-Electricity-Transmission-Revenue-and-Pricing-Rules.html AEMC Review of Electricity Transmission Revenue and Pricing Rules 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022082353/http://www.aemc.gov.au/Market-Reviews/Completed/Review-of-Electricity-Transmission-Revenue-and-Pricing-Rules.html |date=October 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Electricity Rules were amended in 2006 to provide that the annual revenue requirement for a regulated electricity transmission network must be determined using a 'building block approach' under which the 'building blocks are:&lt;ref&gt;See clause 6A.5.4 of the National Electricity Rules version 10 (16 November 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|(1) indexation of the regulatory asset base ...;

(2) a return on capital for that year ...;

(3) the depreciation for that year ... ;

(4) the estimated cost of corporate income tax of the provider for that year ...;

(5) certain revenue increments or decrements for that year arising from the ''efficiency benefit sharing scheme'' ... ;

(6) the forecast operating expenditure accepted or substituted by the AER for that year ...; and

(7) compensation for other risks ...}}

A similar provision has applied to regulated electricity distributors from 1 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See clause 6.4.3 of the National Electricity Rules version 18 (1 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]] issued a draft report proposing to adopt a form of the building block model in the regulation of fixed-line telecommunications services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/904344 ACCC Review of Access Pricing Principles for Fixed Line Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910125335/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/904344 |date=September 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 National Electricity Code did not allow the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]] to roll forward automatically the value of the regulatory asset base from one regulatory period to the next (in contrast to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110218222750/http://www.coderegistrar.sa.gov.au/code.htm 1997 National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems]). however, under both the current National Electricity Rules and National Gas Rules, the regulatory asset base is locked-in using the asset base roll forward equation below. The telecommunications regime has also been amended from 1 January 2011 to allow the ACCC to make access determinations that include 'fixed principles'. The amendment will allow the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]] to lock-in the value of the asset base across regulatory periods.

==The basic model==
The building block model is a tool for spreading or [[Amortization (business)|amortizing]] the expenditure of a regulated firm over time. The building block model, when applied correctly and consistently over time, ensures that the firm earns a revenue stream with a [[present value]] equal to the present value of its expenditure stream. Put another way, the building block model ensures that over the life of the firm, the cash-flow stream of the firm has a net present value equal to zero.

The building block model makes use of the concept of the regulatory asset base. The regulatory asset base – which is related to the [[capital stock]] of the regulated firm – represents the amount that the firm has, in effect, borrowed from its investors in the past (that is, the amount to which its past expenditure has exceeded its past revenue) and is therefore the amount that must be paid back to investors (with interest) over the remaining life of the firm.

In its simplest form, the building block model can be expressed as two equations, the "revenue equation" and the "asset base roll forward" equation.

===The revenue equation===
The revenue equation is an expression which relates the allowed revenue of the regulated firm to the sum of the return on capital (the appropriate cost of capital multiplied by the regulatory asset base) plus the [[return of capital]] (also known as the [[depreciation]]) plus the [[operating expense|operating expenditure]] (in addition, in many applications of the building block model there are other terms, such as compensation for tax liabilities):

:&lt;math&gt;Rev_t = WACC_t \times RAB_{t-1} + Dep_t+Opex_t&lt;/math&gt;

Here: &lt;math&gt;Rev_t&lt;/math&gt; is the target allowed revenue of the regulated firm in the current regulatory period, &lt;math&gt;WACC_t&lt;/math&gt; is the appropriate [[cost of capital]] (also known as the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]]) for the cash-flow stream of the firm during the current regulatory period, &lt;math&gt;RAB_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the closing regulatory asset base at the end of the previous period (the product of the cost of capital times the asset base is also known as the "return on capital"), &lt;math&gt;Dep_t&lt;/math&gt; is the regulatory [[depreciation]] in the current period, and &lt;math&gt;Opex_t&lt;/math&gt; is the expected or forecast [[Operating expense|operating expenditure]] of the firm in the current regulatory period.

The revenue equation is embodied, for example, in the "Post Tax Revenue Model" spreadsheet used by the Australian Energy Regulator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718823 The AER's Post Tax Revenue Model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220144534/http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718823 |date=February 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The asset base roll forward equation===
The asset base roll forward equation is an expression which relates the closing regulatory asset base at the end of the period to the opening asset base at the start of the period plus any new capital expenditure that occurs during the regulatory period less any depreciation during the regulatory period.

:&lt;math&gt;RAB_t = RAB_{t-1} +Capex_t - Dep_t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Here: &lt;math&gt;RAB_t&lt;/math&gt; is the closing asset base at the end of the current period, &lt;math&gt;RAB_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the closing asset base at the end of the previous period, &lt;math&gt;Capex_t&lt;/math&gt; is the [[capital expenditure]] of the firm in the current period, and &lt;math&gt;Dep_t&lt;/math&gt; is the regulatory [[depreciation]] during the current period.

The asset base roll forward equation is embodied, for example, in the "Roll Forward Model" spreadsheet used by the Australian Energy Regulator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718822 The AER's Roll Forward Model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220144558/http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718822 |date=February 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary reason for using the building block model can be stated as follows: Provided (a) the regulator chooses a path of the regulatory asset base which starts at zero before the firm incurs any expenditure and ends at zero after the end of the life of the firm (or, equivalently, provided the sum of the allowed depreciation each period adds up to the total capital expenditure of the firm) and (b) provided the regulator chooses a value for the WACC which reflects the firm's true cost of capital then the resulting path of allowed revenue given by the equations above has the property that the net present value of the cash-flow of the firm (that is, the revenue less the expenditure) is precisely zero.

===Notes===
* Early implementations of the building block model in Australia in respect of electricity networks permitted the regulatory asset base to be periodically revalued, using a valuation methodology such as the depreciated optimised replacement cost (DORC). This approach does not in general ensure that the regulated firm will achieve an overall net present value of zero. A net present value of zero can, in principle, be achieved on average if the expected or forecast revaluation is anticipated in the depreciation chosen at the start of the regulatory period. However, in practice, the depreciation has not been set in this way. In addition, periodic revaluation of the regulatory asset base exposes the regulated firm to material risk, creates strong incentives for lobbying for a higher valuation, and may create a problem of under-compensation for upgrade or maintenance capital expenditure. Periodic revaluation of the asset base has replaced been replaced in the current National Electricity Rules by the "lock in and roll forward" approach embodied in the asset-base-roll-forward equation set out above.
* The building block model is useful as a tool for amortizing the expenditure of a regulated firm over time. In almost all applications there is an infinite number of ways of carrying out that amortization - which are reflected in the building block approach in the discretion of the regulator over the choice of the path of the regulatory asset base or the path of depreciation. The building block model does not determine the "efficient cost" of providing a particular service in a given year. In most applications regulators simply choose a path for depreciation without consideration of the effect on the overall path of allowed revenues. This is a form of cost allocation which has been criticised by economists as having no particular economic significance.&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, W., M. Koehn and R. Willig, (1987), "How arbitrary is 'arbitrary'? Or, towards the deserved demise of full cost allocation", Public Utilities Fortnightly, 21, 3 September 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
* The building block model does not determine individual prices. Once the building block has been used to determine a particular choice of the revenue allowance of the firm in a given year, the regulator must use some other process or mechanism to yield individual regulated prices. Usually those prices are chosen in such a way that, when using those prices, the regulated firm is forecast to recover a revenue stream equal to that given by the building block model.
* The building block model can be applied with all inputs expressed in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal or real]] terms, provided the cost of capital is also expressed in consistent nominal or real terms. Similarly, the building block model can in principle be applied over any length of regulatory period (e.g., one month, one year, or five years) provided the cost of capital is set consistently with the length of the regulatory period.
* The building block model treats [[operating expense|operating expenditure]] and [[capital expenditure]] symmetrically in that the allowed revenue is sufficient to cover the sum of both types of expenditure. In this sense the classification of expenditure into operating expenditure or capital expenditure is of no long-term consequence. However, if, as is often the case, the regulator implements the building block by first choosing a path for depreciation, any change in operating expenditure results in an immediate change in the allowed revenue of the firm whereas a change in capital expenditure is spread (amortized) over time.
* The building block model is usually applied with a regulatory period lasting several years (typically five in the context of electricity transmission and distribution). The allowed revenue is usually profiled over this five-year regulatory period using a "CPI-X" smoothing mechanism - that is the revenue is allowed to adjust from year to year at the rate of inflation less a constant factor. In this context the X factor is merely a smoothing factor and has no impact on the incentives of the regulated firm. This mechanism ensures smooth real revenues during the regulatory period but since, in practice, jumps in revenues have been allowed between regulatory periods (the so-called P0 adjustment), smooth real revenues are not necessarily achieved overall.
* One common variation of the standard building block model is the introduction of an inflation adjustment to the asset-base roll forward equation, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aemc.gov.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Rules/Current-Rules.html National Electricity Rules chapter 6A.2.4(c)(4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;RAB_t = (1+inflation_t) \times RAB_{t-1} +Capex_t - Dep_t &lt;/math&gt;

:Where &lt;math&gt;inflation_t&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change in a price index over the previous period. This variation is usually combined with an equal-and-offsetting change in the revenue equation (specifically the use of a real rather than nominal cost of capital or discount rate) so as to have no effect overall.

==The building block model and incentives==

The building block model can be implemented in such a way that the regulated firm receives a revenue stream just equal in value to the firm's out-turn expenditure. However, this is usually considered undesirable since it would result in the firm having no incentive to improve its overall efficiency or to increase the volume or quality of the services it provides. To overcome this problem the building block model is usually implemented in a way that allows the firm financial rewards for pursuing desirable objectives – such as reducing its expenditure, or maintaining or improving service quality, and sometimes for selecting efficient capital investments, or promoting innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Biggar, Darryl, (2004), [http://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=ACE2004&amp;paper_id=133 "Incentive Regulation and the Building Block Model"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common in regulatory frameworks that make use of the building block model, to incorporate additional factors which reward the regulated firm for maintaining or improving service quality. Examples include the Essential Service Commission's S-factor scheme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esc.vic.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/1D46EE06-7EE4-4DAA-8B4C-E42459443B30/0/FactSheetNo4_ServiceStandardsOct05_Revised.pdf Description of the ESC (Victoria)'s service standards arrangements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401220836/http://www.esc.vic.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/1D46EE06-7EE4-4DAA-8B4C-E42459443B30/0/FactSheetNo4_ServiceStandardsOct05_Revised.pdf |date=April 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ACCC's Service Target Performance Incentive Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718820 ACCC's Service Target Performance Incentive Scheme for distribution businesses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220144701/http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718820 |date=February 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically much interest has focussed on the incentives on the regulated firm to enhance efficiency – that is, incentives to reduce its expenditure while maintaining a given quantity and quality of output. In principle, the building block model can be designed so as to yield either very low-powered incentives to minimise expenditure (which is sometimes known as cost-of-service or [[rate-of-return regulation]]) or very high-powered incentives. The building block model can be implemented in such a way as to yield very high-powered incentives to reduce expenditure by (a) setting the operating and capital expenditure inputs in the building block model on the basis of forecasts which are independent of the regulated firm's own actions, and (b) not "clawing back" any over-spend or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period. However, very high-powered incentives create their own problems – they create strong incentives on the firm to cut expenditure or defer capital expenditure – even at the expense of reducing service quality. In addition, high powered incentives expose the regulated firm to higher levels of risk and give rise to strong incentives to lobby the regulator for a higher target level of revenue. Economic theory does not support the use of very high-powered incentives&lt;ref&gt;Schmalensee, Richard, (1989), "Good Regulatory Regimes", Rand Journal of Economics, 20(3), Autumn 1989, 417-436&lt;/ref&gt; and, in practice, almost all practical regulatory regimes tend to involve medium-powered incentives.

Although details vary across regimes, the most common approach to creating incentives to reduce expenditure is to use a regulatory period consisting of many years. The allowed revenue is set once at the beginning of the regulatory period and there is no clawback of over-spend or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period – thereby allowing the regulated firm to keep some or all of the cost savings it makes during the regulatory period. The operating expenditure input to the building block model is usually based closely on the observed operating expenditure at the end of the previous regulatory period. This approach ensures reasonably strong incentives to reduce operating expenditure in the early years of a regulatory period but can, in principle, lead to weak incentives to reduce operating expenditure in the later years of a regulatory period. One way to solve this problem is to base the operating expenditure not just on a single "test year" of the previous regulatory period&lt;ref&gt;Pint, Ellen M., (1992), "Price-Cap versus Rate-of-Return Regulation in a Stochastic Cost Model", Rand Journal of Economics, 23(4), Winter 1992, 564-578&lt;/ref&gt; but on the average of the previous years. In practice this problem is, instead, often addressed with some form of "efficiency carry-over" or "efficiency benefit sharing" scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718821 Efficiency Benefit Sharing Scheme for Electricity Distribution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220144626/http://www.aer.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/718821 |date=February 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to incentives to reduce capital expenditure, concerns arise relating to the strength of the incentives and the possibility for inefficient substitution between opex and capex. Stronger incentives to reduce capex tend to create strong incentives to defer needed network upgrades with possible consequences for long-term service quality. Ofgem in the UK has experimented with improving measures of asset quality and combining capex and opex into a single "totex" expenditure measure. One common approach to handling capital expenditure is simply to allow the regulated firm to keep the depreciation allowance on any higher forecast capital expenditure and simply to "roll in" the out-turn capital expenditure into the regulatory asset base at the end of the regulatory period. Many regulatory frameworks also give the regulator a role in assessing and approving new capital expenditure in what is known as a "prudency" or "used and useful" test.

==Variations and extensions==

In practice, the building block model is often modified in various ways – particularly to create desired incentives on the regulated firm. These variations include adapting the model to a five-year regulatory period and the introduction of various explicit incentive mechanisms.

===The building block model and uncertainty===

Most regulated firms continue to face some risk or uncertainty in their financial outcomes, due to uncertainty in the demand they face or in their expenditure. Some of this exposure to risk is deliberately created by the regulatory regime in order to ensure the regulated firm faces desirable incentives (such as incentives to minimise its expenditure).

Most of the time this risk is handled through relatively minor changes to the building block model. Specifically, in the simplest case the regulator must ensure that the revenue the firm receives is on average equal to the return on capital (calculated using an appropriate risk-adjusted cost of capital) plus the return of capital plus the average or "expected" operating expenditure. The regulator can achieve this outcome either by ensuring that the regulated firm is compensated for uncertain events ''ex post'' or by ensuring the regulated firm receives sufficient compensation ''ex ante''. As an example of the former, many regulators allow the regulated firm to "pass through" cost events which are largely or entirely outside their control (such as changes in other regulated charges, or changes in some labour rates).

On occasion, it is not feasible to rely on ex post compensation for a risk faced by the regulated firm. This might arise, for example, where the regulated firm faces a risk that demand will drop (or will fail to materialise) in the future, limiting future earnings. Where this risk is material the regulator has no choice but to ensure the regulated firm is adequately compensated on average ex ante.

As a general rule, where the regulatory framework ensures that the regulated firm is adequately compensated on average it must be the case that if there is some positive probability that the out-turn return of the firm is below the allowed cost of capital there must be a positive probability that the out-turn return of the firm is above the allowed cost of capital so that, on average, the firm expects to receive the allowed cost of capital.

===The loss capitalisation model===

In some circumstances, especially where the future demand for the services of the regulated firm is uncertain, there is a risk that the regulator will choose a path for depreciation which results in an allowed revenue in a given year which cannot be achieved by the regulated firm (perhaps because demand in that year is lower than expected). If the out-turn revenue of the regulated firm falls short of the allowed revenue in a given year and this is not recognised in the regulatory framework, there is a risk that the regulated firm will not be allowed to earn a cash-flow stream with an NPV of zero overall (in other words, the investors in the firm will be left under-compensated). To overcome this possibility it may make sense to allow the regulated firm to "capitalise" any short-fall in out-turn revenue relative to allowed revenue in a given year by simply adding the shortfall into the regulatory asset base. This approach is equivalent to allowing the firm to defer some of its depreciation in years in which demand is lower than expected. This approach, which has been termed the "loss capitalisation model" has been considered by the ACCC in the context of the regulation of access to rail track infrastructure in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=917323&amp;nodeId=0e764bff0915d7acab5285d063adace4&amp;fn=Draft%20Decision%205%20March%202010.pdf ACCC Draft Decision on the ARTC Hunter Valley Rail Access Undertaking March 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313185251/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=917323&amp;nodeId=0e764bff0915d7acab5285d063adace4&amp;fn=Draft%20Decision%205%20March%202010.pdf |date=March 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost of capital==
{{Main|Cost of capital}}

The building block model is a tool for amortizing the expenditure of a regulated firm in such a way that the expected net present value of the cash-flow of the firm is zero. For this to be achieved, the regulator must choose the cost of capital to reflect the correct cost of capital or discount rate for the associated cash-flow stream of the firm. This is usually carried out by estimating a [[weighted average cost of capital]] for the cash-flow stream of the firm as a whole. Under the standard regulatory approach in Australia where the tax liabilities of the firm are handled as an additional element in the firm's revenue equation, the appropriate weighted average formula is the simple "plain vanilla" formula, consisting of a weighted average of the cost of capital for the firm's equity and the cost of capital for the firm's debt. The cost of capital for the firm's debt is usually estimated by observing the currently prevailing return in the market for corporate bonds of a similar credit rating and duration. The cost of capital for the firm's equity is usually estimated using the [[capital asset pricing model]].

There has been some controversy in Australia over the correct timeframe for the cost of capital. The ACCC and some academics have argued that the correct term for the cost of capital should be the length of the regulatory period (normally five years). Regulated businesses have argued, however, for a longer term - equal to the term of the longest normally-available government bonds (which is usually ten years). The Australian Competition Tribunal in 2003 held that the use of a long-term rate was appropriate and the common practice in Australia has been to use a ten-year rate since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Re GasNet Australia (Operations) Pty Ltd|ACompT|6|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The building block approach versus index-based approaches ==

Almost from the start of the current period of public utility regulation in Australia (dating from the late 1990s) commentators have argued against the use of the building block model and in favour of a regulatory approach in which a regulated firm's revenue allowance is set primarily on the basis of an industry-wide change in an index of productivity.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the documents associated with the Productivity Commission's 2001 [http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/inquiry/access review of the National Access Regime] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128012740/http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/inquiry/access |date=November 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter approach has been known as a [[total factor productivity]] or Index-Based approach to regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=332190&amp;nodeId=fd10fa1b3ce365c647a752ea087ebd96&amp;fn=Comparison%20of%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Index-Based%20Approaches.pdf Comparison of Building Block and Index-Based Approaches by Farrier Swier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622000918/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=332190&amp;nodeId=fd10fa1b3ce365c647a752ea087ebd96&amp;fn=Comparison%20of%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Index-Based%20Approaches.pdf |date=June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the TFP or index-based approaches to regulation have claimed that it would result in more powerful incentives to reduce expenditure and lower regulatory costs. Supporters of the current regime have argued that the building block framework is capable of accommodating higher-powered incentives if that is desired, that higher-powered incentives are not necessarily desirable, and that, in practice, almost all regulatory regimes in use around the world involve periodic resetting of allowed revenues to out-turn expenditure - in a manner similar to the current practice in Australia. There does seem to be common ground that there is greater scope for benchmarking - that is inter-firm comparisons of efficiency - in regulatory practice in Australia. The Australian Energy Market Commission is currently carrying out a review of the possible role for total factor productivity in electricity distribution regulation in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aemc.gov.au/Market-Reviews/Open/Review-Into-the-Use-of-Total-Factor-Productivity-for-the-Determination-of-Prices-and-Revenues.html AEMC Review into the use of TFP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218144128/http://www.aemc.gov.au/Market-Reviews/Open/Review-Into-the-Use-of-Total-Factor-Productivity-for-the-Determination-of-Prices-and-Revenues.html |date=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Byzantine-Norman Wars}}
A number of '''wars between the Normans and the Byzantine Empire''' were fought from {{circa}} 1040 until 1185, when the last [[Normans|Norman]] invasion of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was defeated. At the end of the conflict, neither the Normans nor the Byzantines could boast much power; by the mid-13th century exhaustive fighting with other powers had weakened both, leading to the Byzantines losing [[Asia Minor]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 14th century, and the Normans losing [[Sicily]] to the [[Hohenstaufen]], who in turn were succeeded by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]].

==Norman conquest of southern Italy==
{{main|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}
The Normans' initial military involvement in southern Italy was on the side of the [[Lombards]] against the Byzantines. Eventually, some Normans, including the powerful de Hauteville brothers, served in the army of [[George Maniakes]] during the attempted Byzantine reconquest of Sicily, only to turn against their employers when the emirs proved difficult to conquer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard 1973, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1030, [[Rainulf Drengot|Rainulf]] became count of Aversa, marking the start of permanent Norman settlement in Italy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1042, [[William Iron Arm|William de Hauteville]] was made a count, taking Lombard prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] as his liege.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Holmes 1988, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; To further strengthen ties and legitimacy, [[Robert Guiscard]] also married Lombard Princess [[Sikelgaita]] in 1058.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Following the death of Guaimar, the Normans were increasingly independent actors on the south Italian scene, which brought them into direct conflict with Byzantium.

During the time that the Normans had conquered southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire was in a state of internal decay; the administration of the Empire had been wrecked, the efficient government institutions that provided [[Basil II]] with a quarter of a million troops and adequate resources by taxation had collapsed within a period of three decades. Attempts by [[Isaac I Komnenos]] and [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] to reverse the situation proved unfruitful. The premature death of the former and the overthrow of the latter led to further collapse as the Normans consolidated their conquest of Sicily and Italy.

[[Reggio Calabria]], the capital of the [[tagma (military)|tagma]] of Calabria, was captured by Robert Guiscard in 1060. At the time, the Byzantines held a few coastal towns in Apulia, including Bari, the capital of the [[catepanate of Italy]]. In 1067–68, they gave financial support to a rebellion against Guiscard. In 1068, the Normans besieged [[Otranto]]; in the same year, they began the [[siege of Bari]] itself. After defeating the Byzantines in a series of battles in Apulia, and after two major attempts to relieve the city had failed, the city Bari surrendered in April 1071, ending the Byzantine presence in southern Italy.

In 1079–80, the Byzantines again gave their support to a rebellion against Guiscard.

Over a thirty year period (1061-1091), Norman factions also completed the initial Byzantine attempt to retake Sicily. However, it would not be until 1130 that both Sicily and southern Italy were united into one kingdom, formalized by [[Roger II of Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis-Secord 2017, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Norman invasion of the Balkans (1081&amp;ndash;1085)==
[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|left|thumb|260px|The map of Europe after the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085.]]
Following their successful [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquest of southern Italy]], the Normans saw no reason to stop; Byzantium was decaying further still and looked ripe for conquest. When [[Alexios I Comnenus]] ascended to the throne of Byzantium, his early emergency reforms, such as requisitioning Church money - a previously unthinkable move - proved too little to stop the Normans.

Led by the formidable [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]] (later, Bohemund I of Antioch), they took [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]], and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]).&lt;ref&gt;Davis-Secord 2017, p.216-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexios suffered several defeats before being able to strike back with success. He enhanced this by bribing the German king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] with 360,000 gold pieces to attack the Normans in Italy, which forced the Normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083&amp;ndash;1084. He also secured the alliance of [[Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo]], who controlled the [[Gargano Peninsula]] and dated his charters by Alexios' reign. The Norman danger ended for the time being with the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085, combined with a Byzantine victory and crucial [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] aid that allowed the Byzantines to retake the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Loud 1999, p.824.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion of Antioch (1104&amp;ndash;1140)==
During the [[First Crusade]], a large number of Normans naturally joined in what appeared to be a great expedition into the unknown where land and loot was plentiful. During this time, the Byzantines were able to utilize, to some extent, the aggressive Normans to defeat the [[Seljuk Turks]] in numerous battles and many cities fell.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard 1972, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that, in exchange for an oath of loyalty, Alexios promised land around the city of Antioch to Bohemond in order to create a buffer vassal state and simultaneously keep Bohemond away from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Charanis 1952, p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Antioch]] fell the Normans refused to hand it over, although in time Byzantine domination was established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Out of fear that this signaled Byzantine intentions to reconquer southern Italy and remove his suzerainty over the Normans, [[Pope Innocent II]] declared the emperor an excommunicate, and threatened any Latin Christian who served in his army with the same consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 1952, p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; With the death of [[John II Komnenos|John Comnenus]] the Norman [[Principality of Antioch]] rebelled once again, attacking [[Cyprus]] and invading [[Cilicia]], which also rebelled. The quick and energetic response of [[Manuel Comnenus]] allowed the Byzantines to extract an even more favorable ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with Antioch (in 1145 being forced to provide Byzantium with a contingent of troops and allow a Byzantine garrison in the city). However, the city was given guarantees of protection against Turkic attack and [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] abstained from attacking the northern parts of the Crusader states as a result.

==Second Norman invasion of the Balkans (1147&amp;ndash;1149)==

In 1147 the Byzantine empire under [[Manuel I Comnenus]] was faced with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had captured the Byzantine island of [[Corfu]] and plundered [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Byzantine Corinth|Corinth]]. However, despite being distracted by a [[Cuman]] attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of [[Conrad III of Germany]], and the help of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rowe 1959, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; In ca.1148, the political situation in the Balkans was divided by two sides, one being the alliance of the Byzantines and Venice, the other the Normans and Hungarians. The Normans were sure of the danger that the battlefield would move from the Balkans to their area in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti|title=Društveni i istoriski spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yA1OAQAAIAAJ|year=1940|quote=Око 1148. год. ситуација на Балкану била је овака.

The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy for the rest of his reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.{{sfn|Magdalino|2005|p=621}} However, while Manuel was in Valona planning the offensive across the Adriatic, the Serbs revolted, posing a danger to the Byzantine Adriatic bases.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=237}}

The death of Roger in February 1154, who was succeeded by [[William I of Sicily|William I]], combined with the widespread rebellions against the rule of the new King in [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Apulia]], the presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantian court, and [[Frederick Barbarossa]]'s (Conrad's successor) failure to deal with the Normans encouraged Manuel to take advantage of the multiple instabilities that existed in the [[Italian peninsula]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003|p=122}} He sent [[Michael Palaiologos (general)|Michael Palaiologos]] and [[John Doukas (general under Manuel I)|John Doukas]], both of whom held the high imperial rank of ''[[sebastos]]'', with Byzantine troops, 10 Byzantine ships, and large quantities of gold to invade [[Apulia]] (1155).{{sfn|Birkenmeier|2002|p=114}}{{sfn|Norwich|1995|p=112}} The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick Barbarossa, since he was hostile to the Normans of Sicily and was south of the [[Alps]] at the time, but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible.{{Cref|b}} Nevertheless, with the help of disaffected local barons including Count [[Robert II of Bassunvilla|Robert of Loritello]], Manuel's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]] rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown, and the untried William I.{{sfn|Magdalino|2005|p=621}} There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold.{{sfn|Brooke|2004|p=482}}{{sfn|Magdalino|2002|p=67}}

William and his army landed on the peninsula and destroyed the Greek fleet (4 ships) and army at Brindisi on May 28, 1156 and recovered Bari. Adrian came to terms at [[Benevento]] on June 18, 1156 where he and William signed the [[Treaty of Benevento]], abandoning the rebels and confirming William as king. During the summer of 1157, he sent a fleet of 164 ships carrying 10,000 men to sack [[Euboea]] and [[Almyros|Almira]]. In 1158 William made peace with the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niketas Choniates]], Grandezza e catastrofe di Bisanzio. III; 13,2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annales Casinenes, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cinnamo, pp. 170, 16-175, 19"&gt;Cinnamo, pp. 170, 16-175, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third Norman invasion of the Balkans (1185&amp;ndash;1186)==
Although the last invasions and last large scale conflict between the two powers lasted less than two years, the third Norman invasions came closer still to taking [[Constantinople]]. The incompetent rule of [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronicus Comnenus]] allowed the Normans to go unchecked towards the Byzantine capital giving [[Thessalonica]] a [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|savage sack]] (a grim portent of what Constantinople would face in 20 years time). The resulting panic, however, allowed [[Isaac Angelus]] to take the throne and, after defeating the confident opponent, push the invaders back to Sicily, with the exception of the [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], the latter remaining in the hands of Norman admiral [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] and his successors until 1479.

==Aftermath==
With the Normans unable to take the Balkans, they turned their attention to European affairs. The Byzantines meanwhile had not possessed the will or the resources for any Italian invasion since the days of [[Manuel Comnenus]]. After the third invasion, the survival of the Empire became more important to the Byzantines than a mere province on the other side of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The death of [[William II of Sicily|William II,]] who was without an heir, threw the kingdom into instability and upheaval, and by 1194 the [[Hohenstaufen]] had taken power, themselves being replaced in 1266 by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis-Secord 2017, p.215.&lt;/ref&gt; The successive Sicilian rulers would eventually continue the Norman policy of domination over post-Byzantine states in the Ionian Sea and Greece, attempting to assert suzerainty over [[Corfu]], finally conquered in 1260, the [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and other territories.

'''Call of Duty: Experience 2016''' (shortened to '''Call of Duty: XP 2016''' and '''CoD: XP 2016''') was the second ''[[Call of Duty]]'' gaming convention held by [[Activision]] and [[Infinity Ward]]. It took place at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California]] from September 2 to September 4, 2016. Serving as the follow-up to the [[Call of Duty: Experience 2011|first convention held in 2011]], the event featured the multiplayer reveal for the upcoming title ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]'' as well as the 2016 [[Call of Duty World League]] Championship.

==Background==
The [[Call of Duty: Experience 2011|first Call of Duty XP]] event was held in 2011 to promote ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'' and its multiplayer mode as well as the series' online service [[Call of Duty: Elite]]. Also at the event was a $1,000,000 tournament featuring competitive ''Call of Duty'' teams.&lt;ref name="charlieintel"/&gt; For the 2016 event, select people within the ''Call of Duty'' community who had covered the game multiple times received a surprise envelope from [[Activision]], the publisher of ''Call of Duty'', in early June 2016. These envelopes were not to be open until the day after it was received. Once opened, a ticket to the Call of Duty XP 2016 event was revealed as the envelope's contents.&lt;ref name="charlieintel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://charlieintel.com/2016/06/08/xp-2016-announced/ | title=Call of Duty XP 2016 event announced, takes place September 2nd – 4th | publisher=charlieINTEL | date=June 8, 2016 | accessdate=June 11, 2016 | author=Bhat, Keshav}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Location and setup==
Call of Duty XP 2016 took place at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], an arena in [[Inglewood, California]]. The convention was held from September 2 to September 4, 2016. It had three ticket packages; Enlisted ($49), Veteran ($129), and Prestige ($199), with each package tier offering more content (i.e. only the Veteran and Prestige tiers have the Care Package bonus and only the Prestige tier has the VIP Lounge access bonus). Each tier, however, features bonus digital content for both ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops III]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.callofduty.com/xp | title=Call of Duty®: COD XP 2016 | publisher=[[Activision]] | accessdate=June 11, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609070643/https://www.callofduty.com/xp | archive-date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
===''Infinite Warfare'' multiplayer and ''Black Ops III'' DLC===
One of the prominent events of Call of Duty XP 2016 was the official reveal of the ''Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare'' multiplayer mode. Anyone who attended the convention was able to play the multiplayer mode hands-on, being the first people of the public to do so. Also playable was the game's Zombies mode as well as the multiplayer mode for ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered]]''. The fourth [[downloadable content|map pack]] for ''Call of Duty: Black Ops III'', '''Salvation''', was also playable at the convention.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-xp-2016-convention-announced-dates-re/1100-6440598/ | title=Call of Duty XP 2016 Convention Announced, Dates Revealed | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=June 8, 2016 | accessdate=June 11, 2016 | author=Paget, Mat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/08/activision-announces-call-of-duty-xp-fan-event | title=Activision Announces Call of Duty XP Fan Event | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=June 8, 2016 | accessdate=June 11, 2016 | author=Carpenter, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Call of Duty World League Championship===
Another prominent event of the convention was the 2016 [[Call of Duty World League]] Championship, a competitive [[e-sports]] tournament. The tournament, which is similar to the one held at the first Call of Duty XP convention, featured 32 competitive ''Call of Duty'' teams from around the world. The prize pool was $2,000,000, which became the largest prize pool in Call of Duty Championship history and double the pool at the first event.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; Team EnVyUs won the championship, defeating Splyce Gaming in the finals 3-1.

===Other events and announcements===
Present at the convention were two activities that were spin-offs from in-game experiences. One was Nuketown Paintball, which is [[paintball]] in a course that replicates the famous Nuketown map as seen in the ''[[Call of Duty#Black Ops story arc|Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' titles.

[[File:Champion Hurdle (13179141823).jpg|thumb|Champion Hurdle]]
The '''Cheltenham Festival''' is a meeting in the [[National Hunt racing]] calendar in the United Kingdom, with race prize money second only to the [[Grand National]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/66009.stm |title=Going is good for Cheltenham |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=17 March 1998 |accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an event where many of the best British- and Irish-trained horses race to an extent which is relatively rare during the rest of the season.

The festival takes place annually in March at [[Cheltenham Racecourse]] in [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire. The meeting usually coincides with [[Saint Patrick's Day]], and is particularly popular with Irish visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/sport/horse-racing/cheltenham-festival-gets-underway-this-afternoon-14219806.html |title=Cheltenham festival gets underway this afternoon |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It features several Grade I races including the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]], [[Champion Hurdle]], [[Queen Mother Champion Chase]] and [[Stayers' Hurdle]], held over four days. Large amounts of money are gambled during Cheltenham Festival week, with hundreds of millions of pounds being bet over the week. Cheltenham is often noted for its atmosphere, most notably the "Cheltenham roar", which refers to the enormous amount of noise that the crowd generates as the starter raises the tape for the first race of the festival.

==History==
The Cheltenham Festival originated in 1860 when the [[National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup|National Hunt Chase]] was first held at Market Harborough. It was initially titled the Grand National Hunt Meeting and took place at several locations since its institution, at the turn of the 20th century it was mostly held at [[Warwick Racecourse]]. In 1904 and 1905 it was staged at Cheltenham over a new course established at Prestbury Park in 1902, having previously taken place at Cheltenham in 1861. From 1906 to 1910 it was again held at Warwick but further additions and major improvements made at Cheltenham by Messrs. Pratt and Company, including a new stand (the fourth one), miles of drain to prevent unsuitable racing ground, tar paving in the enclosures and the paddock extended to 35 saddling boxes, proved enough to make the National Hunt Committee decide on that the 1911 meeting was to return at Prestbury Park, Cheltenham where it remained to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000325/19111209/053/0006 |title=1912 Improvemnts and additions at Cheltenham |date=9 December 1912|publisher=Gloucester Citizen|accessdate=14 November 2015}}{{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000518/19110311/021/0003 |title=1911 National Hunt Steeplechase meeting at Prestbury Park |date=11 March 1911|publisher=Cheltenham Chronicle|accessdate=15 November 2015}}{{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19130313/225/0014 |title=1913 National Hunt Meeting – a record attendance |date=13 March 1913|publisher=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer|accessdate=14 November 2015}}{{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest traceable reference to a "Festival" is in the Warwick Advertiser of 1907.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;Stevens, Peter, History of the National Hunt Chase 1860–2010. {{ISBN|978-0-9567250-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stayers' Hurdle]], first ran in 1912, is the oldest race from the Cheltenham festival that is currently a championship race. The [[Cheltenham Gold Cup|Gold Cup]], established in 1924, was originally a supporting race for the [[Vincent O'Brien County Handicap Hurdle|County Hurdle]] which was the main event of the first day but that quickly changed and in the following seasons it became a championship race, however for many years it was still used by the trainers as a preparation race for the [[Grand National]]. The [[Champion Hurdle]] first ran in 1927 and the [[Queen Mother Champion Chase]] in 1959, were both championship races from the time they were introduced unlike the Stayers' Hurdle and Gold Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000329/19240313/002/0002 |title=A head victory for Red Splash |date=13 March 1924|publisher=Western Morning News|accessdate=14 November 2015}}{{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19240312/068/0010 |title=County Hurdle goes to Hednesford|date=12 March 1924|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=14 November 2015}}{{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, 21-year-old Gee Armytage became the first female jockey to win a race at the festival on 17 March 1987. She won the [[Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup|Kim Muir Challenge Cup]], back then held on Tuesdays and backed it with another victory the next day in the [[Mildmay of Flete Challenge Cup]] on a horse aptly-named Gee-A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eS41AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_KULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3871%2C4607103|title=Geee upsets odds – and men – at the Festival|date=19 March 1987|work=The Glasgow Herald|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the Festival was cancelled due to [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|an outbreak]] of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in Britain. The meeting had initially been postponed to April, but when a case of the disease was confirmed locally, putting the racecourse within an exclusion zone, all racing had to be called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1254326.stm |title=Cheltenham Festival called off |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=1 April 2001 |accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the second day of the festival was cancelled due to heavy storms. The races scheduled for that day were instead run on the third and final days of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/7291303.stm |title=Cheltenham Festival |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=12 March 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Winners' enclosure.JPG|Winners' enclosure at [[Cheltenham Racecourse]].|thumb|right]]

Until 2005 the festival had traditionally been held over the course of three days, but this changed with the introduction of a fourth day, meaning there would be one championship race on each day, climaxing with the Gold Cup on the Friday. To ensure each day would still have six races, five new races were introduced. Four further races have since been added, bringing the total to 28 races overall, with [[National Hunt racing#Grades and classes|grade one]] events including the [[Champion Bumper]], [[Triumph Hurdle]], [[Ryanair Chase]], [[Supreme Novices' Hurdle]], [[Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle]], [[Arkle Challenge Trophy]], [[RSA Chase]], Champion Hurdle, World Hurdle, Queen Mother Champion Chase and the feature race, the Gold Cup.

The festival also includes one of the two biggest Hunter Chases of the season, the Foxhunters', which is run on the Friday over the same course as the Gold Cup, and is sometimes referred to as the "amateurs' Gold Cup".

Unlike [[Royal Ascot]] and many other top [[flat racing]] events in Britain and Ireland, the Cheltenham Festival does not have a history of attracting many international contenders, though French-trained horses have done well – [[Baracouda]] being perhaps the most well-known, having landed the [[World Hurdle]] twice.

==Criticisms==

For several years there have been concerns about the number of equine injuries and fatalities. In 2006, 11 horses died and in response the racecourse decreased the number of runners in certain races and re-sited one of the more difficult fences.

On the opening day of the 2012 festival, three horses had to be euthanised after suffering bone fractures or breaks, including two during the Cross-Country Chase, becoming the second and third equine fatalities in that race since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GMT |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/17360447 |title=Cheltenham Festival: Two more horses die on second day |publisher=BBC |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two further equine fatalities during the festival, and some critics claimed races should not have gone ahead due to the firmness of the ground following exceptionally dry weather. The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] suggested that guidelines be reviewed, while the [[British Horseracing Authority]] stated that "with over 90,000 runners a year [in British horse racing], some accidents and sadly some injuries are inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2115696/RSPCA-fury-carnage-Cheltenham-horses-die-bloodiest-opening-festival-years.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Katherine | last=Faulkner | title=RSPCA fury at carnage of Cheltenham horses as five die in bloodiest opening to festival for six years | date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Races==

The number and type of races at the Cheltenham Festival has changed dramatically over the years of its existence.  In particular, it has grown from a two-day meeting to a four-day meeting.  In 2017, there were 28 races as follows:

The '''Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology''' ({{lang-eo|Konferenco pri Aplikoj de Esperanto en Scienco kaj Tekniko}}, '''KAEST''') is a biennial conference on the application of the international language [[Esperanto]] in science and technology.

The conference first took place in 1978 in [[Czechoslovakia]]. Following the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], it first remained in the Czech Republic, until it was transferred in 2010 to [[Slovakia]], where it is currently being organized by the nonprofit organization [[E@I]]. Latest KAEST took place in [[Modra]], Slovakia, from the 15th to 18 November 2012.&lt;ref name="intro12" /&gt; It included a Wikipedia workshop aimed at both beginners and advanced users, organized in cooperation with [[Wikimedia Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="intro12"&gt;{{Cite web

{{Short description|Dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power}}
:''Individual nation articles should be consulted on specific national responses to corruption.''

In general, '''corruption''' is a form of [[dishonesty]] or criminal activity undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire illicit benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Corruption can be illegal (or legal in a [[kleptocracy]]){{dubious|date=July 2018}} and dishonest, but in recent years can also can involve legal miss-conduct in many other countries and can have global reach in many cases. See [http://thelawdictionary.org/corruption/ Black's Law Dictionary] for legal definition. See also: [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf worldbank.org] paper noting that corruption "may involve collusion between parties typically both from the public and private sectors, and may be legal in many countries"&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption may include many activities including [[bribery]] and [[embezzlement]], though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf |title=Report|website=siteresources.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political corruption]] occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most  commonplace in [[kleptocracies]], [[oligarchies]], [[narco-state]]s and [[mafia]] states.

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term [[anti-corruption]].

==Scales of corruption==
[[File:Say no to bribes in Chipata, Zambia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[billboard]] in [[Zambia]] exhorting the public to "Just say no to corruption".]]
[[File:Niger, Niamey, anti-corruption billboard.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An anti-corruption billboard at the entry into [[Niamey]], capital of [[Niger]]. The text, translated from French, reads: "Together, let's fight against corruption at the borders", and "With my identity card or my passport plus my vaccinaton certificate, I can travel in all tranquillity within the realm of [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]]".]]

Stephen D. Morris,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, S.D. (1991), Corruption and Politics in Contemporary Mexico. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of politics, writes that [[Politics|politic]]al corruption is the illegitimate use of public power to benefit a private interest. Economist Ian Senior&lt;ref&gt;Senior, I. (2006), Corruption – The World’s Big C., Institute of Economic Affairs, London&lt;/ref&gt; defines corruption as an action to (a) secretly provide (b) a good or a service to a third party (c) so that he or she can influence certain actions which (d) benefit the corrupt, a third party, or both (e) in which the corrupt agent has authority. [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]],&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|title=Legal Corruption|last2=Vicente|first2=Pedro|year=2005|publisher=World Bank|format=PDF|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|author-link1=Daniel Kaufmann (economist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the World Bank, extends the concept to include 'legal corruption' in which power is abused within the confines of the law—as those with power often have the ability to make laws for their protection. The effect of corruption in infrastructure is to increase costs and construction time, lower the quality and decrease the benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Mariani|first2=Giacomo|last3=Sainati|first3=Tristano|last4=Greco|first4=Marco|date=2017-04-01|title=Corruption in public projects and megaprojects: There is an elephant in the room!|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786316301090|journal=International Journal of Project Management|volume=35|issue=3|pages=252–268|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research work on social corruption developed at [[The Unicist Research Institute]] defines that corruption allows individuals to profit from the environment through illegitimate actions while they disintegrate the system they are part of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Peter Belohlavek | title = Social Corruption and Corruption Inhibitors as a Complex Adaptive System | publisher =SSRN | date = June 2017 | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.3066116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime.

Increasingly, a number of indicators and tools have been developed which can measure different forms of corruption with increasing accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf|title=Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand? A Comparative Analysis of Different Indicators of Corruption|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|date=2017|website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petty corruption===
'''Petty corruption''' occurs at a smaller scale and takes place at the implementation end of public services when public officials meet the public. For example, in many small places such as registration offices, police stations, state licensing boards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishler v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/nevada/supreme-court/1993/22397-1.html|website=Justia Law|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-534_19m2.pdf|title=Report|website=supremecourt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other private and government sectors.

===Grand corruption===
'''Grand corruption''' is defined as corruption occurring at the highest levels of government in a way that requires significant subversion of the political, legal and economic systems. Such corruption is commonly found in countries with authoritarian or dictatorial governments but also in those without adequate policing of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/NGO/Grand_Corruption_definition_with_explanation_19_August_2016_002_1.pdf|title=Material on Grand corruption|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government system in many countries is divided into the legislative, [[Executive (government)|executive]] and judiciary branches in an attempt to provide independent services that are less subject to grand corruption due to their independence from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|title=Political And Judicial Checks On Corruption: Evidence From American State Governments|last=Alt|first=James|date=|website=Projects at Harvard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203043655/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic corruption===
'''Systemic corruption''' (or endemic corruption)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/glossary/|title=Glossary|publisher=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is corruption which is primarily due to the weaknesses of an organization or process. It can be contrasted with individual officials or agents who act corruptly within the system.

Factors which encourage systemic corruption include [[conflict of interest|conflicting incentives]], [[discretion|discretionary powers]]; [[monopoly|monopolistic powers]]; lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]]; low pay; and a culture of [[impunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Diagnosis corruption| pages=135–136 |author=Lorena Alcazar, Raul Andrade |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-931003-11-7 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific acts of corruption include "bribery, extortion, and embezzlement" in a system where "corruption becomes the rule rather than the exception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Znoj|first=Heinzpeter|editor=Monique Nuijten, Gerhard Anders|title=Corruption and the secret of law: a legal anthropological perspective|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P52bOZFExesC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7682-9|pages=53–54|chapter=Deep Corruption in Indonesia: Discourses, Practices, Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars distinguish between centralized and decentralized systemic corruption, depending on which level of state or government corruption takes place; in countries such as the [[Post-Soviet states]] both types occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Legvold|first=Robert|editor=Robert I.

Some scholars argue that there is a negative duty{{clarify|reason=change wording. Does this mean Western governments should NOT protect... in order that the undeveloped country develop its own? Or that it should stop corruption?|date=February 2015}} of western governments to protect against systematic corruption of underdeveloped governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Merle|editor1-first=Jean-Christophe|title=Global Challenges to Liberal Democracy|journal=Spheres of Global Justice|date=2013|volume=1|page=812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Severe Poverty as a Violation of Negative Duties|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|website=thomaspogge.com|accessdate=8 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211060650/http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|archive-date=11 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption in different sectors==
Corruption can occur in any sector, whether they be public or private industry or even [[NGOs]] (especially in public sector). However, only in democratically controlled institutions is there an interest of the public (owner) to develop internal mechanisms to fight active or passive corruption, whereas in private industry as well as in NGOs there is no public control. Therefore, the owners' investors' or sponsors' profits are largely decisive.

===Government/public sector===
{{anchor|Government/Public corruption}}

Public corruption includes corruption of the political process and of government agencies such as the police as well as corruption in processes of allocating public funds for contracts, grants, and hiring. Recent research by the World Bank suggests that who makes policy decisions (elected officials or bureaucrats) can be critical in determining the level of corruption because of the incentives different policy-makers face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|year=2013|title=Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf|format=PDF|website= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political corruption is the abuse of public power, office, or resources by elected government officials for personal gain, by extortion, soliciting or offering bribes. It can also take the form of office holders maintaining themselves in office by purchasing votes by enacting laws which use taxpayers' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/pubs/article/article.asp |title=SOS, Missouri – State Archives Publications |publisher=Sos.mo.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that corruption can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf |format=PDF|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|website= Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

[[File:"Golden toilet" in ((Kaunas)), ((Lithuania)).png|thumb|250px|right|The Kaunas "golden toilet".]]

The '''[[Corruption in Lithuania#Kaunas golden toilet case|Kaunas golden toilet case]]''' was a major Lithuanian scandal. In 2009, municipality of Kaunas (led by mayor [[Andrius Kupčinskas]]) ordered that a shipping container was to be converted into an outdoor toilet at a cost of 500'000 [[litas]] (around 150'000 euros). It was to also require 5'000 LTL (1'500 EUR) in monthly maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="archive.org5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/auksinis-tualetas-per-menesi-atsieis-5-tukst-lt.d?id=59903123|title="Auksinis" tualetas per mėnesį atsieis 5 tūkst.

Despite the investment, the "golden toilet" remained closed for years due to the dysfunctionality and was a subject of a lengthy anti-corruption investigation into those who had created it and &lt;ref name="archive.org5"/&gt; the local municipality even considered demolishing the building at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|title=Alfa.lt – Kauno apskrities viršininko administracija kreipėsi į teismą dėl "auksinio" tualeto griovimo|date=18 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118124213/https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|archivedate=18 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of public servants involved in the toilet's procurement received various prison sentences for recklessness, malfeasance, misuse of power and document falsifications in a 2012 court case, but were cleared of their corruption charges and received compensation, which pushed the total construction cost and subsequent related financial losses to 352'000 euros.

Various sources acclaim the [[People's Party (Spain)|Spanish People's Party]] – Partido Popular -, to be Europe's most corrupt party, with about yearly 45 billion euro worth of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lasemaineduroussillon.com/2017/09/22/plus-de-45-milliards-de-de-corruption-annuelle-rajoy-a-tete-parti-politique-plus-corrompu-deurope/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Police corruption====
{{main|Police corruption}}
Police corruption is a specific form of [[police misconduct]] designed to obtain financial benefits, personal gain, career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing or selectively pursuing an investigation or arrest or aspects of the thin blue line itself where force members collude in lies to protect other members from accountability. One common form of police corruption is soliciting or accepting [[bribe]]s in exchange for not reporting organized drug or [[prostitution]] rings or other illegal activities.

Another example is police officers flouting the police [[code of conduct]] in order to secure convictions of suspects—for example, through the use of [[falsified evidence]]. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in [[organized crime]] themselves. In most major cities, there are [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct.

====Judicial corruption====
Judicial corruption refers to corruption-related [[judicial misconduct|misconduct of judges]], through receiving or giving bribes, improper sentencing of convicted criminals, bias in the hearing and judgement of arguments and other such misconduct.

Governmental corruption of judiciary is broadly known in many transitional and [[developing countries]] because the [[budget]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject to the [[constitutional economics]].

It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the government (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Corruption in judiciary also involves the government in power using the judicial arm of government to oppress the opposition parties in the detriments of the state.

===Corruption in the education system===
{{anchor|Educational system/Universities}}
Corruption in education is a worldwide phenomenon. Corruption in admissions to universities is traditionally considered as one of the most corrupt areas of the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat.

In some countries, such as certain eastern European countries, some Balkan countries and certain Asian countries, corruption occurs frequently in universities.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Heyneman, S.

===Within labor unions===
The Teamsters ([[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]]) is an example of how the civil [[RICO]] process can be used. For decades, the Teamsters have been substantially controlled by [[La Cosa Nostra]]. Since 1957, four of eight Teamster presidents were indicted, yet the union continued to be controlled by organized crime elements. The federal government has been successful at removing the criminal influence from this 1.4 million-member union by using the civil process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=FBI – Italian/Mafia |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524172413/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=2014-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in religion===
{{wikiquote|Corruption in religion}}
The history of religion includes numerous examples of religious leaders calling attention to corruption in the religious practices and institutions of their time. Jewish prophets [[Isaiah]] and [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] berate the rabbinical establishment of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Judea]] for failing to live up to the ideals of the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah]] 1:2–31, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] 5:21–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] accuses the rabbinical establishment of his time of hypocritically following only the ceremonial parts of the Torah and neglecting the more important elements of justice, mercy and faithfulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Mt]] 23:13–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] accuses the [[Catholic Church]] of widespread corruption, including selling of [[w:Indulgence|indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Princeton University]] professor [[Kevin M. Kruse]] advances the thesis that business leaders in the 1930s and 1940s collaborated with clergymen, including [[James W. Fifield Jr.]], to develop and promote a new [[hermeneutical]] approach to Scripture that would de-emphasize the [[social Gospel]] and emphasize themes, such as [[individual salvation]], more congenial to [[free enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

::Business leaders, of course, had long been working to "[[w:Merchandising|merchandise]]" themselves through the appropriation of religion. In organizations such as [[w:James W. Fifield Jr.#Spiritual Mobilization|Spiritual Mobilization]], the prayer breakfast groups, and the [[w:Freedoms Foundation|Freedoms Foundation]], they had linked [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] and, at the same time, likened the welfare state to godless paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in philosophy===
19th century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] acknowledges that academics, including philosophers, are subject to the same sources of corruption as the society they inhabit. He distinguishes the corrupt "university" philosophers, whose "real concern is to earn with credit an honest livelihood for themselves and ... to enjoy a certain prestige in the eyes of the public"&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “On Philosophy in the Universities,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; from the genuine philosopher, whose sole motive is to discover and bear witness to the truth.

::To be a philosopher, that is to say, a lover of wisdom (for wisdom is nothing but truth), it is not enough for a man to love truth, in so far as it is compatible with his own interest, with the will of his superiors, with the dogmas of the church, or with the prejudices and tastes of his contemporaries; so long as he rests content with this position, he is only a φίλαυτος [lover of self], not a φιλόσοφος [lover of wisdom]. For this title of honor is well and wisely conceived precisely by its stating that one should love the truth earnestly and with one’s whole heart, and thus unconditionally and unreservedly, above all else, and, if need be, in defiance of all else. Now the reason for this is the one previously stated that the intellect has become free, and in this state, it does not even know or understand any other interest than that of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “Sketch for a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[criminology]], '''[[corporate crime]]''' refers to crimes committed either by a [[corporation]] (i.e., a [[business entity]] having a separate legal personality from the [[natural person]]s that manage its activities), or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity (see [[vicarious liability (criminal)|vicarious liability]] and [[corporate liability]]). Some negative behaviours by corporations may not be criminal; laws vary between jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions allow [[insider trading]].

The '''[[Mitterrand–Pasqua affair]]''', also known informally as '''[[Angolagate]]''', was an international [[political scandal]] over the secret and illegal sale and shipment of arms from the nations of [[Central Europe]] to the government of [[Angola]] by the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]] in the 1990s. It led to arrests and judiciary actions in the 2000s, involved an illegal arms sale to Angola despite a [[United Nations|UN]] embargo, with business interests in [[France]] and elsewhere improperly obtaining a share of Angolan oil revenues. The scandal has subsequently been tied to several prominent figures in French politics.&lt;ref name=trans257/&gt;

==Methods==
In [[systemic corruption]] and [[grand corruption]], multiple methods of corruption are used concurrently with similar aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Handbook on Practical Anti-Corruption Measures For Prosecutors and Investigators |url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/corruption/publications_handbook_prosecutors.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery===
{{main|Bribery}}
Bribery involves the improper use of gifts and favours in exchange for personal gain. This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is the common form of corruption. The types of favours given are diverse and may include money, gifts, sexual favours, company shares, entertainment, employment and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Bribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion.

===Embezzlement, theft and fraud===
{{main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] and [[theft]] involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. [[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.

Examples include the misdirection of company funds into "shadow companies" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams and other corrupt activity.

===Graft===
{{main|Graft (politics)}}
The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

===Extortion and blackmail===
{{main|Extortion}}
While [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.

This includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy.

===Influence peddling===
[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favours or preferential treatment for another, usually in return for payment.

===Networking===
{{main|Business networking}}
Networking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of discretion===
{{main|Abuse of discretion}}
[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities. Examples include a judge improperly dismissing a criminal case or a customs official using their discretion to allow a banned substance through a port.

===Favoritism, nepotism and clientelism===
{{main|Nepotism}}
[[Cronyism|Favouritism]], [[nepotism]] and [[clientelism]] involve the favouring of not the perpetrator of corruption but someone related to them, such as a friend, family member or member of an association. Examples would include hiring or promoting a family member or staff member to a role they are not qualified for, who belongs to the same political party as you, regardless of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/government-ethics/resources/what-is-government-ethics/favoritism-cronyism-and-nepotism/|title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism|last=|first=|date=|work=Santa Clara|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states do not forbid these forms of corruption.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Corruption and economic growth ==
Corruption is strongly negatively associated with the share of private investment and, hence, it lowers the rate of economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mo, P.H. (2001). Corruption and Economic Growth. ''Journal of Comparative Economics, 29'', 66–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption reduces the returns of productive activities. If the returns to production fall faster than the returns to corruption and rent-seeking activities, resources will flow from productive activities to corruption activities over time. This will result in a lower stock of producible inputs like human capital in corrupted countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Corruption creates the opportunity for increased inequality, reduces the return of productive activities, and, hence, makes rentseeking and corruption activities more attractive. This opportunity for increased inequality not only generates psychological frustration to the underprivileged but also reduces productivity growth, investment, and job opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Causes of corruption ==
According to a 2017 survey study, the following factors have been attributed as causes of corruption:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimant|first=Eugen|last2=Tosato|first2=Guglielmo|date=2017-01-01|title=Causes and Effects of Corruption: What Has Past Decade's Empirical Research Taught Us? a Survey|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=32|issue=2|language=en|pages=335–356|doi=10.1111/joes.12198|issn=1467-6419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preventing corruption ===
[[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Klitgaard|Klitgaard, Robert]] (1998), Controlling Corruption, University of California Press, Berkeley, CA&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that corruption will occur if the corrupt gain is greater than the penalty multiplied by the likelihood of being caught and prosecuted:

Corrupt gain &gt; Penalty × Likelihood of being caught and prosecuted

The degree of corruption will then be a function of the degree of [[monopoly]] and discretion in deciding who should get how much on the one hand and the degree to which this activity is accountable and transparent on the other hand. Still, these equations (which should be understood in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner) seem to be lacking one aspect: a high degree of monopoly and discretion accompanied by a low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption without any moral weakness or insufficient integrity. Also, low penalties in combination with a low probability of being caught will only lead to corruption if people tend to neglect ethics and moral commitment. The original R.Klitgaard equation has therefore been amended by C. Stephan&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, MV Wissenschaft, Muenster, 3rd edition 2012, pp. 26–28, {{ISBN|978-3-86582-452-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; into:

According to Stephan, the moral dimension has an intrinsic and an extrinsic component. The intrinsic component refers to a mentality problem, the extrinsic component to external circumstances like poverty, inadequate remuneration, inappropriate work conditions and inoperable or over-complicated procedures which demoralize people and let them search for "alternative" solutions.

According to the amended Klitgaard equation, limitation of monopoly and regulator discretion of individuals and a high degree of transparency through independent oversight by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media plus public access to reliable information could reduce the problem. Djankov and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|last=|first=|doi = 10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917|year = 2012|last1 = Olken|first1 = Benjamin A|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|hdl=1721.1/73081}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently addressed the important role information plays in fighting corruption with evidence from both developing and developed countries. Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians’ income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.

===Enhancing Civil Society Participation ===
Creating bottom-up mechanisms, promoting citizens participation and encouraging the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. The implementation of the ALACs “Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs)” has led to a significant increase in the number of citizen complaints against acts of corruption received and documented&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00460|title=Increase in the number of civil complaints against acts of corruption.

The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA, USA 1977) was an early paradigmatic law for many western countries i.e. industrial countries of the [[OECD]]. There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].

As early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore "...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|format=PDF|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then "OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999. However, because of ongoing concealed corruption in international transactions several instruments of Country Monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed since then by the OECD in order to foster and evaluate related national activities in combating foreign corrupt practices. One survey shows that after the implementation of heightened review of multinational firms under the convention in 2010 firms from countries that had signed the convention were less likely to use bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan M.|last2=Malesky|first2=Edmund J.|title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|journal=International Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=33–69|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000443|language=en|issn=0020-8183|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a document&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partnerplatform.org/?7vz3z60x |title=Forgues-Puccio, G.F. April 2013, Existing practices on anti-corruption, Economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services helpdesk request |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services help-desk discusses some of the existing practices on anti-corruption. They found:
* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.
* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.
* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.
* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.
* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.
* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm’s productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

==Legal corruption==
Though corruption is often viewed as illegal, there is an evolving concept of legal corruption,&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website= Economics and Politics, v23 |pages= 195–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=May 2014}} as developed by [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]] and Pedro Vicente.  It might be termed as processes which are corrupt, but are protected by a legal (that is, specifically permitted, or at least not proscribed by law) framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website=Economics and Politics, v23|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of legal corruption ===
In 1977 the USA had enacted the ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/|title=Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|website=justice.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; "for the purpose of making it unlawful... to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business" and invited all OECD countries to follow suit. In 1997 a corresponding [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] was signed by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf |title=Report |website= oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/2406452.pdf|title= Report |website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

17 years after the FCPA enacting, a Parliamentary Financial Commission in Bonn presented a comparative study on legal corruption in industrialized OECD countries&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf|format=PDF|title=Drucksache 12/8468|website= Bonn Parliament records|date=September 8, 1994|pages= 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they reported that in most industrial countries even at that time (1994) foreign corruption was legal, and that their foreign corrupt practices had been diverging to a large extent, ranging from simple legalization, through governmental subsidization (tax deduction), up to extremes like in Germany where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted.
Consequently, in order to support national export corporations the Parliamentary Financial Commission recommended to reject a related previous Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition leader which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US FCPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf Drucksache 12/8468:] "Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD bei Abwesenheit der Gruppen BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN und der PDS/Linke Liste."&lt;/ref&gt;
Only after the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into force, did Germany withdraw the legalization of foreign corruption in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;§ 4 chapter 5 no. 10 Income Tax Act, valid until 19 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 study====
The Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 (Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).&lt;ref name=study /&gt;

Belgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:
* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition
* They must be common in the industry
* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year
* Payments must be appropriate
* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).
In the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.

Denmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.

France: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered "rémunérations occult" and are associated with the following disadvantages:
* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.
* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the "rémunérations occult" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.
* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.

Japan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.

Canada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.

Luxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.

Netherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.

Austria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.

Switzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.

US: (rough résumé: "generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA")

UK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient."

===="Specific" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====
Referring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,&lt;ref name=study /&gt; the then Kohl administration (1991–1994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions&lt;ref&gt;the term "official" had been limited to German jurisdiction. Officials of other states legally were no "officials". See [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQYc-dAIF0MC&amp;pg=PA109 für Rolf Keller"] Essay in Memory for Rolf Keller, 2003, Edited by Criminal Law professors from the Law Faculty of Tübingen and the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, page 104: "Nach der Legaldefinition des §11 I Nr.2a StGB versteht man unter einem Amtsträger u.&amp;nbsp;a. eine Person, die &gt;&gt;nach deutschem Recht Beamter oder Richter ist. Die Vorschrift enthält also eine vom Wortlaut her eindeutige Einschränkung auf das deutsche Recht. Ausländische Amtsträger werden somit nicht erfasst."&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed the full deductibility of bribe money, co-financing thus a specific nationalistic corruption practice (§4 Abs. 5 Nr. 10 EStG, valid until March 19, 1999) in contradiction to the 1994 OECD recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/1952622.pdf|title=OECD: Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respective law was not changed before the OECD Convention also in Germany came into force (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Britta Bannenberg, ''Korruption in Deutschland und ihre strafrechtliche Kontrolle'', page VII (Introduction): "Durch die OECD-Konvention und europaweite Abkommen wurden auch in Deutschland neue Anti-Korruptions-Gesetze geschaffen, so dass nun die Auslandsbestechung durch deutsche Unternehmen dem Strafrecht unterfällt und die Bestechungsgelder nicht mehr als Betriebsausgaben von der Steuer abgesetzt werden können."&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Parliamentary Financial Commission's study, however, in 1994 most countries' corruption practices were not nationalistic and much more limited by the respective laws compared to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Financial Commission's study 1994, pp. 6–7: [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf "Nach Auffassung der Fraktion der SPD belegt auch der Bericht der Bundesregierung eindeutig, daß in den meisten ausländischen Industriestaaten Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder in wesentlich geringerem Umfang als in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland steuerlich abgesetzt werden könnten. So müsse in fast allen Staaten bei Zahlungen in das Ausland der Empfänger angegeben werden... Die Abzugsfähigkeit der genannten Ausgaben (Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder) stelle eine steuerliche Subvention dar..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German_Shadow_Economy.png|thumb|Development of the shadow economy in [[Germany|(West-) Germany 1975–2015]]. Original [[shadow economy]] data from Friedrich Schneider, University Linz.]]
Particularly, the non-disclosure of the bribe money recipients' name in tax declarations had been a powerful instrument for Legal Corruption during the 1990s for German corporations, enabling them to block foreign legal jurisdictions which intended to fight corruption in their countries. Hence, they uncontrolled established a strong network of clientelism around Europe (e.g. SIEMENS)&lt;ref name=blackaccounts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#67|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the formation of the [[European Single Market]] in the upcoming [[European Union]] and the [[Eurozone]].
Moreover, in order to further strengthen active corruption the prosecution of tax evasion during that decade had been severely limited. German tax authorities were instructed to refuse any disclosure of bribe recipients' names from tax declarations to the German criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International: [http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/ach_das_mit_der_prostitution "Geschützt durch das Steuergeheimnis dürfen die Steuerbehörden Hinweise auf Korruption nicht an die Staatsanwaltschaft melden."]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, German corporations have been systematically increasing their informal economy from 1980 until today up to 350 bn € per annum (see diagram on the right), thus continuously feeding their black money reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/20063/umfrage/entwicklung-des-umfangs-der-schattenwirtschaft-seit-1995|title= Schattenwirtschaft – Umfang in Deutschland bis 2015 – Statistik|website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Siemens corruption case ===
In 2007, [[Siemens]] was convicted in the District Court of [[Darmstadt]] of criminal corruption against the Italian corporation [[Enel Green Power|Enel Power SpA]]. Siemens had paid almost €3.5 million in bribes to be selected for a €200 million project from the Italian corporation, partially owned by the government. The deal was handled through [[black money]] accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] that were established specifically for such purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? – hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the crime was committed in 1999, after the OECD convention had come into force, this foreign corrupt practice could be prosecuted. According to Bucerius Law School professors Frank Saliger and Karsten Gaede, for the first time a German court of law convicted foreign corrupt practices like national ones although the corresponding law did not yet protect foreign competitors in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#62|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the judicial proceedings however it was disclosed that numerous such black accounts had been established in the past decades.&lt;ref name=blackaccounts /&gt;

== Historical responses in philosophical and religious thought ==
Philosophers and religious thinkers have responded to the inescapable reality of corruption in different ways. [[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers "shelter behind a wall" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.

''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts—unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d&lt;/ref&gt;''

The [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (ὁ [[wikt:κόσμος|κόσμος]])&lt;ref&gt;2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit "unspotted from the world."&lt;ref&gt;James 1:27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably "deal with the world,"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:31.&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends they adopt an attitude of "as if not" in all their dealings. When they buy a thing, for example, they should relate to it "as if it were not theirs to keep."&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:30.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to refuse to "conform to the present age"&lt;ref&gt;Romans 12:2.&lt;/ref&gt; and not to be ashamed to be peculiar or singular.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 2:9.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not be friends of the corrupt world, because "friendship with the world is enmity with God."&lt;ref&gt;James 4:4.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not to love the corrupt world or the things of the world.&lt;ref&gt;1 John 2:15.&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of this world, Paul explains, "are coming to nothing"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 2:6.&lt;/ref&gt; While readers must obey corrupt rulers in order to live in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:1.&lt;/ref&gt; the spirit is subject to no law but to love God and love our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:8.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to adopt a disposition in which they are "in the world, but not of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Fitz-Gibbon, ''In the World But Not Of the World: Christian Social Thinking at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (2000), See also John 15:19.&lt;/ref&gt; This disposition, Paul claims, shows us a way to escape "slavery to corruption" and experience the freedom and glory of being innocent "children of God".&lt;ref&gt;Roman 8:21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Duanwu Festival''', also often known as the '''Dragon Boat Festival''', is a traditional holiday originating in China, occurring near the [[summer solstice]].  It is also known as '''Zhongxiao Festival''' ({{zh|t=忠孝節|p=Zhōngxiàojié}}), commemorating [[Confucianism#Loyalty|fealty]] and [[filial piety]]. The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional [[Chinese calendar]], which is the source of the festival's alternative name, the '''Double Fifth Festival'''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://tour.tncg.gov.tw/English/culture/ct01.asp?type=12 Double Fifth (Dragon Boat) Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506213724/http://tour.tncg.gov.tw/English/culture/ct01.asp?type=12 |date=May 6, 2008 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese calendar is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so the date of the festival varies from year to year on the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In 2016, it occurred on 9 June; in 2017, on 30 May; and in 2018, on 18 June.

==Name==
The usual English name for the holiday, "Dragon Boat Festival", directly translates into two alternative Chinese names for the holiday, {{lang|zh|龍船節}} (''Lóngchuánjié'') and {{lang|zh|龍舟節}} (''Lóngzhōujié'').

The official Chinese name of the festival is "Duanwu Festival" ({{lang-zh|s=端午节|t=端午節}}) on the mainland,&lt;ref&gt;General Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. 《[http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2010-12/10/content_1762643.htm 国务院办公厅关于2011年部分节假日安排的通知国办发明电〔2010〕40号]》. 9 December 2010.

Among [[Malaysia]]n, [[Singapore]]an, and Taiwanese [[Hokkien]] speakers, the festival is also known as the "Fifth Month Festival," the "Fifth Day Festival," and the "[[Dumpling]] Festival."

In Korea, the holiday is called [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]].  It is a significant traditional holiday in the Korean Culture.  In North Korea it is an official holiday. 

In [[Indonesia]]n, the festival is known as "Peh Cun", which is derived from [[Hokkien]] ({{zh|c=扒船|poj=pê-chûn|labels=no}}).

==History==

===Qu Yuan===
[[File:Qu Yuan.png|thumb|175px|left|A statue of [[Qu Yuan]] in [[Jingzhou]], at the site of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu]] capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]].]]
{{Main article|Qu Yuan}}
The story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister [[Qu Yuan]] ({{circa|lk=no|340}}–278 BC) of the [[state (Chinese)|ancient state]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the [[Warring States period]] of the [[Zhou Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=scmp1&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=f1a731616886a110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=China&amp;s=News SCMP]." ''Earthquake and floods make for muted festival.'' Retrieved on 9 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625104853/http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=f1a731616886a110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=China&amp;s=News |date=25 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cadet member of the [[Mi (surname)|Chu royal house]], Qu served in high offices. However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason.&lt;ref name="scmp1" /&gt; During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]. Twenty-eight years later, Qin captured [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]], the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[Miluo River]].

It is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of [[dragon boat race]]s. When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of [[sticky rice]] into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This is said to be the origin of ''[[zongzi]]''.&lt;ref name="scmp1" /&gt;

===Wu Zixu===
{{Main article|Wu Zixu}}
Despite the modern popularity of the Qu Yuan origin theory, in the former territory of the [[Wu (state)|Kingdom of Wu]], the festival commemorated [[Wu Zixu]] (died 484 BC), the Premier of Wu. [[Xi Shi]], a beautiful woman sent by King [[Goujian]] of the [[Yue (state)|state of Yue]], was much loved by King [[Fuchai]] of Wu. Wu Zixu, seeing the dangerous plot of Goujian, warned Fuchai, who became angry at this remark. Wu Zixu was forced to commit suicide by Fuchai, with his body thrown into the river on the fifth day of the fifth month. After his death, in places such as [[Suzhou]], Wu Zixu is remembered during the Duanwu Festival.

===Cao E===
[[File:Cao E Temple.JPG|thumb|The front of the Cao E Temple, facing east, toward [[Cao'e River]], in [[Shangyu]], Zhejiang, China.]]
Although Wu Zixu is commemorated in southeast [[Jiangsu]] and Qu Yuan elsewhere in China, much of Northeastern Zhejiang including the cities of [[Shaoxing]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Zhoushan]] celebrates the memory of the young girl Cao E ({{lang|zh|曹娥}}, AD 130–144) instead. Cao E's father Cao Xu ({{lang|zh|曹盱}}) was a shaman who presided over local ceremonies at [[Shangyu]]. In 143, while presiding over a ceremony commemorating Wu Zixu during the Duanwu Festival, Cao Xu accidentally fell into the Shun River. Cao E, in an act of [[filial piety]], decided to find her father in the river, searching for 3 days trying to find him. After five days, she and her father were both found dead in the river from drowning. Eight years later, in 151, a temple was built in Shangyu dedicated to the memory of Cao E and her sacrifice for filial piety. The Shun River was renamed [[Cao'e River]] in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dragonboatfestival.tk/2017/04/dragon-boat-festival-history.html|title=The river in which she jumped was renamed as Cao's River.|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404220341/http://www.dragonboatfestival.tk/2017/04/dragon-boat-festival-history.html|archivedate=4 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-existing holiday===
Modern research suggests that the stories of Qu Yuan or Wu Zixu were superimposed onto a pre-existing holiday tradition. The promotion of these stories might be encouraged by [[Confucius|Confucian]] scholars, seeking to legitimize and strengthen their influence in China.

The stories of both Qu Yuan and Wu Zixu were recorded in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', completed 187 and 393 years after the events, respectively, because historians wanted to praise both characters.

Another theory, advanced by [[Wen Yiduo]], is that the Dragon Boat Festival originated from [[Chinese dragon|dragon worship]]. Support is drawn from two key traditions of the festival: the tradition of dragon boat racing and ''[[zongzi]]''. The food may have originally represented an offering to the [[dragon king]], while dragon boat racing naturally reflects reverence for the dragon and the active ''yang'' energy associated with it. This was merged with the tradition of visiting friends and family on boats.

Another suggestion is that the festival celebrates a widespread feature of east Asian agrarian societies: the harvest of winter wheat. Offerings were regularly made to deities and spirits at such times: in the ancient Yue, dragon kings; in the ancient Chu, Qu Yuan; in the ancient Wu, Wu Zixu (as a river god); in ancient Korea, mountain gods (see [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]]). As

interactions between different regions increased, these similar festivals eventually merged into one holiday.

==Public holiday==
[[File:Tomishiro ha-ri.jpg|thumb|''Hari'' in [[Tomigusuku]], [[Okinawa]], Japan.]]
The festival was long marked as a cultural festival in China and is a public holiday in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. The [[People's Republic of China]] government established in 1949, however, did not officially recognize Duanwu as a public holiday. Beginning in 2005, the government began to plan for the recognition of three traditional holidays, including Duanwu.&lt;ref&gt;People's Daily.

Retrieved on 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, Duanwu has been celebrated not only as a festival but also as a public holiday in the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua Net.

==Practices and activities==
[[File:Dragon boats racing at 2008 SFIDBF 02.JPG|thumb|A dragon boat racing in [[San Francisco]], 2008.]]
Three of the most widespread activities conducted during the Duanwu Festival are eating (and preparing) ''[[zongzi]]'', drinking [[realgar wine]], and racing [[dragon boat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/Festivals/78316.htm "Dragon Boat Festival"].

===Dragon boat racing===
Dragon boat racing has a rich history of ancient ceremonial and ritualistic traditions, which originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago. The legend starts with the story of Qu Yuan, who was a minister in one of the Warring State governments, Chu. He was slandered by jealous government officials and banished by king. Out of disappointment in the Chu monarch, he drowned himself into the Miluo river. The common people rushed to the water and tried to recover his body. In commemoration of Qu Yuan, people hold dragon boat races yearly on the day of his death according to the legend. They also scattered rice into the water to feed the fish, to prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body, which is one of the origins of ''[[zongzi]]''.

===Zongzi（rice dumpling)===
A notable part of celebrating Duanwu is making and eating zongzi with family members and friends. People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, lotus or banana forming a pyramid shape. The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, dates and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage and salted duck eggs.

Th reason why the Chinese eat zongzi on this special day is because they are considered as a symbol of luck, as the pronunciation of zong is very similar to the pronunciation of zhong (中). This character has a positive connotation, used in words such as 中奖 (winning a prize).

===Food related to 5===
Wu (午) in the name Duanwu in Chinese has similar pronunciation as the number 5, and thus many regions have traditions of eating food that is related to the number 5. For example, the Guangdong and Hong Kong regions have the tradition of having congee made from 5 different beans.

===Realgar wine===
Realgar wine or xionghuang wine is a Chinese alcoholic drink that is made from Chinese yellow wine dosed with powdered realgar, a yellow-orange arsenic sulfide mineral(it is also known as "rice wine"). Realgarly, it is often used as a pesticide against mosquitoes and other biting insects during the hot summers, and as a common antidote against poison in ancient Asia.

===5-colored silk-threaded braid===
In some regions of China, parents braid silk threads of 5 colors and put them on the their children's wrists, on the day of Duanwu. People believe that this will help keep bad spirits and disease away.

Other common activities include hanging up icons of [[Zhong Kui]] (a mythic guardian figure), hanging [[mugwort]] and [[calamus (palm)|calamus]], taking long walks, and wearing perfumed medicine bags. Other traditional activities include a game of making an egg stand at noon (this "game" implies that if someone succeeds in making the egg stand at exactly 12:00 noon, that person will receive luck for the next year), and writing [[Magic (paranormal)|spells]]. All of these activities, together with the drinking of realgar wine, were regarded by the ancients as effective in preventing disease or evil, while promoting health and well-being.

In the early years of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], Duanwu was celebrated as the "Poets' Day" due to Qu Yuan's status as China's first known poet. The [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] also sometimes conflate the [[Lichun|spring]] practice of [[egg-balancing]] with Duanwu.&lt;ref name=dbfest&gt;Huang, Ottavia. ''Hmmm, This Is What I Think'': "[http://ottaviahuang.blogspot.de/2012/06/dragon-boat-festiva-time-to-balance-egg.html Dragon Boat Festival: Time to Balance an Egg]". 24 June 2012. Accessed 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sun is considered to be at its strongest around the time of summer solstice, as the daylight in the northern hemisphere is the longest. The sun, like the [[Chinese dragon]], traditionally represents [[yang (concept)|masculine energy]], whereas the moon, like the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], traditionally represents [[yin (concept)|feminine energy]]. The summer solstice is considered the annual peak of male energy while the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, represents the annual peak of feminine energy. The masculine image of the dragon was thus associated with the Dragon Boat Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Arlene &amp; al. ''Paddles Up!

The '''Eastern Qalamoun offensive''' was a large-scale [[military offensive]] against [[Syrian rebel]] positions in the eastern [[Qalamoun Mountains]] of the [[Rif Dimashq Governorate]] launched by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] along a frontline of more than 15 kilometers in the region.&lt;ref name=aawsat/&gt;

==The offensive==
On 3 September 2016, ISIL sent two [[car bomb]]s towards rebel positions in the mountains, but both destroyed before they could reach their targets. Following this, ISIL forces stormed the rebel-held territory from three different axis, overrunning several positions and reportedly killing more than 20 rebels.&lt;ref name=huge/&gt;

Three days later, an ISIL convoy was deployed as they launched a second assault in the area. During the clashes, the rebels destroyed an ISIL [[T-72]], a [[bulldozer]], and a [[ZU-23-2]], the latter with a [[BGM-71 TOW]] missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.org/2016/09/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B4-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%AA/|title=Daesh bid to take eastern Qalamoun|work=ARA News|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, [[Jaysh al-Islam]] recaptured a hill near [[Dumayr]] from ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/jaysh-al-islam-recaptures-mountaintop-eastern-qalamoun/|title=Jaysh Al-Islam recaptures mountaintop in eastern Qalamoun|work=Al-Masdar News|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September, ISIL launched a third attack against rebel forces in the mountains.

=== Town Plaza commercialization and other events ===
During his term as Mayor of Agoo, Eriguel was instrumental in the construction of a commercial building within the premises of the town plaza &lt;ref name="LBPvCacayuran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPhilTimes" /&gt; - a redevelopment which the Philippine Supreme court later ruled to be "irregular"&lt;ref name="LBPvCacayuran" /&gt; in its landmark "Land Bank of the Philippines v.

Another redevelopment which took place during Eriguel's term as Mayor of Agoo was the partial conversion of the [[Museo de Iloko]] into a franchise of fastfood giant Chowking.&lt;ref name="Times 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/newly-re-elected-congressman-faces-sins-of-the-past/9305/|title=Newly re-elected congressman faces sins of the past|last=|first=|date=June 12, 2013|publisher=The Manila Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224054944/http://www.manilatimes.net/newly-re-elected-congressman-faces-sins-of-the-past/9305/|archive-date=2017-02-24|dead-url=No|work=Op-Ed|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  Don Eufemio F. Eriguel Memorial National High School, named after Eriguel's father, was also established during his term.

After a nine-year tenure, he had reached the maximum term limit 30 June 2007, and could no longer run for the position mayor of Agoo.&lt;ref name="CongressProfile" /&gt;  His wife Sandra Young Eriguel won as Mayor on May 15, 2007. Eriguel was then appointed as an adviser to the government of the province of La Union for municipal affairs - a post he held until June 30, 2010.&lt;ref name="CongressProfile"/&gt;

== Congressman for the Second District of La Union ==
In the elections of May 10, 2010, Eriguel was elected as a member of the House of Representatives as a candidate for the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC), representing the 2nd District of La Union.&lt;ref name="CongressProfile" /&gt;  During his term as Congressman for the Second District of La Union, Eriguel served as chair of the [[List of Philippine House of Representatives committees|House Committee on Health]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/top-stories/189773/marijuana-bill-gets-new-boost.html|title=Marijuana bill gets new boost|last=Cruz|first=Maricel|date=2015-10-18|newspaper=Manila Standard|access-date=2017-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220080939/http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/top-stories/189773/marijuana-bill-gets-new-boost.html|archive-date=2017-02-20|dead-url=|work=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the members of the bicameral committee that passed the Graphic Health Warning bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newvois.org/graphic-health-warning-bill-passes-final-reading-in-congress/|title=Graphic health warning bill passes final reading in Congress|date=2014-06-10|newspaper=New Vois Association of the Philippines|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agoo-Aringay cityhood proposal ===
On June 11, 2014, Eriguel filed House Bill 4644 in an attempt to create a new city in the Second District of La Union by merging the municipalities of Agoo and Aringay.&lt;ref name="AgooAringayBalita"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://balita.net.ph/2014/08/23/agoo-aringay-merger-mariing-tinututulan/|title=Agoo-Aringay merger, mariing tinututulan|last=Lazaro|first=Freddie G.|date=2014-08-23|newspaper=Balita|access-date=2017-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220053637/http://balita.net.ph/2014/08/23/agoo-aringay-merger-mariing-tinututulan/|archive-date=2017-02-20|dead-url=No|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was co-authored by Eriguel's allies, La Union first district Rep. Victor Ortega and Abono party-list Rep. Francisco Emmanuelle Ortega III.&lt;ref name="AgooAringayBalita" /&gt; 

The bill would have created the "City of Agoo-Aringay",  would have two districts under a city mayor  and city vice mayor along with 14 councilors in the Sangguniang Panlungsod,&lt;ref name="AgooAringayBalita" /&gt; all of which were "new" positions for which the former municipal officials could run despite having finished the terms limits of their offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capuno|first=Joseph J.|year=2013|title=Fiscal transfers and gerrymandering under decentralization in the Philippines|url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/93566/1/747317917.pdf|journal=UP School of Economics Discussion Papers|volume=2013-4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bombing ===
Eriguel's caravan was involved in a bombing incident, believed to be an assassination attempt,  on April 30, 2016 in Agoo, La Union.  The incident claimed the life of his driver-supporter, Mr. Jiovannie “Dalmas” Cacayuran and seriously injured eight (8) other individuals including his Aide, Mr. Samuel Ofiaza who lost his right eye. Mr. Cacayuran was only 31 years old and he is survived by his wife and an eight-year old son. &lt;ref&gt;http://northboundasia.com/2016/05/22/p1-m-reward-la-union-bomb-suspect/&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Temporary inclusion in President Duterte's narco-politicians list ===
On August 16, 2016, Eriguel was included by Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] as one of the [[Rodrigo Duterte speech during a wake visit to killed-in-action NavForEastMin soldiers, August 2016#Speech|local government officials and legislators allegedly involved in illegal drug trade]]&lt;ref name="philstar" /&gt; in his "''[[I am sorry for my country]]''" speech.&lt;ref name="rappler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abs" /&gt; Eriguel and other La Union politicians denied these allegations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the last part of March 2017, Eriguel and three other La Union politicians were removed from the narco-politician list.&lt;ref&gt;http://northboundasia.com/2017/03/28/3-la-union-narco-politicians-cleared-illegal-drugs-link/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/nation/143012-illegal-drugs-mayors-affidavit&lt;/ref&gt; A Manila Times news report quoted sources who said that the inclusion of Eriguel in narco-politician list was politically motivated as there are several personalities close to those in charge of providing the list to the President who have taken advantage of the situation to include the names of their rival politicians.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On June 17, 2018, Eriguel, who had been a founding force in former Vice President [[Jejomar Binay]]'s [[United Nationalist Alliance]], was sworn into the ruling [[PDP–Laban]] party by Speaker [[Pantaleon Alvarez]].

== Death ==
On 12 May 2018, Eriguel and two others were gunned down by unknown assailants in an ambush during an event for the 2018 Barangay elections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Gleiwitz incident''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Überfall auf den Sender Gleiwitz}}; {{Lang-pl|Prowokacja gliwicka}}) was a covert Nazi German attack on the German radio station ''Sender Gleiwitz'' on the night of 31 August 1939 (today [[Gliwice]], Poland). The attack is widely regarded as a deceitful [[false flag]] operation, staged with some two dozen similar German incidents on the eve of the [[invasion of Poland]] leading up to [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]].&lt;ref name="books"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?hl=en&amp;q=Gleiwitz+casus+belli |title=Gleiwitz casus belli |publisher=Google Books |quote=Nazi government under Hitler's leadership staged the Gleiwitz incident as a casus belli for the invasion of Poland the following morning |year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had been posed as [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] nationals. Adolf Hitler invaded Poland the next morning after a lengthy period of preparations. During his declaration of war, Hitler did not mention the Gleiwitz incident but grouped all provocations staged by the SS as an alleged Polish assault on Germany. The Gleiwitz incident is the best-known action of [[Operation Himmler]], a series of [[special operations]] undertaken by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) to serve [[Nazi German]] propaganda at the outbreak of war. The operation was intended to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany to justify the invasion of Poland. Evidence for the Gleiwitz attack by the SS was provided by the German SS officer, Alfred Naujocks in 1945.&lt;ref name="books"/&gt;

==Events at Gleiwitz==
[[File:Alfred Naujocks.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Alfred Naujocks]], who organised and led the Gleiwitz operation on the orders of the [[Gestapo]]]]
Much of what is known about the Gleiwitz incident comes from the [[affidavit]] of ''SS-Sturmbannführer'' [[Alfred Naujocks]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. In his testimony, he stated that he organised the incident under orders from [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]], chief of the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name="Nuremberg"/&gt; On the night of 31 August 1939, a small group of German operatives dressed in Polish uniforms and led by Naujocks seized the Gleiwitz station and broadcast a short [[anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] message in Polish (sources vary on the content of the message).&lt;ref name="Ailsby"/&gt;  The operation was named "''Grossmutter gestorben''" (Grandmother died).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/6106566/World-War-IIs-first-victim.html The World War II's first victim. A farmer was murdered as part of a Nazi plot to provide an excuse to invade Poland, the story of a man forgotten by history.] By Bob Graham, 29 Aug 2009. The Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was to make the attack and the broadcast look like the work of Polish anti-German saboteurs.&lt;ref name="Ailsby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WirtzGordon"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-039-26, Reinhard Heydrich im Prager Schloß crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heydrich]] (left) with [[Karl Hermann Frank]] at [[Prague Castle]] in 1941]]
To make the attack seem more convincing, the Germans murdered Franciszek Honiok, a 43-year-old unmarried German [[Silesians|Silesian]] Catholic farmer, known for sympathising with the Poles. He had been arrested the previous day by the [[Gestapo]] and dressed to look like a [[saboteur]], then killed by [[lethal injection]], given gunshot wounds. Honiok was left dead at the scene so that he appeared to have been killed while attacking the station. His corpse was then presented to the police and press as proof of the attack.&lt;ref name="Franciszek Honiok"/&gt; Several prisoners from the [[Dachau concentration camp]] were drugged, shot dead on the site and their faces disfigured to make identification impossible.&lt;ref name="Ailsby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WirtzGordon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Laqueur]], [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/thomas-laqueur/devoted-to-terror 'Devoted to Terror,'] in [[London Review of Books]], Vol. 37 No. 18–24 September 2015, pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans referred to them by the code phrase "''Konserve''" (canned goods). Some sources incorrectly refer to the incident as Operation Canned Goods.&lt;ref name="Lightbody"/&gt; In an oral testimony at the trials, [[Erwin von Lahousen]] stated that his division of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' was one of two that were given the task of providing [[Polish Army]] uniforms, equipment and identification cards; he was later told by [[Wilhelm Canaris]] that people from concentration camps had been disguised in these uniforms and ordered to attack the radio stations.&lt;ref name="Lahousen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/11-30-45.asp|title=20 Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Volume 2; Friday, 30 November 1945|accessdate=8 November 2012|publisher=[[Avalon Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Glivice plaque.JPG|thumb|left|Plaque on site commemorating the incident]]The Gleiwitz incident was a part of a larger operation carried out by [[Abwehr]] and SS forces.&lt;ref name="WirtzGordon"/&gt; Other orchestrated incidents were conducted along the Polish-German border at the same time as the Gleiwitz attack, such as a house burning in the [[Polish Corridor]] and spurious propaganda. The project was called [[Operation Himmler]] and comprised incidents giving the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany.&lt;ref name="Hitler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lightbody"/&gt; German newspapers and politicians, including [[Adolf Hitler]], had made accusations against Polish authorities for months before the 1939 invasion of organising or tolerating violent [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] living in Poland.&lt;ref name="Hitler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="German Editor"/&gt; On 1 September 1939, the day following the Gleiwitz attack, Germany launched ''[[Fall Weiss (1939)|Fall Weiss]]'' (Case White) the invasion of Poland, which precipitated [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]] in Europe. Hitler cited the border incidents in a speech in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] on the same day, with three of them called very serious, as justification for his invasion of Poland.&lt;ref name="Hitler"/&gt; Hitler had told his generals on 22 August, "I will provide a propagandistic [[casus belli]]. Its credibility doesn't matter. The victor will not be asked whether he told the truth".&lt;ref name="WirtzGordon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lightbody"/&gt;

==International reactions==
[[United States|American]] correspondents were summoned to the scene the next day but no neutral parties were allowed to investigate the incident in detail and the international public was sceptical of the German version of the incident.&lt;ref name="WirtzGordon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaloga"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
There have been several adaptations of the incident in cinema. ''[[The Gleiwitz Case|Der Fall Gleiwitz]]'' (1961), directed by Gerhard Klein for [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]] studios (''The Gleiwitz Case''; English subtitles), is an [[East Germany|East German]] film that reconstructs the events.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

''[[Operacja Himmler (film)|Operacja Himmler]]'' (1979) is a Polish film that covers the events.&lt;ref name="imdb1"/&gt;

Both ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|Die Blechtrommel]]'' (1979), directed by [[Volker Schlöndorff]] and ''[[Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil]]'' (1985), directed by [[Jim Goddard]], briefly include the incident.&lt;ref name="imdb3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb2"/&gt;

It was also mentioned in a video game; ''[[Codename: Panzers]]'' (2004), which stirred up controversy in Poland where the game was briefly discussed in Polish media as [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]] falsification of history, before the issue was cleared up as a case of poor reporting.&lt;ref name="gazeta"/&gt;

==Background==
The Gold Coast has had over two decades of international film production with the world-renowned [[Warner Brothers Studios]], the Gold Coast is a profound location for film and television production from its natural endearments, climate, beaches, marine life, rainforest and hinterland that made it an ideal location for film and television production.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, B., Ward, S. and O'Regan, T.

Modelled on the [[Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film]], The Gold Coast Film Festival once showcased the many genres of [[fantasy film]], including [[Science fiction film|science fiction]], [[Horror film|horror]], [[special effect]]s, [[animation]], [[anime]] and children’s fantasy together with sidebar events. The Festival now highlights films from all genres, including horror, fantasy, drama, comedy, independent and documentaries. The festival is open to the public.

The Gold Coast Film Festival also supported Australia's first online video maker award ceremony, the [[Australian Webstream Awards]] in 2013 and is supported by [[ABC Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2" /&gt; Past Program Director, Mitch Ziems, helped open the ceremony that took place at the [[Metro Arts Theatre]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] on 16 November.&lt;ref name="awa12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webstreamawards.org|title=History, Our Vision, Our Mission|date=8 July 2013|publisher=Webstreamawards.org|author=Australian Webstream Awards|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Queensland-only, the fest has opened up, looking outside the state for films in a bid "to have that element of discovery rather than just being reliant on distribution to find our films," Festival Director Lucy Fisher says.

== Gold Coast Film Industry ==
The [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] boasts a heritage of [[filmmaking]], with international filmmaking introduced to the city in the late 1980s.

Fast-forward to 2017 and in the past year, major international films ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]] and [[Thor: Ragnarok|Thor: Rangarok]]'' have chosen the Gold Coast’s incredible locations and highly competent crew to shoot their multimillion-dollar films.

US productions that have chosen to shoot on the Gold Coast have a combined production budget of A$1.7 billion alone.

As the city’s flagship film event we aim to enhance the reputation of the city as one of Australia’s major filmmaking hubs.

[[Village Roadshow Studios]] is a big drawcard in attracting international production to the city.  The studios offer film production facilities consisting of eight [[sound stage]]s, three water tanks, ten production offices, editing suites, wardrobe, makeup, construction, paint and carpentry shops.

Equally, the incredibly diverse range of [[Filming location|film locations]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] means everything from swamps to city scenes, waterfalls to beaches can be shot here.

Local production is also healthy, with a steady stream of productions shooting on the Gold Coast, including in the past year, [[Jungle (2017 film)|Jungle]] and Flammable Children.

Recent productions filmed or edited on the Gold Coast include:
* [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Pirated Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]
* [[Thor: Ragnarok]]
* [[Kong: Skull Island]]
* [[The Shallows (film)|The Shallows]]
* [[Unbroken (film)|Unbroken]]

'''''Imagining Madoff''''' is a 2010 play by playwright [[Deb Margolin]] that tells the story of an imagined encounter between [[Bernard Madoff]], the admitted operator of what has been described as the largest [[Ponzi scheme]] in history, and his victims. Margolin had originally planned to use Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor [[Elie Wiesel]] as a character representing a victim, but was obliged by legal threats to substitute a fictional character, whom she named Solomon Galkin.

==Elie Wiesel's response to the play==
Wiesel had been one of Madoff's most notable victims, having lost his life savings to Madoff's fraud in addition to more than $15 million in losses to a charitable foundation Wiesel operated, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, with Wiesel calling Madoff a "thief, scoundrel, criminal".&lt;ref&gt;Strom, Stephanie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/business/27madoff.html "Elie Wiesel Levels Scorn at Madoff"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 26, 2009. Accessed July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiesel had been chosen as a character by Margolin because she felt that he was "synonymous with decency, morality, the struggle for human dignity and kindness".&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, Jane. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/18/AR2010051804934.html "Theater J pulls Madoff play after objections from activist Elie Wiesel"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 19, 2010. Accessed July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In Margolin's original version of the play, the Elie Wiesel character was intended to be a [[moral authority]] and key character in the play, in which he recounted his [[concentration camp]] experiences and provided meditations on repentance. Margolin sent a copy of the play to Wiesel, who responded in April 2010 with a letter calling the play "obscene" and "defamatory" and threatening legal action to prevent the play from being staged.&lt;ref name=NYT20100719&gt;Healy, Patrick. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/theater/20madoff.html "The Play on Madoff, Without Wiesel"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 19, 2010. Accessed July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[National Public Radio]] on May 20, 2010, attorney Richard Lehv expressed his opinion that Wiesel would have had little chance in court of preventing Margolin from using him as a  character, noting that "it's a free country. You can make a public figure a character in a work of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127018737 When Truth Meets Fiction, Lawyers Intervene], [[National Public Radio]], May 20, 2010. Accessed July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The play was originally to have been staged at [[Theater J]], a Jewish theater in [[Washington, D.C.]] in May 2010, but was canceled after Wiesel made his objections known.&lt;ref name=NYT20100519&gt;Taylor, Kate. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/play-canceled-after-wiesel-objects/ "Play Canceled After Wiesel Objects"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 2010. Accessed July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Ari Roth]], artistic director of Theater J, had offered to submit the play to Wiesel's foundation for review, Margolin objected, viewing the offer as giving Wiesel veto power over the play's content.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Jonathan L. [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/theater/2010/07/19/imagining-madoff-sans-elie-wiesel-opens-this-week-new-york/ "''Imagining Madoff'', sans Elie Wiesel, Opens This Week in New York"], ''[[Washington City Paper]]'', July 19, 2010. Accessed July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Margolin called the experience "painful" and said that she was "still scared to talk about it" because of fear of lawsuits, but she felt that she "didn't want to abandon this play".&lt;ref name=NYT20100719/&gt; Though the character of Wiesel was formally excised from the play, the replacement character Solomon Galkin, described in the play's script as "80 years old, Holocaust survivor, poet, translator, treasurer of his synagogue", retained most of the dialogue that had originally been planned for the Wiesel character.&lt;ref name=NYT20100719/&gt;

The revised play premiered in July-August 2010 at Stageworks/Hudson in [[Hudson, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Review, ''Times Union'', July 25, 2010. Accessed on 7/7/11 at: http://blog.timesunion.com/reviews/imagining-madoff-stageworkshudson-72510/2765/ &lt;/ref&gt; It ran at Washington's Theater J from August 31 to September 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Theater J website, accessed on 7/7/11 at: http://washingtondcjcc.org/center-for-arts/theater-j/on-stage/11-12-season/ &lt;/ref&gt;  

Artistic director Laura Margolis of Stageworks/Hudson has commented that nothing was lost by removing the Wiesel character, and that the new version of the play gave Margolin greater liberties to develop the Galkin character as a person, rather than as representing a famous figure. In a July 2010 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Margolin emphasized that she had never planned "to be on the wrong side of anybody, let alone someone I admire".&lt;ref name=NYT20100719/&gt;

The [[New Repertory Theatre]] of Watertown, MA staged the New England premiere in January 2014, which included sixteen sold-out performances. An encore extension was co-presented with the Boston Center for American Performance at the Boston University Theatre-Comley Studio 210 in May-June 2014.

==Awards==
On February 27, 2012, Deb Margolin's '''''Imagining Madoff''''' was nominated for the 28th Annual [[Helen Hayes Awards]] which celebrates excellence in professional theater in the Washington D.C. area.&lt;ref&gt;Playbill.com, accessed on 2/29/12 at: http://www.playbill.com/news/article/160175-DCs-Helen-Hayes-Nominees-Include-Hairspray-Eric-Schaeffer-Jan-Maxwell-Imagining-Madoff &lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagu|Australia}}{{spaced ndash}} In an address to the parliament, Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] said that the aircraft was downed by a missile which seems to have been launched by Russian-backed rebels.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maiden|first1=Samantha|title=MH17: Russia says Tony Abbott 'operating only on speculation' in his tough stance over separatist involvement in plane tragedy|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/mh17-russia-says-tony-abbott-operating-only-on-speculation-in-his-tough-stance-over-separatist-involvement-in-plane-tragedy/story-fni0cx12-1226994356506?nk=5ad2afc7bd4e4530771c2b41016dee48|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=Australia|date=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Julie Bishop]], the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs said in an interview on an Australian television programme that it was "extraordinary" that her Russian counterparts have refused to speak to her over the shoot-down after the Russian ambassador was summoned to meet her.&lt;ref name=DT /&gt; The Russian government was critical of Abbott's response, branding his comments as "inappropriate" and an "accusation of guilt based on speculation", as Abbott was one of the first world leaders to publicly connect the shoot-down to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-19/russia-says-abbott-comments-mh17-downing-unacceptable/5608852?pfm=ms |title=Malaysia Airlines MH17: Russia says Tony Abbott's comments blaming separatists are 'unacceptable', Julie Bishop criticises Moscow for lack of talks |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott later criticised the recovery efforts as "shambolic", and "more like a garden clean-up than a forensic investigation", while Bishop publicly warned separatist forces against treating the victims' bodies as hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-21/government-considers-declaring-mh17-disaster-a-terrorist-act/5610908?pfm=ms |title=MH17: Prime Minister Tony Abbott hits out at 'shambolic' recovery effort; Government considers listing outrage as terrorist act; rebels move bodies to refrigerated train |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The downing of the flight had resulted in the death of 38 Australian citizens and residents. In the lead up to the 2014 G20 meeting in Brisbane, Tony Abbott sought to focus attention on Russia's role in the shooting. In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the APEC meeting in Beijing, Abbott reportedly told the president that Australia had information that the missile that destroyed the plane had Russian origin and that Russia should consider apologising and offering appropriate restitution to the victims of the shooting. Russia continued to deny involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/12/tony-abbott-vladimir-putin-consider-apology-compensation-mh17 Tony Abbott tells Vladimir Putin to consider apology and compensation for MH17]; The Guardian; 12 November&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] stated that, after the release of the Dutch Safety Board report into the shoot-down, Australia "will not be bullied by Russia" and that "those who committed this crime must answer for it".

'''Intrinsic fraud''' is an intentionally false representation that goes to the heart of what a given lawsuit is about, in other words, whether fraud was used to procure the transaction.  (If the transaction was fraudulent, it probably does not have the legal status of a contract.)  Intrinsic fraud is distinguished from extrinsic fraud (a/k/a collateral fraud) which is a deceptive means of keeping a person from discovering and/or enforcing legal rights.  It is possible to have either intrinsic or extrinsic frauds, or both.

During a [[trial]], [[perjury]], [[forgery]], and [[bribery]] of a [[witness]] constitute [[fraud]]s that might have been relieved by the [[court]].  Such actions will usually lead to a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] being declared and after any penalties for the involved parties a new trial will take place on the same matter.

Two types of intrinsic fraud in contract law are ''fraud in the inducement'' and ''fraud in the factum''.

''Fraud in the factum'' is a [[law|legal]] defense, and occurs where A signs a contract, but either does not realize that it is a contract or does not understand the nature of the contract, because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' if John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on handwriting analysis, and for his homework, he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed.  If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead "fraud in the factum."

''Fraud in the inducement'' is an [[equity (law)|equitable]] defense, and occurs when A signs a contract, knowing that it is a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the contract is about, but the reason A signed the contract was because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' if John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, then John explains that the deed will be kept in a safe deposit box until she dies.  If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed prior to Mom's death, Mom can plead "fraud in the inducement."

'''Jeremiah Andrew Denton Jr.'''  (July 15, 1924&amp;nbsp;– March 28, 2014) was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] representing [[Alabama]] from 1981 to 1987, a [[United States Navy]] [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] and [[Naval Aviator]] [[Prisoner of War|taken captive]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

Denton was widely known for enduring almost eight years of grueling conditions as an American [[prisoner of war]] (POW) in [[Vietnam|North Vietnam]] after the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] he was piloting was shot down in 1965.  He was the first of all American POWs held captive and released by Hanoi to step off an American plane during [[Operation Homecoming]] in February 1973. As one of the earliest and highest-ranking officers to be taken prisoner in North Vietnam, Denton was forced by his captors to participate in a 1966 televised propaganda interview which was broadcast in the United States. While answering questions and feigning trouble with the blinding television lights, Denton blinked his eyes in [[Morse code]], spelling the word "TORTURE"—and confirming for the first time to U.S. [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence]] that American POWs were being [[torture]]d.

In 1976, Denton wrote ''[[When Hell Was in Session]]'' about his experience in captivity, which was made into the 1979 film with [[Hal Holbrook]].  Denton was also the subject of the 2015 documentary ''Jeremiah'' produced by [[Alabama Public Television]].

==Biography==
Denton was born July 15, 1924, in [[Mobile, Alabama]], the oldest of three brothers, and the son of Jeremiah, Sr. and Irene (Steele) Denton.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1940," index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/V1PV-TV3 : accessed 28 Mar 2014), Irene S Denton, Ward 8, Mobile, Mobile City, Mobile, Alabama, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 49-98A, sheet 8B, family 161, NARA digital publication of T627, roll 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Alabama, County Marriages, 1809-1950," index and images, FamilySearch ([https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VRV7-5HT] : accessed 28 Mar 2014), Jeremiah Andrew Denton and Irene Claudia Steele, 22 Aug 1922; citing Mobile County; FHL microfilm 1550499.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[McGill-Toolen Catholic High School]] and [[Spring Hill College]] in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama.

===Military career===
In June 1943, he entered the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], and graduated three years later in the accelerated Class of 1947 on June 5, 1946, with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. His 34-year naval career included service on a variety of ships and on aircraft, including airships (blimps). His principal field of endeavor was naval operations. He also served as a test pilot, flight instructor, and commanding officer of an attack squadron flying the [[A-6 Intruder]].&lt;!---graduated in 1946, but class of 1947 was an accelerated class---&gt;

In 1957, he was credited with revolutionizing naval strategy and tactics for nuclear war as architect of the "Haystack Concept." This strategy called for concealing aircraft carriers from radar by intermingling with commercial shipping and avoiding formations suggestive of a naval fleet. The strategy was simulated in maneuvers and demonstrated effectiveness, allowing two aircraft carrier fleets thirty-five simulated atomic launches before aggressor aircraft and submarines could repel them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Angevine |first=Robert |title=Hiding in Plain Sight: The US Navy and Dispersed Operations Under EMCON 1956-1972 |journal=Naval War College Review |date=Spring 2011 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=80–82 |url=http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/bfd7502d-682c-444d-946c-63245227ae68/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight--The-U-S--Navy-and-Dispersed |accessdate=9 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118061108/http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/bfd7502d-682c-444d-946c-63245227ae68/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight--The-U-S--Navy-and-Dispersed |archivedate=18 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to serve on the staff of the Commander, [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]] at the rank of Commander (O-5) as Fleet Air Defense Officer.

Denton graduated from the [[Armed Forces Staff College]] and the [[Naval War College]], where his thesis on international affairs received top honors by earning the prestigious President's Award. In 1964, he received the degree of [[Master of Arts]] in [[International Affairs]] from [[George Washington University]]'s School of Public and International Affairs in [[Washington, D.C.]]

====Vietnam War====
{{main|U.S. Prisoners of War during the Vietnam War}}
Denton served as a [[United States Naval Aviator]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. In February 1965, he became the [[Prospective Commanding Officer]] of [[Second VA-75 (U.S. Navy)|Attack Squadron Seventy-Five]] serving aboard aircraft carrier [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS ''Independence'' (CVA-62)]].

On July 18, 1965, [[Commander|CDR]] Denton was piloting his [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6A Intruder jet]] ([[Bureau Number|BUNO]] 151577) while leading a twenty-eight aircraft bombing mission over North Vietnam off the ''Independence'' which was stationed in the [[South China Sea]]. He and [[Lieutenant Junior Grade|LTJG]]  Bill Tschudy, his [[Bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier/navigator]], were forced to eject from their plane after it was hit by enemy antiaircraft fire and went down out of control over the village of Thanh Hoa near Hanoi in North Vietnam. Both men were quickly captured and taken prisoner.

Denton and Tschudy were held as prisoners of war for almost eight years, four of which were spent in solitary confinement. Denton was notable for his leadership during the [[Hanoi March]] in July 1966, when he and over 50 American prisoners were paraded through the streets of Hanoi and beaten by North Vietnamese civilians.&lt;ref name="Rochester and Kiley"&gt;Stuart I. Rochester and Frederick Kiley, ''Honor Bound: American Prisoners of War in Southeast Asia 1961-1973'' (Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Denton
is best known from this period of his life for the 1966 televised press conference in which he was forced to participate as an American POW by his North Vietnamese captors. He used the opportunity to send a distress message confirming for the first time to the U.S. [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] and Americans that American POWs were being tortured in North Vietnam. He repeatedly blinked his eyes in [[Morse code]] during the interview, spelling out "T-O-R-T-U-R-E". He was also questioned about his support for the U.S. war effort in [[Vietnam]], to which he replied: "I don't know what is happening, but whatever the position of my government is, I support it fully. Whatever the position of my government, I believe in it, yes sir. I am a member of that government, and it is my job to support it, and I will as long as I live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/eyewitness/flash.php |title=Eyewitness |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a prisoner, he was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]]. Denton was later awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] and other decorations for heroism while a prisoner of war.

Denton was put in the "[[Hanoi Hilton]]" and the "Zoo" prison and prison camp and "Little Vegas" and "Alcatraz" prisons. In "Alcatraz", he became part of a group of American POWs known as the "[[Alcatraz Gang]]". The group consisted of [[George Thomas Coker|George Coker]], Harry Jenkins, [[Sam Johnson]], George McKnight, James Mulligan, Howard Rutledge, Robert Shumaker, [[James Stockdale]] (he graduated with Denton from the Naval Academy),  Ronald Storz, and Nels Tanner. They were put in "Alcatraz" and [[solitary confinement]] to separate them from other POWs because their strong resistance led other POWs in resisting their captors. "Alcatraz" was a special facility in a courtyard behind the North Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, located about one mile away from Hoa Lo Prison. Each of the American POWs spent day and night in windowless {{convert|3|x|9|ft|m|adj=on}} cells mostly in [[Legcuffs|legcuffs]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Lorraine.

On February 12, 1973, both Denton and Tschudy were released in Hanoi by the North Vietnamese along with numerous other American POWs during [[Operation Homecoming]]. Stepping off the jet back home in uniform, Denton said: "We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances. We are profoundly grateful to our [[Commander-in-Chief]] and to our nation for this day. God bless America." The speech has a prominent place in the 1987 documentary, ''[[Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam]]''.

Denton was briefly hospitalized at the [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth|Naval Hospital Portsmouth, Virginia]], and then was assigned to the Commander, Naval Air Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, from February to December 1973. In January 1974, Denton became the commandant of the [[Armed Forces Staff College]] in Norfolk (now known as the [[Joint Forces Staff College]]),&lt;ref name=dunhmln&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9t5LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_YoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7313%2C2056338 |work=Free Lance-Star |location=(Fredericksburg, Virginia) |agency=Associated Press |title=Denton unhappy, may leave Navy |date=May 15, 1975 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=awtimor&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-N5LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_YoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7116%2C2505843|work=Free Lance-Star |location=(Fredericksburg, Virginia) |agency=Associated Press |last=Riley |first=Dave |title=Admiral wants to improve morality  |date=May 17, 1975 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Matthew |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/08/exvietnam-war-pow-man-committed-cooperation |title=Ex-Vietnam War POW a man committed to cooperation &amp;#124; HamptonRoads.com &amp;#124; PilotOnline.com |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final assignment  was as special assistant to the Chief of Naval Education and Training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], [[Florida]], from June 1977 until his retirement from the Navy on November 1, 1977 with the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]].

He wrote his book in 1976, ''[[When Hell was in Session]]'', detailing his detention as an American [[POW]] in North Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-1935071150}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was made into a television movie of the same title in 1979, starring [[Hal Holbrook]] as Denton.

====After retirement====
Denton accepted a position with the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN) as a consultant to CBN founder and friend, [[Pat Robertson]], from 1978 to 1980. During his time with CBN, both Denton and Robertson repeatedly expressed support for the [[Contras|Contra]] forces in [[Nicaragua]]. In 1981, he founded and chaired the National Forum Foundation. Through his National Forum Foundation, Denton arranged shipments of donated goods to countries in need of aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-senator and Vietnam POW who blinked "torture" in Morse code dies|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeremiah-denton-ex-senator-and-vietnam-pow-who-blinked-torture-in-morse-code-dies-at-89/|accessdate=6 October 2014|publisher=CBS News|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:President Ronald Reagan, in the Oval Office, shaking hands with Republican Senator Jeremiah Denton of Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|Denton with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986]]
In 1980, Denton ran as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] for a U.S. Senate seat from his home state of Alabama. In the primary election, he easily defeated former U.S. Congressman [[Armistead Selden]], who was the candidate of choice of the Republican establishment in the state. He then achieved a surprise victory with 50.15 percent of the vote in November over [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate [[Jim Folsom Jr.]], who himself had defeated the incumbent, [[Donald Stewart (Alabama)|Donald W. Stewart]], in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary election. In doing so, Denton became the first {{Clarify|date=December 2017}} retired Navy admiral elected to the United States Senate. He was the second {{Clarify|date=December 2017}} retired Navy admiral to serve in the U.S. Senate as Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]], U.S. Navy (ret.) of [[Connecticut]] served from November 15, 1945 to November 5, 1946.

He was the first Republican to be popularly elected in Alabama since the direct election of U.S. Senators began in 1913, the first Republican senator since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]] to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate, and the first Catholic to be elected to statewide office in Alabama. Compiling a conservative voting record in the U.S. Senate, Denton was featured in a 1981 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' called "An Admiral from Alabama".&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922541,00.html An Admiral from Alabama] Time. 8 June 1981. Retrieved 11 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Senator, Denton was most outspoken on issues related to the preservation of the nuclear family, a goal that he sought to pursue through a $30 million bill to push chastity among teenagers.&lt;ref name="wp-death"/&gt; Denton also chaired a subcommittee on internal security and terrorism, which focused on communist and Soviet threats. By the mid-1980s, he told Time magazine at the outset of the decade, "We will have less national security than we had proportionately when George Washington’s troops were walking around barefoot at Valley Forge." &lt;ref name="wp-death"/&gt;

Adm. Denton was one of a large group of Republican Senators who were swept into office along with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as the President in 1980. Then in 1986, because of perceived failures in the Reagan Administration (including the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]), all but one of these Republicans (see: [[United States Senate elections, 1986]]) were voted out of office and replaced by Democrats. The only exception was with Sen. Ron East of North Carolina, who had died in office in early 1986. His temporary replacement was not elected in November, either.

In 1986, Denton [[United States Senate election in Alabama, 1986|narrowly lost his bid for reelection]] to the U.S. Senate, receiving 49.72 percent of the vote against U.S. Congressman [[Richard Shelby]], a conservative Democrat.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Denton's first wife and the mother of his seven children, the former Katherine Jane Maury, died after sixty-one years of marriage. He subsequently married Mary Belle Bordone in 2010.

Denton died of complications from a heart ailment at a hospice in Virginia Beach on March 28, 2014, at age 89.&lt;ref name="wp-death"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jeremiah-a-denton-jr-vietnam-pow-and-us-senator-dies/2014/03/28/1a15343e-b500-11e3-b899-20667de76985_story.html|title=Jeremiah A.

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Rear Admiral [then Commander] Jeremiah Andrew Denton Jr. (NSN: 0-485087), United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism while serving as a [[U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War|Prisoner of War in North Vietnam]] from February 1966 to May 1966. Under constant pressure from North Vietnamese interrogators and guards, Rear Admiral Denton experienced harassment, intimidation and ruthless treatment in their attempt to gain military information and cooperative participation for propaganda purposes. During this prolonged period of physical and mental agony, he heroically resisted cruelties and continued to promulgate resistance policy and detailed instructions. Forced to attend a press conference with a Japanese correspondent, he blinked out a distress message in Morse Code at the television camera and was understood by United States Naval Intelligence. When this courageous act was reported to the North Vietnamese, he was again subjected to severe brutalities. Displaying extraordinary skill, fearless dedication to duty, and resourcefulness, he reflected great credit upon himself, and upheld the highest traditions of the Naval Service and the United States Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremiah Andrew Denton , Jr. |url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=4410 |title=Valor awards for Jeremiah Andrew Denton , Jr |publisher=Valor.militarytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert''''' is an American musical television special that was broadcast live on [[NBC]] on April 1, 2018 ([[Easter]] Sunday). Executive produced by [[Craig Zadan]], [[Neil Meron]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[Tim Rice]], and [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], it was a staged concert performance of the 1970 [[rock opera]] ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.

==Description and plot==
{{main|Jesus Christ Superstar#Plot}}
The musical is almost entirely sung-through, with a minimal to no amount of spoken dialogue. The plot is loosely based on the [[Canonical Gospel]]s' accounts of the last week of the life of Jesus Christ, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. 

The apostle Judas Iscariot is worried that Jesus has become too swept up in the adoration of his followers, rather than focusing on his teachings about taking care of the poor, and that his following has grown too large and outspoken, which could soon provoke the wrath of the Roman empire ("Heaven on Their Minds"). Judas also object to Jesus spending his time with Mary Magdalene ("What's the Buzz / Strange Thing Mystifying"), who advises Jesus to relax ("Everything's All Right"). Judas's fears prove justified as priests Caiaphas, Annas and more gather and agree that Jesus and his movement must be crushed ("This Jesus Must Die"). Jesus enters Jerusalem filled with exaltation ("Hosanna") until he discovers that his temple has become overrun with unscrupulous merchants and money lenders. Overwhelmed by a throng of people needing his assistance, he tells them to heal themselves, and his follower Mary Magdalene attempts to calm him. Fearing that Jesus' movement is getting out of control, Judas goes to the Priests and tells them where Jesus will be the following night. The Priests pay him with 30 pieces of silver. Judas arrives at Jesus' location with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek. The soldiers arrest Jesus and send him to Caiaphas, then Pontius Pilate, King Herod, and finally back to Pilate, who condemns him to death on the cross.

===Filming===
The live production included an on-camera audience of about 1,500 people. Some of these extras lined two sides of the stage and formed a [[Moshing|mosh pit]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Esther|title=Can Jesus Christ Superstar Live Capture the Holy Grail?|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/jesus-christ-superstar-live-nbc-musical-john-legend-sara-bareilles|website=Variety|accessdate=April 1, 2018|language=en|date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was expected to utilize as many as twelve cameras to film the special.&lt;ref name="Variety1"/&gt; In addition, a full dress rehearsal performance took place on Saturday, March 31, 2018 in front of an invited audience and was recorded. In the event of any difficulties during the live broadcast, the recording served as an emergency backup. It was ultimately not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandt|first1=Robert|title=Drummer Jamey Tate Talks Jesus Christ Superstar Live|url=https://prologix.blog/2018/04/03/drummer-jamey-tate-talks-jesus-christ-superstar-live/|website=Prologix Percussion Blog|accessdate=April 7, 2018|language=en|date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert'' has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response from critics since it aired. On the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the production holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.5 out of 10 based on 23 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "Shaking up traditional religious and musical iconography, ''Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert'' is a sight to be heard, superbly infiltrating the classic source material with originality, rock legend star power, and soulful depth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert (2018)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jesus_christ_superstar_live_in_concert/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the production a score of 81 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/jesus-christ-superstar-live-in-concert|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a positive review, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s Noel Murray praised the special saying, "A conceptual and artistic triumph, NBC’s live telecast of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' on Easter Sunday may have finally justified the recent live musical fad on network TV. Some technical flubs and one mixed-bag lead performance aside, the production was genuinely thrilling, taking chances with the staging of a classic but controversial Broadway show, much more daring than previous live musical broadcasts like ''The Sound of Music'' or ''Peter Pan''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|title=Review: In ‘Jesus Christ Superstar,’ an Old Story for (Yet Another) New Millennium|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/jesus-christ-superstar-live-in-concert-nbc-review.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=April 3, 2018|date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offering similar acclaim, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s David Rooney said, "But here's the thing: This was a phenomenally balanced production of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'', in which star power was equaled by depth of feeling and characterization in all the principals. And the immediacy of television, with close-ups capable of bringing us in tight on the performers' faces, gave Jesus and Mary Magdalene a complexity that often is missing from conventional productions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title='Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert': TV Review|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/jesus-christ-superstar-live-in-concert-1098854|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=April 3, 2018|language=en|date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine Ali of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' also lauded the production saying, "The show was a collision of religion and theater and pop culture that could have been one holy mess. But by the grace of God, or maybe a great cast and lots and lots of expert staging, a great musical became a great TV production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=Lorraine|title=NBC's 'Jesus Christ Superstar Live' shouldn't have worked.

Actually, the ragged edges of a unifying concept did emerge over the course of the NBC musical’s two-hour-and-20-minute running time: If its philosophy could be summed up in one word, “excess” would just about cover it. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13801">The '''Martin Eisenstadt''' hoax is an elaborate scheme of filmmakers [[Dan Mirvish]] and [[Eitan Gorlin]] that involved the creation of a fictional [[Pundit (expert)|"talking head"]], Martin Eisenstadt, who was quoted by numerous major news outlets (such as the [[Los Angeles Times]] and [[MSNBC]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/14/pranksters-get-the-last-laugh/ Pranksters get the last laugh N.Y. Times and MSNBC  biggest victims  						]&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as countless blogs, all of which failed to verify his actual existence. "Eisenstadt" claimed to be the source of commentary about [[Sarah Palin]] in the wake of [[John McCain]]'s 2008 [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="nonexist"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Senior Fellow at the Institute of Nonexistence|author=Pérez-Peña, Richard|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/arts/television/13hoax.html|date=2008-11-13|accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirvish and Gorlin have since written a satirical novel called ''I Am Martin Eisenstadt: One Man's (Wildly Inappropriate) Adventures with the Last Republicans'' for [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] {{ISBN|978-0-86547-914-2}}. The book was written under Eisenstadt's pseudonym and purports to be a first-person memoir of Eisenstadt's experience with the McCain/Palin campaign, including buying Palin's wardrobe. In the book, the Eisenstadt character denies rumors that he does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=True Lies |author=Joshua Green |work=The Washington Monthly |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0911.green.html |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201181235/http://washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0911.green.html |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2007, Mirvish and Gorlin created short videos for [[YouTube]], with Gorlin playing a parking valet, Sheldon, who spewed effusive (and offensive) praise of then-presidential candidate [[Rudolph Giuliani]]. The original short film ''Sheldon'' played at the U.S. Comedy Arts Film Festival in Aspen in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waitress Opens US Comedy Arts Film Fest|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2007/02/waitress_opens_.html|accessdate=2009-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719003946/http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2007/02/waitress_opens_.html|archivedate=2012-07-19|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; After Giuliani's campaign ceased, the character was modified to be a Sr. Fellow at the "Harding Institute for Freedom and Democracy", a fictional entity named in jest for one of the least-respected US presidents, [[Warren G. Harding]]. The pair created a website for the Harding Institute, created the character of the commentator, dubbed Martin Eisenstadt, played again by Gorlin.

Dan Mirvish is a former speechwriter for Democratic Senator [[Tom Harkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On a Roll at Wendy's Window|author= Argetsinger, Amy and Roxanne Roberts|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012602499.html|date=2006-01-27|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a feature film director and co-founder of the [[Slamdance Film Festival]]. Gorlin was nominated for the Someone to Watch Award at the 2003 IFP [[Independent Spirit Award]]s for his film ''The Holy Land''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 IFP Independent Spirit Awards - Nominees and Winners|work=About.com |url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaifpnom2002.htm |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoaxes==
The first appearance of Martin Eisenstadt was in a video of a phony interview, purportedly  on [[Al Iraqiya]], describing his plan to build [[casino]]s in the [[Green Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iraq Green Zone getting Casinos in Baghdad |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L27uHysoQP0|accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was accepted at face value and blogged by [[Jonathan Stein]] of [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stein |first=Jonathan |title=McCain Adviser Says...Wow, Just Watch for Yourself |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/07/8918_mccain_adviser_1.html |format=blog |date=2008-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but correctly and tentatively identified as [[satire]] by the [[Monthly Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Iraq: We All Work for the Casino in the Green Zone |journal=Monthly Review |year=2008 |issue=27/06/08 |url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/mrzine/eisenstadt270608.html |accessdate=2008-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106005338/http://www.monthlyreview.org/mrzine/eisenstadt270608.html |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, Brazilian-based golf blogger William Wolfram had already extensively researched Eisenstadt and concluded he did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Martin Eisenstadt Chronicles |url=http://www.williamkwolfrum.com/the-martin-eisenstadt-chronicles/|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nationwide hoax exposed from a laptop in Apple Valley|url=http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/valley-10328-apple-exposed.html|accessdate=2009-12-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927162836/http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/valley-10328-apple-exposed.html|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the election campaign, several hoaxes perpetrated by Eisenstadt (Gorlin and Mirvish) were reported by news organizations and blogs as truthful, including reports that [[Joe the Plumber]] was a cousin of [[Charles Keating]] and that [[Paris Hilton]]'s family strongly protested the McCain campaign's comparison of [[Barack Obama]] to Hilton.&lt;ref name="nonexist"/&gt;

After election day, 2008, it was widely reported that a senior McCain advisor had stated that Palin was unaware that [[Africa]] was a continent rather than a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palin Calls Criticism by McCain Aides 'Cruel and Mean-Spirited'|author=Yardley, William and Michael Cooper|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/us/politics/08palin.html |accessdate=2008-11-07 | date=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the story broke, Mirvish and Gorlin released a video where Eisenstadt, reportedly a McCain policy adviser, made that statement. Mirvish and Gorlin said that they did not invent the story but only took the credit for it after it broke as being the source.  Several mainstream news outlets publicised this attribution.

The AP, noting that "Eisenstadt's 'work' had been quoted and debunked before," reported that the hoax "was limited to the identity of the source in the story about Palin - not the Fox News story itself."&lt;ref&gt;11-12-2008.

According to Mirvish it would have taken  "about 20 seconds of searching to realize Eisenstadt was a hoax."&lt;ref&gt;ABC News [http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=6250151&amp;page=2 Martin Eisenstadt: Pundit or Fraud?]&lt;/ref&gt; "With the [[24-hour news cycle]] they rush into anything they can find" added Mirvish.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/arts/television/13hoax.html?bl&amp;ex=1226811600&amp;en=69c9c3988c55907d&amp;ei=5087%0A A Senior Fellow at the Institute of Nonexistence ]&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax revealed lack of fact-checking by news outlets such as MSNBC. An MSNBC spokesman stated that someone in the newsroom received the item in an e-mail, and that no vetting was ever done on it.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In May 2009, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that Eisenstadt was one of the "elite Twitterati" who attended the [[White House Correspondents Dinner]], along with [[Meghan McCain]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], and [[Newt Gingrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=You Won't Believe What Martin Eisenstadt Said At The White House Correspondents Dinner |author=Diane Tucker|work=The Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-tucker/you-wont-believe-what-mar_b_201923.html |accessdate=2009-12-15 |date=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time later retracted its original reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tweets From a Washington Dinner (a.k.a. #nerdprom) |author=Hchuaeoan and Ssss1222|work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1897138-3,00.html | date=2009-05-09 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
Mirvish and Gorlin wrote the book ''I Am Martin Eisenstadt: One Man's (wildly inappropriate) Adventures with the Last Republicans'' which was published in November, 2009, by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]. The authors went on a book tour that included a Washington, DC, party thrown for them by former President [[Bill Clinton]] press secretary [[Joe Lockhart]] and other Washington notables including [[Karen Finney]], [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)]] and [[Michael Feldman (consultant)|Michael Feldman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will the Real 'Martin Eisenstadt' Please Stand Up |author=Roxanne Roberts and Amy Argetsinger|work=The Washington Post |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/reliable-source/2009/11/will_the_real_martin_eisenstad.html |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Videos==
Mirvish and Gorlin's first collaboration was a promo for a video game for Mirvish's film Open House. The character they created turned into Sheldon, the bitter valet, for the eponymously titled short film that screened at the 2007 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen. The duo shot seven more similar shorts and posted them anonymously on YouTube as faux Rudolph Giuliani ads during early primary season for the 2008 U.S. Presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="Dana Harris"&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind the Sarah Palin hoax: Interview with Dan Mirvish |author=Dana Harris |work=Variety |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/hal/2008/11/behind-the-sara.html |accessdate=2009-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826065917/http://weblogs.variety.com/hal/2008/11/behind-the-sara.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giuliani campaign denied any involvement with the ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Tricky |author=Dan Saltzstein|work=The New York Times |url=http://themedium.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/its-tricky/ |accessdate=2009-12-30 | date=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ads created their own controversy when the consulting company who had produced the Swift Boat ads of 2004 was erroneously blamed for them under the assumption they were some sort of dirty tricks campaign by one of Giuliani's rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dirty Tricks Dot-Com? Mystery Online Vids Slam GOP Hopefuls |author=Brian Ross|work=ABC News |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/07/dirty-tricks-do.html |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers had planned to develop The Bitter Valet into a TV series, but due to the 2008 Writers Guild Strike, they shelved that plan and came up with the Martin Eisenstadt character. The first thing they filmed with Eisenstadt was the alleged interview on Iraqi TV, which was actually filmed in Mirvish's garage in California.&lt;ref name="Dana Harris"/&gt;

During the fall of 2008, Gorlin and Mirvish filmed a fake 40-minute BBC documentary entitled "The Last Republican," which they then posted on YouTube in 10 parts.  They also filmed four rebuttals allegedly from Martin Eisenstadt in Washington, DC, in which Eisenstadt threatened to sue the documentarian and the BBC for taking him out of context. In fact, the filmmakers later admitted that "The Last Republican" was actually a pilot for a television show they were developing.&lt;ref name="Dana Harris"/&gt;

==Harding Prize for Best Crafted Apologies==
In April, 2010, Mirvish and Gorlin created an award called "The Harding Prize for Best Crafted Apology" named after President [[Warren G. Harding]], who once apologized for his presidency by saying "I am not fit for this office and should never have been here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satirical pundit, Martin Eisenstadt, awards 'Harding' prize for apologies |author=Howie Perlman|work=The Eagle|url=http://www.theeagleonline.com/news/story/satirical-pundit-martin-eisenstadt-awards-harding-prize-for-apologies/|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Perfect 'Sorry': an Art and Science: The first annual Best Crafted Apology awards|author=Teneille Gibson|work=NBCWashington.com|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/weird/The-Perfect-Sorry-An-Art-and-Science-90746749.html|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awarded in a ceremony at [[American University]], Gorlin (as Martin Eisenstadt) presented the Harding Prizes in several categories: [[Rahm Emanuel]] won for Politics, [[Tiger Woods]] for Sports, [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] for Entertainment, and [[Adam Carolla]] won in the best Twitter apology category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emanuel awarded for Best Political Apology; Arenas nominated|author=Nikki Schwab &amp; Tara Palmeri|work=The Washington Examiner|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/blogs/yeas-and-nays/Spoofed_-Emanuel-awarded-for-Best-Political-Apology_-Arenas-nominated-90703589.html|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Rainbow''' was an operation launched by the [[Syrian Army]], supported by [[Hezbollah]] and other allied militias, during the [[Syrian Civil War]], following [[Operation Canopus Star|a successful operation]] which led to the military encircling [[Aleppo]] from the east side and reaching the city's northern approach. The aim of the operation, as the previous one, was to encircle Aleppo and cut rebel supply lines into the city, thus besieging rebel-held areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/1209/Can-UN-envoy-sell-cease-fire-to-Syria-rebels-Not-so-fast.-video|title=Can UN envoy sell cease-fire to Syria rebels?

===Battle for the north-eastern approach===
On 7 December, the Army captured the Breij area, on the northeastern outskirts of the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/12/syria-nusra-front-makes-gains-deraa-2014127183023470829.html|title=Reports: Syrian rebels make gains in Deraa|author=Al Jazeera And AFP|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advanced towards the al-Owayji area to the west and the al-Enzarat area to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://syriahr.com/en/2014/12/24-fighters-of-the-islamic-battalions-and-20-members-of-the-regime-forces-killed-in-aleppo-today/ 24 fighters of the Islamic battalions and 20 members of the regime forces killed in Aleppo today]{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Army moved around Handarat and captured the al-Hajal and al-Majbal districts overlooking Hanano, Haydariya and Duwayr al-Jandul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria army advance around Handarat|url=https://twitter.com/EjmAlrai/status/541944524541812736|website=Elijah J.

On 11 December, government forces recaptured territory in the Stone Quarries in the southern part of Breij they lost the previous week. The military further advanced past the Stone Quarries and pushed south towards the Hanano district.

===Rebel assault on Handarat===

On 9 March, opposition forces launched an assault on Handarat, north of Aleppo, after reportedly noticing confusion in the ranks of government troops following the February fighting.&lt;ref name="rebelsadvance"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/syria-aleppo-handarat-strategic-turkey-opposition-regime.html |title= Rebels advance in Aleppo |first1= Mohammed |last1= al-Khatieb |publisher= Al Monitor |agency=  |date= 13 March 2015 |accessdate= 14 March 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150714142919/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/syria-aleppo-handarat-strategic-turkey-opposition-regime.html# |archive-date= 2015-07-14 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially reported opposition forces captured Handarat, north of Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Mar-10/290223-rebel-groups-seize-land-north-of-aleppo.ashx |title= Rebel groups seize land north of Aleppo |publisher= The Daily Star|date= 10 March 2015 |accessdate=10 March 2015 |quote= A coalition of Syrian rebel and jihadi groups Monday seized the strategic Handarat area north of Aleppo}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was reported by opposition sources the rebels managed to capture only 40–50% of the village, while the Army remained in control of the northern portion of Handarat.&lt;ref name="syriadirect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriadirect.org/rss/1901-syria-direct-news-update-3-9-15 |title=Syria Direct: News Update 3-9-15| publisher=syriadirect.org|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/Abo_Alyazeed_T/status/575386353397030912/photo/1|website=Twitter|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A military source stated they still controlled 80% of Handarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Masdar|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/aleppo-jabhat-al-nusra-forestalled-southern-handarat/|website=Aleppo: Jabhat Al-Nusra Forestalled at southern Handarat|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palace Theatre, Manchester''', is one of the main theatres in [[Manchester]], England. It is situated on [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Street]], on the north-east corner of the intersection with [[Whitworth Street]]. The Palace and its sister theatre the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]] on [[Quay Street]] are operated by the same parent company, [[Ambassador Theatre Group]]. The original capacity of 3,675 has been reduced to its current 1,955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Palace Theatre Manchester: Venue Hire |url = http://www.atgtickets.com/venues/palace-theatre-manchester/venue-hire/ | website = atgtickets.com | publisher = [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] | access-date = 24 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre, originally known as the Grand Old Lady of Oxford Street, opened on 18 May 1891, having been designed by the architect [[Alfred Darbyshire]] at a cost of £40,500. The interior of the theatre was renovated under by [[Bertie Crewe]] in 1913, the renovation took seven months and the theatre reopened with a reduced seating capacity of 2,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Palace Theatre Manchester: Overview |url = http://www.atgtickets.com/venues/palace-theatre-manchester/history/ | website = atgtickets.com | publisher = [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] | access-date = 3 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1940 the theatre took a direct hit from a German bomb during the [[Manchester Blitz]].{{r|IWM}}

In the 1970s audience numbers declined, as they did in many live venues, and it was threatened with closure. The [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] supported it in the 1980s, and after major internal refurbishment and an enlarged stage facility, it was run by a charitable trust, Norwest Holdings.

It is now one of the best equipped and popular theatres outside London. In its repertoire it hosts major touring musicals often with major celebrities and performances of opera and ballet along with various other comedy acts and one night concerts.

===Royal Opera House, Manchester===
{{main article|The Royal Ballet#Royal Opera House.2C Manchester}}

In 2008 the Royal Opera House and [[Manchester City Council]] began planning stages a new development known as '''Royal Opera House, Manchester'''. The proposal would have seen the Palace Theatre refurbished, to create a theatre capable of staging productions by both the [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] and [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera]]. It was intended that the Royal Opera House would take residence of the theatre for an annual 18-week season, staging 16 performances by the Royal Opera, 28 performances by the Royal Ballet and other small-scale productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Higgins | first = Charlotte | title = Disharmony over Royal Opera's plan to go north | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/28/royal-opera-lowry-manchester | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 28 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Northern opera proposal evaluated | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7702690.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 31 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later [[The Lowry]] sent an open letter to the then [[Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport]], [[Ben Bradshaw]], Arts Council England, Manchester City Council and the ROH, calling for the scheme, in its current form, to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Mark | title = Threat to plan for Royal Opera House in the north | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/25/lowry-manchester-royal-opera-house | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 it was announced that the project was being shelved as part of larger arts-funding cuts.&lt;ref name="Stage_031110"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = ROH shelves its plans to move north | url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/roh-shelves-its-plans-to-move-north/ | work = [[The Stage]] | publisher = The Stage Media Company Ltd | date = 3 November 2010 }} [http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/news/show/2252-roh-shelves-its-plans-to-move-north Alternative link.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sharp | first = Rob | title = Royal Opera House shelves move north | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/news/royal-opera-house-shelves-move-north-2118505.html | work = [[The Independent]] | publisher = Independent Print Ltd | date = 27 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productions ==
The opening presentation, to a capacity audience, was the [[ballet]] ''Cleopatra''; however its initial presentations failed to gain popular support and for several years it struggled to make a profit. Only when it broadened its scope to include more popular performers was it a resounding success. During the early part of the 20th century it came into its own, with artists such as [[Danny Kaye]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Noël Coward]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]] making appearances.

Continuing a long tradition of tour openings in Manchester, the hit [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' opened at the theatre in February 2007 for a run until May when it continued on tour around the UK. [[Peter Kay]] starred as Roger Debris for the Manchester dates.

Other notable shows to have played successful seasons at the Palace Theatre include, amongst others, the regional premiere of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' which ran for 13 months from 1992–93, regional premiere of ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' in 2001, ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' in 2006 and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' over the 2006/07 Christmas season. Broadway musical ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' had its UK premiere at the theatre in 2008 and in December 2008 to March 2009 the theatre hosted a season of the UK tour of ''[[Mary Poppins]]'', one of only six theatres in the country to accommodate the tour, both events further cementing the theatre's reputation as the flagship venue of the [[Northern England|North of England]]. In July 2009, during the [[Manchester International Festival]], the theatre, in association with [[Opera North]], staged the world première of [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Prima Donna (opera)|Prima Donna]]''.

The '''pursuit of Nazi collaborators''' refers to the post-World War II pursuit and apprehension of individuals who were not citizens of the [[Third Reich]] at the outbreak of [[World War II]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated]] with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime during the war. Hence, this article does not cover former members of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and their fate after the war.

== Background ==

There were a number of motives for the apprehension of suspected collaborators.  The main motives were: revenge for those murdered, especially those murdered on ethnic grounds in the Holocaust (principally among [[Jew]]s, [[Poles]], and [[Russians]]); a desire after the war to see those responsible face justice, and be categorised as criminals by a court of law (See [[Nuremberg Trials]]); a means of ensuring that criminal acts done were brought to light and placed on the official record, with evidence, so that they could never be disproven (some of the acts being so unthinkable that [[Holocaust denial|denial]] was plausible); widespread sense that genocide of whole communities and cultures on such a scale was intolerable and must not be left unprosecuted even despite the inadequacy of existing laws; and fear that a "Nazi underground" of some kind existed, such as the mythical [[ODESSA]], which could allow the enemy to somehow regroup for their proclaimed [[Fourth Reich]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Means of pursuit ==

The pursuit took many forms, both individual and organised. Several organisations and individuals (famous [[Nazi hunter]]s) pursued [[ex-Nazi]]s or Nazi [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] who allegedly engaged in [[war crimes]] or [[crimes against humanity]]. The pursuit took varied forms such as individuals who reported they saw someone who they recognised, who had now assumed a false identity intent on slipping back into civilian life undetected. Specific individuals were named and sought by groups or governments for their crimes during the war.

Others were subject to after-war spontaneous retaliation committed by populations within occupied countries, which in some areas led to "[[witch hunts]]" for those suspected of having been collaborators, where vigilantism and "summary justice", were common. After a first period of spontaneous pursuit, provisional governments took the matter into their own hands and brought suspected criminals to court. The Nuremberg Trial in Germany judged only the highest German Nazi authorities, and each country prosecuted and sentenced their own collaborationists. [[Pierre Laval]] in France was judged and sentenced to death, while [[Philippe Pétain]] was also sentenced to death, but [[Charles de Gaulle]] later commuted his sentence into a life condemnation. Government action took the form of investigation and interrogation for people suspected to be such.

Infiltration of Nazi support and escape organisations (the most famous one being the [[ODESSA]] network and its various "[[Ratlines (history)|ratlines]]") and those believed to be aiding and abetting them. However, many suspected war criminals were also given [[amnesty]], and some reached high positions in post-war administrations (e.g. [[Maurice Papon]], who became [[Préfecture de police|Police Prefect of Paris]] in charge during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62); he was blamed for the [[1961 Paris massacre]]). Others were never even tried such as [[Robert de Foy]] who resumed being head of the [[Belgian State Security Service]] 1945-1958.

== Pursuit in specific countries ==

=== Argentina ===

In 1960 [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured by Mossad agents in Argentina and smuggled into Israel. Eichmann provided a location in Argentina where [[Josef Mengele]] had been but Mossad was unable to find him; by 1961 Mengele had moved to Brazil. In early October 1999, [[Nazi hunter]] [[Efraim Zuroff]] tracked [[Ustaše|Ustasha]] [[Dinko Šakić]], the former commandant of [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] (nicknamed the "Auschwitz of the Balkans"). Sakic had lived in Argentina for more than 50 years. He was extradited to [[Croatia]] and sentenced by a Zagreb court to 20 years' imprisonment for his crimes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22509603-5006789,00.html |title=Testimony 'clears' Zentai's name |date=1 October 2007 |author=Paige Taylor |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===


Latvia applied to Australia to extradite [[Konrads Kalejs]], allegedly a senior officer in the pro-Nazi [[Arajs Commando]], but he died on 8 November 2001 before he could be extradited. Kalejs migrated to Australia in 1950 and took citizenship. [[Hungary]] applied for the extradition of [[Charles Zentai]] from Australia. He was accused of the murder of Peter Balazs, an 18-year-old [[Judaism|Jewish]] man, in [[Budapest]] in November 1944, while serving in the [[Military of Hungary#Mid-twentieth century|Hungarian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/08/secondworldwar.argentina |title=The hunt for Doctor Death |first1=Rory |last1=Carroll |first2=Uki |last2=Goñi |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}
=== Belgium ===

[[Belgium]] imprisoned Belgian nationals who had collaborated with the Nazis and executed some. One Belgian to be sentenced to execution was [[Pierre Daye]], however he was one of the first Nazi collaborators to escape Europe, and unusually by plane. He fled to Argentina with the help of [[Charles Lescat]], also collaborator of ''[[Je suis partout]]''.&lt;ref name=extradiciones&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina-rree.com/portal/archivos/justicia01.htm|title=Introducción|work=argentina-rree.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in Argentina he attended a meeting organised by [[Juan Perón]] in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'' during which a network (colloquially called [[ratlines (history)|ratlines]]) was created, to organise the escape of collaborators and former Nazis.&lt;ref name=PaginaUki&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-14198-2002-12-15.html|title=La Odessa que creó Perón|publisher= ''[[Pagina/12]]''|date= 15 December 2002|language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 1947, Belgium requested his [[extradition]] from Argentina, however the Argentine Government ignored this request. Now secure in his freedom, Pierre Daye resumed his writing activities, becoming the editor of an official [[Peronism|Perónist]] review.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[[Mark Falcoff]], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1998/int/981109/latin_america.perons_na30a.html Perón's Nazi Ties], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 9 November 1998, vol 152, n°19 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri de Man]] was one of the leading Belgian [[Socialism|socialist]] theoreticians of his period, who collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. After the liberation of Belgium, he crossed the border to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=classiques&gt;{{cite web|first=Jean-Marie|last=Tremblay|url=http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/de_man_henri/de_man_henri_photo/de_man_henri_photo.html|title=Henri de Man, 1885-1953, Professeur à l’Université libre de Bruxelles, Député et ministre dans le parlement belge|language=French|work= [[University of Quebec]]|date= 9 October 2006 }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fclassiques.uqac.ca%2Fclassiques%2Fde_man_henri%2Fde_man_henri_photo%2Fde_man_henri_photo.html&amp;langpair=fr%7Cen&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8 Google translation])&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' of [[treason]] after the war. He died June 20, 1953, together with his wife, in a collision with a train in [[Murten]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=classiques/&gt;

[[Albert Luykx]] fled to the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1948 and became an Irish citizen in 1954.

=== Czechoslovakia ===

Actions against Nazi collaborators in Czechoslovakia, real or alleged, had two significant forms, by judiciary or by mob action. Immediately after the liberation of Czechoslovakia by [[Red Army|Soviet]] and American armies, in an atmosphere of chaos, wild chases began. Individual acts of revenge, mob violence, and simply criminal acts motivated by the possibility to rob or loot targets, occurred. In some places were conducted, by organised groups of self-styled [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s, violence which resembled what is today known as [[ethnic cleansing]]. In most places this stopped when the provisional Czech government and local authorities took power. Other forms included legal action, undertaken by the state administration, after the war, until the regular Czech parliament was established. [[Edvard Beneš|President Beneš]] ruled by issuing [[Talk:Beneš decrees|decrees]], which were later ratified by parliament.

By decree ''5/1945'', property of untrustworthy persons was put under national administration. Untrustworthy were considered German and Hungarian nationals, and people who were active in destruction of the Czechoslovak state and its democratic government, supported Nazi occupation by any means, or were members of organisations considered fascist or collaborator. By the same decree, property of people of German and Hungarian nationality, who could prove they were anti-Nazi, could be returned to them.

By decree ''12/1945 Sb.'', farm property of German and Hungarian nationals or citizens was confiscated, unless they could prove active resistance against Nazism. Property of ''traitors, and enemies of the republic'' was confiscated, regardless of nationality or citizenship. By decree ''16/1945 Sb.'', special tribunals were started. These people's courts had right to sentence to long term imprisonment, life sentence or death. Prosecutions varied from verbal support to those who had committed crimes against humanity, no prosecution was based on ethnicity. By ''33/1945 Sb.'' people of German and Hungarian nationality or ethnicity lost their Czechoslovakian citizenship. However, they had right to apply for renewal.

Most problematic was the law ''115/1946'', concerning resistance to the Nazi regime, which shifted limit of immunity to the year 1946, effectively amnestying all crimes, acts of individual revenge and atrocities against Germans and Hungarians long after the war.

People who lost Czechoslovakian citizenship and failed to apply or did not get it were [[population transfer|transferred]] to Germany, many through the [[transfer camp]] established at [[Terezín]], near the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].

=== Estonia ===

In the [[Estonian war crimes trials]] of 1961 and 1962, several collaborators were sentenced for participation in the [[Holocaust in Estonia|Estonian holocaust]]. Many of the accused escaped punishment by escaping into exile or by suicide. The infamous [[Karl Linnas]] was finally deported by the United States and died in Leningrad while awaiting retrial.

=== France ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}

{{Further|Epuration légale}}
[[File:Laval-shot0038.png|thumb|left|[[Pierre Laval]] and [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] in the [[Frank Capra]] documentary film ''[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]'' (1943)]]

After the liberation, France was briefly swept by a wave of executions of suspected collaborators. Women who were suspected of having romantic liaisons with Germans or, more often, of being German prostitutes, were publicly humiliated by having their heads shaved. Those who had engaged in the [[black market]] were also stigmatised as "[[war profiteer]]s" (''profiteurs de guerre''). However, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF, 1944–46) quickly reestablished order and brought collaborators before the courts. Many of the convicted were later granted [[amnesty]] under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1946–1954), while some civil servants, such as [[Maurice Papon]], succeeded in holding important positions even under [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] (1958 and afterward).

Three periods are identified by historians:{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}&lt;!-- Which historians examples needed --&gt;
The first phase (''épuration sauvage'') consisted of popular convictions, summary executions, and the shaving of women's heads. Estimates by [[Préfecture de police|police prefects]] made in 1948 and 1952 were that as many as six thousand executions occurred before the liberation of France, and four thousand thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}&lt;!-- source needed for specific numbers like these --&gt; The second phase, ''[[épuration légale]]'' (legal purge), began on 26 and 27 June 1944 with Charles de Gaulle's ordinances on the judgment of collaborators by the ''commissions d'épuration''; the commissions sentenced approximately 120,000 persons. [[Charles Maurras]], the leader of the royalist ''[[Action française]]'', was, for example, sentenced to life imprisonment on 25 January 1945. The third phase was more lenient towards collaborators; the trials of [[Philippe Pétain]] and the writer, [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]] are examples of actions taken during this phase.

Between 1944 and 1951, official courts in France sentenced 6,763 people to death (3,910 in absentia) for treason and other offences, but only 791 executions were actually carried out. More common was [[Dégradation nationale|"national degradation,"]] a loss of face and civil rights, which was meted out to 49,723 people.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony, Postwar: ''A History of Europe Since 1945'', Pimlico (London: 2007), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippe Pétain, the former head of [[Vichy France]], was charged with treason in July 1945. He was convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad, but Charles de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. [[Pierre Laval]] was however, executed after his trial. Most convicts were given amnesty a few years later. In the police, collaborators soon resumed official responsibilities. For example, Maurice Papon, who would be convicted in the 1990s for his role in the Vichy collaborationist government, was in the position of giving orders for the [[Paris massacre of 1961]] as the head of the Parisian police.

The French members of the Waffen-SS [[SS Division Charlemagne|''Charlemagne'' Division]] who survived the war were regarded as traitors. Some of the more prominent officers were executed, while the rank-and-file were given prison terms; some of them were given the option of doing time in [[Indochina War|Indochina]] (1946–54) with the [[Légion étrangère|Foreign Legion]] instead of prison.

Many war criminals were judged only in the 1980s, including [[Paul Touvier]], [[Klaus Barbie]], Maurice Papon and his deputy [[Jean Leguay]]. The last two were both convicted for their roles in the July 1942 ''Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv'', or [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]]). Famous [[Nazi hunter]]s [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld]] spent decades trying to bring them to justice. A fair number of collaborationists joined the [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]] terrorist movement during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62). [[Jacques de Bernonville]] escaped to Quebec, then Brazil. [[Jacques Ploncard d'Assac]] became counselor of [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] in Portugal.

Extrajudicial summary executions were harshly criticised after the war. Circles close to Pétainism advanced the figures of 100,000 such executions, denouncing it as "Red Terror", "[[anarchy]]" or "blind vengeance. In 1960, journalist [[Robert Aron]] estimated the number of summary executions of 40,000, surprising de Gaulle. The figure admitted today by mainstream historians is 10,000. Approximately 9,000 of these 10,000 refer to summary executions, in the whole of the country, including during battle. In absolute numbers, there were fewer legal executions in France than in neighbouring, and much smaller, Belgium, and fewer internments than in Norway or Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

=== Greece ===
{{See also|Axis occupation of Greece during World War II}}

Greece was under the control of the Third Reich from 1941 to 1944. After the liberation, the country followed a controversial period of [[denazification]]. Many collaborators and especially former leaders of the Nazi-held puppet regime in Athens were sentenced to death. General [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], the first collaborationist prime minister, was tried by the Greek Special Collaborators Court in 1945 and sentenced to death, but his penalty, like most death sentences, was commuted to life imprisonment. The second collaborationist leader, [[Konstantinos Logothetopoulos]], who had fled to Germany after the Wehrmacht's withdrawal, was caught by the US military and was condemned to life imprisonment. In 1951, he was given parole and thus died outside prison. [[Ioannis Rallis]], the third collaborationist prime minister, was tried on a treason charge; the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. However, several lower and middle figures that had collaborated with the Germans, especially members of the [[Security Battalions]] and the gendarmerie, were soon released and reinstated in their posts; in the developing [[Greek Civil War]], their anti-Communist credentials were more important than their collaboration. Indeed, in many cases the same people who had collaborated with the Germans and staffed the post-war security establishment persecuted leftist former Resistance members.

Furthermore, during 1945, a Special Court on Collaborators in [[Ioannina]] condemned, [[trial in absentia|in absentia]],&lt;ref name = Konidaris&gt; "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yoaOAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Cham+Albanians+absentia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=absentia Examining policy responses to immigration in the light of interstate relations and foreign policy objectives: Greece and Albania]".

"Τσάμηδες - Τσαμουριά. Η ιστορία και τα εγκλήματα τους" [Chams - Chameria. Their History and Crimes]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the war crimes remained unpunished since the criminals had already fled abroad.

=== Israel ===

Israel enacted the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators Punishment Law on 1 August 1950. Between 1950 and 1961, this law was used to prosecute 29 Jewish Holocaust survivors alleged to have been Nazi collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Orna Ben-Naftali and Yogev Tuval, Punishing International Crimes Committed by the Persecuted, ''Journal of International Criminal Justice'' (Volume 4, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured by Mossad agents in Argentina and smuggled into Israel. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death and then executed on 31 May 1962. In 1988 [[John Demjanjuk]] was sentenced to death too, but the guilty verdict was later overturned by the Supreme Court on 29 July 1993.

On 23 February 1965, [[Latvia]]n aviator and Nazi collaborator [[Herberts Cukurs]] was assassinated by the [[Mossad]], the Israeli foreign intelligence service, after being lured to [[Uruguay]] under the pretense of starting an aviation business.

=== Norway ===
{{main|Legal purge in Norway after World War II}}

Seated (from left to right) are [[Quisling]], [[Himmler]], [[Terboven]], and General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]], the commander of the German forces in Norway.]]
[[Vidkun Quisling]], the war time Norwegian "[[Minister President]]", and, among others, [[Nasjonal Samling]] leaders [[Albert Viljam Hagelin]] and [[Ragnar Skancke]], were convicted and [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]]. A total of 45 people were sentenced to death and 37 were executed (25 Norwegians and 12 Germans). Both at the time and later these sentences were the subject of some debate, since the decision to reintroduce capital punishment to the Norwegian legal system for the post war trials was based on clauses in military law. Capital punishment in the Criminal Code had been abolished in 1904. The decision was made by the exiled Norwegian government in London in 1944, later to be debated three times in the Parliament during the trials, and to be confirmed by the Supreme Court.

=== Poland ===

In [[German occupation of Poland|occupied Poland]] the status of ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' had many privileges but one big disadvantage: ''Volksdeutsche'' were conscripted into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. The Volksliste had 4 categories. No. 1 and No. 2 were considered ethnic Germans, while No. 3 and No. 4 were ethnic Poles that signed the ''Volksliste''. No. 1 and No. 2 in the Polish areas re-annexed by Germany numbered ~1,000,000 and No. 3 and No. 4 ~1,700,000. In the [[General Government]] there were ~120,000 Volksdeutsche.

After the war, Volksdeutsche of Polish origins were treated by Poles with special contempt, and also considered [[traitor]]s according to [[Polish law]]. [[German citizen]]s that remained on territory of Poland became as a group ''[[persona non grata|personae non gratae]]''. They had a choice of applying for [[Polish citizenship]] or being expelled to Germany. The property that belonged to Germans, German companies and [[German states]], was confiscated by the [[Polish state]] along with many other properties in [[Communist Poland]].

German owners, as explicitly stated by the law, were not eligible for any [[Compensation (nationalization)|compensation]]. Those who decided to apply became subject to a verification process. At the beginning of the process, many acts of violence against Volksdeutsche took place. However, soon the verification of Volksdeutsche became controlled by the juridical process and was completed in a more controlled manner.

=== Soviet Union ===
[[File:Vlassof.Himmler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrey Vlasov]] and [[Himmler]]]]
Russian and other Soviet members of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] and the [[Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia]] such as [[Andrey Vlasov]] were pursued, tried, and were either sent to [[Gulag]] prison camps or executed.

Many Soviet [[Prisoners of War]] were seen to have collaborated with the Nazis, even if they had done no more than been captured by the [[Wehrmacht]], and spent the war in a camp. Many such unfortunate Soviet citizens were persecuted upon their repatriation to the Soviet Union. In general, after a short trial, if they were not executed, Nazi collaborators were imprisoned in [[Gulag]] [[labor camp|forced labour camp]]s.

The [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was abolished and [[Volga Germans]] were banished from their settlements on the [[Volga River]] with many being deported to [[Kazakhstan]] or [[Siberia]].

=== United Kingdom ===
[[Image:The Capture of William Joyce, Germany, 1945 BU6910.jpg|thumb|[[William Joyce]], who was "Lord Haw-Haw" to British wartime listeners, now silenced and under arrest, lies in an ambulance under armed guard before being taken from [[British Second Army#Germany, 1945|British Second Army]] Headquarters to a hospital.]]
At the end of the war a number of people were tried for high treason. These included members of the [[Waffen-SS]] [[British Free Corps]] and [[William Joyce]] (Lord Haw-Haw). As agreed at the [[Yalta Conference]], the British handed back many Soviet citizens to the Soviet regime. Some of these were collaborators who had fought in the Russian Liberation Army. In later years there would be a controversy because some of those handed over were [[White movement|White Russians]] who had never been Soviet citizens. Yugoslavs were handed over to [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s forces, and many were subsequently left alive.

In 1948 [[Viktors Arājs]], who was the leader of the eponymous commando unit which helped the Nazis murder the Jews of Latvia and Belarus, had been captured in the British zone of occupied Germany after the war but was allowed to go free. He remained at large until 1979 when West Germany put him on trial. One of Arajs's deputies, Harijs Svikeris, settled in Britain after the war and in the 1990s was thought to be a strong candidate to be prosecuted under the [[War Crimes Act 1991|War Crimes Act]], but he died before being prosecuted

In 1961 [[Ain-Ervin Mere]] was [[Estonian war crimes trials|put on trial]] for leadership in the murder of 5,000 foreign Jews in [[Estonia]], but his [[extradition]] was denied by British authorities. On 1 April 1999, [[Anthony Sawoniuk]] was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of murdering two Jews in the UK's first full Nazi war crimes trial. Sawoniuk had led "search-and-kill" police squads to hunt down Jews trying to escape after nearly 3,000 were massacred at Domachevo in Nazi-occupied [[Belarus]] during September 1942. He died in prison on 7 November 2005 at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4413786.stm|title=Nazi war criminal dies in Britain|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 November 2010|date=7 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yugoslavia ===

The reprisals for collaboration with the Nazis were particularly harsh in Yugoslavia, because collaborators were also on the losing side of a ''de facto'' civil war fought on the Yugoslav territory during World War II. The Communists executed many [[Ustashe]], as well as their collaborators, particularly in a series of "atrocities" referred to as the [[Bleiburg repatriations|Bleiburg "tragedy"]]. After the war, the [[UDBA]], Yugoslavia's [[secret police]], was sent overseas to find and eliminate several former Ustashe who fled the country, including the leader of the Ustashe and their [[Independent State of Croatia|pro-Nazi government]], [[Ante Pavelić]].

The '''Rebellion of the Alpujarras''' (1499–1501) was a series of uprisings by the Muslim population of the [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Kingdom of Granada]], [[Crown of Castile]] (formerly, the [[Emirate of Granada]]) against their Catholic rulers. They began in 1499 in the city of Granada in response to mass [[forced conversion]] of the Muslim population to the Catholic faith, which were perceived as violations of the 1491 [[Treaty of Granada]].&lt;ref name="Coleman2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=33}}{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=59}} The uprising in the city quickly died down, but it was followed by more serious revolts in the nearby mountainous area of the [[Alpujarra]]. The Catholic forces, on some occasions led personally by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]], succeeded in suppressing the revolts and exacted severe punishment on the Muslim population.

The Catholic rulers used these revolts as a justification to abolish the Treaty of Granada and the rights of the Muslims guaranteed by the treaty. All Muslims of Granada were subsequently [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|required to convert to Catholicism]] or be expelled, and in 1502 these forced conversions applied to all of Castile. However, they did not apply in the kingdoms of [[History of Valencia|Valencia]] or [[Aragón#Middle Ages|Aragón]].

== Background ==
[[File:The Moorish Proselytes of Archbishop Ximenes, Granada, 1500.jpg|thumb|300px|Forced conversions under [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]] were considered violations of the [[Treaty of Granada]] and were the main trigger of the rebellion.&lt;ref name="Coleman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=David|title=Creating Christian Granada: Society and Religious Culture in an Old-World Frontier City, 1492–1600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFHCqgOVi5cC|date=25 September 2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-4111-0|ref=harv|page=6|quote=Outraged by Cisneros's efforts and his reported use of torture, Granada's Muslims in December 1499 rose up in an open rebellion that quickly spread to the nearby Alpujarras Mountains.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=33}}{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=59}}]]
{{further|Granada War|Treaty of Granada}}
Muslims had been present in the Iberian peninsula since the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the 8th century. By the end of the 15th century, the [[Emirate of Granada]] was the last Muslim-ruled area in the peninsula. In January 1492, after a [[Granada War|decade-long campaign]], [[Muhammad XII of Granada]] (also known as "Boabdil") surrendered the Emirate to the Catholic forces led by the [[Catholic monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]]. The [[Treaty of Granada]], signed on November 1491, guaranteed a set of rights to the Muslims of Granada, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for the capitulation.

At this point, the Muslim population in the former Emirate of Granada was estimated to be between 250,000 and 300,000, making up the majority in the former emirate, and constituting roughly half of the entire Muslim population in Spain.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=40}}

Initially, the Catholic rulers upheld the treaty. Despite pressure from the Spanish clergy, Ferdinand and the Archbishop of Granada [[Hernando de Talavera]] chose a laissez-faire policy towards the Muslims in the hope that interaction with Catholics would make them "understand the error" of their faith and abandon it. When Ferdinand and Isabella visited the city in the summer of 1499, they were greeted by enthusiastic crowd, including Muslims.{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=51–57}}

In the summer of 1499, [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]], the archbishop of Toledo, arrived in Granada and began working alongside Talavera. Cisneros disliked Talavera's approach and began sending uncooperative Muslims, especially the noblemen, to prison, where they were treated harshly until they agreed to convert. Emboldened by the increase in conversions, Cisneros intensified the efforts and in December 1499 he told [[Pope Alexander VI]] that three thousand Muslims converted in a single day. Cisneros' own church council warned that these methods might be a breach of the Treaty, and sixteenth-century [[hagiography|hagiographer]] [[Álvar Gómez de Castro]] described the approach as "methods that were not correct".{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=57–58}}

== Uprising in Albayzín ==
[[File:El Albayzín panorama (2010).jpg|thumb|300px|A 2010 panorama of Albayzín, where the initial uprising took place]]
The increasing mass and forced conversion of Muslims triggered resistance, initially among the urban population of [[Albayzín]] (also spelled Albaicín), the Muslim quarter of Granada.{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=58–59}}  The situation was exacerbated by the treatment of ''elches'', former Christians who converted to Islam. Specific clauses in the Treaty of Granada forbade the conversion of the ''elches'' back to Christianity against their will, but the treaty allowed for questionings of such converts by Christian clerics, in the presence of Muslim religious authorities. Cisneros used this 'loophole' to summon ''elches'' and imprison those who refused to return to Christianity. These efforts were often focused on wives of Muslim men – an emphasis that angered the Muslim population who considered this a violation of their families.{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=58–59}}

On 18 December 1499, as part of this effort, constable Velasco de Barrionuevo and an assistant were taking a female ''elche'' from Albayzín for such questioning. When they passed through a square, she shouted that she was being forced to become Christian. The officials were then surrounded by a hostile crowd, and the constable was killed and the assistant managed to escape after being sheltered by a local Muslim woman.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=59}}

This incident escalated into an open revolt. The residents of Albayzín barricaded the streets and armed themselves. An angry crowd marched to Cisneros' house, apparently for an assault. This crowd later dispersed, but over the following days the revolt become more organized. The population of Albayzín elected their own officials and leaders. In the standoff that ensued, the archbishop Hernando de Talavera and the Captain-General [[Íñigo López de Mendoza y Quiñones|Marquis de Tendilla]] attempted to defuse the situation through negotiations and gestures of good-will. After ten days, the uprising ended as the Muslims handed in their weapons and handed over the constable's killers, who were promptly executed.{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=59–60}}

Subsequently, Cisneros was summoned to the court in Seville to account for his actions, facing a furious Ferdinand. Cisneros however argued that it was the Muslims, not him, who breached the Treaty by engaging in armed rebellion. He convinced Ferdinand and Isabella to declare a collective pardon to the rebels, on condition that they convert to Christianity. Cisneros returned to Granada, which now nominally became a fully Christian city.{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=60–61}}

== Uprising in the Alpujarra ==
[[File:Capileira 2000.jpg|thumb|[[Capileira]], an Alpujarran village, in 2000, which retains many features from the time of Muslim inhabitants. The uprisings took place in such villages.]]
Although the uprising in Albayzín appeared to be put down and Granada was nominally transformed to a Christian city, the rebellion spread to the countryside. The leaders of the Albayzín uprising fled to the [[Alpujarra]] mountains.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=63}} The inhabitants of the mountains, almost exclusively Muslims, had only accepted Christian rule reluctantly.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=63}} They quickly rose up in revolts against what they regarded as the violation of the terms of the Treaty of Granada, and because they feared they would suffer the same forced conversions as the residents of Albayzín.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=35}} By February 1500, 80,000 Christian troops were mobilized to put down the rebellion.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=63}} By March, King Ferdinand arrived to personally direct the operations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=36}}

The rebels were often tactically well led and made use of the mountainous terrain to conduct guerrilla warfare. However, they lacked a central leadership and coherent strategy.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=35}} This was partly caused by the previous Castilian policy of encouraging and facilitating the Granadan upper class to leave the country or convert and be absorbed into the Christian upper class.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=35}} The rebels' lack of strategic command allowed the Christian forces to proceed by [[Defeat in detail|defeating the rebels in one area separately]], then moving on to the next.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=35}}

The rebelling towns and villages in the Alpujarra were gradually defeated. Ferdinand personally led the assault on [[Lanjarón]].{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=63–64}} Rebels who surrendered were generally required to be baptized in order to keep their lives.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=63}} Towns and villages which had to be taken by assault were treated harshly. One of the most violent episodes occurred in [[Laujar de Andarax]], where the Catholic forces under [[Louis de Beaumont, 2nd Count de Lerín|Louis de Beaumont]] took 3,000 Muslims prisoner and then slaughtered them.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=36}} Between two to six hundred women and children who took refuge in a local mosque were blown up with gunpowder.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=38}}{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=36}} During the capture of [[Velefique]], all the men were killed and the women enslaved.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=38}} At [[Nijar]] and [[Güéjar Sierra]], the whole population was enslaved except children who were kidnapped in order to be brought up as Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis del Mármol Carvajal|Mármol Carvajal, Luis del]]: ''Historia del [sic] Rebelión y Castigo de los Moriscos de Reino de Granada'' IV-xxvii;&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=39}}

On 14 January 1501, Ferdinand ordered his army to stand down because the uprising seemed to be suppressed.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=39}} However, further unrest occurred in [[Sierra Bermeja]].{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=39}} An army under Alonso de Aguilar, one of the most distinguished captains of Spain, marched to put down this rebellion.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=39}} On 16 March, the army's undisciplined troops, eager for pillage, charged the rebels.{{sfn|Lea|1901|pp=39–40}} However, this was met by a fierce counter attack. The result was a catastrophe for the Catholic army; Aguilar himself was killed in battle and the army was nearly annihilated.{{sfn|Carr|2009|pp=64–65}}{{sfn|Lea|1901|pp=39–40}}

However, the Muslims soon sued for peace, and Ferdinand, aware of the weakness of the army and the difficulty of mountain warfare, declared that the rebels must choose between exile or baptism.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=40}} Only those who could pay ten gold ''[[dobla]]s'' were given passage, and the majority who could not pay had to stay and be baptized.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=40}} The insurgents surrendered in waves, beginning from the middle of April, since some waited to see whether the first insurgents who surrendered were safe.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=40}} The emigrants were escorted under guards to the port of [[Estepona]] and given passage to [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=40}} The remaining were allowed to return home after converting, surrendering their arms and forfeiting their property.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=65}}{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=40}}

{{further|Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|Morisco|Morisco rebellions in Granada}}
By the end of 1501, the rebellion was put down. The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada,{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=35}} and were given the choice of: (1) remain and accept baptism, (2) reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  (3) be exiled.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=48}} Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=48}}{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=74}} Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the [[Emirate of Granada]], the entire Muslim population of Granada had [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain#Kingdom of Granada|nominally become Christian]].{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=74}} A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion.{{sfn|Edwards|2014|p=99}}{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=56–57}} The newly converted Muslims were known as ''nuevos cristianos'' ("new Christians") or ''[[morisco]]s''  (lit. "Moorish"). Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=53–55}} Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=49}} In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics.{{sfn|Carr|2009|p=74}} This culminated in [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s ''Pragmatica'' of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language. The ''pragmatica'' triggered the [[Morisco rebellions in Granada#Second rebellion.2C 1568-71 .28War of the Alpujarras.29|Morisco revolts]] in 1568–1571.{{sfn|Lea|1901|p=227}}

The '''Rolex Sports Car Series''' was the premier series run by the [[Grand-Am Road Racing|Grand American Road Racing Association]].  It was a North American-based [[sports car racing|sports car]] series founded in 2000 under the name '''Grand American Road Racing Championship''' to replace the failed [[United States Road Racing Championship]].  [[Rolex]] took over as series sponsor in 2002.

It ran a mixture of classes of [[sports prototype]]s and [[Grand Touring]]-style cars.  In 2003, the series debuted their custom prototype chassis, known as [[Daytona Prototype]]s, named after their premiere event, the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]].

The series staged the '''North American Endurance Championship''', featuring three of its premier races at [[Rolex 24 at Daytona|Daytona]], [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen|Watkins Glen]], and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand-Am confirms North American Endurance Championship for 2012|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20111109/GRAND_AM/111109826|work=Autoweek|publisher=Crain Communications|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2012, Grand-Am announced that it would be merging the Rolex Sports Car Series with the [[American Le Mans Series]] to form a unified road racing championship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Future of Sports Car Racing!|url=http://www.alms.com/articles/welcome-future-sports-car-racing|publisher=American Le Mans Series|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be known as [[United SportsCar Racing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130314/ALMS/130319903 |title=Grand-Am, ALMS to become 'United SportsCar Racing' series in 2014 |publisher=Autoweek |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; later retitled as the TUDOR United Sports Car Championship. The final Rolex Sports Car Series race was held on September 28, 2013 at Lime Rock Park.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.racer.com/angelelli-taylor-storm-lime-rock-to-wrap-up-the-grand-am-rolex-series/article/313864/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the failure of the [[United States Road Racing Championship]] in 1999, the new Grand American Road Racing Association announced their intentions to adopt a format similar to the one used in the USRRC, centering on the [[24 Hours of Daytona]].  This series was seen as an alternative to the former [[IMSA GT Championship]], which had since been replaced by the [[American Le Mans Series]] in 1999.  The new series would run two classes of Sports Racing Prototypes identical to the rules used in the new [[FIA Sportscar Championship]] in Europe, while [[Grand Touring]]-style cars would consist of three classes: GTO for larger production-based race cars, GTU for smaller production-based race cars, and AGT for American [[Space frame|tube frame]] cars. The league would also acquire the [[Six Hours of Watkins Glen]], giving the league a second endurance race alongside the Rolex 24 at Daytona to compete with the ALMS' [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and [[Petit Le Mans]]. GTO and GTU would be renamed GTS and GT for 2001 to better match the classes used by the similar [[American Le Mans Series]].
[[Image:GrandAm LagunaSeca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A GT-class Porsche spinning out after navigating a curve at the 2005 Grand-Am Road &amp; Track 250 at Laguna Seca]]
2003 would see the series go through a radical change, as [[Daytona Prototype]]s debuted for the first time to replace both of the Sports Racing Prototype classes.  Although SRPs would be allowed to continue until the end of 2003, few were seen while the Daytona Prototypes took over the series. The American GT class was also dissolved with the cars being placed into the similar GTS class.

In 2004, the faster GTS class was abandoned in order to provide a larger gap between the Daytona Prototypes and GT cars.  The GTS cars were as fast (if not faster) than the Daytona Prototypes.  This meant that the GT class was now the top tier, being joined by the Super Grand Sport (SGS) class moved up from the [[Grand Am Cup]] series.  This was further streamlined in 2005 with all Grand Touring-style cars being in a single GT class. 
[[Image:DaytonaPrototype.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A 2007 [[Riley Technologies|Riley]] MkXI Daytona Prototype seen as the [[2007 Rolex 24 At Daytona]].]]
This formula led to the Rolex Sports Car Series having a large number of competitors at most events, mostly due to the ease of use and low cost of the cars in either class while the Grand American Road Racing Association was able to keep the competition equalized.

With such high car counts, Grand-Am has had to split GT and DP races at shorter tracks where it is not feasible to put 50 cars on the track at one instance.  In each case, the GT cars race on Saturday, and the DP cars race on Sunday.  This split format allows drivers to run both races.  Each race is the same distance, as it would be if the two classes were running together.  This did however make GT races slightly longer than combined events, since GT cars would likely finish several laps behind the winning prototype and thus not cover the full distance.

When the GT and DP races were combined, the two classes would use a motorcycle racing-style "wave start," a concept from Roger Edmonson, who had been in motorcycle racing before organising the Grand American series with the France family.  In this case, the DP cars would take the green flag first, followed, usually 20–30 seconds later (depending on track length) by the GT cars.  By starting the cars separately, the organisers hoped for safer starts by having the two classes of cars race separately.

Due to the series' affiliation with [[NASCAR]], many [[Sprint Cup Series]] drivers occasionally participated in Rolex Series races, particularly the 24 Hours of Daytona.

'''UN-SPIDER ("United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response")''' is a platform which facilitates the use of space-based technologies for disaster management and emergency response.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal http://www.un-spider.org/"&lt;/ref&gt; It is a programme under the auspices of the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] (UNOOSA).

==Space technology for disaster risk management and emergency response==
Global vulnerability to natural disasters is likely to increase as the impact of climate change and land degradation processes continues to rise along with rapidly growing populations. Earthquakes, floods, storms, and other natural hazards cause massive disruption to societies and overburden national economic systems. Considerable losses of life and property, however, could be avoided through better information about the risk and onset of disasters, improved risk assessment, early warning, and disaster monitoring. In recognition of these needs the [[United Nations General Assembly]], in its [http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_61_110E.pdf resolution 61/110] of 14 December 2006, acknowledged that use of existing space technology, such as [[earth observation]] and [[meteorological satellites]], [[communication satellites|communication]] and [[navigation satellite]]s can play a major role in supporting disaster management by providing accurate and timely information for decision making. Space-based information are relevant in all phases of the disaster management cycle from disaster risk reduction&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER March 2015 Newsletter: Space-based Information for Disaster Risk Reduction http://www.un-spider.org/news-and-events/newsletter/un-spider-newsletter-115-space-based-information-disaster-risk-reduction&lt;/ref&gt; to disaster response and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER June 2013 Newsletter: Earth Observation for Disaster Response http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN-SPIDER_NL_EO_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, world leaders convened in Sendai, Japan to agree on a new global framework for disaster risk reduction for the period 2015 through 2030. The outcome document refers to the importance of Space-based and geospatial information in several paragraphs, highlighting, among others, the importance to "develop, update periodically and disseminate, as appropriate, location-based disaster risk information, including risk maps, to decision makers, the general public and communities at risk to disaster in an appropriate format by using, as applicable, geospatial information technology".&lt;ref&gt;Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 http://www.wcdrr.org/uploads/Sendai_Framework_for_Disaster_Risk_Reduction_2015-2030.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and structure==

[[Image:UN City Vienna.jpg|thumb|right|United Nations, Vienna]]

In its [http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_61_110E.pdf resolution 61/110] of 14 December 2006, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] agreed to establish UN-SPIDER as a new [[United Nations]] programme, with the following mission statement: "Ensure that all countries and international and regional organizations have access to and develop the capacity to use all types of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle".&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 61/110 http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_61_110E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, UN-SPIDER aims at three goals: being a gateway to space information for disaster management support; serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities; and being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening.

UN-SPIDER has three offices in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]] and in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

The UN-SPIDER Vienna office is located at UNOOSA's headquarters in the [[Vienna International Centre]]. Its staff members are in charge of general UN-SPIDER coordination, fund-raising, Regional Support Office (RSO) coordination and Technical Advisory Support. The office is supported by the government of Austria.

[[Image:Bonn Langer Eugen Rheinseite 2009-06-01.JPG|thumb|right|United Nations, Bonn]]

The UN-SPIDER Bonn Office was established in October 2007 with the support from the [[German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] (BMWi) and the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR). The UN-SPIDER Bonn Office is responsible for UN-SPIDER's knowledge management. The goal is to make sure that all relevant information is easily accessible and disseminated to all stakeholders in the areas of disaster management and emergency and humanitarian response. This is done mainly via UN-SPIDER's Knowledge Portal, which is managed by the Bonn staff. The Bonn Office is also dealing with Technical Advisory Support in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The Beijing office opened on November 9, 2010, and is supported by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Beijing Office is mainly dealing with Technical Advisory Support in the Asia and Pacific region and the coordination of UN-SPIDER's network of National Focal Points.

==UN-SPIDER activities==

===Knowledge Management===
The acquisition, processing and transfer of knowledge is the central element of UN-SPIDER's activities. A knowledge base on space-based information and solutions to support risk and disaster management are therefore made available through the UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER February 2013 Newsletter: Knowledge Management http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN-SPIDER%20Newsletter%20Knowledge%20Management_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.un-spider.org/ UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal] is central to all knowledge management activities carried out within the framework of UN-SPIDER, as it provides the hosting environment and the dissemination tool for all resulting outputs and products. The Knowledge Portal went online in June 2009 and has been continuously improved and amended ever since. Its main tool is the [http://www.un-spider.org/space-application-matrix Space Application Matrix], a sophisticated search engine to make available research papers and case studies on the application of different space-based resources in all phases of the disaster management cycle. The Portal also features the latest news from the disaster and risk management and the space communities, information on workshops, trainings and events as well as profile details on UN-SPIDER's network partners.

UN-SPIDER's knowledge management activities are accompanied by its awareness-raising efforts. Since awareness-raising is a process by which the level of understanding among the persons targeted is raised, fostering change in attitudes and behaviour, it is central to the success of promoting the use of space-based information. In the framework of UN-SPIDER, awareness-raising is designed as an ongoing process accompanying, facilitating and preparing activities, as new audiences are addressed, new partnerships are formed and new technological solutions are developed, offering new opportunities for existing and new target groups. UN-SPIDER implements its awareness-raising activities mainly via its publications such as the monthly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120625153634/http://www.un-spider.org/about/updates Updates] and the biannual [https://web.archive.org/web/20120625155446/http://www.un-spider.org/about/newsletter Newsletter] as well as via its Knowledge Portal.

===Outreach===
Experience shows that the conduction of activities targeting the full disaster management cycle spans a variety of agencies from the public and the private sector, at different levels, and is best conducted through a coordinated approach. UN-SPIDER's outreach activities contribute to involving practitioners and experts from the disaster management and space communities in UN-SPIDER activities with the end-goal to promote the use of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle. 

UN-SPIDER's outreach activities include the organization of workshops, seminars and expert meetings in all regions as well as the support to similar events organized by its partners. UN-SPIDER staff furthermore participates in relevant events all over the world to raise awareness about UN-SPIDER's activities and the opportunities that space-based information offers for disaster and risk management.

===Technical Advisory Support===
Technical Advisory Support (TAS) is one of the prime activities of the UN-SPIDER programme at the national level. It serves to identify the existing capacity to use space-based information, to analyze the institutional framework to support disaster management through spacebased information and to identify the limitations that inhibit the use of such information. TAS attempts to enable Member States to overcome these limitations through international cooperation and regional opportunities, networking with regional institutions, and setting up disaster management plans. It covers region-specific aspects such as trans-boundary issues, emergency response, risk assessment, 
GIS-based disaster management systems, and disaster-risk reduction. TAS efforts range from a simple consultative phone call to the facilitation of technical support, missions, trainings and workshops. UN-SPIDER's TAS has three pilars: Technical Advisory Missions, Capacity Building and Facilitation of Emergency Support/Technical Support.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER May 2012 Newsletter: Technical Advisory Support http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN-SPIDER%20Newsletter%20Technical%20Advisory%20Support.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technical Advisory Missions''' (TAMs) are an instrument to identify the needs of Member States regarding their capacities to fully take advantage of space-based information. TAMs are officially requested by the respective national government and are conducted by a team of experts. The team meets with key disaster management and development authorities in the Government, United Nations organizations, regional and international organizations/initiatives and private entrepreneurs to discuss the topic in depth. It makes recommendations focusing on how to improve the access to and use of space-based information in risk and disaster management. Since 2008 various missions have been carried out to countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER's Technical Advisory Mission http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/advisory-missions&lt;/ref&gt;

UN-SPIDER defines its '''Capacity Building''' as the process of facilitating the strengthening of the competency of individuals, teams, and agencies to use space-based information to prevent, mitigate, and respond effectively to the challenges posed by natural hazards and related humanitarian crises. UN-SPIDER capacity building efforts include 
four complementary types of activities: Providing policy-relevant advice to institutions and governments regarding the use of space-based (spatial) information to support the full disaster management cycle, facilitating access to space-based data and services, facilitating the training of individuals on access to and use of such data and facilitating access to infrastructure, hardware, and software, and services for spacebased applications. Therefore, UN-SPIDER's capacity building simultaneously aims at institutions, individuals and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER's training activities http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/training-activities&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of emergencies and disasters, UN-SPIDER provides '''Emergency Support'''by taking the role of a bridge linking the disaster management agencies in charge of response operations with space agencies or the mechanisms which have been established by the space community such as the International Charter: Space and Major Disasters. UN-SPIDER provides this support through the activation of its network of Regional Support Offices (RSO) and through links with specific space agencies.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER's Emergency Support http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/emergency-support&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN-SPIDER's network==
UN-SPIDER created a global network in order to foster and strengthen strategic alliances and partnerships on a global and regional scale. There are two types of networks: Regional Support Offices (RSOs) and National Focal Points (NFP).

===Regional Support Offices===
A Regional Support Office is a regional or national center of expertise that is set up within an existing entity by a Member State.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER November 2014 Newsletter: Regional Support Offices http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/Newsletter_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a network of Regional Support Offices was agreed upon by the United Nations General Assembly in its Resolution 61/110. UN-SPIDER currently has Regional Support Offices in Algeria, Argentina, Japan, Colombia, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Romania, Russia, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, and West Indies. Detailed information on all UN-SPIDER Regional Support Offices can be found in the  [https://web.archive.org/web/20100525234115/http://www.un-spider.org/regional-support-offices UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal]

Regional Support Offices communicate and coordinate with UN-SPIDER staff on regular basis, covering the three following realms:
* Outreach and Capacity Building activities
* Horizontal Cooperation (Communities of Practice, Knowledge Management, contributions to the Knowledge Portal)
* Technical Advisory Support

===National Focal Points===
As defined by the United Nations General Assembly, a National Focal Point is a national institution, nominated by the government of the respective country, representing the disaster management and space applications communities. Among them are for example members of the space - or civil protection agencies. UN-SPIDER networks with all countries through the National Focal Points.

A national Focal Point works with UN-SPIDER staff to achieve the following goals:
* promoting access to and the use of space-based solutions for disaster management in the respective country
* strengthening national disaster management planning and policies
* implementing specific national activities that incorporate space-based technology solutions in support of disaster management

'''UTAGE Flight 141''' was a [[Charter airline|chartered]] international passenger flight operated by Guinean regional airlines [[Union des Transports Aériens de Guinée]] flying from [[Cotonou Airport]] in Benin's capital [[Cotonou]] to [[Kufra Airport]] in [[Kufra]], Libya. On 25 December 2003 the aircraft crashed in the [[Bight of Benin]], killing at least 144 people, most of them [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]]. Shortly after the crash, 35 survivors were found by a search and rescue team. Some of them were pronounced dead upon reaching the hospital.

Flight 141 was an ex-American Airlines [[Boeing 727-223]], 3X-GDO. The airliner's route was [[Conakry International Airport]] – [[Cadjehoun Airport|Cotonou Cadjehoun Airport]] – [[Kufra Airport]] – [[Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport|Beirut International Airport]] – [[Dubai International Airport]].&lt;ref name=Frenchrep&gt;"[http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2003/3x-o031225a/htm/3x-o031225a.html report translation 3x-o031225a] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717002356/http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2003/3x-o031225a/htm/3x-o031225a.html |date=17 July 2012 }}." ''[[Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile]]''. Retrieved on 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The final report, which was published by France's [[Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile]], concluded that the crash occurred due to airplane overload, as the plane's actual weight has exceeded its maximum weight capacity, thus decreasing its performance, especially when taking-off. Flight 141 did take off, but because it took for it too long to take off, the plane hit a localizer building and plunged to the ocean. The report also blamed the airport's lack of facilities.

This was the 100th aviation accident involving the [[Boeing 727]]. Currently, it is held as the deadliest plane crash in Benin's aviation history and the 11th worst accident involving the Boeing 727.

==Flight==
Flight 141 was a weekly scheduled flight, performed by the Union des Transports Africains de Guinée (UTAGE), between [[Conakry]] (Guinea), [[Cotonou]] (Benin), [[Beirut]] (Lebanon) and [[Dubai]] (United Arab Emirates). A stopover at Kufra (Libya) was planned between Cotonou and Beirut. Having departed from Conakry at 10:07 with eighty-six passengers, including three babies, and ten crew members, the Boeing 727-223 landed at Cotonou Cadjèhoun on 25 December 2003 at 12:25 where nine passengers disembarked.
Sixty-three persons, including two babies, checked in at the airport check-in desk. Ten others, including one baby, boarded from an aircraft that had arrived from [[Lomé]] (Togo). Passenger boarding and baggage loading took place with great confusion since the airplane was full. In the cockpit, two UTAGE executives used the jump seats. Faced with the particularly large number and size of the hand baggage, the chief flight attendant informed the captain of the situation.

The ground handling company’s agents began loading the baggage in the aft hold when one of the operator’s agents, who remains unidentified, asked them to continue loading in the forward hold, which already contained baggage. When they were finished, the hold was full.

During this time, the crew prepared the airplane for the second flight segment. The co-pilot was discussing his concerns with the UTAGE executives, reminding them of the importance of determining the precise weight of the loading of the airplane. The flight plan for Kufra, signed by the captain, was filed with the ATC office but the meteorological dossier that had been prepared was not collected. Fuel was added to fill up the airplane’s tanks. The accompanying mechanics added some oil.

At 13:52, Flight 141 was cleared to roll. The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF). The elevator was set at 6 ¾, it was stated that the takeoff would be performed with full power applied with brakes on, followed by a climb at three degrees maximum to gain speed, with no turn after landing gear retraction.

As the roll was beginning, a flight attendant informed the cockpit that passengers who wanted to sit near their friends were still standing and did not want to sit down. The airline’s director general called the people in the cabin to order.

The airplane accelerated. In the tower, the assistant controller noted that the take-off roll was long, though he did not pay any particular attention to it. At 13:59, a speed of a hundred and thirty-seven knots was reached. The captain called out V1 and Vr. The co-pilot pulled back on the control column. This action initially had no effect on the airplane’s angle of attack. The Captain called "Rotate, rotate" the co-pilot pulled back harder. The [[angle of attack]] only increased slowly. When the airplane had hardly left the ground, it struck the building containing the localizer on the extended runway centerline, at 13:59. This, resulting in the building's roof to flung 11 meters to the air, and seriously injuring two people in the building. The right main landing gear broke off and ripped off a part of the underwing [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] on the right wing. Survivors of the crash recalled that the plane was struggling to take off while passengers were screaming. The airplane banked slightly to the right with one of its wheels struck the upper perimeter fence and the plane slammed onto the beach. As it slid, it broke into several pieces. The cockpit started to detach, with its right wing and engines followed. It ended up in the ocean, ejecting dead bodies and passengers from the aircraft. The wreckage submerged in upside down condition.

The two controllers present in the tower heard the noise and, looking in the direction of the takeoff, saw the airplane plunge towards the ground. Immediately afterwards, a cloud of dust and sand prevented anything else from being seen.

==Aircraft==
The Boeing 727-223 serial number 21370 was registered N865AA from June 1977 to January 2003. It was operated by [[American Airlines]] before being stored on 18 October 2001, through the [[Pegasus Aviation Group]], in the [[Mojave Desert]] in [[California]]. It was not possible to obtain the number of flying hours it had performed up to then. On 20 February 2002, it became the property of [[Wells Fargo Bank Northwest]].
In January 2003, the airplane was sold to the Financial Advisory Group whose headquarters was in [[Miami]] ([[Florida]]). This company owns transport category aircraft that it leases to various operators. It is apparently currently based in the [[Virgin Islands]], according to information provided by its office in [[Sharjah]] ([[United Arab Emirates]]), an office that appears to have managed the airplane from the time of its purchase and was the only interlocutor for its successive operators.

On 15 January 2003, an FAA authorization allowed the new operator, [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], to undertake a ferry flight to Afghanistan under the YA-FAK registration. This authorization was subject to the obligation to perform the flight with a crew designated by the FAA and, before any new period of operation, to applying the conditional Airworthiness Directives to the airplane. From 23 June 2003, the airplane was operated by [[Alpha Omega Airways]] in [[Swaziland]] under the 3D-FAK registration. On 8 July, this operator, presenting itself as the owner of the airplane, leased it with a crew for thirty days to UTAGE, which operated it from 9 July 2003 onwards. On 13 October, UTAGE signed a second lease for the same airplane, this time with FAG.

On 15 October 2003, the Guinean DNAC ([[Direction Nationale de l’Aviation Civile]]) registered the airplane under the registration 3X-GDO and, while waiting for UTAGE to write its own documentation, approved the Flight Manual for three months that had originally been approved by the FAA, along with the [[Minimum Equipment List]] (MEL) and the maintenance manual issued by American Airlines.

==Passengers and crew==
As the accident happened on [[Christmas Day]], many of the passengers were workers who were flying back home to Lebanon to enjoy the holidays with their families. Over a hundred of the passengers were [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], while the rest of them were from [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Libya]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survivors of Benin crash arrive home|url=http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2003-12-27/survivors-of-benin-crash-arrive-home/111334|publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the passengers were 15 [[Bangladeshi]] UN peacekeepers returning from their duties in [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benin air crash dead flown home|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3353551.stm|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Exact passenger numbers are impossible to determine, as it is thought that there were more passengers aboard than were listed on the manifest.&lt;ref&gt;BEA final report, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, given the difficulties encountered in finding and identifying the victims, due to the extent of the disaster and the imprecision of the information concerning the people on board, between 140 and 148 fatalities can be recorded. There were 22 survivors, including the Captain, the Flight Engineer and the Director General of the airline. The technician who was in the building struck by the airplane was also seriously injured. Some passengers who survived the initial crash died while being hospitalised.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2003/12/26/benincrash031226.html Plane crash in Benin kills at least 111]." ''[[CBC News|CBC]]''. Friday 26 December 2003. Retrieved on 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Captain was a former pilot of [[Libyan Arab Airlines]], where he flew on Boeing 727, the Captain joined the FAG ([[Financial Advisory Group]]) on 11 March 2003, with availability until 10 March 2004. In this context, he had first worked for three months for [[Royal Jordanian Airlines]] then for six months for [[Trans Air Benin]]. During the latter period, he regularly landed a Boeing 727 at [[Pointe Noire]] and at Cotonou. On 8 December 2003, he had performed his first flight for UTAGE. He has an experience of 11,000 flying hours in total including 5,000 as Captain; and 8,000 flying hours on type including 5,000 as Captain; The co-pilot had joined FAG on secondment from Libyan Arab Airlines. Like the Captain, he had performed his first flight for UTAGE on 8 December 2003 and had done exactly the same things since that date.

The Flight Engineer has a total experience of 14,000 flying hours in total, all on the Boeing 727-200; The Flight Engineer had joined FAG on secondment from Libyan Arab Airlines. Like the Captain, he had performed his first flight for UTAGE on 8 December 2003 and had done exactly the same things since that date.

==Investigation==
The [[Government of Benin]] established a National Commission of Inquiry to investigate the accident, as outlined by Decree No 2003-563 of 26 December 2003. The commission's president established Order No 3451/MDN/DC/SA of 30 December 2003, which gave the ''[[Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile]]'' (BEA), the aviation investigation agency of France, the responsibility of conducting the technical investigation.

===Weight analysis===
The flap was set on 25° and stabilizer on 6 ¾, which are confirmed both by the testimony and the observations made on the wreckage, as well as the declared weight of 78 tons, show that the center of gravity allowed for by the crew was 19%. This value is consistent with a normally balanced airplane.

However, it is not known what the load distribution was in the holds, or even in the cabin, since no loading plan was made. The only thing that could be determined was that the forward hold was full of baggage. Equally, the airplane’s dry operating index, that is to say its empty center of gravity, could not be identified. On the documents from Lebanon, two different indices had been used. It was not therefore possible to reconstitute the airplane’s center of gravity as it was on 25 December.

The graphs obtained from the recorded parameters show that, when the stick was pulled back, the elevator was immediately set in pitch-up position, but that the airplane’s response time was very slow compared to the usual time, the nose lifting off late while the acceleration was continuing. Such a situation at the beginning of the climb-out indicates either a limitation in the elevator’s operation or an airplane with a center of gravity that is too far forward.
Checks on the wreckage did not reveal any evidence that would support the theory that there was a malfunction of the airplane’s elevator system. The calculations made on the basis of airplane performance during take-off gave a center of gravity value of 14%, that is to say a forward balance that would require a stabilizer setting of 7 ¾.
The eight previous take-offs were also analyzed. These show that during the previous take-off from Cotonou (flight No 8) the pitch-up control input had immediately been followed by an increase in the airplane’s angle of attack. The previous day, on flight No 2, the rotation had been performed spontaneously at a speed of around one hundred knots, without any elevator input, and there had then been some stick push so as to control the rotation.

===Final report===
The BEA wrote the original accident report and translated the report into English.&lt;ref name=Frenchrep/&gt; The final report concluded that the accident resulted from a direct cause:
*The difficulty that the flight crew encountered in performing the rotation with an overloaded airplane whose forward center of gravity was unknown to them;
and two structural causes:
*The operator’s serious lack of competence, organization and regulatory documentation, which made it impossible for it both to organize the operation of the route correctly and to check the loading of the airplane;
*The inadequacy of the supervision exercised by the Guinean civil aviation authorities and, previously, by the authorities in Swaziland, in the context of safety oversight.
The following factors could have contributed to the accident:
*The need for air links with [[Beirut]] for the large communities of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] origin in [[West Africa]];
*The dispersal of effective responsibility between the various actors, in particular the role played by the owner of the airplane, which made supervision complicated;
*The failure by the operator, at Conakry and Cotonou, to call on service companies to supply information on the airplane’s loading;
*The Captain’s agreement to undertake the take-off with an airplane for which he had not been able to establish the weight;
*The short length of the runway at Cotonou;
*The time of day chosen for the departure of the flight, when it was particularly hot;
*The very wide margins, in particular in relation to the airplane’s weight, which appeared to exist, due to the use of an inappropriate document to establish the airplane’s weight and balance sheet;
*The existence of a non-frangible building one hundred and eighteen meters after the runway threshold.

'''Valdecoxib''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) used in the treatment of [[osteoarthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and painful [[menstruation]] and menstrual symptoms. It is a selective [[cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor]].

Valdecoxib was manufactured and marketed under the brand name '''Bextra''' by [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]] as an anti-inflammatory arthritis drug.&lt;ref name="CNN_2009" /&gt; It was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] on November 20, 2001, to treat arthritis and menstrual cramps.&lt;ref name="NYT_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson Micromedex.

A water-soluble and injectable [[prodrug]] of valdecoxib, [[parecoxib]] is marketed in the [[European Union]] under the tradename Dynastat.

==Uses until 2005==
In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved valdecoxib for the treatment of [[osteoarthritis]], adult [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and primary [[dysmenorrhea]].&lt;ref name="Off-label"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/pfizerfactsheet.html | title = Pfizer to pay $2.3 billion to resolve criminal and civil health care liability relating to fraudulent marketing and the payment of kickbacks | publisher = Stop Medicare Fraud, US Dept of Health &amp; Human Svc, and of Justice | accessdate = 2012-07-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120830023954/http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/pfizerfactsheet.html | archive-date = 2012-08-30 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valdecoxib was also used [[off-label]] for controlling acute [[pain]] and various types of surgical pain.&lt;ref name = "Off-label" /&gt;

==Side-effects and withdrawal from market==
On April 7, 2005, Pfizer withdrew Bextra from the U.S. market on recommendation by the FDA, citing an increased risk of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] and also the risk of a serious, sometimes fatal, skin reaction. This was a result of recent attention to prescription [[NSAIDs]], such as [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck's]] [[Rofecoxib|Vioxx]]. Other reported side-effects were [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].

Pfizer first acknowledged cardiovascular risks associated with Bextra in October 2004. The [[American Heart Association]] soon after was presented with a report indicating patients using Bextra while recovering from heart surgery were 2.19 times more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack than those taking [[placebos]].

In a large study published in [[The Journal of the American Medical Association]] in 2006, valdecoxib appeared less adverse for renal (kidney) disease and heart arrhythmia compared to Vioxx, however elevated renal risks were slightly suggested.&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cox2drugreview.org |title=Adverse Effects of Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors on Renal and Arrhythmia Events: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials |journal=JAMA |date=2006 |last1=Zhang |first1=J J. |last2=Ding |first2=E.

==2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions==
{{Undue weight section|date=December 2012}}
On September 2, 2009, the [[United States Department of Justice]] fined Pfizer $2.3 billion after one of its [[subsidiaries]], Pharmacia &amp; UpJohn Company, pleaded guilty to marketing four drugs including Bextra "with the intent to defraud or mislead."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8234533.stm |title=Pfizer agrees record fraud fine |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacia &amp; UpJohn admitted to criminal conduct in the promotion of Bextra, and agreed to pay the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter, $1.195 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/Sept2009/PharmaciaPlea.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-16 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20091207084948/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/Sept2009/PharmaciaPlea.html |archive-date=2009-12-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A former Pfizer district sales manager was [[indicted]] and sentenced to home confinement for destroying documents regarding the illegal promotion of Bextra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/Mar2009/FarinaconvictionPR.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/10002882/pfizers-off-label-bextra-team-were-called-the-highlanders/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a Regional Manager pleaded guilty to distribution of a mis-branded product, and was fined $75,000 and twenty-four months on probation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/June2009/HollowayMarySentencingPR.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining $1 billion of the fine was paid to resolve allegations under the civil [[False Claims Act]] case and is the largest civil fraud settlement against a pharmaceutical company. Six whistle-blowers were awarded more than $102 million for their role in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel09/justice_090209.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Former Pfizer sales representative John Kopchinski acted as a [[qui tam]] relator and filed a complaint in 2004 outlining the illegal conduct in the marketing of Bextra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/CM/NewsSettlements/NewsSettlements536.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Kopchinski was awarded $51.5 million for his role in the case because the improper marketing of Bextra was the largest piece of the settlement at $1.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/CM/NewsSettlements/NewsSettlements531.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Volkstheater''' in [[Vienna]] (roughly translated as "People's Theatre") was founded in 1889 by request of the citizens of [[Vienna]], amongst them the [[dramatist]] [[Ludwig Anzengruber]] and the furniture manufacturer [[Thonet]], in order to offer a popular counter weight to the ''[[Hofburgtheater]]''. It was erected according to designs by [[Ferdinand Fellner]] and [[Hermann Helmer]], who attempted to reconcile their plans with [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. It is located in [[Neubau]], the seventh [[Districts of Vienna|district]] of Vienna.

The founders of this stage had a theatrical stage in mind, in order to expose wider circles of the population of Vienna to classical and modern literature whilst staging these next to more traditional plays. The theatre follows this tradition even today. New productions of the classics are always in the pipeline along with regular reinterpretations of works by [[Ferdinand Raimund]] and [[Johann Nestroy]] and many new plays and reruns. Special attention is given to Austrian playwrights of old and new.

In 2005 Michael Schottenberg became art director of the Volkstheater.

In 2005 the Volkstheater started an alternative theater stage called "Volkstheater Hundsturm" in [[Margareten]], the fifth district of Vienna. It is a place for experimental theater (e.g. [[Wojtek Klemm]], [[Dejan Dukovski]], [[monochrom]]).

The [[Volkstheater (Vienna U-Bahn)|Volkstheater station]] of lines U2 and U3 of the Vienna U-Bahn is located here.

The '''Winter Star Party''', aka '''WSP''', is an annual convention of amateur astronomers where the primary activity is nighttime astronomical observation. This February event is run at [[Camp Wesumkee]] located on [[Scout Key]] in the Lower [[Florida Keys]]. It is hosted by the [[Southern Cross Astronomical Society]] of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb | url = http://www.nyaa.ca/gfx/Sky24_starparties.pdf | title = BBC Sky At Night Magazine's Top 10 Star Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most attendees camp on site. [[BBC Sky at Night]] magazine rated WSP as one of the top 10 [[Star party|star parties]] in the world. WSP was first established in 1984 by [[Tippy D'Auria]].
