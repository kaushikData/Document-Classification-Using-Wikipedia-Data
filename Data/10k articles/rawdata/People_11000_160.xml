'''Amy Bulley''' or '''Agnes Amy Bulley; Amy Brooke''' (20 April 1852 – 16 November 1939) was an [[United Kingdom|English]] promoter of [[Female education|women's education]]. She was an early student at both [[Girton College]] and [[Newnham College]] and one of the first two students to sit the [[Tripos|tripos examinations]] in Cambridge. She entered education where she helped to create a "women's department" at what would be [[Manchester University]]. She wrote about [[women's rights]] and the growth of "white blouse" employment.

==Life==
Bulley was born in [[Minera|New Brighton]] near [[Wrexham]] in 1852. She was one fourteen children and one of the three daughters who were unusually sent to college. Her two sisters went to the newly founded [[Newnham College]] whilst Amy went to [[Girton College]]. After three years she moved to Newnham College where she could join her sisters 
and complete a fourth year. The principal of Newnham, [[Anne Jemima Clough]], was a friend of their parents and she had persuaded Mr and Mary Rachel Bulley to send their daughters south.
Bulley and [[Mary Paley]] were the first women to take the tripos examination at [[Cambridge University]]. The people who delivered Paley and Bulley's papers were [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[John Venn]], [[Sedley Taylor]] and Paley's future husband [[Alfred Marshall]]. She took the Tripos in 1874, and had she been a man then she would have been awarded a second class degree but this was denied her because she was a woman. They sat the exams in Professor [[Benjamin Hall Kennedy]]'s drawing room. Paley described how Professor Kennedy would sometimes doze whilst [[Exam invigilator|invigilating]]. Paley created a sketch of Sedley Taylor delivering the exam papers.&lt;ref name="Sutherland2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gill Sutherland|title=Faith, Duty, and the Power of Mind: The Cloughs and Their Circle, 1820-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-jeNIa9LjYC&amp;pg=PA106|date=17 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86155-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 she became an [[Schoolmaster|assistant mistress]] at [[Manchester High School for Girls]] where she taught and in her spare time
gave support to the growing demand for more higher education 
for girls.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Linda Walker, ‘Bulley , (Agnes) Amy (1852–1939)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2010 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48686, accessed 22 Feb 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The Manchester and Salford College for Women was founded in 1876. This was not an easy task as the girls involved found the work difficult as they had not been prepared for higher education. Numbers grew slowly from 46 to 50 and by 1883 there were eighty students. The college was now operating and this created sufficient pressure on the 
[[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]] that it created a women's department in 1883. Bulley served as secretary to the college and despite her interventions only a few students would attend examinations because of the fear of failure. Bulley arranged for students to stay behind to have tea with her as she knew that they would normally return straight home and not enjoy any camaraderie.&lt;ref name="Tylecote1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mabel Phythian Tylecote|title=The Education of Women at Manchester University, 1883-1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBkNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=1941|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=20–25|id=GGKEY:GTG8HH8X98D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulley took an interest in worker's rights when she left Manchester High School for Girls in 1886. She switched careers to journalism where she wrote for the [[Manchester Guardian]]. The switch was possible because she had already established a reputation for writing when she had written ''Middle Class Education in England'' in 1881.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1894 she and Margaret Whitley published "Women's Work".&lt;ref name="BulleyWhitley1894"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Agnes Amy Bulley|author2=Margaret Whitley|title=Women's Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbZOAAAAMAAJ|year=1894|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 she married Joseph Brooke who had been her dead sister Mary's husband. Three years later, her botanist brother, [[Arthur Bulley]] stood for parliament on behalf of the [[women's suffrage]] movement.&lt;ref name="Crawford2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Crawford|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&amp;pg=PA333|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-43402-6|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her husband died in 1912 she moved to Bushey in Hertfordshire where 
she died in 1939.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

'''Anastacia Lyn Newkirk''' (born September 17, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter, producer and former dancer. Her first two albums ''[[Not That Kind]]'' (2000) and ''[[Freak of Nature]]'' (2001) were released in quick succession to major success. Spurred on by the multi-platinum, global smash "[[I'm Outta Love]]", Anastacia was awarded as the 'World's Best-Selling New Female Pop Artist' in 2001. Her commercial success continued with international hits such as "[[Paid My Dues]]", "[[One Day in Your Life (Anastacia song)|One Day In Your Life]]" and the official song of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], "[[Boom (Anastacia song)|Boom]]". After recovering from cancer, she returned with 2004's ''[[Anastacia (album)|Anastacia]]'' which deviated from previous albums into pop-rock. Peaking at number one in 11 countries, it became Europe's second biggest selling album of the year. Its lead single "[[Left Outside Alone]]" remained at number one on the European ''Billboard'' chart for 15 weeks and helped Anastacia launch the most successful European tour by a solo artist that same year.&lt;ref name="anastacia.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anastacia.com"&gt;[http://www.anastacia.com/infos/view/bio Anastacia bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108043930/http://www.anastacia.com/infos/view/bio |date=January 8, 2012 }} (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The album also spawned another three singles: "[[Sick and Tired (Anastacia song)|Sick and Tired]]", "[[Welcome to My Truth]]", and "[[Heavy on My Heart]]".

In 2005, the multi-platinum compilation project ''[[Pieces of a Dream (album)|Pieces of a Dream]]'' was released which spawned the chart topping duet with [[Eros Ramazzotti]], "[[I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)]]". Her fourth studio album ''[[Heavy Rotation (Anastacia album)|Heavy Rotation]]'' (2008) produced the songs "[[Absolutely Positively]]", "[[Defeated (song)|Defeated]]", and "[[I Can Feel You]]". Her cover album ''[[It's a Man's World (Anastacia album)|It's a Man's World]]'' (2012) was followed by a sixth studio album ''[[Resurrection (Anastacia album)|Resurrection]]'' (2014), which reached the top ten in the European charts. Her ''[[Ultimate Collection (Anastacia album)|Ultimate Collection]]'' was released in 2015 and peaked in the top ten of the UK charts, giving the singer her sixth top ten album in Britain. In 2017, Anastacia released her new studio album ''[[Evolution (Anastacia album)|Evolution]]'' and its lead single "[[Caught in the Middle (Anastacia song)|Caught In The Middle]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/anastacia-is-releasing-her-new-single-caught-in-the-middle-this-week-and-its-one-of-her-trademark-power-anthems__19782/|title=Anastacia is back with a brand new power anthem: Preview|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anastacia has established herself as one of the best selling international female singers of the 2000s and 2010s.

Anastacia was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]]&lt;ref name="Times 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTVCancer"/&gt; when she was thirteen. The incurable bowel disease led to an operation where surgeons cut directly through her stomach muscles removing a foot of the singer's intestines, causing Anastacia to be wheelchair bound and needing to learn how to walk again.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1195924/My-health-issues-easily-killed-says-Anastacia--I-refuse-scarred-life.html|title=My health issues could easily have killed me, says Anastacia... but I refuse to be scarred for life|date=June 29, 2009|work=Daily Mail|first=Hilary|last=Freeman|accessdate=January 2, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her illness she soon became interested in dance.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; At age 19, a diet triggered a Crohn's relapse.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

Despite her ongoing health problems Anastacia continued to pursue her ambitions for the next decade.

She appeared in a two videos for American hip hop trio [[Salt-n-Pepa]] (''Get Up Everybody (Get Up)'' in 1988 and ''Twist and Shout'' in 1989).&lt;ref name="BiographyChannel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anastacia Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/anastacia.html |work=Bio. |publisher=AETN UK |accessdate=August 22, 2013 |quote=The young Anastacia battled against Crohn's disease to develop a career in dance and can be spotted in the early Salt-N-Pepa videos 'Everybody Get Up' and 'Twist and Shout'. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921145708/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/anastacia.html |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, she started her musical career as a backing vocalist. She sang back-up vocals on pop star [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]'s ''[[New Inside]]'' album in 1990. In 1991, she featured in music video ''My Fallen Angel'' of Dominican singer/actor [[Coro (singer)|Coro]]. In 1992 she gained her first break as a solo singer on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[ComicView]]'', singing [[Oleta Adams]]' "Get Here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=AnastaciaMusic|author=Anastacia|number=53749838063472640|date=1 April 2011|title=Wow so true.

That same year the singer recorded a collaboration with [[David Morales]] called "[[Forever Luv]]", again however Anastacia failed to get a record deal. Throughout the mid 90s although producers claimed to be intrigued by her voice's unusual tone, Anastacia would be continuously told that 'her sound just didn't quite fit into any category'. In 1994, she sang back-up vocals on [[Jamie Foxx]] debut album ''[[Peep This]]'', and in 1995 Anastacia sang back-up vocals on [[Paula Abdul]]'s third studio album ''[[Head over Heels (Paula Abdul album)|Head Over Heels]]''. By 1997, Anastacia had become the member of a band called ''The Kraze'' which she remained a part of until 1999. In 1997 she also sung in the background choir for [[Kurt Carr]]'s gospel [[vocal ensemble]] called The Kurt Carr Singers on their album ''No One Else''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anastacia-archive.de/cds/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130909101846/http://www.anastacia-archive.de/cds/|deadurl=yes|title=CD’s - Anastacia-Archive.de|date=September 9, 2013|archivedate=September 9, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had two duet songs with [[Cuba]]n [[composer]] [[Omar Sosa]] in 1998, performing "Mi Negra, Tu Bombón" and "Tienes Un Solo" in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1206780/a/spirit+of+the+roots.htm |title=Omar Sosa – Spirit of the Roots CD Album |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=1999-01-26 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRIfyRL6aTU |title=anastacia tienes un solo |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually in 1998, before turning 30, Anastacia attracted the interest of record labels after making the finals of the short-lived [[MTV]] talent show ''[[The Cut (1998 TV series)|The Cut]]''.&lt;ref name="Times 2005"/&gt; Anastacia signed a contract with [[Daylight Records]], a custom label of [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s [[Epic Records]] in March 1999.

===1998–2001: ''Not That Kind''===
Anastacia met Lisa Braude (who later became her manager) in 1997. She encouraged her to join [[MTV]]'s talent show ''[[The Cut (1998 TV series)|The Cut]]'' in 1998. She made her way to be one of the ten finalists, performing her own composition entitled "[[Not That Kind (song)|Not That Kind]]". Even though she did not win the contest, she had successfully impressed some notable artists, such as [[Elton John]] and [[Michael Jackson]] as well as the show's judges that included [[David Foster]] and [[Faith Evans]]. This afterwards led her to sign with [[Daylight Records|Daylight]], one of [[Epic Records|Epic]]'s labels, by March 1999. Backed up by leading American producer/writers, she released her debut album, ''[[Not That Kind]]'' on June 13, 2000. The album reached the top ten in eight countries in Europe and Asia. It went four times platinum in Europe and triple platinum in Australia;&lt;ref name="Australian Certifications 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2000.htm |title=Australian Certifications 2000 |publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611211848/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2000.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; her debut single "[[I'm Outta Love]]" was a global smash hit in 2000, topping the charts in Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number two in France,&lt;ref name="Anastacia-I'm Outta Love"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl//showitem.asp?interpret=Anastacia&amp;titel=I%27m+Outta+Love&amp;cat=s |title=Anastacia-I'm Outta Love |publisher=Dutch Charts.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328195045/http://dutchcharts.nl//jaaroverzichten.asp?year=2013&amp;cat=s |archivedate=March 28, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland, Italy and Ireland as well as also reaching number six both in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ki.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~topsi/deu2000/deu_aug00.html|title=German Top 20 – The Chart Of August 2000 |publisher=Infinity Charts:}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK.&lt;ref name="UK Top 40 Hit Database"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/searchsec.php |title=UK Top 40 Hit Database |publisher=everyhit.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012195559/http://www.everyhit.com/searchsec.php |archivedate=October 12, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., it was only a minor radio hit. The second single "[[Not That Kind (song)|Not That Kind]]" reached number 11 in the UK&lt;ref name="UK Top 40 Hit Database"/&gt; and became a top 10 hit in Italy.

As the last promotional only single, "[[Made for Lovin' You (Anastacia song)|Made for Lovin' You]]" charted in the UK at number twenty-seven and in France at number seventy-two. While "I'm Outta Love" was a top ten hit on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in the United States, "Not That Kind" did not chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; however by the end of the year Anastacia would go on to be the World's Best Selling New Female Pop Artist at the [[2001 World Music Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRQEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=June 2, 2001|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001–2006: ''Freak of Nature'', ''Anastacia'', breast cancer diagnosis and ''Pieces of a Dream''===
Anastacia's second album ''[[Freak of Nature]]'', released in November 2001, achieved successful sales in the UK where it went triple platinum as well as being a hit throughout continental Europe, however unlike her debut it did not match the same level of international success. The first single released was "[[Paid My Dues]]". The song became an overall hit, in 2001, peaking in Denmark, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland, and reaching the top ten in several other mainland European countries. The second single, released in 2002, "[[One Day in Your Life (Anastacia song)|One Day in Your Life]]", reached number eleven in the UK and the top ten in many European countries. The next single "[[Why'd You Lie to Me]]" reached the top thirty in the UK. "[[You'll Never Be Alone]]", the fourth single, reached number twenty-eight on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart in the U.S. The album was finally released in the United States in May 2002. [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]], who had died in a car wreck the month before, was partly responsible for Anastacia's success, since Lisa hosted MTV's ''The Cut''. Soon after she released a double disc edition featuring two bonus hits, remixes for three of the tracks on the album and two live tracks taken from a Japan gig that was performed on the September 13, 2002.

Anastacia joined [[Celine Dion]], [[Shakira]], [[Cher]], [[Dixie Chicks]], and [[Stevie Nicks]] for ''[[VH1 Divas Live]]'' in 2002 and she also contributed the song "Love Is a Crime" to the ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' soundtrack.&lt;ref name="MTVCancer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Anastacia Diagnosed With Breast Cancer|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459603/anastacia-has-breast-cancer.jhtml|accessdate=August 22, 2013|newspaper=[[MTV]]|date=January 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart and enjoyed moderate airplay on Rhythmic/Dance format. Anastacia was also asked to sing the official song for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in South Korea and Japan and subsequently performed this at the opening ceremony.

In January 2003, Anastacia decided to have her [[breast reduction plasty|breasts reduced]] because of back strain. From a routine [[mammography|mammogram]] for the surgery she discovered she had breast cancer. She immediately started and successfully completed surgery and [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pop singer Anastacia undergoes cancer surgery|url=http://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2003/03/04/pop_singer_anastacia.php|accessdate=August 22, 2013|newspaper=The Badger Herald|date=March 4, 2003|agency=Reuters|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anastacia subsequently established the Anastacia Fund to promote awareness of breast cancer among younger women.&lt;ref name="Times 2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrell|first=Tony|title=The trials of Anastacia|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/article152070.ece|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers|accessdate=August 22, 2013|date=October 23, 2005}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has attributed her health scare as being an inspiration for the sound and content of her third album. According to an interview she gave in 2005 on British music station [[The Box (UK and Ireland)|The Box]], her voice lost its power and she became unable to record, and thus she spent a long time writing and trying to create a sound that she finally became happy with.

[[File:Anastacia concert.jpg|thumb|left|Performing live in 2005]]
As stated on the Australian talk show ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'' in 2004, Anastacia wanted to have more edge to her vocals as she felt there was something missing from her previous works. She brought in many rock instruments which brought a new atmosphere to her music. She also felt that she still needed the funkiness and the pop as the singer felt that too much edge would sound wrong with her voice. Out of this a new sound was formed. She describes her sound as Sprock—a combination of [[soul music|soul]], pop, and rock. She named the album after herself.

Anastacia entered record studios in September 2003 to begin recording her next album, working with [[Glen Ballard]], [[Dallas Austin]], and [[David A. Stewart]] for release in 2004. On the album, Anastacia also collaborated with [[P.O.D.]] lead singer [[Sonny Sandoval]] on the socially conscious track "I Do".

The first single, released in March, was "[[Left Outside Alone]]", which saw a change in direction for Anastacia. It was one of the biggest songs in Europe of 2004, reaching number one in Austria, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland; number two in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway; and number three in the United Kingdom and Hungary. Overall the song remained at number one on the European ''Billboard'' singles chart for 15 weeks.&lt;ref name="anastacia.com"/&gt; The song also topped the Australian charts, Anastacia's second number one in the country, where it went on to become the second-biggest selling single of 2004.

''[[Anastacia (album)|Anastacia]]'' quickly became her most successful album to date, giving her a third consecutive triple platinum album in the UK and reaching the top of the national charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia, Greece, Germany and other countries. Unlike her first two albums, which were released in her homeland of America, ''Anastacia'' was not, despite being scheduled for release on three occasions. "[[Left Outside Alone]]" was released twice, but failed to pick up heavy airplay.&lt;ref name="BiographyChannel"/&gt; It only gained sporadic [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] format airplay. Again, it sparked [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic/Dance]] format airplay and the dance mix of "Left Outside Alone" peaked at number five on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. After the original version of "Left Outside Alone" failed to catch on because of lukewarm promotion, especially on radio, the album was postponed and eventually cancelled after the release date of August 30, 2004 passed. Anastacia released three further internationally successful singles; "[[Sick and Tired (Anastacia song)|Sick and Tired]]" (which gave her another number one in Spain and another UK top five single), "[[Welcome to My Truth]]" (her best-selling hit in Spain), and the ballad "[[Heavy on My Heart]]", sales of which went towards the Anastacia Fund (a charitable organization providing [[research funding]] for breast cancer).

A small batch of [[Anastacia (album)|her self-titled album]] was released with a bonus DVD, poster and slip case. The DVD includes a making-of documentary, footage from her 2002 Europe Promo Tour, and a photo gallery. From September 2004 to August 2005, Anastacia embarked on the [[Live at Last Tour]]. In 2005 the tour was renamed the Encore Tour. The tour would become the second most popular tour of 2004 behind only U2.&lt;ref name="anastacia.com"/&gt;

In late 2005, she released her first greatest hits collection, called ''[[Pieces of a Dream (album)|Pieces of a Dream]]'', named after a track of the same name. The album spawned the hit singles "[[Pieces of a Dream (Anastacia song)|Pieces of a Dream]]", which peaked at number one in Spain, and the duet with [[Eros Ramazzotti]], "[[I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)]]", which was a number 1 hit in Germany, Hungary, Italy and Switzerland and a hit throughout continental Europe. Even though [[Sony BMG]] did force her to release this collection, Anastacia has said that she is happy now that it was created as it was like a "story book", or summary of the first six years of her career. In 2005, she was recognized for worldwide sales of over 20 million.&lt;ref name="JME award"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anastacia, 20 million worldwide sales award |url=http://jmenternational.com/work/awards/2005/anastacia/ |work=JM Enternational |accessdate=August 22, 2013 |date=November 2, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223432/http://jmenternational.com/work/awards/2005/anastacia/ |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the release of "I Belong to You (Il Ritmo Della Passione)", Anastacia released her first live DVD ''[[Live at Last (Anastacia video)|Live at Last]]'' on March 27, 2006 in Europe. The DVD contains footage from concerts in Berlin and [[Munich]]. It includes music videos to her four singles; "[[Left Outside Alone]]", "[[Everything Burns]]", "Pieces of a Dream", and "I Belong to You (Il Ritmo Della Passione)", five alternative videos ("I Do", "Rearview", "Seasons Change", "Underground Army", and "[[Time (Anastacia song)|Time]]") to songs from her self-titled album, and a documentary about the tour. Soon after the DVD release Anastacia took a break from the music industry and began concentrating on her growing fashion line with s. Oliver.

=== 2007–2013: ''Heavy Rotation'', collaborations, ''It's a Man's World'' and second breast cancer ===
[[File:Heavy Rotation 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anastacia performing live in 2009]]

Anastacia attended the memorial [[Concert for Diana]] on July 1, 2007, which would have been on Diana's forty-sixth birthday. This was one of the first major events to take place in the new [[Wembley Stadium]], and one of her first major appearances since she took a break from the industry. She opened the medley section of the show and she sang a rendition of "[[Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Superstar]]", from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', with a [[gospel music|gospel]] chorus behind her.

In August 2007, a video was put on the "Anastacia by S. Oliver" web site. During the video, when Anastacia was asked about her future plans, she confirmed that she was working on a new album as well as the clothing line. A specific month of release or title was not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=August 2007 video on the Anastacia section of the "Anastacia by s oliver" website|url=http://www.anastaciabysoliver.com/|publisher=Anastaciabysoliver.com|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, her biography on the official Anastacia website&lt;ref name=OfficialBio&gt;[http://www.anastacia.com/bio.html Biography page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205025217/http://www.anastacia.com/bio.html |date=December 5, 2007 }} Official Anastacia web site.&lt;/ref&gt; was updated to say there would be a new album in 2008, with a tour to follow. During this time Anastacia began having palpitations which she believed were simple panic attacks; she was soon diagnosed with the heart condition [[supraventricular tachycardia]].&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; It was in this period also that Anastacia left Sony and moved to Mercury. During an interview for the UK breakfast show ''This Morning'', the singer cited that David Massey's move from Sony to Mercury was key to her own label change due to the fact that Massey had originally signed her and had been involved in all of her previous albums.

On July 24, Anastacia announced that her fourth studio album ''[[Heavy Rotation (Anastacia album)|Heavy Rotation]]'' would be released October 27, 2008 in Europe and Asia (and elsewhere in 2009). The new album featured collaborations with producers [[Ne-Yo]], The Heavyweights, [[Lester Mendez]], [[J.R. Rotem]], and [[Rodney Jerkins]] and was a noted departure from the pop rock sound of her previous material. The album's first single, called "[[I Can Feel You]]", began playing in some radio markets on August 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="MTVAsia0808"&gt;[http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200808/21016468.html Anastacia Is Back With Fourth Studio Album 'Heavy Rotation'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319021444/http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200808/21016468.html |date=March 19, 2009 }}. (August 21, 2008) MTV Asia. Retrieved August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The second single from ''Heavy Rotation'' was "[[Absolutely Positively]]", later served as a promotional single only. The third official single from the album, "Defeated", was released as a promotional single in Europe without a music video.

Her fourth studio album proved to be less successful than her previous ones; her singles failed to reach the top 40 in her most commercially successful country (UK). Anastacia however remained positive, stating that other artists have faced the same problems while changing a record label, also blaming the world [[Great Recession|economical crisis]] and the label's decision to alter her sound from her own chosen sprock sound of her previous record to a more "urban feel". In later years Anastacia would publicly admit regret towards the change of sound, citing personal problems that led to a creative [[Selling out|sell-out]]. Regardless of the lack of commercial success, the album was ranked number ten on ''Billboard'' magazine's online "Readers' Poll: 10 Best Albums of 2008".

In 2009, the Women's World Award presented Anastacia with the World Artist Award, recognizing the singer's success and ongoing positive influence in pop music.

In June 2009, Anastacia began her second tour throughout Europe to promote her fourth studio album. The tour was funded by the singer herself, not her label, and was well received by critics and fans alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|title=Pop review: Anastacia, Hammersmith Apollo, London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/27/anastacia-hammersmith-apollo-review|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=August 22, 2013|date=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November and December 2009 Anastacia, [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] were headlining the ''[[Here Come the Girls (concert tour)|Here Come the Girls]]'' a special Christmas concert that visited the United Kingdom only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa|last=Sewards |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1215917/Its-diva-fever-Lulus-hit-Shout--you-tour-Chaka-Khan-Anastacia.html |title=It's diva fever!

'''Andrew Philip Kehoe''' (February 1, 1872 – May 18, 1927) was an [[Americans|American]] farmer and treasurer of his township [[school board]], notable as a [[mass murderer]] for killing his wife and 43 other people (including 38 children), and injuring 58 people by setting off bombs in the [[Bath School disaster]] on May 18, 1927. He committed [[suicide]] near the school by detonating [[dynamite]] in his truck, causing an explosion which killed several other people and wounded more. He had earlier set off [[incendiary device]]s in his house and farm, destroying all the buildings, as well as killing two horses and other animals.

== Early life and education==
Kehoe was born in [[Tecumseh, Michigan]], among the younger of a family of 13 children. His parents were Philip Kehoe (1833–1915) and Mary (McGovern) Kehoe (1835–1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daggy|first1=J.L.|title=The Bath School Disaster: Andrew Philip Kehoe - Farmer, School Board Treasurer, Bomber|url=http://daggy.name/tbsd/bsdlrp13.htm|website=Daggy.Com|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Tecumseh High School (Michigan)|Tecumseh High School]] and Michigan State College (later [[Michigan State University]]), where he studied [[electrical engineering]]. There, he first met his future wife, Ellen "Nellie" Price, the daughter of a wealthy [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] family.&lt;ref name="Parker1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Parker|title=Mayday: History of a Village Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osbhAAAAMAAJ|page = 27| accessdate=December 17, 2012|year=1980|publisher=Parker Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Kehoe went south west, apparently working for several years as an electrician in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. During this period, in 1911, he suffered a severe head injury in a fall&lt;ref name="Mayo2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Mayo|title=American Murder: Criminals, Crime, and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEoU2kOb0OIC&amp;pg=PA175| page=175|accessdate=December 17, 2012|date=February 1, 2008|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in his being in a coma for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Arnie Bernstein|url=https://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472116065_qa.pdf|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|accessdate=August 4, 2017|date=2009|quote=...an accident that put him in a coma for two weeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kehoe then moved back in with his father after the injury. He had been away from the family home for several years.  During that time and after his mother's death his father married Frances Wilder.  On September 17, 1911, Frances was severely burned when the family's stove exploded as she was attempting to light it.  The fuel soaked her, with her body catching fire.  Kehoe threw water from a nearby bucket on her; due to the oil-based nature of the fire, the water did nothing to put the flames out.  Frances later died from her injuries with allegations being made that the stove had been tampered with.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnie Bernstein|year=2009|title=Bath Massacre: America's First School Bombing|chapter = Chapter Two - Andrew P.

He does mention the rumors that the stove was tampered with.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth1927_3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monty J.

==Marriage and family==
After his return to Michigan, in 1912 he married Nellie Price.  In 1919 the couple bought a {{convert|185|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm outside the village of [[Bath Township, Michigan|Bath]]&lt;ref name="ellsworth ch 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daggy.name/tbsd/tbsd-t.htm#ChapterOne|title=Chapter One—The Bath Consolidated School|work= The Bath School Disaster|author=Ellsworth, Monty J.|year=1927|publisher=Bath School Museum Committee (1991 ed.)|format=online version|oclc=6743232|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayday p 27"&gt;{{cite book|author=Parker, Grant|year=1992|title=Mayday, History of a Village Holocaust|page=27|publisher=Liberty Press|isbn=0-9604958-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Nellie's aunt for $12,000. He paid $6,000 in cash and took out a $6,000 [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]].&lt;ref name="Parker1980"/&gt;

== Personality ==
Kehoe was regarded by his neighbors as a highly intelligent man who grew impatient and angry with those who disagreed with him. Neighbors recalled that Kehoe was always neat, dressed meticulously, and was known to change his shirt at midday or whenever it became even slightly dirty. Neighbors also recounted how Kehoe was cruel to his farm animals, having once beaten a horse to death.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth1927_3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monty J. Ellsworth|title=The Bath School Disaster|chapter = Chapter Three — Life of Andrew Kehoe|url=http://daggy.name/tbsd/tbsd-t.htm#ChapterThree|accessdate=December 17, 2012|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kehoes initially attended services at the [[Catholic]] church in Bath, but he refused to pay the church's parish assessment of members and prevented his wife from attending.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth1927_3"/&gt;

Kehoe's neighbors thought he preferred mechanical tinkering to farming. His neighbor M. J. "Monty" Ellsworth wrote in his account of the disaster,

{{quote|He never farmed it as other farmers do and he tried to do everything with his tractor. He was in the height of his glory when fixing machinery or tinkering. He was always trying new methods in his work, for instance, hitching two mowers behind his tractor. This method did not work at different times and he would just leave the hay standing. He also put four sections of drag and two rollers at once behind his tractor. He spent so much time tinkering that he didn't prosper.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth1927_3"/&gt;}}

== Bath Consolidated School administration ==
With a reputation for thrift, Kehoe was elected [[treasurer]] of the Bath Consolidated School board in 1924. While on the board, Kehoe fought for lower taxes and was often at cross purposes with other board members, voting against them and calling for adjournment when he did not get his way. He repeatedly accused superintendent Emory Huyck of financial mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth1927_3"/&gt;

While on the school board, Kehoe was appointed as the Bath Township Clerk in 1925 for a short period. In the spring 1926 election, he was defeated for the position, and was angered by his public defeat. His neighbor Ellsworth thought Kehoe started planning his "murderous revenge" against the community at that time. Another neighbor, A. McMullen, noticed that Kehoe stopped working altogether on his farm in his last year, and thought he might be planning [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="Ellsworth1927_3"/&gt;

During these years, Nellie Kehoe was chronically ill with [[tuberculosis]], and had frequent hospital stays - at the time there was no effective treatment or cure for the disease. By the time of the Bath School disaster, Kehoe had ceased making mortgage and [[homeowner's insurance]] payments. The mortgage lender had begun [[foreclosure]] proceedings against the farm.&lt;ref name="Ellsworth1927_3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamiter"&gt;{{cite web|title=School Dynamiter First Slew Wife|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bauerle/nyt520.txt|publisher=New York Times (via Bauerle FreePages @ RootsWeb.com)|accessdate=January 15, 2013|date=May 20, 1927|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018142228/http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bauerle/nyt520.txt|archive-date=2014-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ellsworth ch 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daggy.name/tbsd/tbsd-t.htm#ChapterThree|title=Chapter Three—Life of Andrew Kehoe|work= The Bath School Disaster|author=Ellsworth, Monty J.|year=1927|publisher=Bath School Museum Committee (1991 ed.)|format=online version}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bath School disaster ==
{{Main|Bath School disaster}}

The Bath School disaster is the name given to a series of explosions perpetrated by Kehoe on May 18, 1927, in Bath Township, Michigan, which killed 45 people ([[murder-suicide|including Kehoe himself]]) and injured at least 58. Most of the victims were children in the second to sixth grades (7–12 years of age) attending the Bath Consolidated School. Their deaths constitute the deadliest act of [[mass murder]] in a school in U.S. history.

Between May 16, when he returned home from a hospital stay, and the morning of May 18, Kehoe killed his wife. He moved her body to a farm building before setting off incendiary explosions in their house and farm buildings. About the same time, he had arranged timed explosions in the new school building. The materials in the north wing exploded as planned, killing many students and some adults inside. Kehoe had set a timed detonator to ignite [[dynamite]] and hundreds of pounds of [[pyrotol]] at the school, which he had secretly bought and planted in the basement of both wings over the course of many months. The second {{convert|500|lb}} of explosives in the south wing did not detonate, so that part of the school was not destroyed.

As rescuers started gathering at the school, Kehoe drove up and stopped his truck.  During a struggle with Superintendent Huyck, Kehoe detonated dynamite stored inside his [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]]-filled truck, killing himself and Huyck, as well as killing and injuring several others (among them a boy who had survived the initial bombing).&lt;ref name = "Burcar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burcar|first=Colleen|title=It Happened in Michigan: Remarkable Events That Shaped History|year=2011|publisher=Globe Pequot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xcjTa3sRisC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the rescue efforts, searchers discovered the additional {{convert|500|lb}} of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol planted throughout the basement of the school's south wing. These explosives, connected to an alarm clock that was supposed to act as the detonator, had been set for the same time as the other explosion.

After the bombings, investigators found a wooden sign wired to the farm's fence with Kehoe's last message, "Criminals are made, not born", stenciled on it.&lt;ref name="dynamiter"/&gt; When investigators were done taking an inventory of the Kehoes' estate, they estimated that, prior to its destruction, sale of the unused equipment and materials on the farm would have yielded enough money to pay off the Kehoes' mortgage.

'''Anthony Edward Sowell''' (born August 19, 1959) is an American [[serial killer]] known as the '''Cleveland Strangler'''. He was arrested in October 2009 after the bodies of eleven women were discovered by police investigators at his [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[duplex (building)|duplex]] at 12205 Imperial Avenue in Mount Pleasant neighborhood.&lt;ref name="bodies"&gt;{{cite news| work=BBC News | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8335859.stm|title=Six bodies at US rapist's house |date=October 31, 2009  | accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Anthony Edward Sowell was raised in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]], one of seven children born to [[single parent|single mother]] Claudia "Gertude" Garrison. Seven other children belonging to Sowell's sister also lived in the household, having moved in after the death of their chronically ill mother. According to Sowell's [[niece]], Garrison subjected the siblings to [[physical abuse]] while her own children watched from adjacent rooms. In one incident, Garrison forced her to strip naked in front of the other children, then whipped her with electrical cords until she bled. Sowell himself began raping his niece on an almost daily basis for two years, starting when she was eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/08/serial_killer_anthony_sowell_began_raping_niece_when_both_were_children_witness_testifies.html Serial killer Anthony Sowell began raping niece when both were children, witness testifies], Cleveland ''Plain-Dealer'', 2 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
At the age of 18, Sowell entered the [[United States Marine Corps]] on January 24, 1978. He attended recruit training at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]] in [[South Carolina]], then was further trained as an [[electrician]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]] in [[North Carolina]]. On July 13, 1978, he was assigned to the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]], also in North Carolina. In 1980, Sowell spent a year overseas with the [[3rd Marine Logistics Group|3rd Force Service Support Group]], then returned to Cherry Point. He was then ordered to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Butler]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] on January 20, 1984. A year later, he transferred to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] in [[California]] for three days until his discharge on January 18, 1985. During his seven-year Marine Corps career, Corporal Sowell received a [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Good Conduct Medal]] with one [[service star]], a [[Sea Service Ribbon|Sea Service Deployment Ribbon]], a Certificate of Commendation, a [[Mast (naval)|Meritorious Mast]], and two Letters of Appreciation.&lt;ref name="marine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enctoday.com/news/serial-6305-havelock-killer-sowell.html |title=Marine Corps says accused serial killer stationed twice at Cherry Point and once at Camp Lejeune |work=[[Havelock, North Carolina|Havelock]] News |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109105933/http://www.enctoday.com/news/serial-6305-havelock-killer-sowell.html |archivedate=November  9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1989 attack, incarceration, and release ==
In 1989, Melvette Sockwell, who was three months pregnant, went to Sowell's home voluntarily. When she tried to leave, he bound her hands and feet with a tie and belt, then gagged her with a rag. The victim told police: "He choked me real hard because my body started tingling. I thought I was going to die."&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt;  Sowell was charged with kidnapping, rape and attempted rape. He eventually pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted rape, and as a result he served 15 years in prison. He was released in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/11/anthony_sowell_was_considered.html|title=Anthony Sowell was considered unlikely to attack again in 2005 evaluation|date=2009-11-05|work=CBS News|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell worked in a factory until 2007 when he began collecting unemployment benefits.&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt;  Neighbors said he earned a living selling scrap metal.&lt;ref name="bodies"/&gt;  They complained to the health department of a foul smell in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt; He was a member of an online dating service, where he stated that he was a "master" looking for a submissive person to "train".&lt;ref name="evenMoreBodies"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/02/crimesider/entry5495923.shtml|title=Anthony Sowell Cruised Sex Fetish Site While Dead Bodies Rotted in His Cleveland Home|date=November 4, 2009|work=CBS News|accessdate=November 4, 2009 | first=Edecio | last=Martinez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lori Frazier, a niece of Cleveland Mayor [[Frank G. Jackson]], began a relationship with Sowell shortly after his release from prison and resided in his home. She claims to have smelled the stench of decaying bodies and that she was told the smell was coming from Sowell's stepmother. When she moved out, she claimed that the smell was from Ray's Sausage Shop, located next door to the Sowell residence. There is some confusion about when Frazier stopped living in Sowell's home. In a video interview she mentions moving out in 2007, but in a published article she is said to have been living there until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/11/crimesider/entry5616478.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Mayor's Niece Lived With Alleged "Cleveland Strangler" Anthony Sowell and Rotting Bodies | first=Ryan | last=Smith | date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another article quotes a friend of Frazier's stating that Frazier stopped spending time at Sowell's home in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Phillip.

==Discovery of bodies and arrest==
In September 2009,&lt;ref name="marine"/&gt; Sowell invited Latundra Billups to his home for a drink.  On September 22, 2009, she reported to police that after a few drinks, he became angry, hit her, choked her and raped her as she passed out. On October 29, police arrived at his home with a warrant to arrest him for the alleged rape.  He was not there, but he was located and arrested two days later.&lt;ref name="marine"/&gt;

The bodies of two women were buried in a shallow grave in the basement and four other women were found on the 3rd floor of the home, in crawl spaces in the house.&lt;ref name="moreBodies"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/11/crews_again_digging_at_anthony.html | title=Police discover 10 victims at Anthony Sowell's home | date=November 3, 2009 | work=Cleveland Metro | accessdate=November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After digging in the backyard, investigators found three more bodies and the remains of a fourth. Police also found a human skull in a bucket inside the house, which brought the body count to eleven. Most of the victims were killed by manual strangulation and others were gagged or had ligatures on their bodies when they were discovered.&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt; Sowell also had at least three more rape victims that he had actually let live. All three never reported the attacks, due to their prior drug history or other personal reasons. Many victims were led to his property with an invitation to smoke [[crack cocaine]] with him. He was a known drug user throughout his neighborhood.

At the time of his arrest, Sowell was 50 years old. He had been living at that location for four years.&lt;ref name="skull"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6903700.ece | date = November 5, 2009 | title = Skull in a basket as police search Anthony Sowell's home for more bodies | work = The Times | accessdate = November 5, 2009 | location=London | first=James | last=Boneand}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was held on $5 million bond.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt; His trial was originally supposed to start on June 2, 2010&lt;ref name="Anthony Sowell accused of killing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/05/anthony_sowell_accused_of_kill.html|title=Anthony Sowell accused of killing}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was repeatedly delayed: first to September 7 to allow Sowell's attorneys more time to prepare,&lt;ref name="Anthony Sowell accused of killing"/&gt; then to February 14, 2011,&lt;ref name="Trial for serial killing suspended"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/01/trial_for_serial-killing_suspe.html|title=Trial for serial killing suspended}}&lt;/ref&gt; then to May 2 at the request of Sowell's defense attorneys who needed more time to comb through thousands of records and hours of surveillance video footage shot from the property next door to Sowell's Imperial Avenue home, where the remains of 11 women were discovered in 2009,&lt;ref name="Trial for serial killing suspended"/&gt; and later to June 6 at the request of the prosecution due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name="Trial for serial killing suspended"/&gt; The trial eventually began on June 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Crow |last= Chuck | work=The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/06/pleasant_conversations_with_anthony_sowell_turned_violent_without_warning_three_women_testify.html |title=Pleasant conversations with Anthony Sowell turned violent without warning, 3 women testify |publisher= cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Leila | last=Atassi |url= http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/suspected_serial-killer_anthony_sowell_told_police_he_punished_drug_addicted_women_interrogation_vid.html|title=Suspected serial killer Anthony Sowell told police he 'punished' drug-addicted women, interrogation video reveals |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Leila | last=Atassi |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell_hinted_at_yet_undiscovered_horrors_police_sergeant_testifies.html |title=Anthony Sowell hinted at yet undiscovered horrors, police sergeant testifies |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott | last= Shaw |work= The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell_trial_surviving_family_members_of_imperial_avenue_killings_recount_their_anguish.html |title=Anthony Sowell trial: Surviving family members of Imperial Avenue killings recount their anguish |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Michael | last= Scott | work= The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/more_grotesque_detail_expected_in_third_week_of_anthony_sowell_capital_murder_trial.html |title=More 'grotesque' detail expected in third week of Anthony Sowell capital murder trial |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott | last= Shaw |work= The Plain Dealer |url= http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell_admitted_to_stashing_bodies_in_imperial_avenue_home_neighbor_testifies.html |title=Anthony Sowell admitted to stashing bodies in Imperial Avenue home, neighbor testifies |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott | last= Shaw |work= The Plain Dealer |url= http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/nurse_takes_stand_in_anthony_sowell_serial_murder_trial_describes_taking_dna_evidence.html |title=Nurse takes stand in Anthony Sowell serial murder trial, describes taking DNA evidence |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/news/crime/bodies_found/day-16-anthony-sowell-trial |title=Day 16: Anthony Sowell trial |publisher=Newsnet5.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143044/http://www.newsnet5.com/news/crime/bodies_found/day-16-anthony-sowell-trial |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Marvin |last= Fong |work= The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/judge_acquits_serial-killings_defendant_anthony_sowell_on_2_of_85_counts_state_rests_its_case.html |title=Judge acquits serial-killings defendant Anthony Sowell on 2 of 85 counts, state rests its case |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Michael | last= Scott |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell.html |title=Week one of Anthony Sowell trial hard on victims' families: video interview with PD's Stan Donaldson |publisher=cleveland.com |work= The Plain Dealer| date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction, sentencing, and appeals==
Sowell was charged with eleven counts of [[aggravated murder]] and 74 counts of [[rape]], [[kidnapping]], [[tampering with evidence]], and [[abuse of a corpse]]. He pleaded [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] but later changed his plea to simply "not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=CNN |  url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,571519,00.html | title='House of horrors' suspect due in court | date=March 24, 2010 | accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 22, 2011, he was convicted on all but two counts against him, including the murders of the eleven women whose bodies were found in his house in 2009. On August 10, jurors recommended the [[death penalty]] for Sowell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Scott | first = Michael | title =Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell's sentence: jury recommends death |work = The Plain Dealer | publisher = cleveland.com | date = 10 August 2011 | url = http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/08/cleveland_serial_killer_anthony_sowells_sentence.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 12, Judge [[Dick Ambrose]] upheld the jury's recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Anthony Sowell to die for murders of 11 women; judge accepts jury's advice |work = cleveland.com | publisher = | date = 12 August 2011 | url = http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/2011/08/cleveland_judge_sowell.html |accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 14, 2011, Sowell has resided on death row at [[Chillicothe Correctional Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Offender Search Detail |publisher=Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction |url=https://appgateway.drc.ohio.gov/OffenderSearch/Search/Details/A604609?Enc=%7Csowell%7Canthony%7C%7C%7C%7CAll%7C%7CName%7C1%7C10%7C |accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Sowell's lawyers, Jeffry F. Kelleher and Thomas Rein, filed a Notice of Appeal with the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]].  Sowell's execution was set for October 29, 2012, but in March 2012, a Motion for Stay of Execution was filed; the motion was granted in April, pending final disposition of the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case No. 2011-1921 Entry |publisher=Supreme Court of Ohio |date=April 2, 2012|url=http://supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=191130.pdf |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, Sowell's new lawyers, Jeffrey M. Gamso and Erika Cunliffe of the Cuyahoga County Public Defender's office, appealed to have his conviction and death sentence overturned on 21 points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=APPELLANT'S REPLY BRIEF AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR |publisher=Supreme Court of Ohio |date=April 25, 2013 |url=http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=726248.pdf |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the main three being:

*that Sowell did not receive a fair trial because of the extensive media coverage. The "media attention was overwhelming, generating thousands of news stories, and…local coverage was 'both frenzied and sustained.'"&lt;ref name=Krouse2013&gt;{{cite web |title =Anthony Sowell's attorneys dispute prosecutors' claims that serial killer got fair trial |work=Northeast Ohio Media Group  |publisher=cleveland.com |date = April 26, 2013 |author=Peter Krouse |url = http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/04/anthony_sowells_attorneys_refu.html |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*that the courtroom had been closed to the public "during an evidentiary hearing and while a jury was picked"&lt;ref name=Dissell&gt;{{cite web |title=Ohio Supreme Court asks whether Anthony Sowell's right to a public trial was violated, attorneys respond |work=The Plain Dealer |publisher=cleveland.com |date=October 3, 2014 |author=Rachel Dissell |url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/10/ohio_supreme_court_asks_whethe.html#incart_river_index |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and that he had received "lousy legal representation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Serial killer Anthony Sowell was given a fair trial, Cuyahoga County prosecutors claim in court filing |work=Northeast Ohio Media Group  |publisher=cleveland.com |date=March 12, 2013 |author=Peter Krouse |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/03/serial_killer_anthony_sowell_was_given.html |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sowell's trial attorneys should have had their client plead guilty to killing the women and then focus their efforts on preventing Sowell from getting the death penalty."&lt;ref name=Krouse2013 /&gt;

In September 2014, the court asked both parties to address three issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case No. 2011-1921 Entry |publisher=Supreme Court of Ohio |date=September 3, 2014 |url=http://supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=199920.pdf |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On April 5, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments from Sowell's appellant attorneys and the Cuyahoga County D.A. representing the State of Ohio regarding the merits of the closed pre-trial Suppression Hearing prior to Sowell's trial, and the defendant's right to a fair and public trial. The attorneys representing Sowell argued that Sowell's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right was violated by closing the Suppression Hearing to the press, and that the Court should commute his Death Sentence to Life-In-Prison as a remedy to the structural error that resulted in the violation. They also argued that counsel had made errors, and "urged the Ohio Supreme Court to send the case back to Cuyahoga County for a retrial. 'Frankly we blew it,' attorney Jeffrey Gamso told the Ohio Supreme Court."&lt;ref name=Borchardt&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthony Sowell's lawyer asks Ohio Supreme Court to save his life |publisher=cleveland.com |date=April 5, 2016 |author=Jackie Borchardt |url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/04/anthony_sowell.html |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State argued that if Sowell's Sixth Amendment right was violated via the closed pre-trial Suppression Hearing it would not have affected the outcome of the trial, as the evidence was overwhelming, and that "Sowell's attorneys were the ones who asked multiple times in his presence for the jury selection to be done privately, without cameras in the courtroom."&lt;ref name=Dissell /&gt; The State also asserted that Sowell has never denied his guilt, and that the heinous nature of his crimes—coupled with little mitigating evidence to deny imposing the death penalty—warrants affirming the death sentence.&lt;ref name=Borchardt /&gt; 

On December 8, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Anthony Sowell, affirming his aggravated murder convictions and death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/12/ohio_supreme_court_upholds_con.html|title=Ohio Supreme Court upholds convictions of mass murderer Anthony Sowell|work=cleveland.com|date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Sowell appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/05/anthony_sowell_appeals_case_to.html|title=Anthony Sowell appeals case to U.S. Supreme Court|work=cleveland.com|date=May 25, 2017|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthony-sowell-notorious-cleveland-serial-killer-appeals-case-to-supreme-court/|title=Anthony Sowell, notorious Cleveland serial killer, appeals case to Supreme Court|work=CBS NEWS|date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court said that it would not review Sowell's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2017/10/us_supreme_court_will_not_hear.html|title=U.S. Supreme Court will not hear Cleveland mass murderer Anthony Sowell's appeal|work=cleveland.com|date=October 2, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court denied a request by Sowell to reopen his appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/02/ohio_supreme_court_wont_reopen.html|title=Ohio Supreme Court won't reopen Anthony Sowell appeal|work=cleveland.com|date=February 14, 2018|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
On November 5, 2009, two of the eleven victims were identified. The first to be identified was Tonia Carmichael, a 53-year-old [[African American]] woman who had disappeared more than a year earlier. Her body was found buried in his backyard. She appeared to have been strangled and was identified through the use of DNA evidence. Her mother had reported her missing in December 2008.&lt;ref name="firstID"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2009/11/05/2009-11-05_police_id_first_of_11_victims_found_decomposing_in_anthony_sowells_cleveland_hom.html | title = Police ID first of 11 victims found decomposing in Anthony Sowell's Ohio home as Tonia Carmichael | date=November 5, 2009 | work=New York Daily News | accessdate=November 5, 2009 | first=Brian | last=Kates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second victim was identified as Telacia Fortson, a 31-year-old African American woman who had disappeared five months earlier. Although she had been missing since June, her mother did not report her missing until she heard the news coverage regarding the dead bodies discovered in Sowell's home.&lt;ref name="2ndVic"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.woio.com/Global/story.asp?S=11452010 | title = 2nd Victim: Cuyahoga County Coroner ID's Second Imperial Body | work = [[WIOO]] Action News | date = 5 November 2009 | accessdate = 2009-11-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091108134441/http://www.woio.com/Global/story.asp?S=11452010# | archive-date = 2009-11-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2009, three more bodies were identified.  Crystal Dozier was a 38-year-old African American woman who went missing in May 2007. Dozier, the mother of seven children, lived in the area where her body was discovered. Her family reported her missing to the Cleveland Police Department. This was not the first time she had gone missing, and the family accused the police of failing to investigate. The family took it upon themselves to post fliers and call hospitals.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Baird | first = Gabriel | title = Names put to three more victims in Anthony Sowell case | newspaper = The Plain Dealer | location = Cleveland, Ohio | publisher = Cleveland Live | date = 8 November 2009 | url = http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/11/names_put_to_three_more_victim.html  | accessdate = 2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amelda "Amy" Hunter was a 47-year-old African American woman. Hunter, a beautician and a mother of three, did not live in the area where her body was found, but she did visit frequently. A previous injury left her unable to use one of her arms. Her family did not report her missing until after police began removing bodies from Sowell's house.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt;

Michelle Mason was a 45-year-old African American woman who was last seen in October 2008. She lived in the area where her body was found. According to records, the police conducted a full investigation when her family reported her missing.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt;

Records of missing persons going back to Sowell's June 2005 release from prison were searched and [[DNA testing]] was conducted on the bodies found at Sowell's house. Protesters holding posters of missing loved ones gathered outside his home at the time.&lt;ref name="bodies"/&gt;

[[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]] police also reopened several [[cold case (criminology)|cold case]]s from the late 1980s.  The murders by strangulation used a similar [[modus operandi]] and had stopped around 1989, the same time that Sowell was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/news_article.aspx?storyid=124851&amp;catid=45 "East Cleveland: Did suspected serial killer also strike in 1989?"], [[WKYC]]-TV, 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI]] at the time was gathering information to see if Sowell may have been linked to unsolved cases in cities where he once lived.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2009/11/09/2009-11-09_anthony_sowell_murder_case_goes_worldwide.html#ixzz0ctHtIHZ5 | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Anthony Sowell rape and murder case goes international | first=Soraya | last=Roberts | date=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her paternal grandmother immigrated to Israel from [[Iraq]] as a single mother in the 1950s as part of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], carefully investing her money in property and the education of her children.&lt;ref name="השקד פורחת"&gt;[http://atmag.co.il/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%95%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%99/%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A7%D7%93-%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%AA השקד פורחת]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father was an accountant and voted [[Likud]].&lt;ref name=jtaWho&gt;Julie Wiener, [http://www.jta.org/2015/05/07/news-opinion/the-telegraph/who-is-ayelet-shaked-israels-new-justice-minister Who is Ayelet Shaked, Israel's new justice minister?], Jewish Telegraphic Agency, May 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JRudorenNYTimes05152015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Zeveloff, [http://forward.com/news/israel/213348/can-ayelet-shaked-sell-secular-israel-on-the-far-r/ Can Ayelet Shaked Sell (Secular) Israel on the Far Right?], ''The Forward'', 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaked describes herself as 'half-Iraqi and proud of it'.&lt;ref name="השקד פורחת"/&gt; Her mother, a Bible teacher, was from a center-left [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] family whose ancestors migrated to Palestine from the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Romania]] in the 1880s as part of the [[First Aliyah]].

She grew up in the upper middle class [[Bavli]] neighbourhood of Tel Aviv. She identified her political awakening and right-wing orientation to when she was 8 years old, after watching a television debate between [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and [[Shimon Peres]], where she supported the right-wing views of Shamir.&lt;ref name="JRudorenNYTimes05152015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 January 2013 |url=http://www.star10.co.il/print?c0=20601 |script-title=he:ראיון אישי עם איילת שקד: משהו חדש מתחיל בפוליטיקה הישראלית. |language=he |trans-title= Interview with Ayelet Shaked: something new begins in Israeli politics. |publisher=North Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a teenager, she was a main instructor in the [[Hebrew Scouts Movement in Israel]].

She served in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] as an infantry instructor in the [[Golani Brigade]],&lt;ref name="JRudorenNYTimes05152015"/&gt; serving in the 12th ''Barak'' (''Lightning'') battalion and [[Israeli Special Forces Units#Infantry Corps|Sayaret Golani]] (the special forces unit within the Golani Brigade).&lt;ref name="nrg.co.il"/&gt; It was while she was in the army, that her right-wing views were strengthened.&lt;ref name="nrg.co.il"/&gt; At [[Tel Aviv University]], she obtained a [[BSc]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]]. She began her career in the Tel Aviv high-tech industry,&lt;ref name="Talks with a Tel Aviv Settler"/&gt; working as a [[software engineer]] at [[Texas Instruments]] and later becoming manager of the company's marketing.

From the end of 2011, she campaigned against [[illegal immigration from Africa to Israel]], saying that it poses a threat to the state and also involves severe economic damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ayelet Shaked |date=16 November 2011 |url=http://www.mako.co.il/video-blogs-ayelet-shaked/Article-3eef040728ca331006.htm |title=בקרוב: מאה אלף מסתננים בישראל] |language=he |trans-title=Soon: a hundred thousand infiltrators in Israel |publisher=Mako}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also campaigned against [[Galei Tzahal]] saying it had a "left leaning agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/an_interview_with_ayelet_shaked_20120815|title=An interview with Ayelet Shaked - Israel|work=Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 Shaked was elected to serve as a member of the [[Likud]]'s Central Committee; however, in June 2012 she resigned and joined the Jewish Home. On 14 November 2012 she won third place in the party's primaries, and was placed in the fifth spot on the Jewish Home list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]]. With the list winning 12 seats, Shaked became the only secular Jewish Home MK.

She also chaired the Knesset committee for the Enforcement of the Security Service Law and the National-Civilian Service Law and the Special Committee for the Equal Sharing of the Burden Bill.

In June 2014, Shaked posted an article by the late Israeli writer [[Uri Elitzur]] on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="Exposing militant leftist propaganda"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Exposing-militant-leftist-propaganda-363062 |title=Exposing militant leftist propaganda |last=Shaked |first=Ayelet |date=16 July 2014 |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel's new justice minister considers all Palestinians to be 'the enemy'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who is Ayelet Shaked, Israel's new justice minister?"/&gt;&lt;ref name=foreignPolicy/&gt; The Facebook post was variously described in the media as calling Palestinian children "little snakes" and appearing to justify mass punishment of Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Israel's new justice minister considers all Palestinians to be 'the enemy'"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tharoor|first1=Ishaan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/07/israels-new-justice-minister-considers-all-palestinians-to-be-the-enemy/ |title=Israel's new justice minister considers all Palestinians to be 'the enemy' |work=The Washington Post|date=7 May 2014 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who is Ayelet Shaked, Israel's new justice minister?"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiener|first1=Julie|title=Who is Ayelet Shaked, Israel's new justice minister?|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/05/07/news-opinion/the-telegraph/who-is-ayelet-shaked-israels-new-justice-minister|publisher=Jewish Telegraph Agency|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foreignPolicy&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Grady|first1=Siobhan|title=The New Face of Israel's Hard Right|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/07/the-new-face-of-israel-hard-right-netanyahu-ayelet-shaked/ |work=Foreign Policy |date=7 May 2014 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailysabah"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2014/07/14/mothers-of-all-palestinians-should-also-be-killed-says-israeli-politician|title='Mothers of all Palestinians should also be killed,' says Israeli politician|work= |location= |newspaper=[[Daily Sabah]] |date=14 July 2014|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hillel|first=Mira Bar|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/why-im-on-the-brink-of-burning-my-israeli-passport-9600165.html|title=Why I'm on the brink of burning my Israeli passport|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=11 July 2014|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the Facebook post, the then Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] said that Shaked's mindset was no different from Adolf Hitler's.&lt;ref name=foreignPolicy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.605255|title=Israeli Politician Declares 'War' on 'the Palestinian People'|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Erdoğan’s comments, stating "Erdogan's anti-Semitic comments profaned the memory of the Holocaust."

She said, "I refer specifically to 'Daily Beast' writer Gideon Resnick, who so misrepresented the facts in one of my recent Facebook posts, one has to wonder if his hatred for my country hasn’t rendered him outright useless to his website and his readers."&lt;ref name="Exposing militant leftist propaganda"/&gt;

In 2015, Shaked won the primary election for the Jewish Home Party, which was considered an achievement as a secular female politician within a religious party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/shaked-top-vote-getter-in-jewish-home-primaries Shaked is top vote-getter in Jewish Home primaries] ''The Times of Israel'', 15 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaked was placed third on the Jewish Home list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bechirot20.gov.il/election/Candidates/Pages/OneListCandidates.aspx?LPF=Search&amp;WebId=6adadc15-e476-480b-9746-04490aedeb0f&amp;ListID=ba72a662-765c-45af-9d48-fb68080956af&amp;ItemID=57&amp;FieldID=ListNickname_GxS_Text The Jewish Home] CEC&lt;/ref&gt; and was re-elected to the Knesset. On 6 May 2015, it was reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to appoint Shaked as Minister of Justice as part of a plan to form a new coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Azulay |first=Moran |date=6 May 2015 |title=Netanyahu gives Bayit Yehudi's Shaked the Justice Ministry, but with limited powers |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4654283,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |location=[[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] |access-date=6 May 2015|quote=Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed Wednesday to appoint Bayit Yehudi MK Ayelet Shaked as justice minister, but insisted that her powers be curtailed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesIsrael05062015"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=6 May 2015 |title=In the 11th hour, Netanyahu finalizes 61-strong coalition |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-the-11th-hour-netanyahu-finalizes-61-strong-coalition/ |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |location=[[Jerusalem]] |access-date=6 May 2015|quote=Prime minister reaches deal with Jewish home's Bennett, finalizing a right-wing government; two men set to deliver a statement; Ayelet Shaked will be named justice minister.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heller |first=Jeffrey |date=6 May 2015 |title=Netanyahu clinches deal to form new Israeli government |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/06/us-israel-politics-idUSKBN0NR29R20150506 |publisher=Reuters |location=London |access-date=6 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaked took office as Justice Minister on 14 May 2015.&lt;ref name="JRudorenNYTimes05152015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rudoren |first=Jodi |date=15 May 2015 |title=Ayelet Shaked, Israel's New Justice Minister, Shrugs Off Critics in Her Path |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/world/middleeast/ayelet-shaked-israels-new-justice-minister-shrugs-off-critics-in-her-path.html?_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=16 May 2015|quote=Ms. Shaked still lives in the Bavli neighborhood of Tel Aviv where she grew up.

In July 2015, Shaked announced that she was forming a committee to create a stable legal structure for the [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name=YnetNewsAmbiguity&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4682628,00.html|title=Justice Minister: Remove legal ambiguity from settlements|publisher=Ynetnews |author=Tova Tzimoki|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the committee was agreed upon in the coalition agreement between Bayit Yehudi and Likud.&lt;ref name=YnetNewsAmbiguity/&gt; She has stated: "There are many areas in Judea and Samaria, whose legal status has not been organized. Its time to remove the legal ambiguity, and allow the residents of Judea and Samaria, many of whom live in settlements that were built by the Israeli government, to live without the persistent fear of challenges to their property ownership".&lt;ref name=YnetNewsAmbiguity/&gt; The legal status of the West Bank is disputed; the Palestinians, the UN, human rights organisations and most of the international community consider it to be occupied Palestinian territory.

In January 2016, Shaked sponsored a bill in the Knesset that would require non-governmental organizations ("NGOs") that receive a majority of their funding from "foreign government entities" to be so labeled. In an interview in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' she stated that the law would foster transparency by giving the public the right "to know which NGOs are receiving most of their support from foreign governments and therefore representing foreign government interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/01/31/israel-doesnt-trust-ngos-that-get-money-from-u-s-and-europe-heres-why/|title=Israel doesn't trust NGOs that get money from U.S. and Europe. Here's why|first=William|last=Booth|date=31 January 2016|access-date=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the Israeli Knesset passed a comprehensive [[Anti-terrorism legislation|law against terrorism]], forbidding any kind of terrorism and support of terrorism, and setting severe punishments for terrorists. The law also regulates legal efforts against terrorism and [[counter-terrorism]] measures. The law was sponsored and promoted by Justice minister Shaked.&lt;ref name="Israel-anti-terror-law"&gt;{{cite news|title=Terror bill passes into law|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Terror-bill-passes-into-law-456857 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=16 June 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on Jewish identity and democracy ===

Referencing the Knesset's basic law that Israel will be a Jewish and democratic state, Shaked opposes the view that the two values are in any way incompatible, arguing that "alongside the view that there is a constant struggle and a clash of civilizations between “Jewish” and “democratic,” I believe we can propose another model."&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaked argues that the key of concepts of [[property rights]], the rejection of the [[divine right of kings]], the importance of the separation of powers, and civil liberty are a byproduct of the Jewish philosophical tradition.&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt; She states: "On what did [[John Locke|Locke]] base the right to property if not the chapters on creation? After all, Locke’s
[[Second Treatise of Government]] is inspired by a close textual reading of [[The Book of Genesis]]."&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes that, it was "not primarily Roman law or the democratic tradition of the Athenian polis that shaped and forged the modern democratic tradition in Europe or the United States, but Jewish tradition—joined, of course,  by other traditions."&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

She proposes that "it is precisely when we wish to promote advanced processes of democratization in Israel that we must deepen its Jewish identity. These identities clearly do not contradict each other; on the contrary, I believe that they strengthen each other."&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zionism ===
In a controversial 2017 speech to the Israel Bar Association, Shaked stated that the Israeli judicial branch operates as if in a "dream," adopting a "utopian and universal worldview... Only a moral and political revolution of the magnitude of the revolution we saw in the 90s, but one reaffirming the accomplishments of Zionism and its unchanging positions, may turn this problematic tide."   She argued that the [[Basic Law proposal: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People]], of which she is an advocate and architect, will lead to a "moral and political revolution in Israel...  It's a call to rouse from this dream. It's an overall perception bringing back the principles of our founding fathers to the forefront of law. It moves Zionism and the deepest and most basic components of our identity from the blind spot it currently occupies in the judicial realm to its rightful place: under the spotlight."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5009369,00.html Shaked denounces HCJ illegal aliens ruling, calls for new constitutional revolution] Gilad Morag and Tova Tzimuki, Published:  29.08.17, Ynet&lt;/ref&gt; Shaked states that "Individual rights are almost sacred to me, but not devoid of context, not when cut off from our Israeli uniqueness, our national missions, our history, and our Zionist challenges.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mako.co.il/news-military/politics-q3_2017/Article-5bbb4572d5e2e51004.htm Shaked: Zionism will not bend its head] Offer Haddad, Channel 2, Posted 29/08/17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial views ===

Shaked seeks to limit the power of the Israeli judiciary. She argues that role of the judiciary needs to be delineated and restricted. "Is it still correct to say of the judiciary in Israel what [[Alexander Hamilton]] said about the court that he knew, that it “has no influence over either the sword or the purse”? Is it really true that the judiciary in Israel has “no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society”? To my mind, this is very doubtful. In fact, it is inconceivable to me that a judicial body that bears no responsibility for filling the purse permits itself to empty it, but unfortunately, this is the situation in Israel today ... The new tracks that I seek to lay—carefully, while protecting the independence and dignity of the court—are meant to define more precisely the routes of each of the branches, legislative, executive, and judicial, and thus to enable regular traffic and prevent future collisions."&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

She writes, referencing the arguments of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],  that the long-term damage of normalizing judicial intervention has to be distinguished from the justness of any particular legal decision. "[O]nly a person with real patience who knows that the advantage of democratic government lies not in its immunity from errors, but in the fact that its errors can be corrected in the long term ... only a person like this could understand the enormous benefits of long-term governance power and what de Tocqueville meant when he spoke of the healthy influence of the government’s ability to govern effectively. Tocqueville’s words must be borne in mind as we lay the new tracks regulating the relations between the Supreme Court and the other branches of government. The healthy influence of governance emerges in ways that are not obvious, and certainly not in a brief focused glance, which misses the aggregate damages caused when the court repeatedly strikes down the products of the government and the Knesset."&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaked concludes that the judicial system must "give enough power and leeway to elected officials while minimizing the harm to the individual and giving maximum consideration to the individual’s freedom to shape his life as he wishes".&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic views ===
Shaked argues that the Israeli economy is insufficiently capitalistic. As part of a 20 page treatise she wrote in an academic law journal in 2016 on the structure of the Israeli legal system, she argues that the Israeli economy is suffering from massive over-regulation, and that the fight to de-regulate the economy is a constant uphill battle. {{cquote|"The state’s ability to finance its services depends first and foremost on the value and profit created by entrepreneurs,  by the great industrialists, by the various employers, and by the workers. Yet regulation, so beloved of lawmakers, is strangling them and placing the country’s growth in grave danger... [T]he cumulative wisdom of the masses will always be greater than that of the state’s experts, that the popular mechanisms will always be more flexible, faster, more responsive, and more adaptable than the mechanisms of the state. The law, therefore, must attempt to reflect these mechanisms and not try to create more successful alternatives...  The railroad tracks of legislation to which we have become accustomed lead to an erosion of citizens’ liberty and a series of restrictions on the economy by increasing the Knesset’s ability to criminalize various acts. In labor law, between 2011 and 2013, in an 18-month period, 60 new criminal offenses were added which an employer could be accused of as a result of actions carried out during his business activities. And this is far from being all: in environmental protection, within 24 months, 65 new criminal offenses were added. Overall, the numbers are alarming... The areas of freedom in this world, which create the enormous wealth we enjoy, would be more and more reduced because of a government apparatus."&lt;ref name="Pathways to Governability"&gt;[http://hashiloach.org.il/wp-content/themes/hashiloach_landing/dist/images/article-shaked.pdf Pathways to Governability] by Ayelet Shaked, Hashiloach, October 2016, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Opposition to executive pay limits ====
Shaked opposes the imposition of limits on executive pay. She argues that limiting executive pay means that "banks and pension funds... are having trouble finding talented managers interested in being company officers. Good senior managers are looking for new directions, and are seeking to join other sectors to which the law does not apply, they are having trouble finding talented managers interested in being company officers. Good senior managers are looking for new directions, and are seeking to join other sectors to which the law does not apply...  I'm asking you to refrain from enacting legislation where it is not needed. Unnecessary legislation is harmful legislation. It harms the economy on a macro scale and the individual on a micro scale."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-shaked-denounces-exec-pay-limits-1001187381 Shaked denounces exec pay limits] 4 May 2017 18:32, Chen Ma'anit, Globes Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kurdish Independence ===

Shaked has repeatedly stressed her support for Kurdish independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/1fadf0d1-05c6-4a2e-8772-d4f63de07de2/israeli-minister-calls-for-kurdish-statehood Israeli minister calls for Kurdish statehood] Kurdistan 24 Wednesday, 20 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In an unusual intervention in foreign policy, Shaked called for an independent [[Kurdistan]]. Shaked says as the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] breaks apart, "the greatest opportunity that stands before us could come from strengthening the connections with the Kurdish nation."  Shaked says, “the Jewish and Kurdish nations share a history... of mutual respect, mutual interests,” including fighting Islamic State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Shaked-dives-into-foreign-policy-pushes-for-alliance-with-Kurds-405506 Shaked dives into foreign policy, pushes for alliance with Kurds] Jerusalem Post, By YONAH JEREMY BOB, 06/09/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Shaked has additionally cited the high number of women serving in Kurdish armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

=== Cannabis decriminalization ===
Shaked supports and has legislated for the decriminalization of cannabis consumption. In 2017, as Minister of Justice, Shaked submitted legislation to decriminalize the recreational use of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2017/03/05/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/israels-cabinet-votes-to-decriminalize-recreational-marijuana-use Israel’s Cabinet votes to decriminalize recreational marijuana use] March 5, 2017, JTA&lt;/ref&gt;  On successfully passing the legislation, Shaked said "Whether one supports use of cannabis or is opposed, it is wrong to judge cannabis users per criminal law and its derivatives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/06/health/israel-decriminalizes-cannabis-marijuana/ Israel makes it official: Cannabis is not a crime] By [[Oren Liebermann]] and Kara Fox, CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Shaked is married and has two children and lives in [[Bavli]], Tel Aviv. Her husband is a fighter-pilot in the [[Israeli Air Force]].&lt;ref name=jtaWho /&gt; She is an admirer of [[Steve Jobs]]. She was influenced by [[Ayn Rand]], in particular ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.&lt;ref name="Talks with a Tel Aviv Settler"/&gt; She describes her personality as 'intellectual' and 'systematic'.&lt;ref name="השקד פורחת"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6212">'''Bryson Foster''' is a noted teen [[activist]] who advocates and fundraises for the development of treatments for [[muscular dystrophy]].

Born June 28, 2000, Foster was diagnosed with [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] at age five.&lt;ref name=Diagnosis&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryson Foster|url=http://mda.org/about/bio/bryson-foster|publisher=Muscular Dystrophy Association|accessdate=6 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083549/http://mda.org/about/bio/bryson-foster|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As MDA Goodwill Ambassador==

While attending a [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] banquet at age nine, Foster asked if he could address the audience.&lt;ref name=Speaking&gt;{{cite news|last=Pacek|first=Jessica Groover|title=Concord natives out front in muscular dystrophy fight|url=http://m.independenttribune.com/community/article_4e291c70-25dd-11e3-a09e-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=Independent Tribune|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I was anxious because I had never done it before, but when I got up there I didn't want to stop," he recalled.&lt;ref name=Mobility&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryson Foster: Making a muscle in his Q6 Edge|url=http://www.pridemobility.com/profiles/brysonfoster.asp|publisher=Pride Mobility Products Corporation|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of his parents, Foster demonstrated a flair for communication; this in turn led to his choice as a national MDA [[Goodwill Ambassador]] (formerly known as an MDA [[Poster child|Poster Child]]) for two consecutive years (2012 and 2013).&lt;ref name=Communication&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruebens|first=Lindsay|title=Concord teen wraps up second year as MDA ambassador|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/09/23/4326248/concord-teen-wraps-up-second-year.html#.U0DYKPldW9s#storylink=cpy|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=Charlotte Observer|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this role, Foster appeared on the annual MDA telethon, by then called the [[MDA Show of Strength]], visited numerous MDA corporate and business sponsors (including [[Lowe's]] and [[Harley-Davidson]]), and met many celebrities (including singers [[Taylor Swift]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Faith Hill]] and [[Tim McGraw]], among others).&lt;ref name="Speaking"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spokesperson&gt;{{cite web|title=North Carolina Boy Returns as MDA National Goodwill Ambassador|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/2/prweb10478186.htm|publisher=PRWEB|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foster also dealt frequently with the media and appeared in various MDA national promotional materials, including video [[public service announcements]] and MDA "[[shamrocks]]."

He has also served as MDA Goodwill Ambassador for the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], area.

"My favorite part of the job," explained Foster of his Goodwill Ambassador role, "is meeting new people and being able to thank the sponsors and supporters in person who help make an impact in the lives of people just like me. Every dollar and every cent really does count, and my mission is to have fun while spreading the word about MDA and its mission to help people living with muscle disease."&lt;ref name="Spokesperson"/&gt;

"Most kids my age don't come across opportunities like the ones I've had. . . ," he also observed. "I've experienced so many new things and met wonderful people along the way. I just want to keep speaking from my heart and doing what I love most to inspire people to support a cause that is close to me and my family."&lt;ref name="Spokesperson"/&gt;

==More recent activities==

Foster remains active as an MDA fundraiser and independent MD spokesperson, participating in such fundraising efforts as "Muscle Team, Muscle Walk, Lock-Ups, Shamrocks, mobile kickoffs, Fill the Boot, golf tournaments and social events."&lt;ref name="Spokesperson"/&gt; His walk team, Bryson's Bikers, has raised tens of thousands of dollars for the MDA.&lt;ref name=Bikers&gt;{{cite news|last=Darnell|first=Christina|title=Concord boy stumps for MDA|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/02/19/3019628_concord-boy-stumps-for-mda.html#.U0DfDvldW9s|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=Charlotte Observer|date=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other interests==

Foster's speaking skills resulted in a voice actor role in the [[Mobile application software|app]] ''Little Ashby: Star Reporter'', developed by “[[Entertainment Tonight]]” host and MDA National [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] Ambassador [[Nancy O'Dell]]. Foster performed the voice of child cameraperson "Arty."&lt;ref name="Voice Actor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryson Animated Voiceover Debut|url=http://mda.org/page/bryson-animated-voiceover-debut|publisher=Muscular Dystrophy Association|accessdate=6 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083750/http://mda.org/page/bryson-animated-voiceover-debut|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sports fan, Foster plans to pursue a career in sports, either as a football player, coach, or announcer.&lt;ref name=Goals&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivera|first=Steve|title=Bryson Foster Named MDA's 2012 National Goodwill Ambassador|url=http://quest.mda.org/news/bryson-foster-named-mdas-2012-national-goodwill-ambassador|publisher=Muscular Dystrophy Association|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos de Amésquita''' (also '''Carlos de Amézqueta''' or '''Carlos de Amézola''') was a [[Spain|Spanish]] naval officer of the 16th century. He is remembered for his raid on English soil, known as the [[Raid on Mount's Bay]], during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War 1585–1604]].

Amésquita commanded three companies and four galleys (named ''Capitana'', ''Patrona'', ''Peregrina'' and ''Bazana''). They disembarked at [[Penmarch]] on July 26, and in [[Mount's Bay]] ([[Cornwall]]) on August 2.

After burning the town of [[Mousehole]], Amésquita and his men embarked on their galleys and sailed for two miles, after which they disembarked again, conquered and burned the fort of [[Penzance]] down, [[Newlyn]], and Penzance. They celebrated a mass at St. Mary Chapel at Penzance, where they promised to celebrate another mass after England had been defeated.

[[File:CarolineFayard0001.jpg|thumb]]
On 2010 October 22, Fayard's name surfaced on [[talk radio|talk-radio]] program ''Think Tank with [[Garland Robinette]]'', as a potential competitor for then Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] in his presumed [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2011|2011 reelection campaign]]. The discussants cited Jindal's high [[approval rating]]s and already in-the-bank $7 million [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign fund]] as unapproachable assets for Democrats other than Fayard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwl.com/pages/268189.php 10 "Think Tank" with Garland Robinette.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028165022/http://www.wwl.com/pages/268189.php# |date=2010-10-28 }} The statements about Fayard occurred at 11:00 AM [[Central Daylight Time|CDT]]; the program originated from New Orleans [[WWL (AM)|WWL Radio 870 AM]] and its [[simulcast]] [[frequency modulation|FM]] equivalent [[WWL-FM|WWL Radio 105.3 FM]].&lt;/ref&gt; The speculation continued after the election, with Fayard remaining uncommitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Ultimately, she decided not to run for office. Fayard subsequently focussed on building a successful law practice helping Louisianans recover from the devastating effects of the BP oil spill. She also helped launch Glo Airlines with her brother, Trey Fayard.

Caroline Fayard was inducted into the New Leaders Council.  She has been an outspoken advocate for youth and young adults to get active in politics.

Fayard has remained active in local organizations in southeastern Louisiana.

=== 2016 U.S. Senate primary election ===
[[File:Caroline 2016.jpg|thumb]]
Fayard first announced her candidacy in early February 2016, becoming the first Democrat to enter the race.&lt;ref name="Crisp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/news/14779292-123/caroline-fayard-launches-us-senate-bid|
author=Crisp, Elizabeth|title=Democrat Caroline Fayard Launches U.S. Senate Bid|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Baton Rouge Advocate]]''|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fayard faced a handful of Republican candidates, including State Treasurer [[John Neely Kennedy]], and U.S. Representative [[Charles Boustany]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]].  U.S. Representative [[John Fleming (U.S. politician)|John C. Fleming]] of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], former KKK leader and State Representative [[David Duke]], and retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness also competed.  [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]er [[Foster Campbell]], a Democrat and former State Senator, ran as well.  Due to Louisiana's unusual [[Nonpartisan blanket primary]], Fayard ran on the same ballot with the other 23 candidates on November 8.

Fayard built her campaign on her outsider status in Louisiana politics, her personal accomplishments in the legal and business world, and her advocacy for pay equity for women, [[Paid family leave]], and expansion of [[charter schools]].  According to Fayard, voters are looking past party identification in 2016 and are seeking new leadership, arguing that "people don't believe that government, regardless of who's in charge, is adequately serving their needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanpress.com/20160712-Fayard# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712151651/http://www.americanpress.com/20160712-Fayard# |archive-date=2016-07-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her main criticism of her opponents, aside from fundamental policy concerns, was based on their status as career politicians.  On the campaign trail Fayard noted the amount of time they have held public office, a political liability in a "change" election.

As evidence for her effectiveness as a legislator should she be elected, Fayard touted her role in the settlement negotiations following the 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].  Fayard has compared the process of negotiating settlements in plaintiff's cases to policymaking in the U.S. Government, saying that "In reaching the settlement, you never get 100 percent of everything that what you want, but often a good compromise is almost always better than a bad win."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_1ac8b54e-f45a-576d-a1cd-227e798f3835.html|title=New Orleans lawyer, entrepreneur Caroline Fayard: These 2 big accomplishments would make me successful as U.S. Senator|first=Rebekah Allen|last=rallen@theadvocate.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also made the case that her experience in the private sector, including her role in [[GLO Airlines]], has given her an appreciation for the need to find common ground and cut deals with people with whom she disagrees.

Pay equity for women, paid family leave, and education reform are counted among the issues Fayard most prominently addressed in her campaign.  She publicly pledged to keep only 65% of her salary, equal to the gender pay gap in Louisiana, while donating the rest to charities that support women and children; this is meant to show solidarity and raise awareness for the issue of pay equity.  Fayard also garnered much of her support based on her advocacy for charter schools, which was named a prominent reason behind [[New Orleans]] Mayor [[Mitch Landrieu]]'s endorsement of her bid for the U.S. Senate.

Her campaign style and apparatus has been compared to that of former U.S. Senator [[Mary Landrieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/stephanie_grace/article_6f875168-7907-11e6-8ee4-3b552b47f399.html|title=Stephanie Grace: In crowded Senate field, Democrats carve out their own virtual primary|first=STEPHANIE GRACE |last=sgrace@theadvocate.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fayard's campaign staff included several former aides to Senator Landrieu, and Senator Landrieu herself sits on the advisory board of Democrats for Education Reform, which has endorsed Fayard's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dfer.org/icymi-dfer-la-names-caroline-fayard-as-choice-for-u-s-senate/|title=ICYMI: DFER-LA Names Caroline Fayard As Choice For U.S. Senate - Democrats for Education Reform|date=1 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, Fayard was endorsed by New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/2016_louisiana_senate_race_may.html|title=New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu backs Caroline Fayard in Louisiana Senate race|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing her commitment to New Orleans and the state, Landrieu said of Fayard "She will bring new energy to Washington. Caroline will keep flood protection and coastal restoration a top priority. She also understands that investments in public safety and infrastructure will make our city and state stronger.  Lastly, I am confident she will also support public charter schools, which is vital to keeping our city and state moving forward."  Fayard also received the support of many other prominent figures in Louisiana, including veteran Democratic strategist [[James Carville]], the Alliance for Good Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/stephanie_grace/article_2730a8c4-5f12-11e6-bba3-d3d18c646292.html|title=Grace Notes: Highs and lows from Alliance for Good Government Senate forum|first=STEPHANIE GRACE |last=sgrace@theadvocate.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats for Education Reform- Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfer.org/icymi-dfer-la-names-caroline-fayard-as-choice-for-u-s-senate/|title=ICYMI: DFER-LA Names Caroline Fayard As Choice For U.S. Senate - Democrats for Education Reform|date=1 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent polling from the race, conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove, indicated that Fayard was tied for 2nd place among all voters.&lt;ref&gt;https://lapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ALG-Topline-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The poll, conducted between August 29 and September 1, found Fayard at 13%, tied with U.S. Representative [[Charles Boustany]].  Leading the pack was Louisiana State Treasurer [[John Neely Kennedy]] at 18%.  Fayard significantly outpaced her Democratic opponent, Public Service Commissioner [[Foster Campbell]], who was at 7%.  All other candidates received below 7%.  As of September 25, [[FiveThirtyEight]]'s polling aggregator for the election has Fayard tied with Foster Campbell for 2nd place at roughly 17% of the vote each; both are 11 points behind State Treasurer John Kennedy, who is at 28%.  Fayard's position in the race increased greatly since the spring of 2016, when she began the race in 6th place.

Her campaign was headquartered in New Orleans, LA.

==Political positions==

===Pay equity and childcare===
Fayard is strongly in favor of legislation that seeks to end the [[Gender pay gap]] in the United States, and has made pay equity for women workers a centerpiece for her 2016 campaign for the United States Senate.  Due to the fact that Louisiana women on average earn 65 cents on the dollar compared to men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2016/04/louisiana_wage_gap_costing_wom.html|title=How much is Louisiana's gender wage gap costing women?|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayard has pledged to take only 65% of her salary if elected to the Senate as a show of solidarity with women in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/blogofneworleans/archives/2016/05/31/senate-candidate-fayard-ill-take-only-65-percent-of-my-salary-if-elected|title=Senate candidate Fayard: I'll take only 65 percent of my salary if elected|first=Della|last=Hasselle|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fayard pledges to do this until the Paycheck Fairness Act is passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s862|title=Paycheck Fairness Act (2015 - S. 862)|website=GovTrack.us|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, due to the rising costs of child care, Fayard also supports increased government subsidization of low-cost childcare for working mothers."In Louisiana, our female workforce is the worst paid in the nation, earning 65 cents for every dollar a man makes. Consequently, Louisiana families are losing nearly $11 billion a year in what they would otherwise be earning. This isn't about ego, it's about eating," Fayard says on the issue.  Further, Fayard supports the passage of legislation that provides [[paid family leave]] on the federal level.  Fayard believes employer-provided paid leave will ease the burden on working families, especially concerning the high cost of childcare.

===Education===
Fayard supports [[charter schools]] as a means to increase competition, choice, and quality of schools.  Louisiana currently ranks fifth to last in high-school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/ACGR_RE_and_characteristics_2013-14.asp|title=Common Core of Data (CCD)|website=nces.ed.gov|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with expanding sufficiently regulated charter schools, Fayard supports more ambitious educational standards while retaining local control of education.  Fayard's endorsements by New Orleans Mayor [[Mitch Landrieu]] and Democrats for Education Reform-Louisiana make her a leading voice in Louisiana Democratic Politics on the issue of school choice.  Fayard argues that STEM education will be necessary for Louisiana's economic future, and better primary and secondary education is necessary to fill those openings.  Additionally, to accomplish this goal, she proposes increasing the abundance and availability of federal grants for students who are seeking higher education in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="carolinefayard.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/education-student-debt# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927160822/http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/education-student-debt# |archive-date=2016-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fayard is in favor of substantially reforming federal student debt policy.  Among the reforms she proposes, Fayard highlights "the right to refinance student loans to allow borrowers to take advantage of market interest rates, while eliminating the $2,500 cap on student loan interest deductions".&lt;ref name="carolinefayard.com"/&gt;  Aside from benefiting students, Fayard believes reforms that increase purchasing power of young students will help bolster consumer spending, which will benefit the Louisiana economy.  Predatory lending practices also factor into Fayard's position on higher education.  She believes that further regulation of for-profit universities and their financiers is needed to reign in the power of these institutions.

===National security===
Fayard has called on the federal government to take swift and decisive action against transnational [[terrorism]], especially when motivated by radical Islam.  Fayard has noted on multiple occasions that her witnessing&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carolinefayard.com/sites/carolinefayard/files/images/fayard-at-ground-zero.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[September 11 attacks]] was pivotal in shaping the way she views the world and inspired her to commit to public service.

Fayard has advocated a strong pro-Israel position during her campaign for the U.S. Senate.  She has called the relationship between the United States and Israel "a cultural and strategic partnership that is mutually essential for the safety and security of both nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/national-security# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927163318/http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/national-security# |archive-date=2016-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayard opposes the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS Movement]], which seeks to pressure Israel to withdraw its settlements and occupation from Palestinian territory.

Fayard is a supporter of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and views its activities as crucial to combating global terrorism, preventing humanitarian crises, and ensuring global stability.

===Criminal justice reform and police===
Fayard supports comprehensive [[criminal justice reform]] to address the problems that currently exist in the U.S. Criminal Justice System.  Louisiana, having the highest incarceration rate in the United States, has a justice system in a state of disrepair according to Fayard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/criminal-justice-reform# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927163256/http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/criminal-justice-reform# |archive-date=2016-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fayard argues for Criminal Justice Reform on the grounds of fiscal responsibility and [[civil rights]].  Fayard's ideal criminal justice system would entail "empower[ing] judges with flexibility to make the punishment fit the crime, while directing the proper resources to efficient and effective drug treatment, mental health, and rehabilitation programs, will put Louisiana on a better path to the future."

Fayard opposes the practice of [[solitary confinement]] for juvenile offenders, which remains legal in 10 states, including Louisiana.  This puts Fayard in line with President [[Barack Obama]], who banned the practice in federal prisons in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-bans-solitary-confinement-for-juveniles-in-federal-prisons/2016/01/25/056e14b2-c3a2-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html|title=Obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons|first=Juliet|last=Eilperin|date=26 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Fayard believes that [[private prisons]] are detrimental to society and produce inhumane conditions for prisoners while not substantially reducing costs.  As a result, she believes that private corporations should not be able to profit off of the incarceration of American citizens.

Despite being in favor of overhauling the criminal justice system, Fayard has billed herself as a partner with the Law Enforcement community.  Fayard supports additional funding for community policing and using federal dollars to implement programs to better train officers on effective engagement in the community to stem the tide of tensions between police and the communities they serve and restore a sense of trust and cooperation.  In the aftermath of the July 17th shooting of five police officers in [[Baton Rouge]], Fayard wrote on [[Facebook]] "This vile, unimaginable violence must stop. Attacks on any of us are attacks on all of us, including the memories of those we've lost, and this simply cannot stand. My family and I stand shoulder to shoulder in prayer with the Baton Rouge Police Department, the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office, the people of Baton Rouge, and the entire state of Louisiana."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/geauxcaroline/posts/485097804948041|title=Caroline Fayard|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual assault and domestic violence===
Fayard has called on private institutions as well as the government to increase efforts to prevent sexual assault on college campuses and domestic violence against women and children.  Fayard has criticized colleges and universities over what she calls a "disturbing failure" to implement appropriate prevention, protection, and response mechanisms on campus.  "Educating students and staff about sexual violence, preventing sexual assaults, and providing an appropriate response when sexual assaults occur should be a concerted focus for all higher education institutions around the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/fighting-for-women# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927161301/http://www.carolinefayard.com/issues/fighting-for-women# |archive-date=2016-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fayard advocates for increased federal funding for "[s]helters, domestic violence clinics, and general women, children and infant care programs" to help victims of domestic abuse as well.  She also has said that private corporations should take responsibility and adopt internal policies designed to root out forced labor and human trafficking.  "Americans cannot call their country free in good conscience as long as this issue endures," Fayard writes on her website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6718">[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who led [[Romania]] from 1965 to 1989, had a large family, several members of which wielded influence in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]]. Below are given outlines of his immediate family members' lives, with links to those who have separate articles about them.

Nicolae's father was Andruță Ceaușescu (1886–1969), descendant of a family of shepherds from [[Polovragi]], in [[Gorj County]].&lt;ref name="La taifas - Nepotul..."&gt;"La taifas - Nepotul..."&lt;/ref&gt; Andruţă owned a modest house in [[Scorniceşti|Scornicești]], [[Olt County]]. A supporter of [[Ion Mihalache]] and the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], he was for a while mayor of Scornicești.&lt;ref name="La taifas - Nepotul..."/&gt; After the fall and execution of Nicolae, some people from Scornicești claimed Andruță used to [[Domestic violence|beat]] his wife and children,&lt;ref name="Clanul - Arborele genealogic..."&gt;"Clanul - Arborele genealogic..."&lt;/ref&gt; while the Romanian media alleged that he was an alcoholic.&lt;ref&gt;"Clanul - Arborele genealogic...", " Între ştranduri...", "Poetul .Ceauşescu..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolae's mother was Alexandrina (''née'' Lixandra) (1888–1977), descendant of an officer in [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]'s army.&lt;ref name="La taifas - Nepotul..."/&gt;  She was a very [[Romanian Orthodox Church|religious]] wwoman, and after his parents died, Nicolae Ceaușescu, an atheist, ordered that a church be built in their memory in Scornicești; their portraits still adorn its walls.

In order of birth, their children were:
*Niculina Ceaușescu (1914-1990).. She was the first in her family to leave for [[Bucharest]], seeking work. There, she kept Nicolae in her home in 1929 when he started work as a shoemaker's apprentice.
*[[Marin Ceaușescu]] (1916–1989).
*[[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Nicolae Ceaușescu]] (1918–1989). In 1946, he married [[Elena Ceauşescu|Elena Petrescu]]. They had three children:
**[[Valentin Ceauşescu|Valentin Ceaușescu]] (born 1948) (one son, Daniel, and one daughter, Alexandra).
**[[Zoia Ceauşescu|Zoia Ceaușescu]] (1949–2006).
**[[Nicu Ceauşescu|Nicu Ceaușescu]] (1951–1996).
*Florea Ceaușescu (2 August 1922&amp;ndash;21 October 2006). He was reportedly an [[Iron Guard]] sympathizer as a young man, although this cannot be confirmed, as his [[Romanian Communist Party]] cadre file is missing from the [[National Archives of Romania|National Archives]]. He married Scornicești native Ioana Necă in 1946, and according to his brother Ilie, worked in Bucharest as a waiter in 1946 and as a merchant in 1949. That year, he joined the party and began working for its Bucharest newspaper, ''Steagul Roșu'', later joining ''[[Scînteia]]''. Of his relatives, he got on best with Marin,&lt;ref name="parvenit"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Mihai, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/adevaratul_ceausescu/Neamul_Ceausestilor-pe_calea_parvenirii_socialiste_0_559144779.html "Neamul Ceauşeştilor, pe calea parvenirii socialiste" ("The Ceauşescu Family, on the Road to Communist Success")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924145549/http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/adevaratul_ceausescu/Neamul_Ceausestilor-pe_calea_parvenirii_socialiste_0_559144779.html |date=2011-09-24 }}, ''Adevărul'', 22 September 2011; accessed September 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and he closely resembled Nicolae, with whom he was sometimes confused.
*Nicolae Andruță Ceaușescu (1924–2000). Supposedly, his drunken father declared his name as Nicolae at town hall, despite having another son by that name.&lt;ref&gt;"Clanul - Arborele genealogic...", "Le dictateur..."&lt;/ref&gt; Once his brother came to power, his father's name was made his middle name in order to distinguish the two. At one time, he was chief of cadres at the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior of Romania|Ministry of the Interior]]. Due to a disagreement with his brother, he was later sent to head the [[Securitate]] officers' school in [[Băneasa]].  He was arrested during the [[Romanian Revolution]] by Aurel Ceciu, one of the people he had promoted from that school.&lt;ref&gt;Oprea&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolae Andruță Ceaușescu had two children, Cristian and Claudia.
*[[Ilie Ceauşescu|Ilie Ceaușescu]] (1926–2002).
*Maria Ceaușescu, later Maria Agachi, worked at Electromagnetica, eventually becoming section chief at that factory due to her family connections.&lt;ref name="Clanul - Arborele genealogic..."/&gt;
*Elena Ceaușescu, later Elena Bărbulescu (1928–2001), was a history teacher at Scornicești High School. Due to her famous brother,&lt;ref name="Clanul - Arborele genealogic..."/&gt; she rapidly advanced in her career, quickly becoming head of her school and then school inspector for the whole of Olt County. She had two daughters, Eugenia and Nadia, and a son, Emil, who held a leadership position at the Ministry of the Interior in Olt County before 1989.&lt;ref name="La taifas - Nepotul..."/&gt;
*Ion Ceaușescu taught at the Agronomic Institute of Bucharest and headed the Academy of Agricultural Sciences. After the Revolution of 1989, he established a firm and wrote horticultural works.

Additionally, one child did not survive to adulthood.

Nicolae's parents had 18 grandchildren: 7 boys and 11 girls.

[[File:Stupa 2 Bimaran Charles Masson.jpg|thumb|The Stupa Nb.2 at [[Bimaran]], where the [[Bimaran reliquary]] was excavated. Drawing by Charles Masson.]]
'''Charles Masson''' (1800–1853) was the pseudonym of '''James Lewis''', a [[British East India Company]] soldier and [[explorer]]. He was the first European to discover the ruins of [[Harappa]] near [[Sahiwal]] in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], now in [[Pakistan]].

==Early life==
British by birth, Masson joined the [[Bengal Artillery]] wing of the East India Company Army in [[India]] and served in the [[Siege of Bhurtpore (1805)|Battle of Bharatpur]].

==Travels==
[[File:Plaque on Bactrian coins by Charles Masson.jpg|thumb|A plaque on Bactrian coins by Charles Masson. Published in the Journal of the [[Asiatic Society of Bengal]], 1836.]]
In 1827, while stationed  at [[Agra]], he and a colleague deserted and traveled through parts of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] that were under British control at that time. At [[Ahmadpur East|Ahmadpur]], they were rescued by [[Josiah Harlan]] and commissioned as mounted orderlies in his expedition to overthrow the regime in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan. Not long afterward, near [[Dera Ghazi Khan]], he deserted Harlan.

Between 1833 and 1838, Masson excavated over 50 Buddhist sites around Kabul and [[Jalalabad]] in south-eastern Afghanistan, amassing a large collection of small objects and many coins, principally from the site at [[Bagram]] (the ancient [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]]), north of Kabul. From 1827, when he deserted, to his return to England in 1842, it is estimated that Masson collected around 47,000 coins.

Masson was the first European to see the ruins of [[Harappa]], described and illustrated in his book ''Narrative of Various Journeys in Balochistan, Afghanistan and The Panjab''. He also visited the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], serving as an agent of the East India Company.

In the 1930s, the {{Interlanguage link multi|French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan|fr|Délégation archéologique française en Afghanistan|es|Delegación Arqueológica Francesa en Afganistán}} (''Délégation archéologique française en Afghanistan'', DAFA) found unexpected evidence of an earlier European visitor scribbled in one of the caves above the 55 m Buddha at [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]]. This stated:&lt;br /&gt;
''If any fool this high samootch explore,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Know Charles Masson has been here before''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL27_0809.pdf Elizabeth Errington, "Ancient Afghanistan through the Eyes of Charles Masson (1800-1853): The Masson Project at the British Museum", ''IIAS Newsletter no.27'', pp.8-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Masson Project at the British Museum==
Through his wide-ranging travels, Masson built up an extraordinary collection of artefacts largely (although not exclusively) from the modern states of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Numbering about 9,000 objects, they are now held by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=138885&amp;peoA=138885-3-7 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The Masson Project is led by Dr [[Elizabeth Errington]], and aims to publish Masson's collection. Publications so far include:

'''Claude-Etienne Minié''' (13 February 1804 – 14 December 1879) was a French Army officer famous for solving the problem of designing a reliable [[muzzle-loading rifle]] by inventing the [[Minié ball]] in 1846, and the [[Minié rifle]] in 1849. He succeeded the pioneering work of [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne]] and [[Louis-Etienne de Thouvenin|Louis-Étienne de Thouvenin]]. Minié was born and died in Paris.

Minié served in a number of African campaigns with the [[Chasseur]]s, after which he was eventually promoted to [[Captain (land and air)|captain]].  In 1846 he designed the Minié ball, a cylindrical bullet with a conical hollow in the base which expanded when fired.  This projectile, combined with his rifle, resulted in a major improvement in firearm accuracy.

The French government rewarded Minié with some 20,000 francs and installed him as a member of the staff at the [[Vincennes military school]]. In 1858 he retired from the [[French Army]] with the rank of [[colonel]] and later served as a military instructor for the [[khedive]] of [[Egypt]] and as a manager at the [[Remington Arms Company]] in the United States. His rifling technology proved critical to the increase in firearms accuracy seen during the [[American Civil War]].

[[File:Drafter at work.jpg|thumb|Upright|Traditional drafter at work]]
[[File:Man at drafting table.jpg|thumb|A drafter in Portugal in the 1970s, using a [[drafting machine]] ]]
A '''drafter''', '''draughtsman''' ([[British English]]) or '''draftsman''', '''drafting technician''' ([[American English]] and [[Canadian English]]) is a person who makes detailed [[Technical_drawing|technical drawings]] or plans for machinery, buildings, electronics, infrastructure, sections, etc. Drafters use computer software and manual sketches to convert the designs, plans, and layouts of engineers and architects into a set of technical drawings. Drafters operate as the supporting developers and sketch engineering designs and drawings from preliminary design concepts.

== Overview ==
In the past, drafters sat at drawing boards and used pencils, pens, compasses, protractors, triangles, and other drafting devices to prepare a drawing by hand. From the 1980s through 1990s, board drawings were going out of style as the newly developed computer-aided design (CAD) system was released and was able to produce technical drawings at a faster pace. 

Many modern drafters now use computer software such as [[AutoCAD]], [[Revit]], and [[SolidWorks]]  to flesh out the designs of engineers or architects into technical drawings and blueprints but board drafting still remains the base of the CAD system. Many of these drawings are utilized to create structures, tools or machines. In addition, the drawings also include design specifications like dimensions, materials and procedures.&lt;ref name="AC 2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scan2cad.com/cad/autocad-careers|title=AutoCAD Careers – Everything You Need To Know |date=December 19, 2016 |website=Scan2CAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, drafters may also be casually referred to as CAD operators, engineering draftspersons, or engineering technicians.&lt;ref name="BLC07"&gt;[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (2008) ''[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos111.htm ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–09 Edition:  Drafters]'' dated: 18 December 2007.  accessed: 24 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With CAD systems, drafters can create and store drawings electronically so that they can be viewed, printed, or programmed directly into automated manufacturing systems. CAD systems also permit drafters to quickly prepare variations of a design. Although drafters use CAD extensively, it is only a tool. Drafters still need knowledge of traditional drafting techniques, in addition to CAD skills. Despite the near global use of CAD systems, manual drafting and sketching are used in certain applications.&lt;ref name="BLC07" /&gt;

Drafters' drawings provide visual guidelines and show how to construct a product or structure. Drawings include technical details and specify dimensions, materials, and procedures. Drafters fill in technical details using drawings, rough sketches, specifications, and calculations made by engineers, surveyors, architects, or scientists. For example, drafters use their knowledge of standardized building techniques to draw in the details of a structure. Some use their understanding of engineering and manufacturing theory and standards to draw the parts of a machine; they determine design elements, such as the numbers and kinds of fasteners needed to assemble the machine. Drafters use technical handbooks, tables, calculators, and computers to complete their work.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;

== Specialities ==
Drafting work has many specialities such as:&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AC 2016"/&gt;

* '''Aeronautical drafters''' prepare engineering drawings detailing plans and specifications used in the manufacture of aircraft, missiles, and related parts.
* [[Architectural drafting|'''Architectural drafters''']] draw architectural and structural features of buildings and other structures. These designs are used in the construction or remodeling of homes, commercial buildings and power stations. These workers may specialize in a type of structure, such as residential or commercial, or in a kind of building material used, such as [[reinforced concrete]], [[masonry]], [[steel]], or [[timber]].
* '''Civil drafters''' prepare drawings and topographical and relief maps used in major construction or [[civil engineering]] projects such as buildings, highways, bridges, [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, flood-control projects, and water and sewage systems.
* '''[[Electrical drafters]]''' prepare [[Wiring diagram|wiring]] and layout diagrams used by workers who erect, install, and repair electrical equipment and wiring in communication centers, [[power plant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, electrical distribution systems, and buildings.
* '''Electronics drafters''' draw wiring diagrams, [[circuit board]] assembly diagrams, [[schematics]], and layout drawings used in the manufacture, installation, and repair of electronic devices and components.
* '''Mechanical drafters''' prepare drawings showing the detail and assembly of a wide variety of machinery and mechanical devices, indicating dimensions, [[fastening]] methods, manufacturing equipment, and mechanical installation infrastructure.
* '''Process piping '''or''' pipeline drafters '''prepare drawings used in the layout, construction, and operation of [[Oil field|oil]] and [[gas field]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[refineries]], [[chemical plant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and process [[piping]] systems.
* '''Photovoltaic drafters''' prepare drawings showing inverter Pad location drawings and slab construction drawings, also prepare specific [[PV system|photovoltaic system]] assembly details and some [[wiring diagram]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

== Employment and work environment ==
Drafters work in architectural offices, manufacturing companies, engineering firms, CAD-specific work-groups, construction companies, engineering consultancy firms, the government, natural resource companies or are independently self-employed. Drafting technologists and technicians often work as part of a broader multidisciplinary engineering team in support of engineers, architects or industrial designers or they may work on their own. The position of a drafter is one of a skilled assistant to architects and engineers. Drafters usually work in offices, seated at adjustable drawing boards or drafting tables when doing manual drawings, although modern drafters work at computer terminals much of the time. They usually work in an office environment, but some may have to travel and spend time on manufacturing plants or construction sites. As drafters spend long periods in front of computers doing detailed technical work, they may be susceptible to [[eyestrain]], back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems. Most drafters work standard 40-hour weeks; only a small number work part-time.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;

== Education and training ==
High school courses in English, mathematics, science, electronics, computer technology, [[Technical drawing|drafting]] and [[design]], visual arts, and [[computer graphics]] are useful for people considering a drafting career. Attributes required by drafters include technical writing skills, problem-solving skills, the ability to visualize three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional drawings as well as drawing the relationships between parts in machinery and various pieces of infrastructure. Other skills include an in-depth knowledge of the qualities of metals, plastics, wood and other materials used in the overall manufacturing processes and of construction methods and standards. Technical expertise, a strong understanding of construction and the manufacturing process, and a solid knowledge of drafting and design principles are also important assets in becoming a drafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalschool.ca/3-essential-skills-you-need-to-become-a-successful-cad-technician/ |title=3 Essential Skills You Need to Become a Successful CAD Technician}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern job marketplace, in addition to technical skills enabling CAD drafters to draw up plans, soft skills are also crucial as CADD drafter have to communicate with clients and articulating their drawing plans in an effective way with fellow team members in a real-world setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalschool.ca/3-essential-skills-you-need-to-become-a-successful-cad-technician/ |title=3 Essential Skills You Need to Become a Successful CAD Technician}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers prefer applicants who have also completed training after high school at a trade or technical school. Prospective drafters will also need to have a strong background knowledge and experience with CADD software. Though licenses aren’t a prerequisite for becoming drafters, the American Design Drafting Association (ADDA) does offer certification and licensing. Licensing and certification highlights one's core competence and knowledge of a specific drafting specialty.Drafting and design certificates and diplomas are generally offered by career training schools, trade and technical schools and non-university higher education institutions like community colleges or industrial training institutes.&lt;ref name="AC 2016"/&gt; 

Apprenticeships combine paid on-the-job training and experience with in-class instruction. People interested in becoming drafters can get qualified as either drafting technologists or drafting technicians. Drafting technologists usually have a 2 to 3-year diploma in engineering design or drafting technology from a community college or technical school.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt; Drafters starting out tend to move from company to company to gain experience and to move up. A more senior drafter often moves up into a management position where they become able to supervise entire projects as they gain more experience or they can start their own business and become self-employed. It is also possible for experienced drafters to enter related fields such as [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[exhibit design]], [[landscape design]], [[set design]], and [[animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rileyguide.com/careers/mechanical-drafting-technicians.shtml | title=Mechanical Drafters | publisher=Riley Guide | accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://learn.org/articles/Aeronautical_Drafter_Jobs_Career_and_Salary_FAQs.html | title=Aeronautical Drafter: Career and Salary Facts | publisher=Learn.org | accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31836">The early career of [[Julius Caesar]] was characterized by military adventurism and political persecution. Julius Caesar was born on July 13, 100 BC,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notablebiographies.com/Br-Ca/Caesar-Julius.html#b&lt;/ref&gt; into a patrician family, the [[gens]] Julia, which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus. His father died when he was just 16, leaving Caesar as the head of the household. His family status put him at odds with the Dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], who almost had him executed. 

At about that time, Caesar found himself captured by pirates, only to crucify his former captors after he was ransomed. Soon he began his military career. He served in [[Hispania]], married Sulla's granddaughter and was elected chief priest, all in rapid succession. 

Shortly after this, he was suspected, though not convicted, of involvement in the [[Catiline Conspiracy]]. Soon he was leaving for a governorship in Hispania and positioning himself to be one of the most important figures in history.

==Early life and family==
Caesar was born into an aristocratic family, the ''[[gens]] [[Julius|Julia]]'', which claimed descent from [[Ascanius|Iulus]], son of the legendary [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]], supposedly the son of the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Froude|first=James Anthony|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Life of Caesar|publisher=Project Gutenberg e-text|year=1879|page=67|url=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209113843/http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt|archivedate=2007-12-09|df=}} See also: [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'': ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#6 6]; [[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[cognomen]]'' "Caesar" originated, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], with an ancestor who was born by [[caesarean section]] (from the Latin verb to cut, ''caedere'', ''caes-'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.7 7.7]. The misconception that Julius Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section dates back at least to the 10th century (''[[Suda]]'' [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;user_list=LIST&amp;page_num=1&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=kappa%2C1199 kappa 1199]). Julius wasn't the first to bear the name, and in his time the procedure was only performed on dead women, while Caesar's mother, [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]], lived long after he was born.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' suggests three [[Etymology of the name of Julius Caesar|alternative explanations]]: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin ''caesaries''); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin ''oculis caesiis''); or that he killed an elephant (''caesai'' in Moorish) in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'': ''Aelius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aelius*.html#2 2].&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favoured this interpretation of his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/dkaplan888/jcae.htm|title=Coins of Julius Caesar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, having produced only three [[Roman consul|consuls]]. Caesar's father, also called [[Gaius Julius Caesar (proconsul of Asia, 90s BC)|Gaius Julius Caesar]], reached the rank of [[praetor]], the second highest of the Republic's elected magistracies, and governed the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], perhaps through the influence of his prominent brother-in-law [[Gaius Marius]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; [[Plutarch]], ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1], ''Marius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]; ''Inscriptiones Italiae'', 13.3.51–52&lt;/ref&gt; 

His mother, [[Aurelia Cotta]], came from an influential family which had produced several consuls. [[Marcus Antonius Gnipho]], an orator and grammarian of [[Gaul]]ish origin, was employed as Caesar's tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives of Eminent Grammarians'' [[s:Lives of Eminent Grammarians#7|7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar had two older sisters, known as [[Julia Major (sister of Caesar)|Julia Major]] and [[Julia Minor (sister of Caesar)|Julia Minor]]. Little else is recorded of Caesar's childhood. [[Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]]'s biographies of him both begin abruptly in Caesar's teens; the opening paragraphs of both appear to be lost.&lt;ref name="plutsuet1"&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Marius-Sulla civil war==
Caesar's formative years were a time of turmoil, and "savage bloodshed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=Caesar Life of a Colossus|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn= 978-0-300-12048-6|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] was fought from 91 to 88&amp;nbsp;BC between Rome and her Italian allies over the issue of [[Roman citizenship]], while [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] threatened Rome's eastern provinces. Domestically, Roman politics was divided between politicians known as ''[[optimates]]'' and ''[[populares]]''. The ''optimates'' tended to be more conservative,&lt;ref name=greenblatt&gt;Greenblatt, Miriam. 2005. Julius Caesar and the Roman Republic. P.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mackay/&gt;&lt;ref name=tempora/&gt; defended the interests of the upper class&lt;ref name=mackay&gt;Mackay, Christopher S. Ancient Rome: a military and political history. P.171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tempora&gt;Shapiro, Susan O. 2005. O tempora! O mores!: Cicero's Catilinarian orations: a student's edition with historical essays. P.129&lt;/ref&gt; and used and promoted the authority of the Senate;&lt;ref name=morstein&gt;Morstein-Marx, Robert. 2004. Mass oratory and political power in the late Roman Republic. P.204-205&lt;/ref&gt; the ''populares'' advocated reform in the interests of the masses&lt;ref name=greenblatt/&gt;&lt;ref name=tempora/&gt; and used and promoted the authority of the Popular Assemblies.&lt;ref name=mackay/&gt;&lt;ref name=morstein/&gt; These were not official political parties, but were instead loose confederations of like-minded individuals who would often switch sides. Caesar's uncle [[Gaius Marius]] was a ''popularis'', Marius' protégé [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] was an ''optimas''&lt;!-- not "optimus", as one would think! --&gt;, and in Caesar's youth their rivalry led to civil war.

Both Marius and Sulla distinguished themselves in the Social War, and both wanted command of the war against Mithridates, which was initially given to Sulla; but when Sulla left the city to take command of his army, a [[tribune]] passed a law transferring the appointment to Marius. Sulla responded by marching his army on Rome (the first time ever this happened and an influence for Caesar in his later career as he contemplated crossing the Rubicon), reclaiming his command and forcing Marius into exile, but when he left on campaign Marius returned at the head of a makeshift army. He and his ally [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] seized the city and declared Sulla a public enemy, and Marius's troops took violent revenge on Sulla's supporters. Marius died early in 86 BC, but his followers remained in power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#34 1.34–75]; Plutarch, ''Marius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#32 32–46], ''Sulla'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html#6 6–10]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#15 2.15–20]; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans5.html 5]; [[Florus]], ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#6|2.6]], [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 85 BC Caesar's father died suddenly while putting on his shoes one morning, without any apparent cause,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]&lt;/ref&gt; and at sixteen, Caesar was the head of the family. The following year he was nominated to be the new ''[[Flamen Dialis]]'', high priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], as [[Lucius Cornelius Merula (consul 87 BC)|Merula]], the previous incumbent, had died in Marius's purges.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#22 2.22]; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the holder of that position not only had to be a patrician but also be married to a patrician, he broke off his engagement to [[Cossutia]], a plebeian girl of wealthy [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family he had been betrothed to since boyhood, and married Cinna's daughter [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, having brought Mithridates to terms, Sulla returned to finish the civil war against Marius' followers. After a campaign throughout Italy he seized Rome at the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]] in November 82&amp;nbsp;BC and had himself appointed to the revived office of [[Roman dictator|dictator]]; but whereas a dictator was traditionally appointed for six months at a time, Sulla's appointment had no term limit. Statues of Marius were destroyed and Marius' body was exhumed and thrown in the Tiber. Cinna was already dead, killed by his own soldiers in a mutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#76 1.76–102]; Plutarch, ''Sulla'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html#24 24–33]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#23 2.23–28]; Eutropius, ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans5.html 5]; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sulla's [[proscription]]s saw hundreds of his political enemies killed or exiled. Caesar, as the nephew of Marius and son-in-law of Cinna, was targeted. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding. The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the [[Vestal Virgins]]. Sulla gave in reluctantly, and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar.&lt;ref name="plutsuet1" /&gt;

==Military service==
[[Image:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|right|Gaius Marius, Caesar's uncle]]
Feeling it much safer to be far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, Caesar quit Rome and joined the army, serving under [[Marcus Minucius Thermus]] in [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 79 BC)|Servilius Isauricus]] in [[Cilicia]]. He served with distinction, winning the [[Civic Crown]] for his part in the siege of [[Mytilene]]. On a mission to [[Bithynia]] to secure the assistance of King [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|Nicomedes']] fleet, he spent so long at his court that rumours of an affair with the king Nicomedes arose.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#2 2–3]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#2 2–3]; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career: the ''Flamen Dialis'' was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'': ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Flamen.html Flamen]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Rome==
In 79 BC, [[Sulla]] resigned his dictatorship, re-established consular government and, after serving as consul in 80 BC, retired to private life.&lt;ref&gt;Appian. ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#103 1.103]&lt;/ref&gt; In a manner that the historian [[Suetonius]] thought arrogant, Julius Caesar would later mock Sulla for resigning the Dictatorship—"Sulla did not know his political ABC's".&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#77 77].&lt;/ref&gt; He died later in 78 BC and was accorded a state funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html#36 36–38]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hearing of Sulla's death, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. Lacking means since his inheritance was confiscated, he acquired a modest house in the [[Subura]], a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome.&lt;ref name="suet46"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#46 46]&lt;/ref&gt; His return coincided with an attempted anti-Sullan coup by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus but Caesar, lacking confidence in Lepidus's leadership, did not participate.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#3 3]; Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#107 1.107]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Instead he turned to legal advocacy. He became known for his exceptional oratory, accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for [[extortion]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. Even [[Cicero]] praised him: "Come now, what orator would you rank above him...?"&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#55 55]&lt;/ref&gt; Aiming at [[rhetoric]]al perfection, Caesar travelled to [[Rhodes]] in 75 BC to study under [[Apollonius Molon]], who had previously taught Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#4 4]. Plutarch (''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#3 3–4]) reports the same events but follows a different chronology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping by pirates==
On the way across the [[Aegean Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Again, according to Suetonius's chronology (''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#4 4]). Plutarch (''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1.8 1.8–2]) says this happened earlier, on his return from Nicomedes's court. Velleius Paterculus (''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41.3 2:41.3–42]) says merely that it happened when he was a young man.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was kidnapped by [[Cilicia]]n [[piracy|pirates]] and held prisoner in the [[Dodecanese]] islet of [[Farmakos|Pharmacusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. While held captive for a period of thirty-eight days he would participate in his captors' games, exercise alongside them, and order them to be silent when they were loud. During this time, Caesar also wrote poems and practiced his public speaking. He read his prose out loud to the pirates, flatly calling them illiterate barbarians if his work wasn't appreciated. The pirates were greatly entertained by his arrogance, which they attributed to the young man's age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notablebiographies.com/Br-Ca/Caesar-Julius.html#b&lt;/ref&gt; When the pirates thought to demand a ransom of twenty [[talent (weight)|talents]] of gold, he insisted they ask for fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Julius Caesar: Conqueror and Dictator |author=Thorne, James |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2003 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 39&lt;/ref&gt;  After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them in [[Pergamon]]. Marcus Junctus, the governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], refused to execute them as Caesar demanded, preferring to sell them as slaves,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; but Caesar returned to the coast and had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivity&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 40&lt;/ref&gt;—a promise the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut.  He then proceeded to Rhodes, but was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] to repel an incursion from Pontus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=Caesar Life of a Colossus|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn= 978-0-300-12048-6|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caesar begins a political career==
[[File:Mithridates VI of Pontus.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mithridates VI of Pontus]].]]
On his return to Rome he was elected military [[tribune]], a first step on the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' of Roman politics. The [[Third Servile War|war]] against [[Spartacus]] took place around this time (73–71 BC), but it is not recorded what role, if any, Caesar played in it.  He was elected [[quaestor]] for 69 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 51&lt;/ref&gt; and during that year he delivered the [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|funeral oration for his aunt Julia]], widow of Marius, and included images of Marius, unseen since the days of Sulla, in the funeral procession. His own wife Cornelia also died that year.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 52&lt;/ref&gt; 

After her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC, Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in [[Hispania]] under Antistius Vetus.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 100&lt;/ref&gt; While there he is said to have encountered a statue of [[Alexander the Great]], and realised with dissatisfaction he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. He requested, and was granted, an early discharge from his duties, and returned to Roman politics. On his return in 67 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 101&lt;/ref&gt; he married [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], a granddaughter of Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#5 5–8]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#5 5]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was curator of the [[Appian Way]] in 66 BC and after taking out massive loans began a reconstruction project of the ancient road. This was a gamble as it placed him in early debt but allowed voters traveling to the city to see the work he had done. He was elected [[aedile]] and restored the trophies of Marius's victories; a controversial move given the Sullan regime was still in place. He also brought prosecutions against men who had benefited from Sulla's proscriptions, and spent a great deal of borrowed money on public works and games, outshining his colleague [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]]. He was also suspected of involvement in two abortive coup attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#9 9–11]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#5.6 5.6–6]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#8 37.8], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==63 BC: Caesar comes to prominence==
===The trial of Gaius Rabirius===
[[File:Giulio-cesare-enhanced 1-800x1450.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Caesar from the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].]]
In 63 a tribune, [[Titus Labienus]], prosecuted the elderly optimate senator [[Gaius Rabirius (senator)|Gaius Rabirius]] for the killing, 37 years previously, of the populist tribune [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]], who had been declared a public enemy by the Senate after a candidate for the consulship had been murdered during an election. Caesar was one of the two judges, and [[Suetonius]] says he had bribed Labienus to bring the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#12 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was the archaic offence of ''[[perduellio]]'', a form of treason, the punishment for which was crucifixion.&lt;ref name=goldsworthy&gt;Adrian Goldsworthy, ''Caesar: The Life of a Colossus'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 122}} Rabirius was defended by [[Quintus Hortensius]], who argued that he had not killed Saturninus, and [[Cicero]], who argued that the killing of Saturninus was lawful as it had been done under the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'', a declaration of a state of emergency which authorised the consuls to do whatever it took to protect the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Rab.+Perd.+1 For Gaius Rabirius]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rabirius was convicted, and exercised his right of appeal to the people. During his appeal, a procedural technicality was contrived - the [[praetor]] [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer (consul)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer]] took down the military flag from the Janiculum hill, indicating foreign invasion - and proceedings were adjourned. The prosecution was never resumed. The purpose of the trial is obscure, but it has been interpreted as a challenge to the use of the ''senatus consultum ultimum''.&lt;ref name=goldsworthy /&gt;{{rp|122}} [[Cassius Dio]] characterises it as a populist attack on the authority of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#26 26–28]&lt;/ref&gt; Labienus would remain an important ally of Caesar over the next decade, and served under him during the Gallic wars.

===Pontifex Maximus===
The same year, Caesar ran for election to the post of [[Pontifex Maximus]], chief priest of the Roman state religion, after the death of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]], who had been appointed to the post by Sulla. He ran against two powerful ''optimates'', the former consuls [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus (Capitolinus)|Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 79 BCE)|Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus]]. There were accusations of bribery by all sides. Caesar is said to have told his mother on the morning of the election that he would return as Pontifex Maximus or not at all, expecting to be forced into exile by the enormous debts he had run up to fund his campaign. He won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing, possibly because the two older men split their votes.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#7 7]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#13 13]&lt;/ref&gt; The post came with an official residence on the [[Via Sacra]].&lt;ref name="suet46" /&gt;

===The conspiracy of Catiline===
When Cicero, who was consul that year, exposed [[Catiline]]'s conspiracy to seize control of the republic, Catulus and others accused Caesar of involvement in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sallust]], ''Catiline War'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#49 49]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar, who had been elected praetor for the following year, took part in the debate in the Senate on how to deal with the conspirators. During the debate, Caesar was passed a note. [[Cato the Younger|Marcus Porcius Cato]], who would become his most implacable political opponent, accused him of corresponding with the conspirators, and demanded that the message be read aloud. Caesar passed him the note, which, embarrassingly, turned out to be a love letter from Cato's half-sister [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]].&lt;ref name="Ciceroetal"&gt;Cicero, ''Against Catiline'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Catil.+4.7 4.7–9]; Sallust, ''Catiline War'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#50 50–55]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#7.5 7.5–8.3], ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#20 20–21], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#22 22–24]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#14 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar argued persuasively against the death penalty for the conspirators, proposing life imprisonment instead, but a speech by Cato proved decisive, and the conspirators were executed.&lt;ref name="Ciceroetal"/&gt; The following year a commission was set up to investigate the conspiracy, and Caesar was again accused of complicity. On Cicero's evidence that he had reported what he knew of the plot voluntarily, however, he was cleared, and one of his accusers, and also one of the commissioners, were sent to prison.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#17 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

==62 BC: Scandal==
===Praetorship===
While praetor in 62 BC, Caesar supported Metellus Nepos, now tribune, in proposing controversial legislation that would recall Pompey and his army in order to quell the rising disorder in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;p173, ''Caesar'', Goldsworthy&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pair were so obstinate in their proposals that they were suspended from office by the Senate. Caesar attempted to continue to perform his duties, only giving way when violence was threatened. The Senate was persuaded to reinstate him after he quelled public demonstrations in his favour.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#16 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bona Dea Scandal===
That year the festival of the [[Bona Dea]] ("good goddess") was held at the ''domus publicus'', Caesar's residence as pontifex maximus. No men were permitted to attend, but a young patrician named [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] managed to gain admittance disguised as a woman, apparently for the purpose of seducing Caesar's wife [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]]. He was caught and prosecuted for sacrilege. Caesar gave no evidence against Clodius at his trial, careful not to offend one of the most powerful patrician families of Rome, and Clodius was acquitted after rampant bribery and intimidation. Nevertheless, Caesar divorced Pompeia, saying that "the wife of Caesar must be above suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/1.12|1.12]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/1.13|1.13]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/1.14|1.14]]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#9 9–10]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#45 37.45]&lt;/ref&gt;

==61 BC: Governorship in Hispania==
After his praetorship, Caesar was appointed to govern [[Hispania Ulterior]] (Outer [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]]), but he was still in considerable debt and needed to satisfy his creditors before he could leave. He turned to [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], one of Rome's richest men. In return for political support in his opposition to the interests of [[Pompey]], Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Hispania he conquered the [[Callaici]] and [[Lusitanians|Lusitani]], being hailed as ''[[imperator]]'' by his troops, reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#11 11–12]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18 18.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==60 BC: Campaign for the Consulship==
By the time Caesar returned to Rome mid-year in 60 BC, the senate had granted him the title of ''imperator'', a title which entitled him to a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. However, he also wanted to stand for [[consul]], the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand ''in absentia'', but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18.2 18.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Denny Bacon.jpg|thumbnail|right|Edward Denny Bacon in around 1900.]]
'''Sir Edward Denny Bacon''', [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] (29 August 1860 –  5 June 1938)&lt;ref name="APS-HoF Bacon"&gt;[http://www.stamps.org/Almanac/alm_HallofFame_1970-74.htm#Bacon Biography] in the [[American Philatelic Society]]'s Hall of Fame.&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[philatelist]] who helped with the enlargement and mounting of collections possessed by rich collectors of his time&lt;ref name="name=TQS p138-140"&gt;Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', pages 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; and became the curator of the [[Royal Philatelic Collection]] between 1913 and 1938.

== Early life ==
Edward Bacon was the son of a London malt producer, and worked in his father's factory until its closure in 1895.

==Philately==
After 1895 he decided to become a full-time philatelist.&lt;ref name="name=TQS p138-140"/&gt; His two main collections were of Japanese stamps (later acquired by [[Philipp von Ferrary]]) and of [[postal stationery]] (later in the ownership of [[Thomas Tapling]]).

He joined the [[Royal Philatelic Society London|Philatelic Society, London]] in 1880, in which he served in all the principal positions.&lt;ref name="name=TQS p138-140"/&gt; He was elected President in 1917.&lt;ref name="WWW-B"&gt;[http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/bpt/whowaswho/whowaswho-b.htm ''Who Was Who?''], British Philatelic Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known to help some British collectors to manage their philatelic possessions. The first one was [[Thomas Keay Tapling]]; when Tapling bequeathed his collection to the British Museum, Bacon mounted the ensemble and wrote its description, a task he undertook for an exhibition in February 1897,&lt;ref&gt;The Tapling exhibition was visited by [[George V of the United Kingdom|George, the then Duke of York]] and [[John Alexander Tilleard]] on 15 February 1895. (Duke of York's diaries quoted in Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', page 138).&lt;/ref&gt; after Tapling's death in 1891.&lt;ref name="name=TQS p138-140"/&gt; After that, he managed Henry J. Duveen's collection, and published in 1911 the catalogue of the [[Crawford Library]].&lt;ref&gt;This library was given to the British Museum by Crawford in his Will: [http://www.stamps.org/Almanac/alm_HallofFame_1941.htm#Lindsay Lindsay's biography] in the [[American Philatelic Society]]'s Hall of Fame.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Bacon was the first President of the [[Philatelic Literature Society]].&lt;ref name=LP&gt;"The Philatelic Literature Society" in ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. XVI, No.191, November 1907, p.264.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon was also a member of the [[Fiscal Philatelic Society]].

==The Royal Philatelic Collection==
A week after [[John Alexander Tilleard]], "Philatelist to the King",&lt;ref&gt;"Philatelist to the King" was Tilleard's official title in 1910 after the Duke of York became King George V.&lt;/ref&gt; died in September 1913, Bacon was invited by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] to be the Curator of the [[Royal Philatelic Collection]].&lt;ref name="name=TQS p138-140"/&gt; He accepted and travelled from his residence in [[Croydon]] to [[Buckingham Palace]] two or three times a week until his death to work on the collection, to buy stamps, to receive items from the post offices in the United Kingdom, and the British Dominions and colonies, and to mount all this in uniform red [[stamp album]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Bacon's account book is kept in the Collection and is very precise. Described in Courney Nicholas (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', page 140, the first purchase was for material to mount an album : five hundred album sheets, [[stamp hinge]]s and chemicals to fix hinges on the sheets.&lt;/ref&gt; while Tilleard had accumulated and mounted only when the King was preparing an exhibition at the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]]. Nevertheless, [[John Wilson (philatelist)|John Wilson]], Keeper of the Collection after Bacon's death, criticised the way Bacon added new hinges without removing old ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, John (1952). ''The Royal Philatelic Collection'', page 56, quoted in Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[deafness]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', page 135&lt;/ref&gt; isolated Bacon from the others members of the Royal Court, he alone succeeded in balancing the collection's budget when the King bought a lot and to mount every project, essay and issued stamp received. During [[World War I]], the session in the Stamp Room placed inside Buckingham Palace diverted the King from matters of state and the war, and made him consider the curator as a friend like Tilleard.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, John (1952). ''The Royal Philatelic Collection'', page 59, quoted in Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', page 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

After George V's death in January 1936, Bacon continued his tasks on a collection that became part of the royal heritage. Even if Kings [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] were less enthusiastic stamp collectors than their father, they made sure that all British and colonial postal authorities continued to send philatelic material to the Curator.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', pages 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt; But Edward VIII ordered that the collection had to be financially self-sufficient, through the sales of duplicate stamps. In July 1936 Bacon was authorised to sell two 500-dollar stamps of the [[Straits Settlements]] featuring King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] for 1,000 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Alexander Hardingue, Private Secretary of the King, 10 July 1936, quoted in Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', page 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 Bacon announced to the King his retirement on the next first of September. [[John Wilson (philatelist)|John Wilson]] was quickly chosen because, as President of the Royal Philatelic Society London and chairman of its Expert Committee, he already knew the collection well.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', pages 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bacon died of influenza in June 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', pages 252.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1904 until his death, he lived in Croydon, commuting to work at Buckingham Palace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5trF1m2m6s

== Titles and awards ==
In 1917 Bacon was made a Member of the [[Royal Victorian Order]], then Commander in 1922 and Knight in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Courtney (2004). ''The Queen's Stamps'', page 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 he received the first [[Lindenberg Medal]]&lt;ref name="APS-HoF Bacon"/&gt; from the [[Berliner Philatelisten-Klub]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamps.org/Almanac/alm_HallofFame_appendix.htm Glossary on the American Philatelic Society's website].&lt;/ref&gt; and was amongst the first to sign the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] with King George V.&lt;ref name="APS-HoF Bacon"/&gt;

The '''Edward VIII postage stamps''' are a [[definitive stamp]] series issued in the [[United Kingdom]] during the 20 January – 11 December 1936 reign of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]].

== The definitive issue ==
The profile portrait chosen was taken by [[Hugh Cecil]]'s studio. The design was suggested by H.J. Brown, an 18-year-old man, and sent in February 1936 to the postal authorities. It inspired [[Harrison and Sons]] printers.&lt;ref&gt;"Great Britain" stamps #457-460, ''2008 Commonwealth &amp; British Empire Stamps 1840-1970'', [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-85259-653-1}}, page GB15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Kirk in ''King Edward VIII'', The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, pages 5 and 6, quoted letters exchanged between Brown's family and the Post Office. H.J. Brown was thanked and told that his project could not be used as such. After the stamps were issued, the father wrote that he was disappointed by the lack of frankness from the Post Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The only graphic decorations on the stamp were the crown, the [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denomination]] in the upper corners, and the word "POSTAGE" at the bottom. Brown's project, the simplest of all submissions, placed the words "POSTAGE" and "REVENUE" on the lateral sides.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced on the cover and page iv of A.J. Kirk in ''King Edward VIII'', The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The Post Office wrote to Mr Brown telling him that his proposed design could not be used. After the stamp came out, clearly using Brown's design, Brown's father issued a statement regretting the Post Office's deceit.

Watermarked with a crown and "E8R", the {{frac|1|2}}d green, the {{frac|1|1|2}}d brown and the {{frac|2|1|2}}d blue stamps were issued on 1 September 1936, and the one penny red on 14 September.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Kirk, ''King Edward VIII'', The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, pages 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; After Edward's abdication there was the usual delay in designing and distributing the stamps of [[George VI]]. Thus the Edward VIII stamps remained on sale for months.  That, and the large numbers saved by the public, have kept their collector value very low.

== Morocco Agencies ==
The four or part of the four stamps were [[overprint]]ed to be used in the [[British post offices in Morocco]]. For [[Tangier]], the name of the town was overprinted alone. "MOROCCO / AGENCIES" was overprinted with a new face value in French [[centime]]s or Spanish [[céntimo]]s depending the zone of the post office.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Kirk, ''King Edward VIII'', The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other stamp projects ==

=== United Kingdom ===
As soon as the beginning of the reign in January 1936, the British Post Office was preparing two other issues in addition to this "accession issue" of four definitive stamps: work was done at the Post Office and at Harrison &amp; Sons were done for a "Coronation issue", previewed for the 12 May 1937, and a final "Definitive issue".&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Kirk, ''King Edward VIII'', The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Essays for the former were made with the King wearing different military uniforms, such as the [[Bertram Park]]'s pictures of Edward VIII wearing [[Seaforth Highlanders|Seaforth Highlander]] and [[Welsh Guards|Welsh Guard]] uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in A.J. Kirk, ''King Edward VIII'', The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1936, the King accepted the idea of larger stamps picturing his effigy and castles. But the abdication stopped all design efforts (despite essays having been made).&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Kirk, ''King Edward VIII'', The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, pages 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
The 2d red stamp project of [[Australia]] used a photograph of the King in uniform. The sole ornaments were the denomination in an oval in the bottom right corner and the red "POSTAGE" bar at the bottom. Printing of this stamp began in September 1936 at the [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]]'s printing branch. All operations were stopped with the abdication.&lt;ref name="TLPh 1367 p202-3"&gt;[[Lord Vestey]] and John Michael, ''Unissued Edward VIII Stamps of Australia (from display to the Society on 11 June 2009'', ''The London Philatelist'' #1367, [[Royal Philatelic Society London]], July–August 2009, pages 202-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the destruction of the stock and all material needed for the printing, a 6 × 2d red stamp signed corner block is in the hands of a British collector. On 29 September 1936, [[William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield]], [[Governor of Victoria]], visited the plant and was invited to sign and date one of the finished sheets. In the name of the Commonwealth Bank, printer [[John Ash (printer)|John Ash]] offered the sheet to the Governor in October, but had to claim it back on 16 December. The sheet was given back the next day, but the six stamp corner block bearing the signature was missing. The Governor had already sent it to someone in England and could not retrieve it.&lt;ref name="TLPh 1367 p202-3"/&gt;

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], the Edward VIII stamp dies and proofs were officially destroyed on 25 and 27 January 1937; some essays were kept in the archives, and the two plaster casts were saved by coin engraver [[Emmanuel Hahn]] and a postal officer.&lt;ref name="TCP 1999"&gt;Paul J. Henry, « The Edward VIII Postage Stamp Essay », ''The Canadian Philatelist / Le Philatéliste canadien'', [[Royal Philatelic Society of Canada]], March–April 1999, pages 56 to 62 ; [http://www.rpsc.org/CP_scans/Canadian%20Philatelist,%20Vol.%2050.%20No.%202,%20March-April,%201999.%20Whole%20No.%20291.pdf pdf file] on the RPSC website, retrieved on 3 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1936, the Canadian Post Office received the photographic profile the new King wanted to be used, and in June it obtained the one received by the Royal Mint. The [[Canadian Banknote Company]] worked on traditional ornemented designs with the two pictures with the help of the [[American Banknote Company]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In October, the Post Office received a plaster cast by British artist [[Hugh Paget]]. Finally, on 1 December 1936, the project was accepted by [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]], the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]]. Two die-proofs were sent to London for the King to approve, but arrived after the abdication and were brought back to Canada.&lt;ref name="TCP 1999"/&gt;

The prepared design was used with a Bertram Park portrait of King George VI; this permitted an issue on 1 April 1937.&lt;ref name="TCP 1999"/&gt;

=== Falkland Islands ===
For the [[Falkland Islands]], George Roberts redrew photographs of the archipelago's fauna, human activities and coat of arms. These illustrations were inscribed inside a rectangular frame bearing two upper corner circles: the right side one for a crown and the left one for the profile of the King, from the same picture as the British issued series.&lt;ref&gt;Photographs of projects signed "G. Roberts", reproduced in Tony Belfield, ''The London Philatelist'' #1367, [[Royal Philatelic Society London]], July–August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the abdication, the projects were reworked by Roberts. Edward VIII's profile in a circle was replaced by a picture of King George VI in an oval, with his military collar still visible. The stamp series was issued on 3 January 1938.&lt;ref&gt;stamps #146 to 163, "Falkland Islands", in ''Commonwealth &amp; British Empire Stamps 1840-1970'', [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2008, page 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perceval-arrives-at-grail-castle-bnf-fr-12577-f18v-1330-detail.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Perceval]] arrives at the Grail Castle to be greeted by the Fisher King in an illustration for a 1330 manuscript of ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'']]

In [[Arthurian legend]], the '''Fisher King''', also known as the '''Wounded King''' or '''Maimed King''', is the last in a long line charged with keeping the [[Holy Grail]]. Versions of the original story vary widely, but he is always wounded in the legs or [[groin]] and incapable of standing. All he is able to do is [[Fishing|fish]] in a small boat on the river near his castle, [[Corbenic]], and wait for some noble who might be able to heal him by asking a certain question. In later versions knights travel from many lands to try to heal the Fisher King, but only the chosen can accomplish the feat. This is [[Percival]] alone in the earlier stories; in later versions, he is joined by [[Galahad]] and [[Bors]]. 

Many later works have two wounded "Grail Kings" who live in the same castle, a father and son (or grandfather and grandson). The more seriously wounded father stays in the castle, sustained by the Grail alone, while the more active son can meet with guests and go fishing. For the purposes of clarity in the remainder of this article, where both appear, the father will be called the Wounded King, the son named the Fisher King. 

In the Fisher King legends, it is implied that he becomes unable to father or support a next generation to carry on after his death (a "thigh" wound has been interpreted by many scholars in Arthurian literature as a genital wound). There are slight hints in the early versions that his kingdom and lands suffers as he does, and 20th-century scholars have suggested his impotence affecting the fertility of the land and reducing it to a barren [[Wasteland (mythology)|wasteland]].

==History of the character==
===Celtic mythology===
The Fisher King appears first in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' in the late 12th century, but the character's roots may lie in [[Celtic mythology]]. He may be derived more or less directly from the figure of [[Brân the Blessed]] in the ''[[Mabinogion]]''. In the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Second Branch]], Bran has a cauldron that can resurrect the dead (albeit imperfectly; those thus revived cannot speak) which he gives to the king of Ireland as a wedding gift for him and Bran's sister [[Branwen]]. Later, Bran wages war on the Irish and is wounded in the foot or leg, and the cauldron is destroyed. He asks his followers to sever his head and take it back to Britain, and his head continues talking and keeps them company on their trip. The group lands on the island of [[Gwales]], where they spend 80 years in a castle of joy and abundance, but finally they leave and bury Bran's head in [[London]]. This story has analogues in two other important [[Welsh language|Welsh]] texts: the Mabinogion tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', in which [[King Arthur]]'s men must travel to Ireland to retrieve a magical cauldron, and the poem ''[[The Spoils of Annwn]]'', which speaks of a similar mystical cauldron sought by Arthur in the otherworldly land of [[Annwn]].

[[File:Myths and legends; the Celtic race (1910) (14596966327).jpg|thumb|The bloodied head on a plate in [[T. W. Rolleston]]'s ''Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race'' (1910) &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;"Peredur had been shown these things to incite him to avenge the wrong, and to prove his fitness for the task."&lt;/small&gt;]]

The [[Welsh Romance]] ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg]]'' is based on Chrétien or derived from a common original, but it contains several prominent deviations and lacks a Grail. The character of the Fisher King appears (though he is not called such) and presents [[Peredur]] with a severed head on a platter. Peredur later learns that he was related to that king, and that the severed head was that of his cousin, whose death he must avenge by defeating the [[Nine sorceresses|Nine Witches]].

===Later medieval works===
The Fisher King is a character in Chrétien's ''Perceval'' (1180)&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, D. S. Brewer, Cambridge 1982, reprinted in paperback 1997 New Edition 2006 {{ISBN|1 84384 102 9}} {{ISBN|978 1 84384 102 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the first of a series of stories and texts on the subject of [[Perceval]] and the Grail. He represents the Pope, or papal authority, which has been compromised by wealth, an aristocratic lifestyle and dependency for support in his office upon those who live by the code of chivalry. Accordingly, he is unable to protect families, women, cultivated land, the built infrastructure and trade from the violence of knights who live by that code and which is characterised as waste. His impotence in the face of chivalry and its endemic evils is represented by the wound in his thighs which has crippled him and confines his activities to fishing with a hook. Later versions of the story, e.g. the Didot ''Perceval'', reject this critique and point to papal succession as the source of papal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, smashwords.com, 2017, {{ISBN|9781310181337}} (epub format only)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Parzival]]'' was written in 1210 by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], forty years after ''Perceval''. Although a different work, it is strikingly similar to ''Perceval''. The story revolves around the Grail Quest and once again the main character is Percival or Parzival. Similarly to ''Perceval'', Eschenbach kept the story line of Parzival not asking the healing question, which results in him Questing for years. Eschenbach's ''Parzival'' differs from Chrétien's ''Perceval'' in three major ways. Firstly, the Fisher King is no longer nameless and is called '''Anfortas'''. Secondly Eschenbach thoroughly describes the nature of the wound. The wound is a punishment for wooing a woman who is not meant for him (every Grail keeper is to marry the woman the Grail determines for him), causing the King immense pain. Then lastly Parzival comes back to cure the Fisher King. ''Parzival'', unlike its predecessor ''Perceval'', has a definite ending.

===Further medieval development===
The Fisher King's next development occurred around the end of the 13th century in [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''Joseph d'Arimathie'', the first work to connect the Grail with [[Jesus]]. Here, the "Rich Fisher" is called '''Bron''', a name similar enough to Bran to suggest a relationship, and he is said to be the brother-in-law of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], who had used the Grail to catch Christ's blood before laying him in the tomb. Joseph founds a religious community that travels eventually to Britain and entrusts the Grail to Bron (who is called the "Rich Fisher" because he catches a fish eaten at the Grail table). Bron founds the line of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.[[File:The castle rocked and rove throughout.jpg|thumb|[[Sir Balin]] stabs Pellam in the "[[Dolorous Stroke]]" in [[Lancelot Speed]]'s illustration for [[James Thomas Knowles (1831–1908)|James Knowles]]' ''The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights'' (1912) &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;"The castle rocked and rove throughout, and all the walls fell crashed and breaking to the earth."&lt;/small&gt;]]

The [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle includes a more elaborate history for the Fisher King. Many in his line are wounded for their failings, and the only two that survive to Arthur's day are the Wounded King, named  '''Pellehan''' ('''Pellam of Listeneise''' in Malory), and the Fisher King, '''Pelles'''. 

Pelles engineers the birth of [[Galahad]] by tricking [[Lancelot]] into bed with his daughter [[Elaine of Corbenic|Elaine]], and it is prophesied that Galahad will achieve the Grail and heal the [[Wasteland (mythology)|Wasteland]]. Galahad, the knight prophesied to achieve the Holy Grail and heal the Maimed King, is conceived when Elaine gets Dame Brisen to use magic to trick Lancelot into thinking that he is coming to visit [[Guenever]]. So Lancelot sleeps with Elaine, thinking her Guenever, but flees when he realizes what he has done. Galahad is raised by his aunt in a convent, and when he is eighteen, comes to King Arthur's court and begins the Grail Quest. Only he, Percival, and Bors are virtuous enough to achieve the Grail and restore Pelles.

In the [[Post-Vulgate]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', the Fisher King's wound was given to him by [[Sir Balin]] in the "[[Dolorous Stroke]]", when Balin grabs a spear and stabs Pellam in self-defense. The spear is the [[Spear of Destiny|Spear of Longinus]], however, and Pellam and his land must suffer for its misuse until the coming of Galahad. The Dolorous Stroke is typically represented as divine vengeance for a sin on the part its recipient. The nature of Pellam's sin is not stated explicitly, though he at least tolerates his murderous brother Garlon, who slays knights while under cover of invisibility, apparently at random. 

King Pelles is the Maimed King is one of a line of Grail keepers established by Joseph of Arimathea, the father of Eliazer and Elaine (the mother of Galahad), and he resides in the castle of [[Corbenic|Corbinec]] in [[Listeneise|Listenois]]. Pelles and his relative Pellehan appear in both the Vulgate (Lancelot-Grail) and Post-Vulgate Cycles, as well as in later works, such as Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' (in which Pellehan is called Pellam). In the Vulgate, Pelles is the son of Pellehan, but the Post-Vulgate is less clear about their relationship. It is even murkier in Malory's work: one passage explicitly identifies them (book XIII, chapter 5), though this is contradicted elsewhere. 

In all, there are characters (some of whom can probably be identified with each other) filling the role of Fisher King or Wounded King in Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur'':

# King Pellam, wounded by Balin, as in the Post-Vulgate. In the Vulgate's (somewhat) clearer Grail lineage, Pelles is the son of Pellehan and is wounded in a separate accident, while in the Post-Vulgate Pelles and Pellehan are brothers. The further step of mistaking them as the same character would be understandable; he makes a similar confusion between the brothers [[Ywain]] and [[Ywain the Bastard]], whom he eventually regards as the same character, though he had initially treated as separate.
# King Pelles, grandfather of Galahad, described as "the maimed king". In one passage, he is explicitly identified with Pellam; in another, however, he is said to have suffered his wound in quite different circumstances.
# King '''Pescheour '''(or '''Petchere'''), lord of the Grail Castle, who never appears on stage (at least under that name). He owes his existence to a mistake by Malory, who took the [[Old French]] ''roy Peschour'' ("Fisher King", a phrase that Malory never otherwise uses) for a name rather than an epithet. Nevertheless, Malory treats him as distinct from Pelles.
# An anonymous, bed-ridden Maimed King, healed by Galahad at the climax of the Grail Quest. He is definitely distinct from Pelles, who has just been sent out of the room, and who is anyway at least mobile.

In addition, there is the figure of King [[Pellinore]], who is Percival's father (in other versions of the legend, Percival is related to the Pelles family). It would appear that Malory intended to have one Maimed King, wounded by Balin and suffering until healed by his grandson Galahad, but never managed to successfully reconcile his sources.

==Themes==

===Fisher King injury===
The injury is a common theme throughout the telling of the Grail Quest. Although some iterations have two kings present, one or both are injured, most commonly in the thigh. The wound is sometimes presented as a punishment, usually for philandering. In ''Parzival'', specifically, the king is injured by the bleeding lance as punishment for taking a wife, which was against the code of the "Grail Guardians".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Arthur (1910). "The Bleeding Lance". PMLA (PMLA) 25 (1): 1–59: 6&lt;/ref&gt; In some early story lines, Percival asking the Fisher King the healing question cures the wound. The nature of the question differs between ''Perceval'' and ''Parzival'', but the central theme is that the Fisher King can be healed only if Percival asks "the question".&lt;ref&gt;Eschenbach, Wolfram von (2013). Parzival. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-78289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the wound is of great importance to the legend. In most medieval stories, the mention of a wound in the groin or more commonly the "thigh" (such as the wounding of the ineffective suitor in [[Lanval]] from the ''[[Lais of Marie de France]]'') is a euphemism for the physical loss of or grave injury to one's penis. In medieval times, acknowledging the actual type of wound was considered to rob a man of his dignity, thus the use of the substitute terms "groin" or "thigh", although any informed medieval listener or reader would have known exactly the real nature of the wound. Such a wound was considered worse than actual death because it signaled the end of a man's ability to function in his primary purpose: to propagate his line. In the instance of the Fisher King, the wound negates his ability to honor his sacred charge.

Throughout Arthurian legend, homoerotic narratives have been found, and there are some strong arguments that they are present in the story of the Fisher King. The Fisher King's wound can be interpreted as effeminate or in fact a "castration".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Anna (2001). "Queer Fisher King: Castration as a Site of Queer Representation ("Percival,Stabat Mater, The City of God"". Arthuriana (Arthuriana) 11 (3): 49–98: 51&lt;/ref&gt; The wound could be a feminizing aspect, especially coupled with the Fisher King's inability to hunt. The treatment for this wound is also repeated contact by male servants (Roberts, 54). Furthermore, in some versions of the story, the only way to alleviate the Fisher King's pain is reinsertion of the spear that causes the wound. In later iterations, Galahad became the focus of the Grail Quest. In Malory's work specifically, the Fisher King is healed by Galahad, who pours the blood from the lance onto the king to heal his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard (2004). The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief. Cambridge: Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the wound is still the same, located between the thighs.

===Christianized form===
Most of the Grail romances do not differ very much from ''Parzival'' and ''Perceval''. That being said, there are two interesting exceptions to this case. The two pieces that hold particularly stronger Christian themed deviations than prior works are ''Queste del Saint Graal'' and ''Sone de Nausay''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"&gt;Stone, Alby (1989). "Bran, Odin, and the Fisher King: Norse Tradition and the Grail Legends." Folklore (Folklore) 100 (1): 25–38: 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Queste del Saint Graal'' is heavily Christianized not only in terms of the tone but also the characters and significant objects. The Grail maidens become angels, there is a constant relationship between the knights and religious symbolism; most importantly, the Fisher King is replicated as a priest-like figure&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt; In the case of ''Sone de Nausay'' by Robert de Boron, Bron (the Fisher King) is part of a tale in which the story makes a constant correlation between the Gospel narrative and the history of the Grail.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard (2004). The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief. Cambridge: Harvard University. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===The bleeding lance===
The bleeding lance has taken numerous forms throughout the Arthurian literature chronology. In the earlier appearances of the lance, it is not represented as a Christian symbol, but morphs into one over time. In ''Perceval'' and ''Parzival'', the lance is described as having "barbaric properties" which are difficult to associate with Christian influence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1910"&gt;Brown, Arthur (1910). "The Bleeding Lance". PMLA (PMLA) 25 (1): 1–59. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Chretien describes his lance with "marvelous destructive powers", which holds a closer connection to the malignant weapons of the Celtic origin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Brown, Arthur (1910). "The Bleeding Lance". PMLA (PMLA) 25 (1): 1–59. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In Chretien's ''Perceval'', the lance takes on a dark and almost evil persona&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and also seems to overshadow the Grail, which if this was a Christian story would be rather odd.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Arthur (1910). "The Bleeding Lance". PMLA (PMLA) 25 (1): 1–59. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram's tale also treated the lance in a similar dark manner. In ''Parzival'', the lance is "poisonous" which contrasts sharply with the general trend of healing Christian themes. This lance is plunged into the Fisher King's wound at different times to continue his pain, for having sought forbidden love.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1910"/&gt; This lance is considered significant because it is most often associated directly with the wound of the Fisher King, which is demonstrated both in Chretien's and Eschenbach's versions of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Arthur (1910). "The Bleeding Lance". PMLA (PMLA) 25 (1): 1–59. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent writings have the lance presented in the Fisher King's castle with Christian theology. More specifically, it is supposed to be the lance that pierced Jesus Christ while on the cross. This is seen in Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. In Malory's version the Fisher King is healed with the blood from the lance, signifying it as a good, holy, Christian object. In ''Corbenic'' we see the precession at the Fisher King's feast, featuring heavily on the Holy Grail, which is a strong Christian artifact. It can be extrapolated that in the same precession, the accompanying lance is the lance that pierced Jesus Christ.

===Sword===
The sword is commonly thought to be a gift from the Fisher King to Perceval. This is then followed by Perceval's cousin's prophecy that the sword will break at a crucial moment. In two cases, the writers tell us that Perceval broke the sword: in Eschenbach, it fails him in his battle against his half-brother at the end of ''Parzival''; and [[Gerbert de Montreuil]] describes how he shatters it on the gates of the "Earthly Paradise".&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard (2004). The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief. Cambridge: Harvard University. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The adventure of the broken sword is a theme originally introduced by Chretien, who intended it as a symbol of Perceval's imperfections as a knight.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard (2004). The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief. Cambridge: Harvard University. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The major example for his imperfection is that Perceval refused to ask about the Grail. This concept of punishment is also seen in Eschenbach's tale where Perceval is told: "your uncle gave you a sword, too, by which you have been granted since your eloquent mouth unfortunately voiced no question there."&lt;ref&gt;Eschenbach, Wolfram von (2013). Parzival. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-78289-0}}.205&lt;/ref&gt; The sword remains as a plot device to both remind Perceval of how he failed to ask the healing question and as a physical reminder of the existence of "Munsalvaesche" (Eschenbach's name for Corbenic).

==Modern versions of the legend==
* The 1922 poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]] is thought to loosely follow the legend of the Fisher King.
* In the 1945 novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the third book of ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'', the philologist [[Elwin Ransom]] is, among other roles, the Fisher King.
* The 1979 novel ''[[The Drawing of the Dark]]'' by Tim Powers has the Fisher King is the driving force behind the major plot.
* The 1981 film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' by [[John Boorman]] largely bases its version of the Grail Quest upon the mythological pattern of the Fisher King tale, with its wounded Arthur wasting away and Percival healing him by discovering the truth of the Grail mystery.
* The 1984 comic series ''[[Mage (comics)|Mage]]: The Hero Discovered'' revolves around Kevin Matchstick a character charged with protecting the mysterious Fisher King as he is the modern Arthur.
* The 1991 film ''[[The Fisher King]]'' by [[Terry Gilliam]] retells the story of trauma and quest in New York City.
* The 2001 book ''Parsifal's Page'' (the fourth book in author [[Gerald Morris]]'s Arthurian series for young adults) is based on the story of Perceval and the Fisher King.
* The 2006 two-episode sequence to end season 1 and start season 2 of the television series ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' features an antagonist who calls himself the Fisher King.
* The 2015 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Before the Flood (Doctor Who)|Before the Flood]]" features a villain called the Fisher King, a supposedly dead alien warlord who is waiting for his people to come and save him.
* A character called the Fisher King can be found in ''[[The Witcher]]'' books and video games. He appears as the lover of the Lady of the Lake, who bequeaths a powerful sword to the title character.

'''Francis Lightfoot Lee''' (October 14, 1734 – January 11, 1797) was a member of the [[House of Burgesses]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]]. As an active protester regarding issues such as the [[Stamp Act]], Lee helped move the colony in the direction of independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. Lee was a delegate to the Virginia Conventions and the [[Continental Congress#First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]]. He was a signer of the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as a representative of [[Virginia]].

==Family, education and early life==
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Lee Family.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Francis Lightfoot Lee]]
Francis Lee was born October 14, 1734 at a Lee family home at Machadoc, later known as Burnt House Field, in Hague, Westmoreland County, Virginia. He grew up at Stratford Hall, which his father completed in 1738. He was educated at home, where Lee pursued classical studies under Dr. Craig. He was of English descent, and was born into one of the [[First Families of Virginia]]. Lee was the fourth son of [[Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)|Thomas Lee]]  and Hannah Harrison Ludwell (of the nearby Greenspring Plantation).

In 1772, Francis married his cousin, Rebecca Plater Tayloe.  They were 2nd cousins, once removed.

Lee lived his entire life in the region of Virginia between the [[Rappahannock River]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] (known as the [[Northern Neck]]).

==Government service==
In 1774, Lee was among those who called for a general congress and [[First Virginia Convention|the first of the Virginia Conventions]], which he attended. He served in the [[Virginia State Senate]] from 1778 to 1782, and was a delegate to the first Continental Congress held in [[Philadelphia]], serving until 1779. As a congressional representative of Virginia, he signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation.

==Death==
Lee died of [[pleurisy]] at his residence (named "[[Menokin]]") in [[Richmond County, Virginia]], on January 11, 1797, following his wife's death four days prior. He is buried in the Tayloe family burial ground at [[Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia|Mount Airy Plantation]], near [[Warsaw, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|2809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations==
Lee was the grandson of Col. [[Richard Lee II]] and a great-grandson of Col. [[Richard Lee I]]. Senator [[Richard Henry Lee]] and diplomats [[William Lee (diplomat)|William Lee]] and [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Dr. Arthur Lee]] were his brothers. Another brother, [[Thomas Ludwell Lee]], was appointed to a committee, along with [[Thomas Jefferson]], to re-write the laws of Virginia.  Francis Lightfoot Lee had no children; his namesake Francis Lightfoot Lee II was the son of his brother [[Richard Henry Lee]], and further men of the same name descend from him.

'''George Albert Wells''' (22 May 1926&amp;ndash;23 January 2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/tributes/wells George Albert Wells, Emeritus Professor 22 May 1926-23 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/06/george-wells-obituary?utm_ George Wells obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;), usually known as '''G. A. Wells''', was a  Professor of German at [[Birkbeck, University of London]]. After writing books about famous European intellectuals, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Franz Grillparzer]], he turned to the study of the [[historicity of Jesus]], starting with his book ''The Jesus of the Early Christians'' in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"An Interview with Prof. Wells - Jesus: There Was No Such Person", ''Freethought Today'', April–May 1985&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as an advocate of the thesis that Jesus is essentially a [[Christ myth theory|mythical]] rather than a historical figure, a theory that was pioneered by German biblical scholars such as [[Bruno Bauer]] and [[Arthur Drews]].

Since the late 1990s, Wells said that the hypothetical [[Q document]], which is proposed as a source used in some of the [[gospels]], may "contain a core of reminiscences" of an itinerant [[Galilean]] miracle-worker/[[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]-sage type preacher.&lt;ref name=earliest&gt;{{cite journal |first=G.

Price]] on the information about Jesus being "all mythical".&lt;ref name=WellsTrust49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells (2003) {{ISBN|0812695674}} pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; Wells believes that the Jesus of the gospels is obtained by attributing the supernatural traits of the Pauline epistles to the human preacher of Q.&lt;ref&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells (2003) {{ISBN|0812695674}} p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells was Chairman of the [[Rationalist Press Association]]. He was married and lived in [[St. Albans]], near London. He studied at the [[University of London]] and [[Bern]], and holds degrees in [[German language|German]], [[philosophy]], and [[natural science]]. He taught German at London University from 1949, and was Professor of German at Birkbeck College from 1968.

==Work on early Christianity==
Wells's fundamental observation is to suggest that the earliest extant Christian documents from the first century,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://infidels.org/library/modern/g_a_wells/earliest.html|title=Earliest Christianity|author1=G.A.

Rather, the early Christian epistles present him "as a basically supernatural personage only obscurely on Earth as a man at some unspecified period in the past".&lt;ref name=earliest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M.

September 1999, pp. 13-18.] I have argued that there is good reason to believe that the Jesus of Paul was constructed largely from musing and reflecting on a supernatural 'Wisdom' figure, amply documented in the earlier Jewish literature, who sought an abode on Earth, but was there rejected, rather than from information concerning a recently deceased historical individual. The influence of the Wisdom literature is undeniable; only assessment of what it amounted to still divides opinion. ...The Jewish literature describes Wisdom as God's chief agent, a member of his divine council, etc., and this implies supernatural, but not, I agree, divine status.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early trilogy (1971, 1975, 1982), Wells argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of a Jewish Wisdom figure—the Jesus of the early epistles—who lived in some past, unspecified time period. And also on the views of New Testament scholars who acknowledge that the gospels are sources written decades after Jesus's death by people who had no personal knowledge of him. In addition, Wells wrote, the texts are exclusively Christian and theologically motivated, and therefore a rational person should believe the gospels only if they are independently confirmed.&lt;ref name="Martin.1993.p38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Michael|title=The Case Against Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWkC4dTmK0AC&amp;pg=PA38|date=March 1993|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-081-1|page=38|quote=[Per the canonical Gospels] According to Wells they [Christian theologians and biblical scholars] also admit that there is much in these accounts that is legend and that the Gospel stories are shaped by the writers' theological motives. Furthermore, the evidence provided by the Gospels is exclusively Christian. Given this situation, Wells says, a rational person should believe the accounts of the Gospels only if they are independently confirmed. [...] He points out that it is acknowledged by all biblical scholars that the earliest Christian writers—Paul and other epistle writers—wrote before the Gospels were composed. ...Wells maintains that they do not provide any support for the thesis that he [Jesus] lived early in the first century. Thus, those Pauline letters now admitted to be genuine by most scholars, and those letters that are considered probably or possibly authentic, are silent about the parents of Jesus, the place of his birth, his trial before Pilate, the place of his crucifixion, and his ethical teachings.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells clarified his position in ''The Jesus Legend'', that "Paul sincerely believed that the evidence (not restricted to the Wisdom literature) pointed to a historical Jesus who had lived well before his own day; and I leave open the question as to whether such a person had in fact existed and lived the obscure life that Paul supposed of him. (There is no means of deciding this issue.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=George|title=The Jesus Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmhtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=1 December 2013|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8126-9872-5|page=19|quote=Paul sincerely believed that the evidence (not restricted to the Wisdom literature) pointed to a historical Jesus who had lived well before his own day; and I leave open the question as to whether such a person had in fact existed and lived the obscure life that Paul supposed of him.

In his later trilogy from the mid-1990s, ''The Jesus Legend'' (1996), ''The Jesus Myth'' (1999), and Can We Trust the New Testament? (2004). Wells modified and expanded his initial thesis to include a historical Galilean preacher from the [[Q source]]:&lt;ref name="Wells.Jesus.Down.Size" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wells.Reply.Holding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=George Albert Wells|first1=G. A.|authorlink1=George Albert Wells|title=A Reply to J.P. Holding...|url=https://infidels.org/library/modern/g_a_wells/holding.html|website=infidels.org|accessdate=24 April 2017|language=en|date=2000|quote=[Per the gospels, the historical Galilean preacher of Q is placed in a historical context consonant with the date of the Galilean preaching.] Now that I have allowed this in my two most recent relevant books [1996, 1999] ...it will not do to dub me a "mythicist" tout court. Moreover, my revised standpoint obviates the criticism ...which J. D. G Dunn levelled at me in 1985.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I propose here that the disparity between the early [New Testament] documents&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the [later] gospels is explicable if the Jesus of the former is not the same person as the Jesus of the latter. Some elements in the ministry of the gospel Jesus are arguably traceable to the activity of a Galilean preacher of the early first century, who figures in what is known as Q (an abbreviation for ''Quelle'', German for ‘source’). Q supplied the gospels of Matthew and Luke with much of their material concerning Jesus’s Galilean preaching. [...] In my first books on Jesus, I argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of the Jesus of the early epistles. The summary of the argument of the ''Jesus Legend'' (1996) and the ''Jesus Myth'' (1999) given in this section of the present work makes it clear that I no longer maintain this position. The weakness of my earlier position was pressed upon me by J.D.G. Dunn, who objected that we really cannot plausibly assume that such a complex of traditions as we have in the gospels and their sources could have developed within such a short time from the early epistles without a historical basis (Dunn, [''The Evidence for Jesus''] 1985, p. 29). My present standpoint is: this complex is not all post-Pauline [there is also a historical Galilean preacher from the Q source] (Q, or at any rate parts of it, may well be as early as ca. A.D. 50); and if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical. The essential point, as I see it, is that the Q material, whether or not it suffices as evidence of Jesus's historicity, refers to a [human] personage who is not to be identified with the [mythical] dying and rising Christ of the early epistles." (''Can We Trust the NT?'', 2004, pp. 43, 49–50).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wells later allowed for the possibility that the central figure of the gospel stories may be based on a historical character from first-century [[Galilee]]: "[T]he Galilean and the Cynic elements ... may contain a core of reminiscences of an itinerant Cynic-type Galilean preacher (who, however, is certainly not to be identified with the Jesus of the earliest Christian documents)."&lt;ref name=earliest/&gt; Sayings and memories of this preacher may have been preserved in the "Q" document that is hypothesized as the source of many "sayings" of Jesus found in both gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. However, Wells concluded that the reconstruction of this historical figure from the extant literature would be a hopeless task.&lt;blockquote&gt;What we have in the gospels is surely a fusion of two originally quite independent streams of tradition, ...the Galilean preacher of the early first century who had met with rejection, and the supernatural personage of the early epistles, [the Jesus of Paul] who sojourned briefly on Earth and then, rejected, returned to heaven—have been condensed into one. The [human] preacher has been given a [mythical] salvific death and resurrection, and these have been set not in an unspecified past (as in the early epistles) but in a historical context consonant with the Galilean preaching. The fusion of the two figures will have been facilitated by the fact that both owe quite a lot of their substance in the documents—to ideas very important in the Jewish Wisdom literature. (''Cutting Jesus Down to Size'', 2009, p. 16)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The updated position taken by Wells was interpreted by other scholars as an "about-face", abandoning his initial thesis in favor of accepting the existence of a historical Jesus.&lt;ref name="Voorst.2003.p660"&gt;{{cite book|last=Voorst|first=Robert Van|authorlink=Robert E.

Wells believes that it is early and reliable enough to show that Jesus probably did exist, although this Jesus was not the Christ that the later canonical Gospels portray.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wells insisted that this figure of late first-century gospel stories is distinct from the sacrificial Christ myth of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's epistles]] and other early Christian documents, and that these two figures have different sources before being fused in Mark, writing, "if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical." Wells notes that he belongs in the category of those who argue that Jesus did exist, but that reports about Jesus are so unreliable that we can know little or nothing about him.&lt;ref&gt;For a more brief statement of his position, Wells refers readers to his article, "Jesus, Historicity of" in Tom Flynn's ''The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief''.

Eddy and Boyd are particularly concerned to refute the standpoint of those in category 1 of these 3, and classify me as one of them [i.e. category 1], as “the leading contemporary Christ myth theorist” (p. 168n). In fact, however, I have expressly stated in my books of 1996, 1999, and 2004 that I have repudiated this theory, ...I have never espoused this view, not even in my pre-1996 Jesus books, where I did deny Jesus’s historicity.

This is the position I have argued in my books of 1996, 1999, and 2004, although the titles of the first two of these—''The Jesus Legend'' and ''The Jesus Myth''—may mislead potential readers into supposing that I still denied the historicity of the gospel Jesus.

E. Witt, reviewing ''The Jesus of the Early Christians'' in the ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', offered some criticisms but concluded that "Hellenists should welcome the appearance of this challenging book."&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Witt, "Reviewed Work: 'The Jesus of the Early Christians' by G. A. Wells" The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 92 (1972), pp. 223-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Wells' conclusions have been criticized by biblical scholars and ecclesiastical historians such as [[William Hugh Clifford Frend|W. H. C. Frend]] and [[Robert E. Van Voorst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. H. C. |last=Frend |title=Review of 'The Jesus of the Early Christians.' by G. A.

He has written several books rejecting the historicity of Jesus, a position almost no New Testament scholar endorses, even those who are radically opposed to Christianity." &lt;ref&gt;David Aikman, The Delusion of Disbelief (Nashville: Tyndale House Publishers, 2008), 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wells featured in the controversial Channel 4 television series about the historicity of Jesus, ''Jesus: The Evidence'' (LWT: 1984).

After reviewing criticisms from several authors, atheist philosopher [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] said that although "Wells's thesis is controversial and not widely accepted," his "argument against the historicity of Jesus is sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Martin |authorlink=Michael Martin (philosopher) |title=The Case Against Christianity |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |isbn=0-87722-767-5 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Ehrman]], in his ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)]]'' (2012) stated: "The best-known mythicist of modern times — at least among the NT scholars who know of any mythicists at all — is George A. Wells...He has written many books and articles advocating a mythicist position, none more incisive than his 1975 book, ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Wells)|Did Jesus Exist?]]''. Wells is certainly one who does the hard legwork to make his case: Although an outsider to NT studies, he speaks the lingo of the field and has read deeply in its scholarship. Although most NT scholars will not (or do not) consider his work either convincing or particularly well argued." (p.&amp;nbsp;19).  Wells provided an answer to these points in an article in ''[[Free Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G.A.

'''Grace Dalrymple Elliott'''&amp;nbsp;(c. 1754–16 May 1823) was a&amp;nbsp;[[Scotland|Scottish]]&amp;nbsp;courtesan, writer and spy who resided in Paris at the time of the&amp;nbsp;[[French Revolution]]. Elliott was an eyewitness to events which she detailed in her memoirs, ''Journal of my life during the French Revolution'' (''Ma vie sous La Révolution'') published posthumously in 1859.&lt;ref name=Manning&gt;{{harv|Manning|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=majormurden&gt;{{harv|Major|Murden|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the mistress of the&amp;nbsp;[[Louis Philip II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], and the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], by whom she is said to have borne an illegitimate daughter. Elliott trafficked correspondence and hid French aristocrats escaping from the French Revolution. She was arrested several times but managed to avoid the [[guillotine]], and was released after the death of&amp;nbsp;[[Robespierre]].

==Early life==
Elliott was born probably in Edinburgh about 1754, the youngest daughter of Grisel Craw (''d''. ''c''.1765) and [[Hew Dalrymple (advocate)|Hew Dalrymple]] (d.1774), an [[Edinburgh]] [[advocate]] concerned in the great [[Douglas case]]. Her parents separated around the time of her birth, and she was most likely brought up at her grandparents house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Elliott [Eliot; née Dalrymple], Grace [nicknamed Dally the Tall] (1754?–1823), courtesan and writer|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8675|work=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/8675|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was educated in a French convent, and on her return to Scotland, was introduced by her father into Edinburgh society. Her beauty made such an impression on [[John Elliot (physician)|John Elliott]], a prominent and wealthy physician, that he made her an offer of marriage in 1771. She accepted, although Elliott was some 20 years her senior. They were married on 19 October 1771 in London. The couple entered fashionable society, but eventually grew apart due to their difference in age and interests.&lt;ref name=majormurden/&gt; In 1774 Elliott met and fell in love with [[Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Mountnorris|Lord Valentia]], with whom she entered into an affair. Convinced of his wife's infidelity, John Elliott had the couple followed and eventually sued Valentia for [[criminal conversation]] (adultery). He received £12,000 in damages before successfully obtaining a divorce.

With her social reputation destroyed, Elliott became recognised as a member of the [[demimonde]] and forced to earn her living as a professional mistress or [[courtesan]]. She was then taken by her brother to a French convent, but she seems to have been brought back almost immediately by [[George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley|Lord Cholmondeley]], who became her lover and remained one of her principal protectors throughout her life.

==Life in England==
Having met Lord Cholmondeley at the [[Pantheon, Paris|Pantheon]] in 1776, she began a liaison with him that lasted for three years. [[Thomas Gainsborough]] painted a portrait of her in 1778, which is in the [[Frick Collection]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. In 1782, she had a short, concealed intrigue with the [[Prince of Wales]] (afterwards [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]) and gave birth to a daughter on 30 March 1782, who was baptised at St Marylebone as Georgiana Augusta Frederica Seymour (d. 1813) but used the name Georgina Seymour.

Elliott declared that the Prince was the father of her child and ''[[The Morning Post]]'' stated in January 1782 that he admitted responsibility. However, the child was dark in complexion, and when she was first shown to the Prince, he is said to have remarked, "To convince me that this is my girl they must first prove that black is white."{{citation required|date=May 2018}}

The Prince and many others regarded Lord Cholmondeley as the father of the girl, although the Prince's friends said that [[Charles William Wyndham]] (brother of Lord Egremont), whom she was thought to resemble, claimed paternity. Yet others thought she might have been fathered by [[George Augustus Selwyn (politician)|George Selwyn]]. Lord Cholmondeley brought up the girl, and after her early death in 1813, looked after her only child.

== Life in France. French Revolution ==
[[File:Gainsborough - Grace Dalrymple Elliott.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Grace Elliott (1754?–1823). Portrait by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], 1778. (In the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bpor/ho_20.155.1.htm|title=Mrs Grace Dalrymple Elliott|publisher=Metropolitan Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
George, Prince of Wales, introduced her to the French&amp;nbsp;[[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orleans]]&amp;nbsp;in 1784 and by 1786, she had permanently set up residence in Paris and become one of Orleans' recognised mistresses. In exchange for her companionship, the Duke granted her a home on the Rue Miromesnil and a property in [[Meudon]], to the south of Paris. During this period Elliott also pursued liaisons with the [[Charles de Fitz-James|Duke de Fitz-James]] and the [[Princes of Condé|Prince of Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Elizabeth Sarah Villa-Real Gooch, Mrs |year=1792 |title=The life of Mrs. Gooch |publisher=London, The authoress |oclc=5398468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of what is known about Elliot's life in France is recorded in her memoirs, ''Journal of my life during the French Revolution.'' Although there are a number of inconsistencies in her account, her work has become one of the best-known English-language accounts of [[French Revolution|The Terror]], documenting the movements of the Duke of Orleans and those within his aristocratic [[Jacobin]] circle at the [[Palais-Royal]]. During her life in Paris, Elliott witnessed the horror of the [[September Massacres]] and the body of the [[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy|Princess de Lamballe]] carried through the streets. Although Elliott was an associate of the Duke of Orleans (who later took the name Philippe Égalité) her royalist sympathies soon became widely known throughout her district, and her home was frequently searched during the programme of domiciliary visits. It has been recently shown that Elliott was trafficking correspondence on behalf of the British government and assisting in the transportation of messages between Paris and members of the exiled French court in [[Koblenz|Coblenz]] and in Belgium.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;&lt;ref name=majormurden/&gt;

On several occasions, Elliott risked her life to assist and hide aristocrats who were being pursued by the Revolutionary government. Shortly after the [[Tuileries Palace|Assault on the Tuileries Palace]], on 10 August 1792, Elliott hid the injured [[Marquis de Champcenetz|Marquis de Champcentz]] by physically carrying him to her house on the Rue Miromesnil, at great risk. During a search of her home, she placed him between the mattresses of her bed and feigned illness. On another occasion, Elliott agreed to take in and hide Madame de Perigord and her two children at her home in Meudon, who were attempting to flee to England. Elliott was instrumental in arranging false travel documents for those wishing to escape the Revolution and after hiding Champcentz in the attic of her home in Meudon, she was able to orchestrate his passage out of France. In the spring of 1793 Elliott was arrested and imprisoned and spent the rest of the Terror incarcerated at several prisons, including the [[Recollects|Recollets]] and the Carmes, where she claims to have met [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], though this assertion has been questioned by historians. Elliott details her harrowing experiences in prison, the violent coercion she experienced, as well as the illness and deprivation endured by her fellow prisoners.

==Later life==
Although many of her friends met their deaths, including [[Madame du Barry]], Elliott did not. She narrowly avoided death and was released after the [[Reign of Terror]] came to an end, not before she had been confined in total to four different prisons by the republican government. In later years, there were rumours that she had an attachment with [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], but had rejected his offer of marriage. She died a wealthy woman at [[Ville d'Avray]], in present-day [[Hauts-de-Seine]], in May 1823, while a lodger with the commune's mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manning|2005|pp=349–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manning|2005|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions in film and literature==
A dramatic portrayal of part of her life is contained in the 2001 film ''[[The Lady and the Duke]]''. English actress [[Lucy Russell (actress)|Lucy Russell]] played Elliott and [[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] played the Duke of Orleans.

Grace Elliott also appears as a major character in [[Hallie Rubenhold]]'s novel ''The French Lesson'' (Doubleday, 2016).

[[File:Hamilton-Clarke.jpg|thumb|right|Hamilton Clarke]]
'''James Hamilton Siree Clarke''' (25 January 1840 – 9 July 1912), better known as '''Hamilton Clarke''', was an English conductor, composer and organist.  Although Clarke was a prolific composer, he is best remembered as an associate of [[Arthur Sullivan]], for whom he arranged music and compiled overtures for some of the [[Savoy Operas]], including Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Mikado]]''.

Clarke began as an organist, pianist and theatre conductor, becoming a musical director for [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], among others.  While conducting at London theatres, he also composed a tremendous volume of church music, organ solos, songs, operettas and orchestral works.  Beginning in the late 1870s, he composed [[incidental music]] as musical director for many of [[Henry Irving]]'s spectacular productions at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].  He also composed music for many of the [[German Reed Entertainments]] and conducted at many other London theatres in the 1870s and 1880s.  Clark published a ''Manual of Orchestration'' and music criticism, as well as some fiction.  In 1889, he took charge of the Victorian National Orchestra in Australia, returning to England in 1892 and soon becoming conductor of the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] for several years.

==Biography==
Clarke was born in [[Birmingham]], the son of an amateur organist.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;"Death of Mr. Hamilton Clarke", ''The Musical Herald,''  1 August 1912, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing the piano at age four, and by six had improvised a tune that he reused in one of his mature works forty years later.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; He took up the violin when he was eight and played in an orchestra at twelve.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; In the same year, he became the organist at his church and was composing music by age 19.&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;Moratti, Mel. [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~melbear/downunder/yeomenreview1.htm Clarke's profile from ''Argus'', 20 May 1889], reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Australia site&lt;/ref&gt; His parents did not approve of his taking music up as a profession, and he was sent to work first with an analytical chemist and then with a land surveyor.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; According to ''[[The Musical Times]]'', he did not take up music as a profession until he was in his twenties.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;''[[The Musical Times]]'', 1 August 1912, p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 he was awarded the first prize for anthems by the College of Organists.&lt;ref name=Australia/&gt;

===Early career===
Clarke held posts as organist in Ireland&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Mackerness, E. D. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/05869 "Clarke, Hamilton",] ''Grove Music Online'', accessed 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and was conductor of the [[Belfast]] Anacreontic Society.&lt;ref name=Australia/&gt; From 1866 he was organist at [[Queen's College, Oxford]], where he also conducted the Queen's College Musical Society.&lt;ref name=Who&gt;Stone, David. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/ClarkeHamilton.htm "Hamilton Clarke",] ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 15 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; After travelling for several years, he returned to London in 1871 and became the organist of Kensington Parish Church, London, and in 1872 he succeeded [[Arthur Sullivan]] as organist of St. Peter's, [[South Kensington]].&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; He left that post soon, however, to become a theatrical conductor.

[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Richard D'Oyly Carte engaged Clarke as conductor in 1874]]
Clarke was [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s musical director and conductor at the [[Opera Comique]] in 1874 for ''The Broken Branch'' adapted from ''La Branche Cassée''.&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements", ''Le Follet: Journal du Grand Monde, Fashion, Polite Literature, Beaux Arts &amp;c. &amp;c.'', 1 September 1874&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke interpolated into the [[operetta]] a ballet of his own composition, "Les Prètresses de l'Amour".&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Drama", ''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'', 26 September 1874&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1875, Sullivan hired Clarke as a replacement musical director of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' at the [[Royalty Theatre]], London, when Charles Morton succeeded Carte as general manager of the opera's original production.  Clarke then moved with the production to the Opera Comique in January 1876, where it ran until May.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; In 1876 Clarke was reported to be suffering from "a long and painful illness", and Carte organised a benefit concert for him at the Langham Hall.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 9 July 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; By December of that year, Clarke was working again, adapting the score and providing new choruses and ballet music for the first English performances of ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 10 December 1876&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer of ''[[The Observer]]'' found [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss's]] music "thin and commonplace" and thought Clarke's additional music much superior: "in remarkable contrast to that with which it is associated, being full of bright, characteristic melody, well harmonised and enriched by masterly orchestration."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 December 1876, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, Clarke participated in a very early experiment with [[telephone|telephony]], with his organ playing being sent a distance of four miles down a wire.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 15 July 1877, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke performed on the piano as an accompanist at the [[The Proms|promenade concerts]] at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] that year,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 22 September 1873, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1878, encouraged by Sullivan, who was then in charge of the concerts, he conducted a major orchestral work of his own, a symphony in F major. ''[[The Times]]'' reported this concert thus:
{{quote|Amateurs know that Mr Clarke is a composer of more than ordinary promise, and were, therefore, not surprised to hear a work of more than ordinary merit. The Symphony is in four movements, the first of which, ''[[tempo|allegro]] molto appassionato'', constructed mainly upon two themes, combined and worked out with great ingenuity, fully bears out its title. The second movement, a ''[[larghetto]]'', in the key of the [[subdominant]], is of a more tranquil character, though diversified by episodes, and especially one, given out by the [[violoncello]]s, effectively contrasting with the leading subject. The third, ''molto [[grazioso]]'', is a [[minuet]], so graceful and tuneful that a more fitting designation could hardly be applied to it. It has also a most engaging ''alternativo'' equally noticeable. The ''finale'', preceded by a kind of recitative, most effective in its place, is an ''allegro molto'', full of vigour, instrumented for the orchestra with all varieties of combination and contrast, while preserving consistency throughout. The whole terminates effectively with a reference to the opening phrase of the ''allegro appassionato.'' The symphony was capitally played under the direction of its composer, to whom Mr Sullivan, who deserves much credit for having produced it, courteously yielded the baton.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 August 1878, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Theatre work===
Clarke conducted at ten or more London theatres,&lt;ref&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/scowcroft/Composerconductors6.htm "Some British Conductor-Composers, Part 6 (conclusion)"], MusicWeb, February 1994&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], where he composed music for a number of [[Henry Irving]]'s productions, including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; Irving's co-star, [[Ellen Terry]], wrote in her memoir, ''The Story of My Life'', "No one was cleverer than Hamilton Clarke, Henry's first musical director, and a most gifted composer, at carrying out [Irving's] instructions.  Hamilton Clarke often grew angry and flung out of the theatre, saying that it was quite impossible to do what Mr. Irving wanted. 'Patch it together, indeed!' he used to say to me indignantly....  'Mr. Irving knows nothing about music, or he couldn't ask me to do such a thing.' But the next day he would return with the score altered on the lines suggested by Henry, and would confess that the music was improved. 'Upon my soul, it's better! The 'Guv'nor' was perfectly right.'"&lt;ref name=Lyceum&gt;Marshall, Christabel.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=FlT3nE2bB2IC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Hamilton+Clarke%22+composer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_CO6hz9lJC&amp;sig=NxcOdz-n2iynbEkJ6H0WiTbFv1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA121,M1 reprinted in ''Ellen Terry's Memoirs''], pp. 121–22&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the many composers recruited to write [[German Reed Entertainments]] at [[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodbridge Wilson, Fredric.

Malcolm Watson) in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 20 October 1885, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews both for Clarke's music and the performances of [[Corney Grain]] and the rest of the company were excellent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 22 February 1880 p. 3; 5 June 1881 and 11 June 1882, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Clarke's friend and associate, [[Arthur Sullivan]]]]
Clarke was a close associate of Arthur Sullivan.  In 1878, at Sullivan's instance, he was engaged by Carte as musical director of his touring Comedy-Opera Company from March to November 1878, while the Company presented a revival of ''Trial'', the first provincial production of ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', and, from September 1878, the first provincial production of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; He assisted Sullivan by arranging musical selections from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' for the promenade concerts at Covent Garden in 1878 that stimulated audience interest in that opera.  Sullivan described Clarke's arrangement as "most spirited" and conducted it at several of the promenade concerts in late August.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke also made an arrangement from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' for the promenade concerts in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 September 1880, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke later arranged the overtures for [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s operas ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (for its 1884 revival), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885) and ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887).  He also assisted in the piano arrangement of Sullivan's 1886 [[cantata]], ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'' and helped prepare the score for printing.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan biographer Gervase Hughes later strongly criticised Clarke's work, finding the ''Mikado'' overture carelessly constructed and his ''Ruddigore'' overture a "jumble" and "a crude selection, hardly redeemed by its spirited ending". Hughes also criticised Clarke's overture to ''The Sorcerer'', though misattributing it to [[Alfred Cellier]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan considered rewriting the ''Mikado'' overture&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mikswo.htm "The Sadler's Wells Mikado (1962),"] ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography''&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought to have sketched out a new overture on more symphonic lines, but no trace of it survives.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 136–38&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke's ''Ruddigore'' overture was dropped by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] in 1919 in favour of a wholly rewritten overture by [[Geoffrey Toye]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 October 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 Clarke provided the music for [[Alfred Tennyson|Lord Tennyson's]] play ''The Promise of May'', which was "a miserable fiasco", though Clarke's music was praised.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 12 November 1882, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to the music of the successful 1885 [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]''.  In 1887, he accepted the post of musical director at the [[Comedy Theatre]] under the management of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 April 1887, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications and compositions===
[[File:Hornpipe-harry.jpg|right|thumb|300px|1898 production of Clarke's operetta for boys, ''Hornpipe Harry'']]
Clarke composed over 600 musical works, of which some 400 were published.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; His second symphony, in G minor, premiered in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 7 September 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and he composed the music for some half dozen ballets and at least eleven operas.&lt;ref name=Australia/&gt; Compositions by Clarke mentioned over the years in ''The Musical Times'' showed the breadth of his interests, from part-songs, to organ works, to comedy: "Love and Gold": Four-Part Song;&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 40, No. 671 (1 January 1899)&lt;/ref&gt; "Original Compositions for the Organ": No. 110;&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 30, No. 553 (1 March 1889), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in B Flat'';&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 18, No. 414 (1 August 1877), p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; "Sonatina for the Pianoforte";&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 18, No. 413 (1 July 1877), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; "God so Loved the World";&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 15, No. 353 (1 July 1872), p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; "To the Audience'': Humorous Four-Part Song;&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 34, No. 599 (1 January 1893), pp. 29–35&lt;/ref&gt; "They That Go down to the Sea in Ships";&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 43, No. 709 (1 March 1902), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Romance for Violin and Pianoforte;&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 38, No. 658 (1 December 1897), p. 824&lt;/ref&gt; and "To a Red Rose".&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', Vol. 42, No. 706 (1 December 1901), p. 818&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Clarke published ''The Daisy-Chain'' (Op. 352), an operetta for children in two acts, for which he wrote both words and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=161964&amp;set_entry=000003&amp;format=999 British Library catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote both the libretto and the score for ''Hornpipe Harry'', in 1897, a well-reviewed show depicting the adventures of sailors cast ashore on a remote island.&lt;ref&gt;Kidner, Walter J, "Hornpipe Harry at Bristol", ''School Music Review'', September 1898, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; One of his last compositions was the one-act operetta ''[[The Outpost (opera)|The Outpost]]'', first produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in July 1900.  It was produced as a [[curtain raiser (drama)|curtain raiser]] to ''The Pirates of Penzance'' and ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' until December 1900 and also ran on tour in 1901–02.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;

In 1888 Clarke published his ''Manual of Orchestration'' described by ''The Musical Times'' as an excellent little book. "As far as can be gathered, either from direct statements or implied directions, [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]] would be the model suggested for imitation, [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] for avoidance."&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', 1 August 1888, p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke's conservatism caused comment from other reviewers; ''The Musical Standard'' mocked him for denying that Wagner was a master of orchestration: "Mr. Clarke should re-edit his work, cutting out all this nonsense. It might then form an admirable book for the beginner".&lt;ref&gt;"The Study of the Orchestra", ''The Musical Standard'', 2 January 1897, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;   Clarke also wrote several other books and articles about orchestration, as well as some fiction and song lyrics.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;

===Later life===
In 1889, Clarke went to Australia, where he succeeded [[Frederick Hymen Cowen|Frederick Cowen]] as conductor of the Victorian National Orchestra in [[Melbourne]].  He was also made inspector of Australian army bands, and given the honorary rank of Captain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 22 February 1891, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He did not enjoy Melbourne; after returning to England in 1892, he gave a talk describing his experiences, giving "many valuable hints … to those who might think of accepting appointments in the Australian Colonies".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal College of Organists", ''Musical News'', 9 December 1893, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; His comments drew a rejoinder from an Australian writer who accused him of "incompetence and lack of interest" while in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;G. G. M.,"Music in Australia", ''Magazine of Music'', June 1894, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke was appointed conductor of the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 24 June 1893, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 he composed and conducted the [[incidental music]] for [[John Martin Harvey]]'s adaptation of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Only Way'", ''The Bury and Horwich Post'', 23 May 1899, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke was forced to retire around 1901 because of failing eyesight.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; In later life, Clarke suffered from health problems that affected his mind.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; According to [[Ellen Terry]], Clarke's "brilliant gifts... 'o'er-leaped' themselves, and he ended his days in a lunatic asylum."&lt;ref name=Lyceum/&gt;

Clarke died at [[Banstead]] Asylum in [[Surrey]] in 1912, aged 72.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

'''Jeffrey Owen Katz''' (born 1950) is an American scientist best known for his pivotal contribution to the field of factor analysis&lt;ref&gt;Jennrich, Robert I., "Rotation to Simple Loadings Using Component Loss Function: The Oblique Case," ''Psychometrika'', Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 173-191, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and his development of innovative AI (artificial intelligence) tools.&lt;ref&gt;Gopalakrishnan, Jayanthi. "Staying Alive as a Trader: Jeffrey Owen Katz." ''Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities'', January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Born April 6, 1950, he is the only child of Nathan Katz (accountant) and Rosalyn Anker (talent agent, entertainer, lapidary shop owner, and founder of Animals in Distress).  He grew up in Queens, New York, but moved with his family to Merrick, N.Y. in 1962.  He was a recognized child prodigy in electronic engineering, able to read and draw schematic diagrams before he could read and write English.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, William. "Young Electronics Genius Experimented at Age 2." ''Long Island Sunday Press'', January 1, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than send their only child away to a boarding school for gifted children, his parents arranged for home-schooling, which was continued until Katz' mid-teens when he began auditing college level courses at local universities.

==Education==
Eventually Katz enrolled in undergraduate studies at [[Stony Brook University]], part of the State University of New York.  Katz rapidly advanced through mathematics, psychology, psychophysiology, physics, and biology.  As a graduate student in mathematics at SUNY Stony Brook, he published a new method of factor rotation,&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jeffrey Owen, and Rohlf, F. James. "Functionplane: A new approach to simple structure rotation."  ''Psychometrika'', March 1974, Vol. 39, No. 1, pp. 37-51&lt;/ref&gt; programmed (in Fortran) a portion of the Numerical Taxonomy Systems Package, and published a number of papers in refereed journals.

In the mid-1970s, Katz was invited to enroll at the University of Lancaster in England, where his academic interests and expertise coalesced in the application of mathematics and psychometrics to the study of psychophysiology and genetics via sophisticated instrumentation which he designed and built.  Katz's graduate studies were interrupted by an extended critical illness during which time he returned to his family home in the U.S.  In 1983, Katz received a Ph.D. from the University of Lancaster, England, under the mentorship of both Phillip Levy, Chair of Lancaster's Psychology Department, and Hans Eysenck, psychometrician and founder of the Psychology Department at the University of London.  Despite the offer of a teaching and research position in Dr. Eysenck's department, after graduation Katz returned to Long Island to be close to his family.

==Research==
After graduation, Katz held several research positions.  He worked for the Brain Research Laboratories (New York University) developing neurometric systems based on the multivariate statistical analysis of electroencephalographic signals (EEG).  He later worked for HeartMap, a biomedical company, where he headed the design, hardware prototyping, software development and testing of a 64-channel cardiac monitor with special analytic capabilities, including neural network pattern recognition and the ability to generate 3-D images of the electrical potentials across the surface of the heart.  He also worked for the [[American Society for Psychical Research]]. where he developed experimental protocols, conducted data analysis, as well as designed and built low noise instrumentation for a variety of psycho physiological and physical experiments.

In 1989, Katz founded and became CEO of Scientific Consultant Services, Inc. (www.scientific-consultants.com), a firm that provides advanced solutions to difficult data handling problems in diverse fields.  To that end, he developed sophisticated artificial intelligence software (neural networks and genetic algorithms).  His clients have ranged from the U.S. Navy to the Swedish Lumber Authority; major asset management firms to individual investors.   His accomplishments include the development of the first commercially available neural network model that forecasts the date, direction and degree of S&amp;P 500 and OEX turning points from one day to months in advance (NexTurn); the development of the first 32-bit neural network development tool for PCs (N-Train); and the development of the first neurogenetic development tool, designed for the genetic evolution of neural networks (LogiVolve).

In addition, Katz served as Managing Principal and Director of Trading and System Development of Blackhorn Asset Management, LLC (2005–2008); Technical Director of Interactive Software Laboratories, Inc. (1995–1998), a firm offering data, data management tools and predictive software to the financial community; and Co-Founder, Vice President, and Director of Software Development, Datatek, Inc. (1990–1993), a consulting and trading system development firm.

Throughout his life, Katz has given generously of his time and resources to various nonprofit causes, ranging from animal welfare to science education.  He has lectured and taught classes at all levels of academia and at private organizations, has published extensively in several fields (in refereed journals, trade magazines, anthologies) and, with his wife, co-authored three books for McGraw-Hill&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jeffrey Owen, and McCormick, Donna L.  ''The Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies''.  McGraw-Hill, Spring 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jeffrey Owen, and McCormick, Donna L.  ''How to Start Day Trading Futures, Options, and Indices''.  McGraw-Hill, October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jeffrey Owen, and McCormick, Donna L.  ''Advanced Option Pricing Models: An Empirical Approach to Valuing Options''.  McGraw-Hill, March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy and Custer Institute==
From 2003-2013, Katz devoted substantial time to one of his main passions: science education.  During that period, he established research and internship programs at the [[Custer Observatory|Custer Institute, Inc.]], where he also served on the Board of Directors (2003–2013), as Observatory Director (2004–2012), and as Research Chair (2006–2012). He was the founder and coordinator of the Custer Institute's “Education Through Research” Program, and served as mentor for students from high school through graduate school, often helping them achieve grants and competitive awards.&lt;ref&gt;"Custer Receives Grant from Brookhaven National Labs," ''Custer Comment'', Volume XXXIX, Issue 1, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; To help promote the Institute and its programs, for several years Katz wrote a monthly astronomy column for the ''Long Island Pulse'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jeffrey Owen. "Star Gazer." Monthly column for ''Long Island Pulse magazine,'' 2007-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured in numerous media productions, including the PBS award-winning documentary, "The Souls of New York."&lt;ref&gt;Brent Sterling Nemetz, Director/Producer, Sterling Films, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate the work of the Institute, he obtained grants for its research and educational programs,&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Christina. "Money to See Beyond Stars." ''The Suffolk Times'', January 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Custer Institute Receives Grant from BNL," ''LongIslandExchange.com'', October 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; enlisted the participation of many local scientists and academicians, and developed specialized hardware (e.g., optics innovations&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Michelle. "Universe in Focus in Southold." ''The Suffolk Times'', May 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) and software (e.g., a unique deconvolution algorithm for image enhancement&lt;ref&gt;"Annual Report from the Observatory Director," ''Custer Comment'', Annual Issue June 2010-May 2011, p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;). In acknowledgment of his accomplishments, he was awarded a Citation from the New York State Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;"NYS Honors Custer &amp; Staff," ''Custer Comment'', Summer 2009, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Katz is currently on the Advisory Board of Montauk Observatory, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montaukobservatory.com/advisory_board.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the Custer Institute, Katz's childhood interest in amateur radio resurfaced.  He revitalized the Institute's amateur radio and radio astronomy programs and was pivotal in arranging the donation and installation of a 55-foot crank-up radio tower from the Great South Bay Amateur Radio Club (of which he is still a member).

Katz's latest research endeavor is the development of a multi-schedule survey of symptomatology and treatment of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientific-consultants.com/cfs-main.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 5000 respondents have participated in this study, which revealed important correlations between a number of factors, including the relationship between thyroid conditions and these disorders.  Katz is currently working on a publication about this study and the results.

'''Lazarus Long''' is a fictional character featured in a number of [[science fiction]] novels by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. Born in 1912 in the third generation of a [[selective breeding]] experiment run by the [[Howard families|Ira Howard Foundation]], Lazarus (birth name '''[[Woodrow Wilson]] Smith''') becomes unusually long-lived, living well over two thousand years with the aid of occasional [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] treatments. Heinlein "patterned" Long on science fiction writer [[Edward E. Smith]], mixed with [[Jack Williamson]]'s fictional Giles Habibula.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Patterson, ''Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century'', volume 1, Tor Books, 2011, p.273&lt;/ref&gt;

His exact (natural) life span is never revealed. In his introduction at the beginning of ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'', he claims he is 213 years old. Approximately 75 years pass during the course of the novel, but because large amounts of this time are spent traveling close to the [[speed of light]], the 75-year measurement is an expression of the time elapsed on Earth rather than time seen from his perspective.  At one point, he estimates his natural life span to be around 250 years, but this figure is not expressed with certainty.  He acknowledges that such a long life span should not be expected as a result of a mere three generations of selective breeding, but offers no alternative explanation except by having a character declare, "A mutation, of course-—which simply says that we don't know".&lt;ref&gt;Justin Foote the 45th in the (in-fiction) Introduction in ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Methuselah's Children'', Long mentions visiting Hugo Pinero, the scientist appearing in Heinlein's first published story "[[Life-Line]]", who had invented a machine that precisely measured lifespan.  Pinero refuses to reveal the results of Lazarus's reading and returns his money.

The promotional copy on the back of ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', the second book featuring Lazarus Long, states that Lazarus was "so in love with time that he became his own ancestor," but this never happens in any of the published books. In the book, Lazarus does travel back in time and is seduced by his mother, but this takes place years after his own birth. Heinlein did, however, use just such a plot device in the short story "[[—All You Zombies—]]", in which a character becomes both of his own parents.

A rugged individualist with a distrust of authority, Lazarus drifts from world to world, settling down periodically and leaving when the situation becomes too regimented for his taste-—often just before an angry mob arrives to capture him.

The Lazarus Long set of books involve [[time travel]], [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimension]]s, [[free love]], [[individualism]], and a concept that Heinlein named [[World as Myth]]—the theory that universes are created by the act of imagining them, such that even fictional worlds are real.

==Appearances==
Novels featuring Lazarus include:
*''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' ([[1941 in literature|1941]]) (serialized magazine version)
*''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' ([[1958 in literature|1958]]) (rewritten novel version)
*''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' ([[1973 in literature|1973]])
*''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' ([[1980 in literature|1980]])
*''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' ([[1985 in literature|1985]])
*''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'' ([[1987 in literature|1987]])

''[[The Notebooks of Lazarus Long]]'', a book containing sayings of the character Lazarus Long largely taken from ''Time Enough for Love'', was published in 1978.

== The Lives of Lazarus Long ==

===''Methuselah's Children''===
When the character of Lazarus Long is introduced in ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'', he is 213 years old, and the breeding experiment that created the [[Howard families|Howard Families]] has proven to be a success, with most "Howards" enjoying a lifespan of approximately 150 years and changing identities periodically to conceal their long lifespans.  10% of their number have elected to end "The Masquerade" and live publicly, with the approval of the Howard Foundation; but this process has backfired.

The general public of Earth, once exposed to the Howards' lifespan, believes incorrectly that the Howards have discovered an anti-aging process that they are choosing to conceal, and come to resent them. [[Civil liberty|Civil liberties]] applied to the Howards are suspended, and the entire membership of the Howard Families is detained, with the exception of Lazarus himself.

With the aid of the elected head of the world government, Slayton Ford, Lazarus hijacks the ''New Frontiers'', a starship designed to travel to distant stars, and liberates the Howards.  While the ''New Frontiers'' was designed to sustain a colony in travel at speeds significantly below the [[speed of light]], a Howard named [[Andrew Jackson Libby|Andrew Jackson "Slipstick" Libby]] raises the ship to speeds approaching lightspeed.  With the ship thus modified, the Howard Families, under the leadership of Lazarus Long, escape the [[solar system]] in search of a planet of their own.

The first planet they encounter is populated by the Jockaira, an intelligent species that has been domesticated for another, unnamed, species whom they worship as gods.  When the latter discover that the humans cannot be domesticated, all of the humans are forcibly removed from the planet and placed in their ship, which is then transferred to another star system and planet by means of technology sufficiently advanced that it is not observable by the humans.

This second planet is populated by a diminutive furry species called the "Little People", who are a very advanced [[collective intelligence]].  They are very accommodating to the humans, and in fact their world is pleasant enough to be considered a [[paradise]].  After many years, Mary Sperling&amp;mdash;a close friend of Lazarus and the second-oldest of the Howard Families&amp;mdash;joins the collective intelligence in order to escape [[thanatophobia]]; whereupon Lazarus and many other Howards return to [[Earth]].  Approximately twelve thousand remain behind.

Upon return to Earth, the Howards learn that a rejuvenation treatment has been developed to approximate the secret of longevity supposedly held by themselves; thus permitting Lazarus, who is grown old, to regain his youth.

===''Time Enough for Love''===

At the beginning of this book, Lazarus has grown weary of life and decides to die.  He returns to Secundus, where a standing order is in place to notify the Chairman Pro Tempore of the Howard Families if he came on world.  He is located and, without his [[informed consent|consent]], subjected to rejuvenation at the behest of his descendant Ira Weatheral, Chairman ''Pro Tempore'' of the Howard Families, who believes that the society and culture of Secundus are in death throes, and wishes to lead the Families to a new planet named Tertius, having had Lazarus advise him in doing so. Lazarus later agrees, promising to commit [[suicide]] if Ira does not meet his demands; and in exchange, Ira orders a search to find Lazarus a new amusement. This search, using a "[[Morphological box|Zwicky Box]]", is performed by an [[artificial intelligence]] named Minerva, who handles most of the computerized functions of the planetary government, is in love with Ira, and becomes friends with Lazarus. Meanwhile, the latter's rejuvenator named [[Ishtar]] and Ira's daughter named [[Hamadryad]], both give birth to female clones of him, their [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] being replaced by an identical copy of the [[X chromosome]], producing "daughters" named [[Lapis Lazuli]] and [[Lorelei]] Lee. Lazarus' advice to Ira appears alternately as [[proverb]]s and as stories.

Lazarus assists Ira in the migration to Tertius; settles the latter; and attempts a trans-temporal journey to Earth, circa 1919-1929; but mistakenly arrives in 1916, there to insinuate himself into his parents' family under the name of "Ted Bronson", whom his grandfather Ira (resembling "The Old Man" of Heinlein's earlier work ''[[The Puppet Masters]]''){{cn|date=September 2017}} suspects to be an illegitimate nephew or son of his own. Lazarus also discovers, to his surprise and (initial) shame, a sexual desire of his own mother, [[Maureen Johnson (Heinlein character)|Maureen]]. When his family learns that he has no plans to join the [[army]] in [[World War I]], they spurn him, prompting him to enlist. His genetic father, Brian Smith, also an officer, makes arrangements for him to go overseas, thinking he is doing "Ted" a favor.

Before deployment, Lazarus again visits his family, whereupon he learns that Maureen is as attracted to him as he is to her.  She explains that her husband does not insist on [[fidelity]], although she is careful not to become pregnant by any man but Brian; and being newly pregnant, consummates her attraction to Lazarus himself. Overseas, Lazarus is seriously wounded in combat, but is rescued by his Tertian household.

===Other novels===

In ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', the main characters discover a way to travel to fictional worlds, and in the course of their explorations, visit the world of Lazarus Long.  Using the technology of these characters' ship (which can travel through space and time), Lazarus snatches his mother out of the time stream at the end of her life and replaces her with a dead clone.

Lazarus also appears as a minor character in ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and plays a role in Heinlein's last novel, ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'', which is the life story of Maureen.  In the former novel, Lazarus is revealed at the end of the novel as the father of protagonist Colin "Richard Ames" Campbell; whereas in the latter novel, Maureen as narrator tells a somewhat different version of Lazarus' visit to Earth in 1916-18, details that information about the future received from Lazarus was crucial to the Howard Foundation's survival of the [[Great Depression]], and reveals that Lazarus (as Woodrow "Bill" Smith) was the backup pilot of the first lunar expedition.

The first five seasons aired on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]], while the succeeding seasons aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]].&lt;ref name=PRNewswire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-21-2009/0005081305&amp;EDATE |title=Lifetime Television's 'Project Runway' Becomes Highest Rated Premiere Ever for the Series and in the Network's History |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001154001/http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104 |archivedate=2009-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Project Runway'' contestants are chosen by the show's producers through an application process that includes a videotape submission and "virtual portfolio" of sketches and completed designs, semi-final interviews at select cities, and a final interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunim-murray.com/ProjectRunway_Application_and_Release.pdf |format=PDF |title="Project Runway" – Season 7: Application Instructions |publisher=[[Bunim/Murray Productions]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521020025/http://www.bunim-murray.com/ProjectRunway_Application_and_Release.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two hundred contestants have competed, three of whom have competed twice—[[Daniel Franco]] competed in both [[Project Runway (season 1)|Season 1]] and [[Project Runway (season 2)|Season 2]] and Kate Pankoke in [[Project Runway (season 11)|Season 11]] and [[Project Runway (season 12)|Season 12]] in addition to Amanda Valentine in Season 11 and [[Project Runway (season 13)|Season 13]]. Angela Keslar and Vincent Libretti were originally eliminated in Episodes 8 and 9, respectively, of [[Project Runway (season 3)|Season 3]], but were brought back due to that season's twist. Justin LeBlanc would have originally been eliminated in Episode 6 of Season 12, but was given a second chance due to the newly instituted "Tim Gunn Save". During Season 13, the "Tim Gunn Save" was used to retroactively bring Charketa Glover back into the competition for Episode 7 after she was eliminated in Episode 6. Seven contestants left ''Project Runway'' for reasons other than being eliminated by the show's judges. [[Keith Michael]] was disqualified in Season 3 for bringing design books to the contest, which is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/288881_tv17.html|title=On TV: A stunning 'Project Runway' season wraps up on Bravo|first=Melanie McFarland|date=2006-10-17|accessdate=2009-08-25|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Jack Mackenroth]] of [[Project Runway (season 4)|Season 4]], Maya Luz of [[Project Runway (season 7)|Season 7]], Cecilia Motwani of [[Project Runway (season 9)|Season 9]], Andrea Katz of [[Project Runway (season 10)|Season 10]], Kooan Kosuke of Season 10, and Sandro Masmanidi of Season 12 all withdrew from the show due to personal reasons.

'''Liz Jackson'''  (1951 – 27 June 2018) was an [[Australia]]n [[journalist]] and [[barrister]] noted for her work on the ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' and  ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' television programs. She received nine [[Walkley Award]]s for excellence in journalism.

==Career ==
Jackson grew up in [[Melbourne]], Australia and commenced work with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) in 1986. Prior to her career with the ABC, Jackson also worked in a community legal centre in Australia and practised law in [[London]] as a barrister at [[Gray's Inn]]. Jackson returned to Australia and worked for the NSW Premier's Department, in the Women's Coordination Unit, dealing with laws to protect women from violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-17/liz-jackson-biography/8031224 Liz Jackson: One of Australia's finest journalists]; abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining ''Four Corners'' as an investigative reporter in 1994, Jackson was awarded [[Walkley Award]]s, Australia's awards for journalism, on five occasions for her work on the following:
*The situation in [[Somalia]] (1993);
*The suicide of Aboriginal activist [[Rob Riley (Aboriginal activist)|Rob Riley]];
*"Fixing Cricket", a report about cricket match-fixing (2000);
*"Go to jail", regarding the [[Northern Territory]]'s mandatory sentencing laws (2000); and,
*"Putting the Children at Risk", an investigation into the [[New South Wales]] Government Department of Community Services (2002).&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/reporter_lizjackson.htm Biography of Liz Jackson], ''Four Corners'' website, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], accessed 11 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson received three [[Logie Award]]s for "Fixing Cricket" and stories related to the [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment#Blackhawk accident|Blackhawk disaster]] and [[HIV]] transmission from a [[doctor's office|doctor's surgery]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

At the start of 2005, Jackson hosted the media-criticism program ''Media Watch'', before stepping down in December 2005 and returning to ''Four Corners''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/attard-fronts-media-watch/2005/12/07/1133829602483.html|title=Attard fronts Media Watch|date=7 December 2005|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
Her daughter, [[Rose Jackson (politician)|Rose Jackson]], is a student politician aligned with the [[National Labor Students]] faction and sits on the executive of the [[Australian Labor Party|New South Wales Labor Party]].

In November 2016, Jackson revealed she had been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 2014, with the release of a documentary called "A Sense of Self" broadcast as an episode of ''Four Corners''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-17/liz-jackson-living-with-parkinson's-disease/8029626 A Sense Of Self], ''Four Corners'', 21 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in her sleep while on holiday in Greece on 27 June 2018, at the age of 67.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, '[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-28/liz-jackson-former-abc-journalist-dies/9921518 Liz Jackson, former ABC journalist, dies aged 67'], 28 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luc Gilbert Cyrille Nilis''' (born 25 May 1967), nicknamed ''Lucky Luc'', is a former Belgian [[Association football|football]] [[Striker (association football)|striker]]. He enjoyed a successful career in his native Belgium and, in particular, in the [[Netherlands]] with [[PSV Eindhoven]]. However, his playing days came to an end in the [[2000–01 Premier League|2000–01]] season after breaking his leg in a match with his club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] following a clash with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]].

==Club career==
His former clubs include [[K.R.C. Genk|K.F.C. Winterslag]], [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]], [[PSV Eindhoven]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

Having left Anderlecht for Eindhoven in 1994, Nilis topped the Dutch scoring charts in the [[1995–96 Eredivisie|1995–96]] season, plundering 21 goals.&lt;ref name = "Eredivisie top scorer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eredivisiestats.nl/topscorers.php|work=EredivisieStats.nl|title=Topscorers|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued that form into [[1996–97 Eredivisie|1996–97]] – leading the pack by December 1996 with 13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3hYuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zjADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2734%2C457053|title=Hierro grabs crucial goal as Real Madrid stay on top|agency=Reuters|date=2 December 1996|accessdate=23 January 2016|newspaper=The Nation|location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt; – before matching his previous total,&lt;ref name="Eredivisie top scorer" /&gt; in a season that ended with PSV winning the league title for the first time in five years.&lt;ref name = "Loaded"&gt;{{cite news|date=9 September 2016|first=Jack|last=Beresford|title=Luc Nilis: The PSV Eindhoven hitman who ran out of luck at Aston Villa|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=loaded.co.uk|publisher=Loaded|url=http://loaded.co.uk/luc-nilis-the-psv-eindhoven-hitman-who-ran-out-of-luck-at-aston-villa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1997, Nilis scored thrice in three games over a fifteen-day period, all against [[Shay Given]]; with a goal at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League group stage]] coming in between goals for Belgium against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref name = "Buzz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgium legend Luc Nilis opens up about the 1998 World Cup playoff against Ireland &amp; our chances at Euro 2016|work=buzz.ie|date=13 June 2016|url=http://buzz.ie/legendary-belgian-striker-luc-nilis-opens-up-about-the-1998-world-cup-playoff-against-ireland-and-our-chances-at-euro-2016/|first=David|last=Coughlan}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with PSV, Nilis formed one of the deadliest partnerships in Europe with team-mate [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], who signed for PSV in 1998.&lt;ref name="Loaded" /&gt; In the [[1998–99 Eredivisie|1998–99]] season, Nilis and van Nistelrooy scored 55 league goals between them. Van Nistelrooy finished as top-scorer,&lt;ref name="Eredivisie top scorer" /&gt; Nilis came second. In the [[1999–2000 Eredivisie|following season]], Nilis' last for PSV, they scored 48 league goals between them.

Then, after 6 years in the Netherlands, Nillis joined Aston Villa on a [[Free transfer (association football)|Bosman transfer]] in July 2000.&lt;ref name = "Blind eye"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nilis turns blind eye to Villa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/belgium/783793.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 January 2014|date=9 June 2000|first=Pete|last=Lansley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nilis' Villa career started well, as he scored on his debut in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] against [[1.

[[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] occasionally names Nilis as one of the best strike partners he had played with despite sharing only a brief time with him at PSV.&lt;ref&gt;http://esporte.uol.com.br/ultimas/multi/2009/05/15/04023762DC812346.jhtm?sabatina-da-folha-com-ronaldo--integra-da-entrevista-04023762DC812346&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] has also stated on several occasions that the Belgian was one of the best players, if not the best, he had ever played with.&lt;ref name="Loaded" /&gt;

==International career==
Nilis played 56 times for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national team]], scoring 10 times. A prolific goalscorer with his clubs, he scored his first goal for Belgium only on his 24th cap (a 9–0 win against [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]]).&lt;ref name = "Int'l profile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Luc Nilis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/belgium/743993.stm|date=14 May 2000&lt;!-- visible in "see also" box; third link from top: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/belgium/783793.stm --&gt;|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nilis played in the [[FIFA World Cup]]s in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. Qualification for the latter was sealed with Nilis' goals in each leg of Belgium's [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA play-off)|playoff]] against the Irish Republic.&lt;ref name="Buzz" /&gt; Nilis dropped out of international football after the 1998 Finals, reportedly in response to an "unhealthy atmosphere within the squad and their lack of achievement".&lt;ref name="Int'l profile" /&gt; However, with control of the Belgian national side having changed,&lt;ref name="Blind eye" /&gt; Nilis returned to the international fold in November 1999,&lt;ref name="Int'l profile" /&gt; in time for [[Euro 2000]], co-hosted by his birth-country Belgium and the [[Netherlands]].

==Coaching career==
After his playing career [[K. Beringen-Heusden-Zolder|Beringen-Heusden-Zolder]] were his next port of call, becoming technical director in 2005, not long before the club's liquidation after financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="Loaded" /&gt; Nilis took a job with PSV, first as a scout and then training the club's forwards. In January 2011, Nilis became assistant manager with Turkish club [[Kasımpaşa Spor Kulübü]], followed by another assistant manager stint with [[Gençlerbirliği S.K.]], also in Turkey. In April 2015 he was re-hired by PSV as a striker coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luc Nilis joins PSV's backroom team|url=https://www.psv.nl/english-psv/news/article/luc-nilis-joins-psv-s-backroom-team.htm|website=PSV.nl|accessdate=8 October 2015|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Nilis's father, Roger (1938–2011), played as a professional footballer in Belgium in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgian Legends – Luc Nilis|url=http://thebelgianwaffle.co.uk/belgian-legends-luc-nilis/|publisher=The Belgian Waffle|accessdate=5 January 2014|author=Chris Mayer|date=4 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101065851/http://thebelgianwaffle.co.uk/belgian-legends-luc-nilis/|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Acting===
Wilson became interested in acting after watching her oldest brother Danny act. Mara's parents refused to let her act, but they eventually reluctantly agreed to let her go into acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/04-2013/being-matilda_64967.html|title=Being Matilda|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After acting in commercials for [[Lunchables]], Bank of America, Texaco, and Marshall's, Mara was invited to audition for the 1993 comedy film ''Mrs. Doubtfire'' and won the part of Natalie Hillard. This was followed by the 1994 remake of ''Miracle on 34th Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-07-27/entertainment/9707250824_1_mara-wilson-starring-role-rock-cafe|title=Mara Wilson's Role Is A Wish Come True|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she had a recurring role as Nikki Petrova on ''Melrose Place'' and played Barbara Barton in the television film ''A Time to Heal''.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Wilson sang "[[Make 'Em Laugh]]" at the [[67th Academy Awards]] telecast on March 27, 1995, with [[Tim Curry]] and [[Kathy Najimy]].&lt;ref&gt;Archerd, Army (March 14, 1995). [https://variety.com/1995/voices/columns/oscars-plan-to-make-em-laugh-1117862661/ Oscars plan to 'Make 'em Laugh']. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, she won the [[National Association of Theatre Owners|ShoWest Award]] for "Young Star of the Year". Her performances in those films caught the attention of [[Danny DeVito]] which led to her being cast as Matilda Wormwood in ''Matilda''. She then went on to star in ''A Simple Wish'' alongside [[Martin Short]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/11/entertainment/ca-11517 Short Works Magic in Uneven ''A Simple Wish'' &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, she played Willow Johnson in the 1999 Disney Channel television film ''Balloon Farm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/27/entertainment/ca-21390|title=Rip Torn, Mara Wilson Help Keep Disney's 'Balloon Farm' Aloft|first=LYNNE|last=HEFFLEY|date=March 27, 1999|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson auditioned for the 1998 remake of ''[[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|The Parent Trap]]'', but she lost to [[Lindsay Lohan]] after being deemed too young for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/16/matilda-star-mara-wilson-reviews-matilda-the-musical.html|title=‘Matilda’ Star Mara Wilson Reviews ‘Matilda the Musical’|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Wilson went to a table reading of ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]], but she did not get the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/mara-wilson-recalls-robin-williams-grown-ups/story?id=25027733|title=Mara Wilson Recalls Robin Williams 'Was Different With Grown-Ups'|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson appeared in the 2000 children's fantasy adventure film ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'', it was her last feature film until 2015. At that point, scripts were being sent to her that she did not have to go to auditions. After Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Wilson retired from acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/interview/marawilson|title=Mara Wilson Interview|work=[[contactmusic.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before taking a 12-year hiatus from acting, she got the script for ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' but declined to audition for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mara-wilson-sickness-induced-reason-she-hates-gary-211227|title=Mara Wilson on the sickness-induced reason she hates Gary Jules’ "Mad World"|work=avclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Wilson appeared briefly in one episode of a [[web series]] called ''Missed Connection'' in the role of Bitty and made special appearances on internet review shows for ''[[That Guy with the Glasses]]'' — most notably a comedic turn playing an adult Matilda during a review of ''Matilda'' by The Nostalgia Chick, [[Lindsay Ellis (Nostalgia Chick)|Lindsay Ellis]]. That year, when asked why she quit film acting, Wilson explained: "Film acting is not very fun. Doing the same thing over and over again until, in the director's eyes, you 'get it right', does not allow for very much creative freedom. The best times I had on film sets were the times the director let me express myself, but those were rare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/child-star-mara-wilson-why-i-quit-film-acting-2012174|title=Child Star Mara Wilson: Why I Quit Film Acting|date=April 17, 2012|work=usmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson appeared in the 2015 comedy-drama film ''Billie Bob Joe'', it was her first feature film in over 15 years.

'''Menahem Azariah da Fano''' (also called Immanuel da Fano, and Rema MiPano) (1548 – 1620) was an Italian [[rabbi]], [[Talmud]]ist, and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]].

==Life==

[[File:Fano Castle.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The Castle of Fano in a 19th-century etching. The high watchtower was destroyed during World War II.]]
He was a disciple of Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]], to whose widow he offered 1,000 [[Sequin (coin)|sequin]]s for her husband's manuscripts. Even as a youth Fano had some reputation for learning, as is shown by the fact that Moses Cordovero (d. 1570) sent him a copy of his ''Pardes Rimmonim''. Another one of Fano's teachers was [[Ishmael Ḥanina b. Mordecai]] of [[Valmontone]].

Fano was a patron of learning. When Rabbi [[Joseph Caro]], shortly before his death (1575), sent ''Kesef Mishneh'', his commentary on [[Maimonides]]' ''Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah'', to Mantua for publication, Fano, at the suggestion of [[Dei Rossi]], assumed part of the expense and took charge of the edition.

According to a report of [[Immanuel Aboab]], Fano lived for some time in [[Reggio Emilia]]. Numerous pupils flocked to him from Italy and Germany, and he was held in general respect for his learning and character.

One of Fano's sons was [[Isaac Berechiah]]; and the same name was borne also by Fano's son-in-law and pupil (mentioned in a letter of [[Israel Sforno]] to his son [[Obadiah ben Israel Sforno]]).

==Works==

Fano's authority as a Talmudist is evident in a collection of [[responsa]] ("She'elot Teshubot me-Rabbi Menaḥem 'Azaryah," Dyhernfurth, 1788) containing 130 chapters on various subjects connected with religious law and ritual questions. They are distinguished by precision of style as well as by the author's independence of the later authorities. He even decides sometimes in opposition to Joseph Caro (e.g., No. 32), and holds changes in the ritual to be justifiable in certain cases (see, e.g., No. 25). In his love for precision and brevity Fano compiled a book of extracts from [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]]'s code, which itself is only a compendium of the Talmud. This book is preserved in manuscript. [[Azulai]] enumerates twenty-four cabalistic treatises by Fano, part being in manuscript. Ten of these are comprised in the work "'Asarah Ma'amarot"; five of them, under the title "Amarot Ṭehorot," were printed together with "Ḳol Yehudah," a philosophical commentary by [[Judah ben Simon]] (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1698; Mohilev, 1810).

These treatises originated partly in addresses delivered by the author on feast-days, especially on [[Rosh Hashanah]]. In spite of Fano's decided tendency toward scholastic and allegoric interpretation, his works are not devoid of original remarks. For example, in connection with the cabalistic interpretation of Num. xxxiii. 2, "And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys," he says: "The Torah speaks always of ideas when it seems to be describing concrete things: the higher meaning is the principal thing; the lower, material meaning holds the second place. Moses b. Naḥman, indeed, follows another opinion in his commentary on Genesis in holding to the principle that 'the Torah speaks according to the manner of men'; but we can justly say that men speak according to the manner of the Torah" ("Ḥiḳḳur Din," iii. 22). "The prohibitions of the Torah never appear in the imperative, but in the form of the future: 'Thou shalt have no other gods'; 'Thou shalt not bow down thyself to other gods'; 'Thou shalt not swear falsely'; etc. This means, 'I know thou wilt not be guilty of these things, since human nature does not tolerate such crimes, and if sin occurs in this life it can be only a passing episode.' On the other hand, the commandments are in the imperative: 'Kabbed,' 'zakor'; that is, 'I command thee nothing new; the good instincts in thee have always been there; they need only to be awakened and developed'" (ib. iv. 9). This last sentence is characteristic of the author's optimism as well as of his mild nature, which attracted the sympathy of all.

In 1581 [[Jedidiah Recanati]] dedicated to Fano his Italian translation ("Erudizione dei Confusi") of Maimonides' "Moreh Nebukim." [[Isaiah Hurwitz]] especially mentions Fano's treatise "Yonat Elem" as a theological work the teaching of which comes very near to the truth ([[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], introduction to "Nobelot Ḥokmah"). Fano's pupil [[Samuel Portaleone]] composed an elegy on the occasion of his death (Oxford MS. No. 988c).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6743">'''Morris Pashman''' (September 27, 1912 &amp;ndash; October 3, 1999) was an [[United States|American]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politician and attorney who served as [[Mayor of Passaic, New Jersey]] before spending 23 years as a judge, 10 of them on the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]. On the state's highest court, he ruled the book ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' obscene and banned its publishing in the state, issued rulings in two major murder cases, advocated for the equal citizenship rights of the mentally handicapped and was one of the few dissenting votes objecting to the jailing of a reporter who refused to turn over his notes in a murder case.

==Early life and career==
Pashman was born in Passaic on September 27, 1912.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;[[William H. Honan|Honan, William H.]] [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/10/nyregion/morris-pashman-87-champion-of-free-speech-on-new-jersey-s-highest-court.html "Morris Pashman, 87, Champion of Free Speech on New Jersey's Highest Court"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 10, 1999. Accessed October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from [[Rutgers School of Law—Newark]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=RecordObit&gt;Young, Elise. [http://find.galegroup.com/gtx/infomark.do?contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;docType=IAC&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T004&amp;prodId=SPN.SP00&amp;docId=CJ70535680&amp;userGroupName=bergen_main&amp;version=1.0&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;source=gale&amp;infoPage=infoMarkPage "Morris Pashman, Influential Jurist, Dies at 87; Tireless Worker Shaped Decisions in Key N.J. Cases."], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', October 4, 1999. Accessed October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending time in private practice, Pashman was named in 1946 to serve in Passaic on its police court, and later on its municipal court. Elected Mayor of Passaic in 1951, he served until 1955 and then served as city commissioner and director of revenue and finance.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

==Superior Court==
After two years on Passaic County Court, [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Robert B. Meyner]] appointed him to [[New Jersey Superior Court]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He became the assignment judge for Passaic County in 1965 and for [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

In a 1964 decision, Pashman upheld Bergen County prosecutor [[Guy W. Calissi]]'s decision to ban the sale of the [[John Cleland]] book ''Fanny Hill'' in New Jersey, calling the book "sufficiently obscene to forfeit the protection of the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment of the Constitution]]." In addition to failing tests of "social value," "prurient interest" and "patently offensive," Pashman ruled that ''Fanny Hill'' failed the "hard-core pornography test," noting that the "book may be well-written but still obscene."&lt;ref&gt;Waggoner, Walter H. [https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/08/archives/fanny-hill-sale-banned-in-jersey-judge-rules-its-obscenity-forfeits.html "Fanny Hill' Sale Banned in Jersey; Judge Rules Its Obscenity 'Forfeits' Protection"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 8, 1964. Accessed October 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was overturned, and Pashman would later call his actions in the case an "aberration," saying that "I think every judge or justice is entitled to one."&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

In a 1966 ruling in a case filed by the [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]] Bar Association, Pashman's decision stated that the Passaic County [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] was obligated to replace the county courthouse due to inadequate conditions in the building. A new building was constructed within four years of the order.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

In a 1971 case, Pashman agreed to a plea bargain that would allow [[Edgar Smith (murderer)|Edgar Smith]] to go free based on time served. Smith had been convicted of the 1957 murder of a 15-year-old cheerleader and assessed the death sentence, but the prosecutor later disclosed that critical evidence in the case was no longer available and agreed to allow Smith to plead guilty to second-degree murder, fearing that Smith would be able to claim false imprisonment.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

==New Jersey Supreme Court==
Governor [[William T. Cahill]] named Pashman to serve as a Justice of the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] in April 1973 to replace Justice [[Haydn Proctor]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Ronald. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70610FC395C1A7A93CBA8178FD85F478785F9 "Cahill Names Two Justices And Supreme Court Chief; Nominees Praised 2 Meyner Nominees"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 19, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1978 "Dr. X" murder trial of [[Mario Jascalevich]], Judge [[Theodore Trautwein]] had ordered that reporter [[M. A. Farber]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' be sent to jail for refusing to turn over notes to the defense attorney. When Farber was about to be jailed, his attorneys filed for an emergency stay on a weekend and Pashman arrived in his golfing attire to grant the stay. When the full court heard the case the next day, Pashman was the only dissenter as the court upheld the lower court ruling and ordered that Farber serve time in jail. When the court reaffirmed the lower court action in a decision in September 1978, Pashman and fellow Justice [[Alan B. Handler]] were the only dissenters.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

In another 1978 case, this on challenging New Jersey's [[Blue Law]]s, the court ruled 5&amp;ndash;2 to uphold the laws then in effect in 10 of the state's 21 counties restricting sales of certain products on Sundays. Handler and Pashman were the only dissenters, with Pashman saying that the law fails the too-frequently ignored "test of common sense" and that it improperly grants government the right to tell people what to do "for their own good."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Waldron|Waldron, Martin]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/19/archives/new-jersey-pages-jerseys-high-court-upholds-blue-law-prohibition-on.html "Jersey's High Court Upholds Blue Law; Prohibition on Some Sunday Sales in Effect in 10 of 21 Counties."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 19, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pashman reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1982.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Death==
A resident of [[Clifton, New Jersey]], Pashman died in a New York City hospital at age 87 on October 3, 1999. He was survived by a daughter, a son, four grandsons, and three great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

The '''National Museum "George Castrioti Skanderbeg"''' ({{lang-sq|Muzeu Kombëtar "Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu"}}), also known as the '''Skanderbeg Museum''' or the '''Kruja Museum''', is located in [[Krujë]] and is one of the most important and visited museums in [[Albania]]. The museum was built at the end of the 70's and was inaugurated on November 1, 1982. Its architecture was designed by architects [[Pirro Vaso]] and [[Pranvera Hoxha]], and it has the character of a memorial that is treated as a northern Albanian tower.&lt;ref name="argophilia.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://argophilia.com/albania/skanderbeg-museum.html|title=Skanderbeg Museum (Muzeu Kombetar Gj. Kastriot Skenderbeu) {{!}} Visit Albania|website=argophilia.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the museum is in the honor of the Albanian national hero [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg|Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbej]].

The [[Krujë Castle]], which houses the museum, is a historic citadel. Ottoman troops attacked it thrice, in 1450, 1466 and 1467, but failed to take control. It was this impregnable fortress that helped George Kastrioti Skanderbeg defend Albania from the Ottoman invasion for more than two decades.&lt;ref name="Museum of Krujë"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeg Museum of Krujë, Albania|url=http://www.balkansgeotourism.travel/content/gjergj-kastrioti-skenderbeg-museum-of-kruj%C3%AB-albania/see7BCD502F3C44F1400|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building ==
The National Museum "Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu" project was based on the conceptual platform designed by [[Aleks Buda]] in September 1976, which was sent as a design assignment to the Institute of Studies and Projets (ISP) No.1 Tirana, under the direction of architect [[Pirro Vaso]]. After reviewing three variants, the ISP decided to continue the work on designing a building based on these variants and decided that the site where the museum would be built was in the interior of the walls of the old [[Kruja Castle]]. The design team consisted of [[Pirro Vaso]], [[Pranvera Hoxha]], F.Stermasi, K.Meka, L.Gashi, Gjarçani and R.Agalliu, who designed a building which would be stylistic to the Albanian medieval towers, mainly built in northern Albania.&lt;ref name="Telegraf"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://telegraf.al/kulture/haki-hoxha-muzeu-i-krujes-vlerat-e-nje-vepre-monumentale|title=Haki HOXHA* / Muzeu i Krujës, vlerat e një vepre monumentale|last=Telegraf|first=Gazeta|website=Gazeta Telegraf|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the museum's draft idea was approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture, the ISP working group started work on the project implementation of this work. The works for the construction of the National Museum "Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu" began in September 1978 and they were directed by Robert Kote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/flasin-realizuesi-i-vertete-i-projektit-dhe-gurgdhendesi-i-muzeut-muzeu-i-krujes-su-projektua-nga-pranvera-hoxha-dhurate-nga-enveri-per-diplome/|title=Flasin realizuesi i vërtetë i projektit dhe gurgdhendësi i muzeut: Muzeu i Krujës s’u projektua nga Pranvera Hoxha, dhuratë nga Enveri për diplomë|website=www.panorama.com.al|language=sq|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1980, the Ministry of Education and Culture set up two working groups for the preparation of the museum content model, pavilions, [[Mural|mural paintings]], and so on. The group of historians led by prof. Kristo Frasheri and the group of painters led by Bashkim Ahmeti completed this design in the end of 1980.&lt;ref name="Telegraf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkivalajmeve.com/Mjeshteria-e-derdhur-ne-dy-muralete-muzeut-mesjetar-te-Krujes.1047633846/|title=Mjeshtëria e derdhur në dy muralet e muzeut mesjetar të Krujës - Arkiva Shqiptare e Lajmeve|website=www.arkivalajmeve.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibits ==
The museum contains objects dating back to Skanderbeg’s time. The exhibits have been arranged in a way that chronicles his life and military feats. Paintings, armor, and other artifacts dating back to his time have been exhibited to showcase one of the proudest periods of Albanian history. An interesting display is the replica of the hero’s famous goat head-topped helmet, the original of which is on display at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]].&lt;ref name="Museum of Krujë" /&gt; The memorial building was designed by [[Pirro Vaso]] and Pranvera Hoxha.&lt;ref name="argophilia.com"/&gt;

'''Owl Woman''' ([[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]] name: ''Mis-stan-stur''; died 1847) was a [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] princess.&lt;ref name=Varnell7&gt;Varnell, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a daughter of White Thunder,{{#tag:ref|White Thunder's name can also be translated as Gray Thunder and Painted Thunder.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dexter4&gt;Dexter (2008) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} a well-respected [[medicine man]] of the Cheyenne tribe. She was married to an [[Anglo-American ethnic group|Anglo-American]] trader named [[William Bent]], with whom she had four children. Owl Woman was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]] for her role in managing relations between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]] and the Anglo-American men.

==Background==

===Native American tribes of the central plains===
In the 1820s, the [[Great plains|central plains]] area in which several Native American tribes lived had been subject to political and economic turmoil resulting from the [[Mexican War of Independence]].  The [[Arkansas River]] delineated the border, with Mexico to the south and the United States northwards. There were many opportunities for trade alliances, in part to replace those that had involved the now-deposed Spanish governors, and there was also encroachment on the area by the United States as that nation pursued its policy of [[manifest destiny]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (2011), pp. 156-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was also subject to turmoil as Native American [[Plains Indians|plains tribes]] of the central and southern plains sought to define or redefine their territory. Tribes moved to new lands within the plains for various reasons: they may have been displaced in their previous land, had internal disputes that caused them to relocate, sought better hunting or gathering grounds, or sought land that was most conducive to their way of life.  The [[Comanche]], [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]], [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho people|Arapahoe]] were among the disputing tribes.&lt;ref name=Marker43&gt;Marker, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cheyenne likely moved into the plains in the 17th and 18th century from [[Minnesota]] and by the mid-1800s lived with the Arapaho north of the [[Arkansas River]] in land near [[Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site|Bent's Fort]] in [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=Marker43/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hydep155+162"&gt;Hyde (2011), pp. 155, 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Native American tribes, the Comanche came to the grasslands of southern plains for a better life which put them at odds with other tribes.  In an agreement reached with the Cheyenne, "[[#Bent's Fort role in negotiating tribal relationships|The Great Peace of 1840]]", they agreed to stay south of the Arkansas River and the Cheyenne and Arapaho above it.
{{quote|The Comanche invasion of the southern plains was, quite simply, the longest and bloodiest conquering campaign the American West had witnessed - or would witness until the encroachment of the United States a century and a half later.&lt;ref&gt;Hämäläinen, pp. 18, 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===William Bent and the Santa Fe trail===

William Bent, a white trader from [[St Louis]], came to the Arkansas River region towards the end of the 1820s.&lt;ref name=Varnell8/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hydep147"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  By around 1832, although possibly as late as 1834,&lt;ref name="Hydep160"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; a permanent trading post called [[Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site|Bent's Fort]], which was a substantial adobe construction capable of accommodating 200 people,&lt;ref name=Varnell8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; had been built on the northern "Mountain Route" of the Santa Fe Trail and was open for business. The location of this building was determined after discussions with the Cheyenne&lt;ref name=Varnell8/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hydep155"/&gt; and was not far from [[La Junta, Colorado|La Junta]], near to land occupied by the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes.&lt;ref name=Varnell8/&gt; It became an important center of trade, principally in buffalo robes but also in numerous other goods, including horses and mules.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The fort was operated in partnership with his brother, [[Charles Bent|Charles]],&lt;ref name=Halaas24/&gt; and [[Ceran St. Vrain|Ceran St Vrain]], a fur trader who had already established significant trading contacts in New Mexico.&lt;ref name=Halaas23and55&gt;Halaas, Masich, pp. 23, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPS4&gt;National Park Service, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Varnell states that another brother, George, was also a partner at some point.&lt;ref name=Varnell9/&gt;|group=nb}} Sometimes referred to as Fort William,&lt;ref name="Hydep155"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; it was in "the perfect place at the perfect time"&lt;ref name="Hydep160"/&gt; for someone looking to make money from trading and, for example, a gallon of brandy bought in St Louis for {{USD}}2 could be sold at the fort for {{USD}}25.&lt;ref name="Hydep161"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde has dated the moment that White Thunder realized a common interest with Bent. In November 1833 they talked together as a meteor shower lit up the sky over the plains. Many Cheyenne who were gathered with them believed that this celestial event was a signal of the end of the world and it was subsequently referred to as "the Night the Stars Fell". White Thunder saw it as a new beginning and sought both a truce with the Pawnees and the return of the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne which had been captured by the Pawnee during a battle. Partially successful, he returned from his solo, unarmed visit to the Pawnee village with two of the arrows and an agreement for peace. He also realized that a formal marital alliance with Bent, and in particular the children that would result from such a relationship, would represent another element of the new beginning, of peace for the Cheyenne and indeed the region.&lt;ref name="Hydep163-164"/&gt;

Bent had already learned the language of the Cheyenne&lt;ref name=Halaas23&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was known as ''Little White Man'' by the native tribes.&lt;ref name=Varnell8/&gt; He and his brothers had been given native names upon their first meeting with Cheyenne in the area, which had been a convivial occasion during which their respect for the Cheyenne protocols had set a firm base for their future development of the fort and trading.&lt;ref name="Hydep147"/&gt;

===Life at Bent Fort and the Cheyenne village===
[[File:Bent's Fort 1848.png|thumb|250px|Bent's Fort in 1848]]
The fort and the area immediately outside it was a multi-cultural, multilingual center with permanent inhabitants from many nations and also visitors, including the temporary camps of native tribes such as the [[Sioux]], [[Apache]] and [[Kiowa]], as well as Comanche and Cheyenne. It was the hub of a trading area that encompassed a 500-mile radius and was visited each year by hundreds of [[Wagon train|wagons]] traveling the [[Santa Fe trail]]. Hyde writes in ''Empires, Nations and Families'' that "Bent's Fort was the one spot on the Santa Fe trail where exchanges with Indians were welcomed and encouraged, and the effects of those conversations on both sides were far-reaching&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;archeological evidence tells us that people sat in the courtyard together and smoked—a lot".{{#tag:ref|Archeological surveys have recovered 1526 pipes in the courtyard of the fort alone.&lt;ref name="Hyde165"/&gt;|group=nb}} Bent managed trade to and from the fort: he provided a safe zone in the area and a supply of goods for its store, as well as facilitating the movement of buffalo robes back to St. Louis for sale.&lt;ref name="Hyde165"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Halaas27&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sitting on the Santa Fe trail, Bent's Fort was a resting stop for travelers, some staying as much as three weeks.  From fall through spring the fort was busy with people wishing to trade and travelers to rest and restock their supplies. Visitors and employees included: Mexicans, Native Americans, and European travelers and trappers.  There were also three [[Slavery in the United States|African American slaves]] owned by the Bents.  Up to 100 employees needed to support the fort and trade included: clerks, guards, traders, teamsters, trappers, a tailor, blacksmith, carpenter and herders.  Caravans took goods to trade with regional Native American tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1913), pp. 170-172, 178, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort was usually relatively empty during the summer months and during that period Bent would often be riding the six-month journey on the {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} trail to and from [[Westport, Missouri]] in order to trade the goods gathered over the previous winter and replenish the stocks of the fort for the forthcoming hunting season.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923) pp. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Bent and the trains were away the fort managed with a skeleton crew of herders, clerks, traders and laborers for Native Americans and travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1913), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

William and Charles owned African slaves Andrew and Dick Green and brought them from Missouri to assist in the running of the fort.  Dick Green's wife, Charlotte, a negro cook who described herself as the only female American woman&lt;ref name=Simmons51to52&gt;Simmons, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Although Simmons provides the "Green" surname for the men, there is conjecture as to whether this was in fact their surname.|group=nb}}  to [[George Ruxton]] at the time of his visit in 1848 as "de only lady in de whole damn Injun country".&lt;ref name=Ruxton440/&gt;  She was notorious for her cooking among fur traders and travelers.  One person called her a "culinary divinity".  Bent's Fort held dances regularly; Charlotte was described by Colonel [[Henry Inman (U.S. Army officer and author)|Henry Inman]] as "the center of attention, the belle of the evening. She knew her worth and danced accordingly." Dick was released from slavery by George and William Bent after his heroic efforts in a battle in 1847 at Taos after the death of Charles Bent.  Dick, who has been stationed with Charles Bent in Santa Fe, made his way north with American soldiers to Bent's Taos home.  He bravely led a skirmish against a group of Taos Pueblo and other people.  Dick was severely wounded but survived a trip back to Bent's fort. Charlotte, who Simmons claims was also Charles and William's slave, left the fort with her husband.&lt;ref name=Simmons51to52/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavender, p. 171, 313, 319&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bent's Fort role in negotiating tribal relationships===
In the period immediately prior to the marriage of Owl Woman to Bent both the Cheyenne and the Arapahoe had become eager to work with the incoming [[Wagon train|trade caravans]], and notably those associated with Bent. Unlike many other tribes in the area, they saw these caravans as an opportunity for enrichment rather than as a threat.&lt;ref name="Hydep163"/&gt; The Cheyenne in particular had reason to favor Bent because he had on one occasion intervened to protect them against [[Comanche]] raiders.&lt;ref name="Hydep155"/&gt; However, the disparity in how the long-settled and the recently settled tribes viewed the influx of new traders exacerbated intertribal rivalries and resulted in White Thunder making a decision that was calamitous for both his tribe and his reputation. In 1833 he led the Cheyenne into a fight with the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]], the outcome of which was not merely a considerable loss of life but also the loss of the four arrows. This symbolic capture by the Pawnees represented a huge loss of respect and status for White Thunder and his tribe.&lt;ref name="Hydep163"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bent had been doing much to negotiate a resolution to the intertribal disputes, as well as raids on settlers and traders. An uneasy truce had developed which, in its turn, had enhanced his own status and trading position.&lt;ref name="Hydep160"/&gt; Anne Hyde has described the overall situation that came to exist in the area as being similar to that prevailing in northern California, a "negotiated community ... Only constant renegotiation and the conscious creation of community through family ties, diplomacy, warfare, and dinner made it operate in a surprisingly stable way."&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trading environment improved after 1840, when Bent's Fort became the site of a truce between the Comanche, Apache and Kiowa tribes on the one hand and the Cheyenne and Arapahoe on the other, creating what Hyde describes as "network of enormous significance."&lt;ref name="Hyde 2011, p. 355"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; The Comanche, in particular, had for many years protected their territory to the south of the Arkansas River against almost all who attempted to move into it. They had built up their power with a deep knowledge of their territory, shrewd trading arrangements, and their willingness to indulge in raids against those who threatened or breached those arrangements. Indeed, their grip on the territory to the south of the river was one of the reasons why Bent's Fort had been constructed on the opposite side. Although they had continued to assert their power after Mexican independence, the influx of displaced tribes from elsewhere, the westward push of white settlers and the development of the Santa Fe Trail meant that there were many bloody battles and much loss of life. These culminated in a Comanche raid on the fort and its surroundings in 1839 and a retaliatory raid by the Cheyenne. Realizing that long-term peace was preferable to reciprocating attacks, this was agreed and the formalization of the arrangement at the fort over several weeks during the summer of 1840 saw Bent playing a central role as host to the various camps and their celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (2011), pp. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell, pp. 41-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde has said that {{quote|For William Bent, Owl Woman, and their families and business associates, the Arkansas River as border between Mexico and the United States was an abstraction. However, the Arkansas River as border between the Comanches and the Cheyennes mattered deeply, as did the river as wintering ground for people and for bison. Bent's Fort and its ''vacinidad'' created an oasis where business could be conducted and lives led, regardless of imperial borders.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[George Ruxton]] subsequently observed, in 1848, how the council room at the fort was used, "Chiefs of the Shain, Kioway and Araphó sit in solemn conclave with the head traders, and smoke the "[[calumet (pipe)|calumet]]" over their real and imaginary grievances."&lt;ref name=Ruxton440&gt;Ruxton, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Owl Woman, whose date of birth is unrecorded, was the oldest daughter of White Thunder&lt;ref name=Halaas24&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tail Woman. She had at least two younger sisters, Yellow Woman and Island.&lt;ref name=Halaas39&gt;Halaas, Masich, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was an influential Cheyenne leader who acted as the tribe's "Keeper of the Arrows,"&lt;ref name=Halaas290&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; four arrows thought to have a sacred or medicinal role. The prestige of his position as a spiritual leader or medicine man was reflected on to his daughters.&lt;ref name=Varnell8&gt;Varnell, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halaas14and290&gt;Halaas, Masich, pp. 14, 23, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cheyenne were a [[Plains Indians|nomadic plains tribe]] who followed and hunted buffalo. They were described as "tall, well built with even features" and regarded as "honorable, intelligent, honest and clean".&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, pp. 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
It was not uncommon at this time for white men living in the area, usually working as traders or [[Mountain men|trappers]], to take a Native American wife. Often these relationships lasted only until the men left the frontier territory, but while they existed they were of mutual benefit.&lt;ref name=Halaas24/&gt; Bent and Owl Woman's relationship, however, was a partnership that ultimately "resulted in children, wealth and power."&lt;ref name=Deverell313&gt;Deverell, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; From Bent's point of view, marriage to a Cheyenne would not merely provide him with female companionship and a social escort for functions held at the fort but, perhaps more importantly, reinforce an alliance with the tribe that would be a useful adjunct to his burgeoning trading activities. From the perspective of White Thunder, it would bolster his tribe's already friendly relationship with Bent and thus provide protection for them, and on a more personal level it would re-establish some of his prestige within the tribe itself.&lt;ref name=Varnell8/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hydep163-164"&gt;Hyde (2011), pp. 163-164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halaas23to25&gt;Halaas, Masich, pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

To observe the formal rituals of the Cheyenne, he obtained consent from White Thunder to court Owl Woman. So much as talking to a Cheyenne girl was considered to be courtship by the tribe and, as such, it was necessary to obtain the permission first in order not to cause offence. There were other pre-courtship rituals, such as an exchange of ponies between the two men, and during the courtship itself Bent and Owl Woman were always chaperoned by Yellow Woman,&lt;ref name=Varnell8/&gt; in accordance with the Cheyenne belief in remaining celibate until marriage.  To signal Bent's request to marry Owl Woman, he arrived at White Thunder's camp with horses and gifts and smoked a [[Calumet (pipe)|peace pipe]] of tobacco with Owl Woman's father in a ritualistic ceremony. Although Owl Woman wanted to marry Bent, the decision for the couple to marry was made by White Thunder by joining William Bent's hands with Owl Woman's hands. This signified both the acceptance of Owl Woman as William Bent's wife, but also an agreement for William Bent to also accept Owl Woman's sister Yellow Woman.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, pp. 11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The arrangement for Yellow Woman to accompany her sister Owl Woman into the marriage with Bent was a custom to share the work of managing a family, processing buffalo hides, meal preparation and possibly other wifely duties.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

The couple married in a Cheyenne ceremony in 1835,&lt;ref name="Hydep164"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; per Britney Nelson of the [[Colorado Historical Society]], or as others claim by 1837.&lt;ref name=Dexter4/&gt; As a part of the ritual, Owl Woman was carried into a lodge which was constructed for them in the Cheyenne village near the fort,&lt;ref&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 13, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; while Bent dispensed largesse in the form of numerous gifts.&lt;ref name=Hyde164to165&gt;Hyde (2011), pp. 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt; Bent later became a "Cheyenne sub-chief", having attained tribal membership with his marriage to Owl Woman.&lt;ref&gt;Hoig, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Varnell believes that Bent "gradually accepted&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Yellow Woman as his wife" who gave birth to Bent's son named Charles in 1845.&lt;ref name=Halaas39/&gt;&lt;ref name=Varnell10/&gt; Dexter stated that: Bent "welcomed her as an honored member of the family, promising to always provide for her, but making it clear he would only have one wife, and that was Owl Woman." She states that Bent took Yellow Woman as his wife after Owl Woman's death.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, pp. 17, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Grinnell similarly believes that this marriage was after the death.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde believes that Bent married another sister of Owl Woman, Island.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

===Living arrangements===
;Bent's Fort and the Cheyenne village
The couple each spent time at their partner's residence: the lodge created for Owl Woman and Bent's quarters within the fort, which were furnished according to their backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Hyde165"/&gt;  Owl Woman did not prefer to stay the fort, where her room was dark and near the loud, smoky blacksmith shop.  The horses and pack animals were also loud and smelly.&lt;ref name=Halaas26to27/&gt;  On the other hand, her lodge was quiet and lit through the parchment-like paper of the roof.  Horses grazed on the hills.  In the lodge built for Owl Woman and Bent, a shrine-like area held sacred and religious items. Supplies were stowed away, including cooking utensils, food, clothing, bedding, riding gear and weapons.&lt;ref name=Halaas26to27&gt;Halaas, Masich, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1840s two of Owl Woman's younger sisters, Island and Yellow Woman, joined them, in accordance with tribal custom for successful men.  In 1845 Yellow Woman bore William a boy named Charley, or Pe-ki-ree meaning White Hat in Cheyenne.&lt;ref name=Varnell9&gt;Varnell, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halaas39/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavender, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April Bent left the fort for the six-month supply train journey to Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the summer months his family went back and forth between the fort and the nearby Cheyenne village and were in the fort by autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Big Timbers
[[File:Cheyenne Village at Big Timbers 1853.jpg|thumb|The only surviving [[daguerreotype]] from [[Solomon Nunes Carvalho]]'s journey West in 1853 depicts a view of the Cheyenne village at [[Big Timbers]]. A pair of figures stand to the left; drying hides hang on the right. Courtesy of [[Library of Congress]].]]
Seasonally the Cheyenne moved {{convert|30|miles|km}} down the Arkansas River&lt;ref&gt;Lavender, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Big Timbers]].{{#tag:ref|Big Timbers later became the site of [[Bent's New Fort]], built to replace the original after it was destroyed in mysterious circumstances in 1849 around the time of the Oklahoma [[cholera]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=NPS4/&gt;|group=nb}}  Alongside the Arkansas River for {{convert|40|miles|km}} Big Timbers was a prime location for hunting buffalo, a major source of food for the Cheyenne.&lt;ref&gt;Halaas, Masich, pp. 11, 42, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tribe also lived on roots and berries.&lt;ref name=Halaas42/&gt; Big Timbers was their desired camp site in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Halass, Masich, pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hyde, Owl Woman and her children traveled with her tribe to Big Timbers during the winter months and were at the fort itself during the summer.&lt;ref name="Hyde 2011, p. 355"/&gt;  During the Cheyenne's winter visit to Big Timbers, Bent accompanied his family with goods for trading.&lt;ref name=Halaas42/&gt; At Big Timbers, Bent lived according to Cheyenne custom when he lived with them in a more casual, unstructured way of life.  While Bent's Fort life was somewhat structured with William having a leadership role.&lt;ref name=Halaas62/&gt;

{{quote|Such was the rhythm of village life.  Always movement — sometimes to Big Timbers close to the buffalo herds, sometimes to the fort, but always someplace where grass was thick, wood plentiful, and water fresh and sweet.&lt;ref name=Halaas42&gt;Halass, Masich, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Role at the fort===
Within a short time after the marriage the couple were, according to Hyde, "the central business and social leaders of the region", having combined their familial and trading connections with the various tribes, the traders, and the authorities of both New Mexico and the US Army to considerable effect.&lt;ref name="Hydep162"&gt;Hyde, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; They were both active peacemakers&lt;ref name=Bataille230&gt;Bataille, Lisa, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; among the natives, explorers, and settlers who visited the fort: Mexican traders, American explorers, African slaves, hunters and trappers and members of many area Native American tribes.&lt;ref name=Halaas27/&gt;

Owl Woman worked in the fort and often managed the supply trains.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; Her position enabled her to deter predatory tribes who might have designs on the trade caravans, this [reputedly] being achieved by her flashing a signal using a mirror.&lt;ref name=Varnell9/&gt;

It was while at the fort in 1845 that [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|topographical engineer]] Lieutenant [[James William Abert|James W. Abert]] asked Owl Woman to sit for him as the subject of a watercolor painting. He described that:

{{quote|In the evening I got a fine sketch of 'Mis-stan-stur,' (Owl Woman), a Cheyenne squaw, who although she has been married several years and has two children, yet shows signs of having been a remarkably handsome woman. Having a white man for her husband, she has not been obliged to work, therefore her hands are in all their native beauty, small, delicately formed, and with tapering fingers; her wavy hair, unlike the Indians generally, was fine and of silken soften. She put on her handsomest dress in order to sit for me. Her cape and under garment were bordered with bands of beads, and her beautiful leggins, which extended only to the knee, were so nicely joined with the moccasin that the connection could not be perceived, and looked as neat as the stockings of our eastern belles, and the modest attitude in which she sits is characteristic, but will be best conceived by the sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/chekbird/r6/bentfort.htm |title=Mis-stan-stur - Ghost-Owl Woman |publisher=US Geological Survey |date=3 August 2006 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Children===
The real fruit of the marriage was always anticipated to be the children, of whom they raised four together.&lt;ref name=Hyde164to165/&gt; These were named in English and Cheyenne:&lt;ref name="Hyde165"&gt;Hyde (2011), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Varnell9to10&gt;Varnell, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Mary, named for Bent's favorite sister, was born January 22, 1838. Her Cheyenne name was Ho-ka.
* Robert, named for Bent's youngest brother, was born about 1840 - 1841. His Cheyenne name was Octavi-wee-his.
* [[George Bent|George]], was born July 7, 1843, named after Bent's brother. George was also named Ho-my-ike.
* Julia or Um-ah was born in 1847 and her English name was that of Bent's oldest sister.

Life at the fort, called the "mud castle of the plains", reflected the heritage of both parents.  The children's clothes included linen shirts and soft-leather moccasins.  There they ate on fine china and, according to Cheyenne custom, slept on the ground in soft hides.  The furnishings and household goods included items from America, Mexico and international locations.&lt;ref&gt;Deverell, pp. 314, 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  Children enjoyed pumpkin pie and pancakes made by the Charlotte, a slave in service to the Bents.  Chipita, the French-Mexican wife to a Bent worker, made taffy for the children; She performed housekeeping and laundry services at the fort.&lt;ref&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owl Woman's mother taught the children to be respectful and courteous of their elders.  Discipline was given through stern glances and waving fingers by his mother and his aunts.  In their multi-cultural environment, the children learned to speak many languages; George learned how to speak Cheyenne, English, Spanish, Comanche, Kiowa and Arapaho.  The boys learned to ride horses bareback, control the horses actions through softly worded commands, hunt and to be warriors.  The girls learned how to perform chores, like gathering wood, fetching water, and picking berries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=Halaas39to40&gt;Halaas, Masich, pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Girls were also taught to be gracious, generous hosts.&lt;ref name=Halaas41&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; George Bent recalled of his childhood at the fort:
{{quote|Something was always going on, and we children had no lack of amusements.  In the fall and winter there was always a large camp of Indians just outside the fort — Cheyenne and Arapahos, and sometimes [[Sioux]], [[Kiowa people|Kiowas]], [[Comanche]]s, and [[Plains Apache|Prairie Apaches]].&lt;ref name="Hyde165" /&gt;}}

Life for the Bent family changed dramatically over six years after Owl Woman's death.  In 1849 a cholera epidemic swept through the Cheyenne tribe killing up to half of the people, including the children's grandmother, Tail Woman.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1923), p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Demand in fur declined, with a resulting drop in William Bent's business at the fort. In 1853 Bent established a stone fort in the Big Timbers area.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1913), pp. 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1854, subsequent to the death of Owl Woman, George was sent away to be educated at a school run by an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] in [[Westport, Missouri]], causing him to be separated from his family for much of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (2011), pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and posthumous recognition==
The death of Owl Woman from complications of the birth of Julia, (who was born in 1844) in 1847 was not witnessed by Bent as he was away at that time.&lt;ref name=Varnell10/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Two of his brothers, Charles and Robert, also died in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell (1913), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Bent mourned deeply for Owl Woman. Her sister Island took responsibility for raising Bent and Owl Woman's children.&lt;ref name=Halaas62&gt;Halaas, Masich, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owl Woman, described as "a most estimable good woman of much influence in the tribe",&lt;ref name=Varnell10&gt;Varnell, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; had worked to manage and improve relations between Native American tribes and the white man during her life. Hyde notes that {{quote|Bent and his allies figured out a middle position between the powerful Comanches and the expanding American systems. William and Charles Bent, White Thunder, and Owl Woman created a place and a moment that used the trading systems of the Native people and the roads, wagons, and goods made by Europeans to link two very different worlds. They envisioned&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp; a new world that would provide sustenance and honor for their children.&lt;ref name="Hyde169to170"&gt;Hyde (2011), pp. 169-170&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Their vision did not last, being overtaken by wider events as the years passed by,&lt;ref name=NPS4/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyde169to170"/&gt; but the contribution of Owl Woman was recognized posthumously. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Owl Woman, Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parisa Tabriz''' is an [[United States|American]] [[computer security]] expert who works for [[Google]] as a Director of Engineering. She chose the title "Security Princess" due to her experience in hacking and internet security and a desire for a less staid, more whimsical title on her business card.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOct4-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/11140639/Googles-top-secret-weapon-a-hacker-they-call-their-Security-Princess.html |title=Google's top secret weapon – a hacker they call their Security Princess |author=Josie Ensor |date=October 4, 2014 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=October 4, 2014 |quote=I knew I'd have to hand out my card and I thought Information Security Engineer sounded so boring.

==Early life==
Parisa Tabriz was born to an [[Iranian Americans|Iranian]] father, a doctor, and an American mother, a nurse, of [[Polish-American]] descent.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOct4-14" /&gt; She grew up in the suburbs of [[Chicago]] and is the older sister of two brothers.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOct4-14" /&gt; Neither of her parents were computer literate and Tabriz didn't encounter the world of computing until her first year at university.&lt;ref name="Meet Google's Security Princess"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Meet Google's Security Princess |url=http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/a14652/google-parisa-tabriz-profile/ |author=Clare Malone |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tabriz initially enrolled at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] to study engineering, but soon became interested in computer science instead.&lt;ref name="Meet Google's Security Princess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Google AI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ai.google/research/people/author36241 |title=Parisa Tabriz |publisher=[[Google]] AI |accessdate=September 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She completed Bachelor's and master's degrees at the university&lt;ref name="Meet Google's Security Princess"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CS @ Illinois Alumna, and Google’s Security Princess |url=http://cs.illinois.edu/news/cs-illnois-alumna-and-google’s-security-princess |accessdate=July 15, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719012701/http://cs.illinois.edu/news/cs-illnois-alumna-and-google%E2%80%99s-security-princess |archivedate=July 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did research in wireless networking security and attacks on privacy-enhancing technologies, co-authoring papers with her advisor [[Nikita Borisov]].&lt;ref name="Google AI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Passive Data Link Layer 802.11 Wireless Device Driver Fingerprinting |author1=[[Jason Franklin]] |author2=[[Damon McCoy]] |author3=Parisa Tabriz |display-editors=etal |date=2006 |journal=USENIX-SS'06 |publisher=[[USENIX]] |pages=167–178 |location=[[Berkeley, California]] |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec06/tech/full_papers/franklin/franklin_html/index.html |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Breaking the Collusion Detection Mechanism of MorphMix |date=2006 |location=[[Cambridge]] |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2166542 |author1=Parisa Tabriz |author2=[[Nikita Borisov]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141004215720/http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2166542 |archivedate=October 4, 2014 |dead-url=yes |editor1=[[George Danezis]] |editor2=[[Philippe Golle]] |work=Privacy Enhancing Technologies.

==Career==

Tabriz was offered a summer internship with Google's security team while at college,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=With Any Luck, This Googler Will Turn More Girls Into Hackers |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/08/with-any-luck-this-googler-will-turn-more-girls-into-hackers/ |author=Cade Metz |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=August 26, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the company a few months after her graduation in 2007.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOct4-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.60secondrecap.com/parisa-tabriz-google-security-princess/ |title=Parisa Tabriz, Google security, talks about college |author=Peter Osterlund |work=[[60second Recap]] |date=October 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While preparing to attend a conference in Tokyo with Google, she decided to use the job title "Security Princess" rather than the conventional "Information Security Engineer" as it seemed more interesting. This title is now on her business cards.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOct4-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Click 2018-09-01"/&gt; As of 2016, she heads a team of 30 experts responsible for the security of [[Google Chrome]].&lt;ref name="Chromium"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chromium Security Team |url=https://dev.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Insider 2014-07-12"/&gt; She is also responsible for training Google staff interested in moving into the internet security field.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOct4-14"/&gt; Seeing the [[sexism in the technology industry|gender imbalance in Silicon valley]], Tabriz works on hiring more female workers in her department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/13/tech/parisa-tabriz-security-princess-google-hack/ |title=The cyber warrior 'princess' who guards Google |author=Sheena McKenzie |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 17, 2015 |access-date=January 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to inspire younger people to enter her field, Tabriz mentors young teens at an annual science convention in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOct4-14"/&gt;

In 2018, in response to the [[RSA Conference]] having only one non-male [[keynote speaker]] in a line-up of 20, Tabriz co-founded the Our Security Advocates conference, [https://www.oursa.org/ OURSA], which in only five days pulled together 14 speakers who are women. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/07/oursa_women_in_infosec_conference/ |title=Women of Infosec call bullsh*t on RSA's claim it could only find one female speaker |author=Iain Thomson |work=[[The Register]] |date=March 7, 2008 |access-date=March 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marko Mrnjavčević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Марко Мрњавчевић}}, {{IPA-sh|mâːrko mr̩̂ɲaːʋt͡ʃeʋit͡ɕ|pron|Sr-markomrnjavcevic.ogg}}; {{circa|1335}}&amp;nbsp;– 17 May 1395) was the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian]] king from 1371 to 1395, while he was the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of territory in western [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] centered on the town of [[Prilep]]. He is known as '''Prince Marko''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Краљевић Марко}}, ''Kraljević Marko'', {{IPA-sh|krǎːʎeʋit͡ɕ mâːrko|IPA}}) and '''King Marko''' ({{lang-bg|Крали Марко}}; {{lang-mk|Kрaле Марко}}) in [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] [[oral tradition]], in which he has become a major character during the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule over the [[Balkans]]. Marko's father, King [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević|Vukašin]], was co-ruler with Serbian [[Tsar]] [[Stefan Uroš V]], whose reign was characterised by weakening central authority and the gradual disintegration of the [[Serbian Empire]]. Vukašin's holdings included lands in western Macedonia and [[Kosovo]]. In 1370 or 1371, he crowned Marko "young king"; this title included the possibility that Marko would succeed the childless Uroš on the Serbian throne.

On 26 September 1371, Vukašin was killed and his forces defeated in the [[Battle of Maritsa]]. About two months later, Tsar Uroš died. This formally made Marko the king of the Serbian land; however, Serbian [[Nobility|noblemen]], who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler. Sometime after 1371, he became an Ottoman [[vassal]]; by 1377, significant portions of the territory he inherited from Vukašin were seized by other noblemen. King Marko, in reality, came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near [[Skopje]] (better known as [[Marko's Monastery]]), which was completed in 1376. Marko died on 17 May 1395, fighting for the Ottomans against the [[Wallachia]]ns in the [[Battle of Rovine]].

Although a ruler of modest historical significance, Marko became a major character in South Slavic oral tradition. He is venerated as a national hero by the [[Serbs]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Bulgarians]], remembered in [[Balkans|Balkan]] folklore as a fearless and powerful protector of the weak, who fought against injustice and confronted the Turks during the Ottoman occupation.

==Life==

===Until 1371===
Marko was born about 1335 as the first son of [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević]] and his wife Alena.&lt;ref name=fost49&gt;Fostikov 2002, pp.49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[patronymic]] "Mrnjavčević" derives from Mrnjava, described by 17th-century [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] historian [[Mavro Orbin]] as a minor nobleman from [[Zachlumia]] (in present-day [[Herzegovina]] and southern [[Dalmatia]]).{{sfn|Орбин|1968|p=116}} According to Orbin, Mrnjava's sons were born in [[Livno]] in western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]],{{sfn|Орбин|1968|p=116}} where he may have moved after Zachlumia was annexed from Serbia by Bosnia in 1326.&lt;ref name=fine362&gt;Fine 1994, pp.362–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mrnjavčević family{{ref|Notea|n.b.1}} may have later supported [[Serbian Empire|Serbian Emperor]] ([[tsar]]) [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Stefan Dušan]] in his preparations to invade Bosnia as did other Zachlumian nobles, and, fearing punishment, emigrated to the Serbian Empire before the war started.&lt;ref name=fine362/&gt;&lt;ref name=fine323&gt;Fine 1994, p.323.&lt;/ref&gt; These preparations possibly began two years ahead of the invasion,&lt;ref name=fine323/&gt; which took place in 1350. From that year comes the earliest written reference to Marko's father Vukašin, describing him as Dušan's appointed ''[[župan]]'' (district governor) of [[Prilep]],&lt;ref name=fine362/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stojanović 1902, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; which was acquired by Serbia from [[Byzantium]] in 1334 with other parts of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Fine 1994, p.288.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1355, at about age 47, Stefan Dušan died suddenly of a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=fine335&gt;Fine 1994, p.335.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dušan was succeeded by his 19-year-old son [[Stefan Uroš V|Uroš]], who apparently regarded Marko Mrnjavčević as a man of trust. The new Emperor appointed him the head of the embassy he sent to Ragusa (now [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]) at the end of July 1361 to negotiate peace between the empire and the [[Ragusan Republic]] after hostilities earlier that year. Although peace was not reached, Marko successfully negotiated the release of Serbian merchants from [[Prizren]] who were detained by the Ragusans and was permitted to withdraw silver deposited in the city by his family. The account of that embassy in a Ragusan document contains the earliest-known, undisputed reference to Marko Mrnjavčević.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.51. Ćorović 2001, "[http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/3_9.html Распад Српске Царевине]".&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription written in 1356 on a wall of a church in the Macedonian region of [[Tikveš]], mentions a Nikola and a Marko as governors in that region, but the identity of this Marko is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dušan's death was followed by the stirring of separatist activity in the Serbian Empire. The south-western territories, including [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], and lands in southern Albania, seceded by 1357.&lt;ref&gt;Šuica 2000, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the core of the state (the western lands, including [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]] and [[Travunia]] with the upper [[Drina|Drina Valley]]; the central Serbian lands; and Macedonia), remained loyal to Emperor Uroš.&lt;ref name=fine358&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1994|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, local noblemen asserted more and more independence from Uroš' authority even in the part of the state that remained Serbian. Uroš was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in his own domain.&lt;ref name=fine345&gt;Fine 1994, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian lords also fought each other for territory and influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Šuica|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Vukašin, Psača.jpg|right|thumb|190px|alt=Grey-bearded king, holding a scroll and a cross-shaped staff|Marko's father King Vukašin (from a fresco in the [[Psača Monastery]], Macedonia)]]

Vukašin Mrnjavčević was a skilful politician, and gradually assumed the main role in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; In August or September 1365 Uroš crowned him king, making him his co-ruler. By 1370 Marko's potential patrimony increased as Vukašin expanded his personal holdings from Prilep further into Macedonia, [[Kosovo]] and [[Metohija]], acquiring Prizren, [[Pristina]], [[Novo Brdo]], [[Skopje]] and [[Ohrid]].&lt;ref name=fine362/&gt; In a [[charter]] he issued on 5&amp;nbsp;April 1370 Vukašin mentioned his wife (Queen Alena) and sons (Marko and Andrijaš), signing himself as "Lord of the Serb and Greek Lands, and of the Western Provinces" ({{Script|Cyrs|господинь зємли срьбьскои и грькѡмь и западнимь странамь}}).&lt;ref&gt;Miklošič 1858, [https://archive.org/stream/monumentaserbic00miklgoog#page/n200/mode/1up p.180], № CLXVII.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1370 or early 1371 Vukašin crowned Marko "Young King",{{sfn|Sedlar|1994|pp=31}}&lt;ref name=sui20&gt;{{harvnb|Šuica|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a title given to [[Heir presumptive|heirs presumptive]] of Serbian kings to secure their position as successors to the throne. Since Uroš was childless Marko could thus become his successor, beginning a new—Vukašin's—dynasty of Serbian sovereigns,&lt;ref name=fine362/&gt; and ending the two-century [[Nemanjić dynasty]]. Most Serbian lords were unhappy with the situation, which strengthened their desire for independence from the central authority.&lt;ref name=sui20/&gt;

Vukašin sought a well-connected spouse for Marko. A princess from the [[Croats|Croatian]] [[House of Šubić]] of [[Dalmatia]] was sent by her father, Grgur, to the court of their relative [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], the [[Ban (title)|ban]] of Bosnia. She was supposed to be raised and married by Tvrtko's mother [[Jelena Šubić|Jelena]]. Jelena was the daughter of [[George II Šubić of Bribir|George II Šubić]], whose maternal grandfather was Serbian King [[Stephen Dragutin of Serbia|Dragutin Nemanjić]].&lt;ref&gt;Fajfrić (2000), "[http://www.rastko.rs/istorija/zfajfric-kotromanici_c.html#_Toc486040898 Први Котроманићи]".&lt;/ref&gt; The ban and his mother approved of Vukašin's idea to join the Šubić princess and Marko, and the wedding was imminent.&lt;ref name=jirecek&gt;Jireček 1911, [https://archive.org/stream/geschichtederser00jire#page/430/mode/1up p.430].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theiner97&gt;Theiner 1860, [https://archive.org/stream/p1veteramonument02thei#page/97/mode/1up p.97], № CXC.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 1370 [[Pope Urban V]] sent Tvrtko a letter forbidding him to give the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] lady in marriage to the "son of His Magnificence, the King of Serbia, a [[East–West Schism|schismatic]]" (''filio magnifici viri Regis Rascie scismatico'').&lt;ref name=theiner97/&gt; The pope also notified King [[Louis I of Hungary]], nominal overlord of the ban,&lt;ref&gt;Theiner 1860, [https://archive.org/stream/p1veteramonument02thei#page/97/mode/1up p.97], № CLXXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; of the impending "offence to the Christian faith", and the marriage did not occur.&lt;ref name=jirecek/&gt; Marko subsequently married Jelena (daughter of [[Radoslav Hlapen]], the lord of [[Veria]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] and the major Serbian nobleman in southern Macedonia).&lt;ref name=mih170&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, pp. 170–1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the spring of 1371, Marko participated in the preparations for a campaign against [[Nikola Altomanović]], the major lord in the west of the Empire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p. 137; Fine 1994, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was planned jointly by King Vukašin and [[Đurađ I Balšić]], lord of [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]] (who was married to Olivera, the king's daughter). In July of that year Vukašin and Marko camped with their army outside [[Shkodër|Scutari]], on Balšić's territory, ready to make an incursion towards [[Onogošt]] in Altomanović's land. The attack never took place, since the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] threatened the land of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] [[Jovan Uglješa]] (lord of [[Serres]] and Vukašin's younger brother, who ruled in eastern Macedonia) and the Mrnjavčević forces were quickly directed eastward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Having sought allies in vain, the two brothers and their troops entered Ottoman-controlled territory. At the [[Battle of Maritsa]] on 26&amp;nbsp;September 1371, the Turks annihilated the Serbian army;&lt;ref&gt;Ćorović 2001, "[http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/3_10.html Маричка погибија]".&lt;/ref&gt; the bodies of Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa were never found. The battle site, near the village of [[Ormenio]] in present-day eastern Greece, has ever since been called as ''Sırp Sındığı'' ("Serbian rout") in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The Battle of Maritsa had far-reaching consequences for the region, since it opened the [[Balkans]] to the Turks.&lt;ref name=fine379&gt;Fine 1994, pp. 379–82&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1371===
[[Image:Central balkans 1373 1395.png|right|thumb|200px|Approximate borders of territory ruled by King Marko after 1377 (shown in darker green)]]
When his father died, "young king" Marko became king and co-ruler with Emperor Uroš. The Nemanjić dynasty ended soon afterwards, when Uroš died on 2 (or 4)&amp;nbsp;December 1371 and Marko became the formal sovereign of Serbia.&lt;ref name=mih168&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian lords, however, did not recognise him,&lt;ref name=mih168/&gt; and divisions within the state increased.&lt;ref name=fine379/&gt; After the two brothers' deaths and the destruction of their armies, the Mrnjavčević family was left powerless.&lt;ref name=mih168/&gt; Lords around Marko exploited the opportunity to seize significant parts of his patrimony. By 1372 Đurađ I Balšić took Prizren and Peć, and Prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]] took Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;Šuica 2000, pp.35–6.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1377 [[Vuk Branković]] acquired Skopje, and Albanian magnate [[Andrea Gropa]] became virtually independent in Ohrid; however, he may have remained a vassal to Marko as he had been to Vukašin.&lt;ref name=fine379/&gt; Gropa's son-in-law was Marko's relative, Ostoja Rajaković of the [[Serb clans|clan]] of Ugarčić from Travunia. He was one of Serbian noblemen from Zachlumia and Travunia (adjacent principalities in present-day Herzegovina) who received lands in the newly conquered parts of Macedonia during Emperor Dušan's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Šuica 2000, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Markovi Kuli zapaden del.JPG|left|thumb|250px|alt=Stone castle ruins against a blue sky|Remains of Marko's fortress above [[Prilep]], known as ''[[Markovi Kuli]]'' ("Marko's towers")]]
The only sizable town kept by Marko was Prilep, from which his father rose. King Marko became a petty prince ruling a relatively small territory in western Macedonia, bordered in the north by the [[Šar mountains]] and Skopje; in the east by the [[Vardar]] and the [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna Reka]] rivers, and in the west by Ohrid. The southern limits of his territory are uncertain.&lt;ref name=mih170/&gt; Marko shared his rule with his younger brother, Andrijaš, who had his own land.&lt;ref name=fine379/&gt; Their mother, Queen Alena, became a nun after Vukašin's death, taking the monastic name Jelisaveta, but was  co-ruler with Andrijaš for some time after 1371. The youngest brother, [[Dmitar Mrnjavčević|Dmitar]], lived on land controlled by Andrijaš. There was another brother, Ivaniš, about whom little is known.&lt;ref&gt;Fostikov 2002, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; When Marko became an Ottoman [[vassal]] is uncertain, but it was probably not immediately after the Battle of Maritsa.&lt;ref name=mih164&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, pp.164–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point Marko separated from Jelena and lived with Todora, the wife of a man named Grgur, and Jelena returned to her father in Veria. Marko later sought to reconcile with Jelena but he had to send Todora to his father-in-law. Since Marko's land was bordered on the south by Hlapen's, the reconciliation may have been political.&lt;ref name=mih170/&gt; Scribe Dobre, a subject of Marko's, transcribed a [[liturgical book]] for the church in the village of Kaluđerec,{{ref|Noteb|n.b.2}} and when he finished, he composed an inscription which begins as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Stojanović 1902, pp.58–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Marko's fortress was on a hill north of present-day Prilep; its partially preserved remains are known as ''[[Markovi Kuli]]'' ("Marko's towers"). Beneath the fortress is the village of Varoš, site of the medieval Prilep. The village contains the Monastery of Archangel Michael, renovated by Marko and Vukašin, whose portraits are on the walls of the monastery's church.&lt;ref name=mih170/&gt; Marko was [[ktetor]] of the Church of Saint Sunday in Prizren, which was finished in 1371, shortly before the Battle of Maritsa. In the inscription above the church's entrance, he is called "young king".&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monastery of St. Demetrius, popularly known as [[Marko's Monastery]], is in the village of [[Markova Sušica]] (near Skopje) and was built from c.&amp;nbsp;1345 to 1376 (or 1377). Kings Marko and Vukašin, its ''ktetors'', are depicted over the south entrance of the monastery church.&lt;ref name=fost49/&gt; Marko is an austere-looking man in purple clothes, wearing a crown decorated with pearls. With his left hand he holds a scroll, whose text begins: "I, in the Christ God the pious King Marko, built and inscribed this divine temple&amp;nbsp;..." In his right hand, he holds a horn symbolizing the horn of oil with which the [[Old Testament]] kings were [[Anointing|anointed]] at their coronation (as described in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] [[s:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#Chapter 16|16:13]]). Marko is said to be shown here as the king chosen by God to lead his people through the crisis following the Battle of Maritsa.&lt;ref name=mih168/&gt;

Marko [[Mint (coin)|minted]] his own money, in common with his father and other Serbian nobles of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt; His silver [[coin]]s weighed 1.11&amp;nbsp;grams,&lt;ref&gt;Šuica 2000, pp.133–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and were produced in three types. In two of them, the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] contained a five-line text: {{Script|Cyrs|ВЬХА/БАБЛГОВ/ѢРНИКР/АЛЬМА/РКО}} ("In the Christ God, the pious King Marko").&lt;ref name=mandic&gt;Mandić 2003, pp.24–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first type, the reverse depicted [[Christ]] seated on a throne; in the second, Christ was seated on a [[mandorla]]. In the third type, the reverse depicted Christ on a mandorla; the obverse contained the four-line text {{Script|Cyrs|БЛГО/ВѢРНИ/КРАЛЬ/МАРКО}} ("Pious King Marko"),&lt;ref name=mandic/&gt; which Marko also used in the church inscription. He omitted a territorial designation from his title, probably in tacit acknowledgement of his limited power.&lt;ref name=mih170/&gt; Although his brother Andrijaš also minted his own coins, the [[money supply]] in the territory ruled by the Mrnjavčević brothers primarily consisted of coins struck by King Vukašin and Tsar Uroš.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; About 150 of Marko's coins survive in [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections.&lt;ref name=mandic/&gt;

By 1379, Prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]], the ruler of [[Moravian Serbia]], emerged as the most-powerful Serbian nobleman.&lt;ref name=mih164/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mihaljčić 1975, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he called himself [[Autokrator]] of all the [[Serbs]] ({{Script|Cyrs|самодрьжць вьсѣмь Србьлѥмь}}), he was not strong enough to unite all Serbian lands under his authority. The [[Balšić noble family|Balšić]] and Mrnjavčević families, [[Konstantin Dragaš]] (maternally a Nemanjić), Vuk Branković and Radoslav Hlapen continued ruling their respective regions.&lt;ref name=mih164/&gt; In addition to Marko, Tvrtko I was crowned King of the Serbs and of Bosnia in 1377 in the [[Mileševa monastery]]. Maternally related to the Nemanjić dynasty, Tvrtko had seized western portions of the former Serbian Empire in 1373.&lt;ref&gt;Fine 1994, p.393.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15&amp;nbsp;June 1389 Serbian forces led by Prince Lazar, Vuk Branković, and Tvrtko's nobleman [[Vlatko Vuković]] of Zachlumia, confronted the Ottoman army led by Sultan [[Murad I]] at the [[Battle of Kosovo]], the best-known battle in medieval Serbian history.&lt;ref name=fine408&gt;Fine 1994, pp.408–11.&lt;/ref&gt; With the bulk of both armies wiped out and Lazar and Murad killed, the outcome of the battle was inconclusive. In its aftermath the Serbs had insufficient manpower to defend their lands, while the Ottomans had many more troops in the east. Serbian principalities which were not already Ottoman vassals became such over the next few years.&lt;ref name=fine408/&gt;

In 1394, a group of Ottoman vassals in the Balkans renounced their vassalage.&lt;ref name=Fostikov52&gt;Fostikov 2002, pp.52–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Marko was not among them, his younger brothers Andrijaš and Dmitar refused to remain under Ottoman dominance. They emigrated to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], entering the service of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]]. They travelled via Ragusa, where they withdrew two-thirds of their late father's store of {{convert|96.73|kg}} of silver, leaving the remaining third for Marko. Although Andrijaš and Dmitar were the first Serbian nobles to emigrate to Hungary, the Serbian northward migration would continue throughout the Ottoman occupation.&lt;ref name=Fostikov52/&gt;

In 1395 the Ottomans attacked [[Wallachia]] to punish its ruler, [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]], for his incursions into their territory.&lt;ref name=Fine424&gt;Fine 1994, p.424.&lt;/ref&gt; Three Serbian vassals fought on the Ottoman side: King Marko, Lord Konstantin Dragaš, and Despot [[Stefan Lazarević]] (son and heir of Prince Lazar). The [[Battle of Rovine]], on 17&amp;nbsp;May 1395, was won by the Wallachians; Marko and Dragaš were killed.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956|pp=489}} After their deaths the Ottomans annexed their lands, combining them into an Ottoman province centred in [[Kyustendil]].&lt;ref name=Fine424/&gt; Thirty-six years after the Battle of Rovine, [[Constantine of Kostenets|Konstantin the Philosopher]] wrote the ''Biography of Despot Stefan Lazarević'' and recorded what Marko said to Dragaš on the eve of the battle: "I pray the Lord to help the Christians, no matter if I will be the first to die in this war."&lt;ref&gt;Konstantin 2000, "[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/liturgicka/konstantin-zitije_desp_stefana_c.html О погибији краља Марка и Константина Драгаша]".&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle goes on to state that Marko and Dragaš were killed in the battle.&lt;ref name="Ђурић1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ђурић|first=Иван|title=Сумрак Византије: време Јована VIII Палеолога (1392–1448)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPocAAAAYAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Народна књига|page=78|quote=У Дечанском летопису је, уз вест о боју на Ровинама, забележено како су тамо погинули Марко Краљевић и Константин Драгаш.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another medieval source that mentions Marko's death at the Battle of Rovine is the [[Dečani Chronicle]].&lt;ref name="Ђурић1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ђурић|first=Иван|title=Сумрак Византије: време Јована VIII Палеолога (1392–1448)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPocAAAAYAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Народна књига|page=78|quote=У Дечанском летопису је, уз вест о боју на Ровинама, забележено како су тамо погинули Марко Краљевић и Константин Драгаш.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folk poetry==

===Serbian epic poetry===
Marko Mrnjavčević is the most popular hero of [[Serbian epic poetry]],&lt;ref name=noyes&gt;Noyes 1913, "[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/hbs/hbs04.htm Introduction]".&lt;/ref&gt; in which he is called "Kraljević Marko" (with the word ''kraljević'' meaning "prince"&lt;ref name=noyes/&gt; or "king's son"). This informal title was attached to King Vukašin's sons in contemporary sources as a surname (Marko Kraljević),{{ref|Notec|n.b.3}} and it was adopted by the Serbian oral tradition as part of Marko's name.&lt;ref name=rudic&gt;Rudić 2001, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hercegovac pjeva uz gusle.JPG|right|thumb|185px|alt=Man seated under a tree bowing a musical instrument, surrounded by listeners|A [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] sings with a [[gusle]] in an 1823 drawing. Serbian epic poems were often sung,  accompanied by this traditional instrument.]]
Poems about Kraljević Marko do not follow a storyline; what binds them into a poetic cycle is the hero himself,&lt;ref name=deretic&gt;Deretić 2000, "[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/jderetic_knjiz/jderetic-knjiz_05_c.html Епска повесница српског народа]".&lt;/ref&gt; with his adventures illuminating his character and personality.&lt;ref name=low&gt;Low 1922, "[https://archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/n35/mode/2up The Marko of the Ballads]".&lt;/ref&gt; The epic Marko had a 300-year lifespan; 14th- to 16th-century heroes appearing as his companions&lt;ref name=deretic/&gt; include [[Miloš Obilić]], [[Hrelja|Relja Krilatica]], [[Vuk Grgurević|Vuk the Fiery Dragon]] and [[John Hunyadi|Sibinjanin Janko]] and his nephew, Banović Sekula.&lt;ref&gt;Popović 1988, pp.24–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Very few historical facts about Marko can be found in the poems, but they reflect his connection with the disintegration of the Serbian Empire and his vassalage to the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=deretic/&gt; They were composed by anonymous Serbian poets during the Ottoman occupation of their land. According to American [[Slavic studies|Slavicist]] George Rapall Noyes, they "combine tragic [[pathos]] with almost [[ribald]] comedy in a fashion worthy of an [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan]] playwright."&lt;ref name=noyes/&gt;

Serbian epic poetry agrees that King Vukašin was Marko's father. His mother in the poems was Jevrosima, sister of [[voivode]] Momčilo, the lord of the [[Pirlitor]] Fortress (on [[Durmitor|Mount Durmitor]] in [[Old Herzegovina]]). Momčilo is described as a man of immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a [[sabre]] with eyes. Vukašin murdered him with the help of the voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, [[Skadar]], and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo.&lt;ref&gt;Low 1922, "[https://archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/n47/mode/2up The Marriage of King Vukašin]".&lt;/ref&gt; This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary [[Momchil]], who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 [[Battle of Peritheorion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ćorović 2001, "[http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/3_7.html Стварање српског царства]".&lt;/ref&gt; According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a ''[[Slavic fairies#Vila|vila]]'' (Slavic mountain [[nymph]]) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.&lt;ref&gt;Bogišić 1878, [https://archive.org/stream/narodnepjesmeiz00bogigoog#page/n411/mode/2up pp. 231–2].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marko Kraljević i Musa Kesedžija.jpg|left|thumb|300px|alt=Two mounted men, brandishing weapons at each other|''Prince Marko and [[Musa Kesedžija]]'', 1900 painting by [[Vladislav Titelbah]]; Prince Marko is on the right]]
As Marko matured, he became headstrong; Vukašin once said that he had no control over his son, who went wherever he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into a large, strong man, with a terrifying appearance, which was also somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap pulled low over his dark eyes, his black moustache was the size of a six-month-old lamb and his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A [[Damascus steel|Damascus sabre]] swung at his waist, and a spear was slung across his back. Marko's [[pernach]] weighed 66&amp;nbsp;[[Oka (mass)|oka]]s ({{convert|85|kg}}) and hung on the left side of his saddle, balanced by a well-filled wineskin on the saddle's right side. His grip was strong enough to squeeze drops of water from a piece of dry [[European Cornel|cornel]] wood. Marko defeated a succession of champions against overwhelming odds.&lt;ref name=deretic/&gt;&lt;ref name=low/&gt;

The hero's inseparable companion was his powerful, talking piebald horse Šarac; Marko always gave him an equal share of his wine.&lt;ref name=low/&gt; The horse could leap three [[Spear#Infantry Spears 2|spear-length]]s high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko to capture the dangerous, elusive ''vila'' Ravijojla. She became his [[Blood brother|blood sister]], promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted [[Musa Kesedžija]] (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain a better man than himself.&lt;ref&gt;Low 1922, "[https://archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/20/mode/2up Marko Kraljević and the Vila]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Low 1922, "[https://archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/124/mode/2up Marko Kraljević and Musa Kesedžija]"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Miloš, Marko i vila.jpg|right|thumb|220px|alt=Two men riding together, guarded by a ghostly woman|Prince Marko, [[Miloš Obilić]] and the ''vila'' Ravijojla in a 1906 painting by [[Paja Jovanović]] inspired by the poem "Marko Kraljević and the Vila", which takes place on [[Miroč|Mount Miroč]]]]
Marko is portrayed as a protector of the weak and helpless, a fighter against Turkish bullies and injustice in general. He was an idealised keeper of patriarchal and natural norms: in a Turkish [[military camp]], he beheaded the Turk who dishonourably killed his father. He abolished the marriage tax by killing the tyrant who imposed it on the people of Kosovo. He saved the sultan's daughter from an unwanted marriage after she entreated him, as her blood brother, to help her. He rescued three Serbian voivodes (his blood brothers) from a dungeon and helped animals in distress. Marko was a rescuer and benefactor of people, and a promoter of life; "Prince Marko is remembered like a fair day in the year".&lt;ref name=deretic/&gt;

Characteristic of Marko was his reverence and love for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, following it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good on the path of moral improvement and Christian virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Popović 1988, pp.70–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.&lt;ref name=low/&gt;

Marko is represented as a loyal vassal of the Ottoman sultan, fighting to protect the potentate and his empire from outlaws. When summoned by the sultan, he participated in Turkish military campaigns.&lt;ref name=deretic/&gt; Even in this relationship, however, Marko's personality and sense of dignity were apparent. He occasionally made the sultan uneasy,&lt;ref name=low/&gt; and meetings between them usually ended like this:
{|

Marko's [[fealty]] was combined with the notion that the servant was greater than his lord, as Serbian poets turned the tables on their conquerors. This dual aspect of Marko may explain his heroic status; for the Serbs he was "the proud symbol expressive of the unbroken spirit that lived on in spite of disaster and defeat,"&lt;ref name=low/&gt; according to translator of Serbian epic poems David Halyburton Low.

In battle, Marko used not only his strength and prowess but cunning and trickery. Despite his extraordinary qualities he was not depicted as a superhero or a god, but as a mortal man. There were opponents who surpassed him in courage and strength. He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental goodness.&lt;ref name=low/&gt;

With his comic appearance and behaviour, and his remarks at his opponents' expense, Marko is the most humorous character in Serbian epic poetry.&lt;ref name=deretic/&gt; When a [[Black Arab (mythology)|Moor]] struck him with a mace, Marko said laughingly, "O valiant black Moor! Are you jesting or smiting in earnest?"&lt;ref&gt;Karadžić 2000, "[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/usmena/vkaradzic-pesme_II_c.html#_Toc494261514 Марко Краљевић укида свадбарину]".&lt;/ref&gt; Jevrosima once advised her son to cease his bloody adventures and plough the fields instead. He obeyed in a grimly humorous way,&lt;ref name=low/&gt; ploughing the sultan's highway instead of the fields. A group of Turkish [[Janissary|Janissaries]] with three packs of gold shouted at him to stop ploughing the highway. He warned them to keep off the furrows, but quickly wearied of arguing:

Marko, age 300, rode the 160-year-old Šarac by the seashore towards Mount Urvina when a ''vila'' told him that he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; [[hydromancy]] confirmed the ''vila''{{'}}s words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to [[Mount Athos]] and buried him at the [[Hilandar|Hilandar Monastery]] in an unmarked grave.&lt;ref&gt;Low 1922, "[https://archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/174/mode/2up The Death of Marko Kraljević]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epic poetry of Bulgaria and Macedonia===
"Krali Marko" has been one of the most popular characters in Bulgarian folklore for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;For further information, read {{cite book|year=1901|url=|author=Veliko Iordanov|title=Krali-Marko v bulgarskata narodna epika|publisher=Sbornik na Bulgarskoto Knizhovno Druzhestvo|location=Sofia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian epic tales in general (and those about Marko in particular) seem to originate from the southwestern part of the Bulgarian region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mihail Arnaudov |year=1961 |url=http://bulgarian-orthodox-church.org/slovo/narod/bnt12_1.txt |title=Българско народно творчество в 12 тома. Том 1. Юнашки песни. |language=Bulgarian |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015095416/http://bulgarian-orthodox-church.org/slovo/narod/bnt12_1.txt |archivedate=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily in the present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Therefore, the tales are also part of the ethnic heritage of present-day Macedonia.

According to local legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), sister of the [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] [[voivoda]] [[Momchil]] (who ruled territory in the [[Rhodope Mountains]]). At Marko's birth three ''[[narecnitsi]]'' (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting that he would be a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A ''[[samodiva (mythology)|samodiva]]'' named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the ''samodiva''{{'}}s milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the ''samodiva'' Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.&lt;ref&gt;The River Danube in Balkan Slavic Folksongs, Ethnologia Balkanica (01/1997), Burkhart, Dagmar; Issue: 01/1997 , pp.&amp;nbsp;53–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of Macedonian Literature 865–1944, Volume 112 of Slavistic Printings and Reprintings, Charles A. Moser, Publisher Mouton, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bulgarian folklorists who collected stories about Marko included educator [[Trayko Kitanchev]] (in the [[Resen (town)|Resen]] region of western Macedonia) and [[Marko Cepenkov]] of [[Prilep]] (throughout the region).&lt;ref&gt;Прилеп; зап. Марко Цепенков ([[СбНУ]] 2, с. 116–120, № 2 – "Марко грабит Ангелина").&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|In legends}}In legend==
South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are primarily based on myths much older than the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He was said to have helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in [[Demir Kapija]] ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of [[Bitola]], [[Mariovo]] and [[Tikveš]] in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.&lt;ref name=radenkovic/&gt;

Legend also has it that Marko acquired his strength after he was suckled by a ''vila''. King Vukašin threw him into a river because he did not resemble him, but the boy was saved by a cowherd (who adopted him, and a ''vila'' suckled him). In other accounts, Marko was a shepherd (or cowherd) who found a ''vila''{{'}}s children lost in a mountain and shaded them against the sun (or gave them water). As a reward the ''vila'' suckled him three times, and he could lift and throw a large boulder. An [[Istria]]n  version has Marko making a shade for two snakes, instead of the children. In a Bulgarian version, each of the three draughts of milk he suckled from the ''vila''{{'}}s breast became a snake.&lt;ref name=radenkovic/&gt;

Marko was associated with large, solitary [[boulder]]s and indentations in rocks; the boulders were said to be thrown by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse).&lt;ref name=radenkovic&gt;Radenković 2001, pp.293–7.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he did something memorable. They were often [[List of places named after Prince Marko|named after him]], and there are many [[Toponymy|toponyms]]—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name.&lt;ref&gt;Popović 1988, pp.41–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.&lt;ref name=radenkovic/&gt;

In some legends, Marko's wonder horse was a gift from a ''vila''. A Serbian story says that he was looking for a horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an enormously powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion.&lt;ref name=karadzic&gt;Karadžić 1852, pp.345–6, s.v. "Марко Краљевић".&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a ''vila''{{'}}s advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.&lt;ref name=radenkovic/&gt;

According to folk tradition Marko never died; he [[King in the mountain|lives on in a cave]], in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land.&lt;ref name=radenkovic/&gt; A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, "Oh God, what am I going to do now?" God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls on the ground and Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world.&lt;ref name=karadzic/&gt; Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with [[Elijah]] in heaven.&lt;ref name=radenkovic/&gt;

==In modern culture==

During the 19th century, Marko was the subject of several [[Adaptation (arts)|dramatization]]s. In 1831 the Hungarian drama ''Prince Marko'', possibly written by [[:hu:Balog István (színész)|István Balog]],&lt;ref name=Sarenac26&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was performed in [[Buda]] and in 1838, the Hungarian drama ''Prince Marko – Great Serbian Hero'' by [[Celesztin Pergő]] was staged in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].&lt;ref name=Sarenac26/&gt; In 1848 [[Jovan Sterija Popović]] wrote the [[tragedy]] ''The Dream of Prince Marko'', in which the legend of sleeping Marko is its central [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]. [[Petar Preradović]] wrote the [[drama]] ''Kraljević Marko'', which glorifies [[southern Slav]] strength. In 1863 [[Francesco Dall'Ongaro]] presented his Italian drama, ''The Resurrection of Prince Marko''.&lt;ref name=Sarenac26/&gt; In her collection of short stories from 1978, Nouvelles Orientales, Marguerite Yourcenar imagined an alternative,  inexplicable end to Marko's life (La Fin de Marko kraliévitch).

Of all Serbian epic or historical figures, Marko is considered to have given the most [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] to [[visual art]]ists;&lt;ref name="S06"&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a monograph on the subject lists 87 authors.&lt;ref name="S02"&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His oldest known depictions are 14th-century [[fresco]]es from [[Marko's Monastery]] and [[Prilep]].&lt;ref name=S05&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian Medieval Royal Attire|url=http://www.srpskoblago.org/gallery/main.php/main.php?g2_itemId=43&amp;g2_page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929014453/http://www.srpskoblago.org/gallery/main.php/main.php?g2_itemId=43&amp;g2_page=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-29|date=2006-11-21|accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 18th-century drawing of Marko is found in the [[Čajniče Gospels]], a medieval parchment manuscript belonging to a Serbian Orthodox church in [[Čajniče]] in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. The drawing is simple, unique in depicting Marko as a saint&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momirović|1956|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reminiscent of [[stećci]] reliefs.&lt;ref name="Šarenac 1996, p. 27"&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vuk Karadžić]] wrote that during his late-18th-century childhood he saw a painting of Marko carrying an [[ox]] on his back.&lt;ref name=karadzic/&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[lithography|lithographs]] of Marko were made by [[Anastas Jovanović]],&lt;ref name=S44&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdo Kikerec]]&lt;ref name="Šarenac 1996, p. 27"/&gt; and others. Artists who painted Marko during that century include  [[Mina Karadžić]],&lt;ref name=S44/&gt; [[Novak Radonić]]&lt;ref name=S45&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Đura Jakšić]].&lt;ref name=S45/&gt; Twentieth-century artists include [[Nadežda Petrović]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirko Rački]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uroš Predić]]&lt;ref name=S46&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paja Jovanović]].&lt;ref name=S46/&gt; A sculpture of Marko on Šarac by [[Ivan Meštrović]] was reproduced on a Yugoslavian banknote and stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Šarenac|1996|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern illustrators with Marko as their subject include [[Alexander Key]], [[Aleksandar Klas]], [[Zuko Džumhur]], [[Vasa Pomorišac]] and [[Bane Kerac]].&lt;ref name="S02"/&gt;

Princ Marko, and his Sabre was also inspiration for Current Serbian National Anthem "Boze Pravde". The song was taken from a theatre piece Markova Sablja, very popular among Serbs in 1872.

[[Motif (visual arts)|Motifs]] in multiple works are Marko and Ravijojla, Marko and his mother, Marko and Šarac, Marko shooting an arrow, Marko plowing the roads, the fight between Marko and Musa and Marko's death.&lt;ref&gt;Šarenac 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;6–14&lt;/ref&gt; Also, several artists have tried to produce a realistic portrait of Marko based on his frescoes.&lt;ref name=S05/&gt; In 1924 Prilep Brewery introduced a light beer, ''Krali Marko''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Krali Marko| url=http://www.prilepskapivarnica.com.mk/index.php/en/products/krali-marko| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615171945/http://www.prilepskapivarnica.com.mk/index.php/en/products/krali-marko| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2011-06-15| publisher=Prilep Brewery| accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard J. Ross''' is the [[Massachusetts State Senate|Massachusetts State Senator]] for the [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk]], [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol]], and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] districts, which includes parts of [[Attleboro, Massachusetts|Attleboro]], [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]], [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], and [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], and all of [[North Attleboro, Massachusetts|North Attleboro]], Ross's home town of [[Wrentham, Massachusetts|Wrentham]], [[Plainville, Massachusetts|Plainville]], [[Norfolk, Massachusetts|Norfolk]], [[Millis, Massachusetts|Millis]], [[Sherborn, Massachusetts|Sherborn]], [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]].&lt;ref name="ma-legis" /&gt; He is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and currently serves as the Senate [[Minority whip|Minority Whip]].

==Background==
Ross grew up in Wrentham, Massachusetts. He attended [[American University]]. After the sudden death of his father, Ross returned to Massachusetts and assumed the family business, R. R. Ross Funeral Home, in Wrentham. Ross attended the [[New England Institute of Technology|New England Institute]] of Anatomy, Science &amp; Embalming, and graduated with highest honor in 1975.  Prior to serving in the Massachusetts legislature, he served on the Wrentham Board of Health and the Wrentham Board of Selectmen.&lt;ref name="ma-legis"&gt;[http://www.malegislature.gov/People/Profile/RJR0 Member Profile – Richard J.

J. Ross Funeral Home.

==Political offices==
Ross has served in the state senate since May 2010, when he won a special election to succeed [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]]. This was the third time Ross was elected to a political office to succeed Brown.&lt;ref name="globe-2010" /&gt; From 2005 to 2010, Ross was a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] for the 9th Norfolk district.&lt;ref name="ma-legis" /&gt;

In the [[general election]] of [[Massachusetts general election, 2018|November 2018]], Ross was defeated by Democratic challenger Becca Rausch by approximately a two percent margin.&lt;ref name=Shira&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/11/democrats_pick_up_seats_in_mas.html |title=Democrats pick up seats in Massachusetts Legislature |first=Shira |last=Schoenberg |website=MassLive.com |date=November 7, 2018 |accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===S787 Controversy===
In 2013, state senator Ross filed S787,&lt;ref name="S787"&gt;[https://malegislature.gov/Bills/BillHtml/122340?generalCourtId=11 Text of S787]&lt;/ref&gt; which would restrict the dating and sex lives of people going through a divorce if they have children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In divorce, separation, or 209A proceedings involving children and a marital home, the party remaining in the home shall not conduct a dating or sexual relationship within the home until a divorce is final and all financial and custody issues are resolved, unless the express permission is granted by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/03/21/3417400/massachusetts-judge-sex/ Bill Forces People Going Through Divorce To Get A Judge’s Permission Before Having Sex In Own Home]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Massachusetts, divorces are not finalized until 120 days after the final paperwork is signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/divorcefaq.html#nisi After one signs divorce papers before a judge in Massachusetts is there a waiting period or are you divorced immediately?]&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 24, 2014, Ross defended his submission of the bill in a [[Facebook]] post, "This was a free petition that I filed at the request of a constituent. I am not the sponsor of this legislation, nor have I ever endorsed or spoken in favor of it." The Massachusetts Executive Office of Administration and Finance defines a 'free petition' as: "In Massachusetts all citizens have the right to petition the state legislature. This procedure is called the right of free petition. A citizen drafts and files a Petition and accompanying Bill. A legislator sponsors the Bill in the General Court. If a legislator disagrees with the contents of the Bill, he/she may indicate this by placing the phrase 'By request' after his/her name."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/legal-and-legislative-resources/ma-legislative-glossary.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Elect-Richard-J-Ross-for-State-Senate/286890596340]&lt;/ref&gt; The text of S787 specifies that it was filed by "Richard J. Ross, (BY REQUEST)".&lt;ref name="S787"/&gt;

'''Stephen C. Harrison''' is professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology, professor of pediatrics, and director of the Center for Molecular and Cellular Dynamics of [[Harvard Medical School]], head of the Laboratory of Molecular Medicine at [[Boston Children's Hospital]], and investigator of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/AIDS-Vaccine-Week/2005-08-22/082220053336AV.html |title=Awards - Stephen C. Harrison wins Bristol-Myers Squibb infectious diseases r |publisher=Newsrx.com |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
He received his B.A. in chemistry and physics from Harvard in 1963, and was then a Henry fellow at the [[MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] at [[Cambridge]]. In 1967, he received his Ph.D. in biophysics from Harvard, was a research fellow there as well as a junior fellow in the Society of Fellows, and joined the Harvard faculty in 1971.

==Research==
His wide-ranging studies of protein structure have contributed insights to [[virus|viral]] architecture, [[DNA]]–[[protein]] recognition, and [[cellular signaling]].

Harrison has made important contributions to [[structural biology]], most notably by determining and analyzing the structures of viruses and viral proteins, by [[crystallographic]] analysis of protein–DNA complexes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson JE, Ptashne M, Harrison SC |title=Structure of the repressor-operator complex of bacteriophage 434 |journal=Nature |volume=326 |issue=6116 |pages=846–52 |year=1987 |pmid=3553959 |doi=10.1038/326846a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ellenberger TE, Brandl CJ, Struhl K, Harrison SC |title=The GCN4 basic region leucine zipper binds DNA as a dimer of uninterrupted alpha helices: crystal structure of the protein-DNA complex |journal=Cell |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=1223–37 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1473154 |doi= 10.1016/s0092-8674(05)80070-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by structural studies of [[protein kinase|protein-kinase]] switching mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xu W, Harrison SC, Eck MJ |title=Three-dimensional structure of the tyrosine kinase c-Src |journal=Nature |volume=385 |issue=6617 |pages=595–602 |date=February 1997 |pmid=9024657 |doi=10.1038/385595a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiator of high-resolution virus crystallography, he has moved from his early work on [[tomato bushy stunt virus]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harrison SC |title=Structure of tomato bushy stunt virus.

A '''woman''' is a [[female]] [[human]] being. The term ''woman'' is usually reserved for an [[adult]], with ''[[girl]]'' being the usual term for a female [[child]] or [[Adolescence|adolescent]]. The term ''woman'' is also sometimes used to identify a female human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as "[[women's rights]]". Women with typical genetic development are usually capable of giving [[birth]] from [[puberty]] until [[menopause]]. There are also [[trans women]] (those who have a male [[sex assignment]] that does not align with their [[gender identity]]),&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"&gt;''Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression in Social Work Practice'', edited by Deana F. Morrow and Lori Messinger (2006, {{ISBN|0231501862}}), p. 8: "Gender identity refers to an individual's personal sense of identity as [man] or [woman], or some combination thereof."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intersex]] women (those born with sexual characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male or female).

== Etymology ==
The spelling of "woman" in English has progressed over the past millennium from ''wīfmann''&lt;ref&gt;"wīfmann": Bosworth &amp; Toller, ''Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' (Oxford, 1898–1921) p. 1219. The spelling "wifman" also occurs: C.T. Onions, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'' (Oxford, 1966) p. 1011&lt;/ref&gt; to ''wīmmann'' to ''wumman'', and finally, the modern spelling ''woman''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary, Second College Edition'', entry for "woman".&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Old English]], ''wīfmann'' meant "female human", whereas ''wēr'' meant "male human". ''Mann'' or ''monn'' had a gender-neutral meaning of "human", corresponding to Modern English "person" or "someone"; however, subsequent to the [[Norman Conquest]], ''man'' began to be used more in reference to "male human", and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term ''wēr''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=man man] – definition Dictionary.reference.com&lt;/ref&gt; The medial labial consonants f and m in ''wīfmann'' coalesced into the modern form "woman", while the initial element ''wīf'', which meant "female", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman ("wife").

It is a popular misconception&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/wb/wb04.htm ''The Woman's Bible'', By Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the Revising Committee, 1898]&lt;/ref&gt; that the term "woman" is etymologically connected to "womb". "Womb" is actually from the Old English word ''wambe'' meaning "stomach" (modern German retains the colloquial term "Wampe" from Middle High German for "potbelly").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=/data/ie/germet&amp;text_number=%20562|title=Germanic etymology : Query result|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/?s=wampe|title=dict.cc&amp;nbsp;— wampe&amp;nbsp;— Wörterbuch Englisch-Deutsch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological symbol ===
The [[Gender symbol|symbol]] for the planet and goddess [[Venus]] or [[Aphrodite]] in Greek is the sign also used in biology for the female sex.&lt;ref&gt;Jose A. Fadul. ''Encyclopedia of Theory &amp; Practice in Psychotherapy &amp; Counseling'' p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; It is a stylized representation of the goddess Venus's hand-[[mirror]] or an abstract symbol for the goddess: a circle with a small equilateral cross underneath. The Venus symbol also represented [[femininity]], and in ancient alchemy stood for [[copper]]. Alchemists constructed the symbol from a circle (representing [[spirit]]) above an equilateral cross (representing [[matter]]).

== Terminology ==
{{Further|girl|virgin|mother|wife|goodwife|lady|maid|maiden|widow|}}
'''Womanhood''' is the period in a human female's life after she has passed through childhood and adolescence, generally around age 18.

The word ''woman'' can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with ''girl''. The word ''girl'' originally meant "young person of either sex" in English;&lt;ref&gt;Used in Middle English from c. 1300, meaning 'a child of either sex, a young person'.  Its derivation is uncertain, perhaps from an Old English word which has not survived: another theory is that it developed from Old English 'gyrela', meaning 'dress, apparel': or was a diminutive form of a borrowing from another West Germanic Language. (Middle Low German has Gör, Göre, meaning 'girl or small child'.)  "girl, n.". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a ''female'' child.&lt;ref&gt;By late 14th century a distinction was arising between female children, often called  'gay girls'&amp;nbsp;– and male, or 'knave girls' -: a1375   William of Palerne  (1867) l. 816  ' Whan þe gaye gerles were in-to þe gardin come, Faire floures þei founde.' ('When the gay girls came into the garden, Fair flowers they found.') By the 16th century the unsupported word had begun to mean specifically a female:  1546   J. Heywood Dialogue Prouerbes Eng. Tongue i. x. sig. D,   'The boy thy husbande, and thou the gyrle his wyfe.'  The usage meaning 'child of either sex' survived much longer in [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]]. "girl, n.". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''girl'' is sometimes  used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman; however, during the early 1970s, feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. In particular, previously common terms such as ''office girl'' are no longer widely used. Conversely, in certain cultures which link family [[honor]] with female [[virginity]], the word ''girl'' (or its equivalent in other languages) is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the more-or-less obsolete English ''maid'' or ''maiden''.

There are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term "womanhood" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the [[menarche]]; "femininity" is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to [[gender role]]s; "womanliness" is like "femininity", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles; "femaleness" is a general term, but is often used as shorthand for "human femaleness"; "distaff" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate [[archaism]]; "muliebrity" is a [[neologism]] (derived from the Latin) meant to provide a female counterpart of "[[virility]]", but used very loosely, sometimes to mean merely "womanhood", sometimes "femininity" and sometimes even as a collective term for women.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Menarche, the onset of [[menstruation]], occurs on average at age 12–13. Many cultures have [[rites of passage]] to symbolize a girl's [[coming of age]], such as confirmation in some branches of [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/confirmation_1.shtml|title=BBC&amp;nbsp;— Religions&amp;nbsp;— Christianity: Confirmation|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bat mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]], or even just the custom of a special celebration for a certain [[birthday]] (generally between 12 and 21), like the [[quinceañera]] of Latin America.

In terms of [[biology]], the female [[sex organ]]s are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s are involved in nurturing children or, in some cultures, attracting a mate. The [[ovaries]], in addition to their regulatory function producing hormones, produce female gametes called [[ovum|eggs]] which, when [[fertilization|fertilized]] by male gametes ([[spermatozoon|sperm]]), form new genetic individuals. The [[uterus]] is an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and muscle to expel it when giving birth. The [[vagina]] is used in copulation and birthing, although the term vagina is often colloquially and incorrectly used in the English language for the [[vulva]] or external female genitalia, which consists of (in addition to the vagina) the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], the [[clitoris]], and the female [[urethra]]. The [[breast]] evolved from the sweat gland to produce milk, a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of mammals, along with live birth. In mature women, the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals; this prominence, not necessary for milk production, is probably at least partially the result of [[sexual selection]]. (For other ways in which men commonly differ physically from women, see [[Man#Biology and gender|man]].){{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

During early fetal development, embryos of both sexes appear gender-neutral. As in cases without two sexes, such as species that [[Asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]], the gender-neutral appearance is closer to female than to male. A fetus usually develops into a male if it is exposed to a significant amount of [[testosterone]] (typically because the fetus has a Y chromosome from the father). Otherwise, the fetus usually develops into a female, typically when the fetus has an X chromosome from the father, but also when the father contributed neither an X nor Y chromosome. Later at puberty, estrogen feminizes a young woman, giving her adult sexual characteristics.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

An imbalance of maternal hormonal levels and some chemicals (or drugs) may alter the secondary sexual characteristics of fetuses. Most women have the [[karyotype]] 46,XX, but around one in a thousand will be [[47,XXX]], and one in 2500 will be [[Turner syndrome|45,X]]. This contrasts with the typical male karotype of 46,XY; thus, the [[x chromosome|X]] and Y chromosomes are known as female and male, respectively. Because humans inherit mitochondrial DNA only from the mother's ovum, genetic studies of the female line tend to focus on [[Human mitochondrial genetics|mitochondrial DNA]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Whether or not a child is considered female does not always determine whether or not the child later will identify themselves that way (see [[gender identity]]). For instance, [[intersex]] individuals, who have mixed physical and/or genetic features, may use other criteria in making a clear determination. At birth, babies may be assigned a gender based on their genitalia. In some cases, even if a child had XX chromosomes, if they were born with a penis, they were raised as a male.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fausto-Sterling |first=Anne |title= Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c3lhYfZzIXkC |accessdate=2 July 2015 |year=2000 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0465077144 |pages=44–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[trans women]] who were assigned as male at birth, but identify as women;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transgender FAQ |url=https://www.glaad.org/transgender/transfaq |website=[[GLAAD]] |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are varying social, legal, and individual definitions with regard to these issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:11-stages-womanhood-1840s.jpg|thumb|left|"The Life &amp; Age of Woman – Stages of Woman's Life from the Cradle to the Grave",1849]]
Although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), because of a longer life expectancy there are only 81 men aged 60 or over for every 100 women of the same age. Women typically have a longer life expectancy than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-is-life-expectancy-lo |title=Why is life expectancy longer for women than it is for men? |publisher= Scientific American |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to a combination of factors: [[genetics]] (redundant and varied [[gene]]s present on [[sex chromosome]]s in women); [[sociology]] (such as the fact that women are not expected in most modern nations to perform [[conscription|military service]]); [[health]]-impacting choices (such as [[suicide]] or the use of [[cigarette]]s, and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]); the presence of the female hormone [[estrogen]], which has a cardioprotective effect in premenopausal women; and the effect of high levels of [[androgen]]s in men. Out of the total human population in 2015, there were 101.8 men for every 100 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2015.htm |title=United Nations Statistics Division&amp;nbsp;— Demographic and Social Statistics |website= unstats.un.org|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls' bodies undergo gradual changes during puberty, analogous  to but distinct from those experienced by boys. Puberty is the process of physical changes by which a child's [[Human body|body]] matures into an adult body capable of [[sexual reproduction]] to enable [[fertilisation]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s-either the ovaries or the [[Testicle|testes]]. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], breasts, and sexual organs. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal, physical differences between boys and girls are the [[Human genitals|genitalia]], the [[human penis|penis]] and the vagina. Puberty is a process that usually takes place between the ages 10–16, but these ages differ from girl to girl. The major landmark of girls' puberty is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12–13.&lt;ref name="Tanner"&gt;(Tanner, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title =Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Age at menarche in Canada: results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children &amp; Youth |publisher=BMC Public Health |year= 2010 |pmid=21110899 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-736 |pmc=3001737 |volume=10 |vauthors=Al-Sahab B, Ardern CI, Hamadeh MJ, Tamim H |journal=BMC Public Health |page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |url =http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf |title= Obstetrics and Gynaecology |first=Diana |last=Hamilton-Fairley |edition= Second |publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most girls go through menarche and are then able to become [[pregnant]] and [[childbirth|bear children]]. This generally requires internal fertilization of her eggs with the sperm of a man through [[sexual intercourse]], though [[artificial insemination]] or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see [[reproductive technology]]). The study of female reproduction and [[sex organ|reproductive organs]] is called [[gynaecology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gynaecology |title= gynaecology&amp;nbsp;— definition of gynaecology in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries |website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English |access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
{{further|Women's health|Maternal death}}
[[File:Pregnancy 26 weeks 1.jpg|upright|thumb|Pregnant woman]]
Women's health refers to health issues specific to human female anatomy. There are some diseases that primarily affect women, such as [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]]. Also, there are some [[sex-related illness]]es that are found more frequently or exclusively in women, e.g., [[breast cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], or [[ovarian cancer]]. Women and men may have different symptoms of an illness and may also respond to medical treatment differently. This area of medical research is studied by [[gender-based medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/news/advancing-case-gender-based-medicine|title=Advancing the case for gender-based medicine&amp;nbsp;— Horizon 2020 – European Commission|website=Horizon 2020|language=en|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of women's health has been taken up by many [[feminists]], especially where [[reproductive health]] is concerned. Women's health is positioned within a wider body of knowledge cited by, amongst others, the [[World Health Organization]], which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/social_determinants&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maternal mortality]] or maternal death is defined by [[WHO]] as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 99% of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. More than half of them occur in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and almost one third in [[South Asia]]. The main causes of maternal mortality are severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth), infections (usually after childbirth), [[pre-eclampsia]] and [[eclampsia]], unsafe abortion, and pregnancy complications from [[malaria]] and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Maternal mortality |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most European countries, Australia, as well as Japan and Singapore are very safe in regard to childbirth, while Sub-Saharan countries are the most dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproductive rights and freedom ==
[[File:Sterilization states.jpg|thumb|A poster from a 1921 [[eugenics]] conference displays the U.S. states that had implemented sterilization legislation]]

[[Reproductive rights]] are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]]. The [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] has stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figo.org/projects/reproductive_and_sexual_health |title=Resolution on Reproductive and Sexual Health &amp;#124; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics |publisher=Figo.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(...) the human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences.

Violations of reproductive rights include [[forced pregnancy]], [[forced sterilization]] and [[forced abortion]].

Forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many Western countries. Forced sterilization and forced abortion are reported to be currently practiced in countries such as [[Uzbekistan]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17612550 | work=BBC News | title=Uzbekistan's policy of secretly sterilising women | date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fjx63 |title=BBC Radio 4 - Crossing Continents, Forced Sterilisation in Uzbekistan |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/130409/china-mother-dies-after-forced-sterilization-one-child-policy |title=China 'one-child' policy: Mother of 2 dies after forced sterilization |publisher=GlobalPost |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 |title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18435126 | work=BBC News | title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage | date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_HiddenGulag2_Web_5-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of adequate laws on sexual violence combined with the lack of access to [[contraception]] and/or [[abortion]] are a cause of enforced pregnancy (see [[pregnancy from rape]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Culture and gender roles ==
{{Main|Gender role}}
[[Image:Weaving profile.jpg|thumb|A woman weaving. [[Textile]] work is traditionally and historically a female occupation in many cultures.]]

In many [[prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures, women assumed a particular cultural role. In [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, women were generally the gatherers of plant foods, small animal foods and fish, while men hunted meat from large animals.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In more recent history, gender roles have changed greatly. Originally, starting at a young age, aspirations occupationally are typically veered towards specific directions according to gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Sharpe| first1=S. |title=Just like a Girl |date=1976 |publisher=Penguin| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, [[middle class]] women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care. For poorer women, especially [[working class]] women, although this often remained an ideal,{{Specify |date=February 2007}} economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home. Many of the occupations that were available to them were lower in pay than those available to men.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As changes in the labor market for women came about, availability of employment changed from only "dirty", long hour factory jobs to "cleaner", more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded, women's participation in the U.S. labor force rose from 6% in 1900 to 23% in 1923. These shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes of women at work, allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented.{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|During [[World War II]], some women performed roles which would otherwise have been considered male jobs by the culture of the time]]

In the 1970s, many female academics, including scientists, avoided having children. However, throughout the 1980s, institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace. Even so, the inequalities at home stumped women's opportunities to succeed as far as men. Professional women are still generally considered responsible for domestic labor and child care. As people would say, they have a "double burden" which does not allow them the time and energy to succeed in their careers. Furthermore, though there has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men, a recent research study showed that women focused on issues of morality, fairness, and well-being, while men focused on social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Gere, J., &amp; Helwig, C.C.

"Psychology of Women Quarterly, 36", 301–313. doi: [http://pwq.sagepub.com/ 10.1177/0361684312444272]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, U.S. women's colleges required their women faculty members to remain single, on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once. According to Schiebinger, "Being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career." (p. 93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Schiebinger |first=Londa| title=Has Feminism Changed Science? : Science and Private Life| year=1999| publisher= Harvard University Press| location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |pages=92–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements advocate [[equality of opportunity]] for both sexes and [[civil rights|equal rights]] irrespective of gender. Through a combination of [[economics|economic]] changes and the efforts of the [[feminism|feminist]] movement,{{Specify|date=May 2007}}&lt;!-- Which one? The one that occupies university departments, the movements advocating specific rights, like the Suffragettes, first wave feminism, second wave, the collection of people who identify themselves as feminists? Be clear, please. --&gt; in recent decades women in many societies now have access to careers beyond the traditional [[homemaker]]. &lt;!-- Despite these advances, modern women in Western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as with the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and motherhood, and others. -- Clear this sentence of its vagueness before returning it to the article.--&gt; &lt;!-- [[Sexism]] can be a main concern and barrier for woman almost anywhere, though its forms, perception, and gravity varies between societies and social classes. -- This sentence can be read in so many ways there is no point in keeping it. Either make it clearer, or move the subject from general, hence vague, to specific and comprehensible. --&gt;

Although a greater number of women are seeking higher education, their salaries are often less than those of men. CBS News claimed in 2005 that in the United States women who are ages 30 to 44 and  hold a university degree make 62 percent of what similarly qualified men do, a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available. Some Western nations with greater inequity in pay are Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/13/national/main838207_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=U.S. Education Slips In Rankings | date=13 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations|UN]] [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] defines "violence against women" as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104. Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.}}

and identifies three forms of such violence: that which occurs ''in the family'', that which occurs ''within the general community'', and that which is perpetrated or condoned ''by the State''. It also states that "''violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= United Nations General Assembly |url= http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women&amp;nbsp;— UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements |publisher=UN Documents |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence against women remains a widespread problem, fueled, especially outside the West, by patriarchal social values, lack of adequate laws, and lack of enforcement of existing laws. Social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress towards protecting women from violence. For example, according to surveys by [[UNICEF]],  the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Jordan]], 87% in [[Mali]], 86% in [[Guinea]] and [[Timor-Leste]], 81% in [[Laos]], and 80% in the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |title= Statistics by Area&amp;nbsp;— Attitudes towards wife-beating&amp;nbsp;— Statistical table |publisher=Childinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |archivedate=2014-07-04 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that [[stoning]] as a punishment for [[adultery]] was supported by 82% of respondents in [[Egypt]] and [[Pakistan]], 70% in [[Jordan]], 56% [[Nigeria]], and 42% in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ |title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah &amp;#124; Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific forms of violence that affect women include [[female genital mutilation]], [[sex trafficking]], [[forced prostitution]], [[forced marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], [[honor killings]], [[acid throwing]], and [[dowry death|dowry related violence]]. Governments can be complicit in violence against women, for instance through practices such as [[stoning]] (as punishment for adultery).

There have also been many forms of violence against women which have been prevalent historically, notably the  [[Witch-hunt|burning of witches]], the sacrifice of [[widows]] (such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]]) and [[foot binding]]. The prosecution of women accused of [[witchcraft]] has a long tradition, for example [[witch trials in the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, rural North India, and Papua New Guinea) where belief in witchcraft is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21363894 | work=BBC News | title=Woman burned alive for 'sorcery' in Papua New Guinea | date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft. In [[Saudi Arabia]], witchcraft remains a crime [[punishable by death]], and in 2011 the country beheaded a woman for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/saudi-arabia-beheading-sorcery-shocking-2011-12-12 |title=Saudi Arabia: Beheading for 'sorcery' shocking &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/meast/saudi-arabia-beheading/ | work=CNN.com | title=Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery'| date=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the case that certain forms of violence against women have been recognized as criminal offenses only during recent decades, and are not universally prohibited, in that many countries continue to allow them. This is especially the case with [[marital rape]].&lt;ref&gt;In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women'' found that (p. 113): "Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 States. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offence in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted."[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736)'', stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "''hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract''"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html in the case of ''R v R'' in 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western World, there has been a trend towards ensuring [[gender equality]] within [[marriage]] and prosecuting [[domestic violence]], but in many parts of the world women still lose significant legal rights when entering a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf] In [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".{{cite web| url= http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }} In the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or to initiate other legal proceedings.[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/drc/Congo0602-09.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence against women greatly increases during times of [[war]] and [[armed conflict]], during [[military occupation]], or [[ethnic conflict]]s; most often in the form of [[war rape]] and [[sexual slavery]]. Contemporary examples of sexual violence during war include [[rape during the Armenian Genocide]], [[rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War]], [[rape in the Bosnian War]], [[rape during the Rwandan genocide]], and [[War rape#Democratic Republic of the Congo|rape during Second Congo War]]. In Colombia, the [[Colombian conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]] has also resulted in increased sexual violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/colombian-authorities-fail-stop-or-punish-sexual-violence-against-women-2012-10-04 |title=Colombian authorities fail to stop or punish sexual violence against women &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent case was the [[Sexual jihad]] done by [[ISIL]] where 5000–7000 Yazidi and Christian girls and children were sold into [[Sexual slavery]] during the [[Sexual violence in the Iraqi insurgency|genocide and rape of Yazidi and Christian women]], some of which jumped to their death from [[Mount Sinjar]], as described in a witness statement.&lt;ref name=rudaw-26082014&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Havidar|title=The Yezidi Exodus, Girls Raped by ISIS Jump to their Death on Mount Shingal|date=14 August 2014|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/140820142|publisher=[[Rudaw Media Network]]|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws and policies on violence against women vary by jurisdiction. In the [[European Union]], sexual harassment and human trafficking are subject to [[Directive (European Union)|directives]].&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2002/73/EC&amp;nbsp;— equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in different parts of the world dress in different ways, with their choices of clothing being influenced by local culture, religious tenets traditions, social norms, and fashion trends, amongst other factors. Different societies have different ideas about [[modesty]]. However, in many jurisdictions, women's choices in regard to dress are not always free, with laws limiting what they may or may not wear. This is especially the case in regard to [[Islam and clothing|Islamic dress]]. While certain jurisdictions legally mandate such clothing (the wearing of the headscarf), other countries forbid or restrict the wearing of certain [[hijab]] attire (such as [[burqa]]/covering the face) in public places (one such country is [[France]] – see [[French ban on face covering]]). These laws are highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Women’s right to choose their dress, free of coercion |url=https://doc.es.amnesty.org/cgi-bin/ai/BRSCGI/WOMENS%20RIGHT%20TO%20CHOOSE%20THEIR%20DRESS%20FREE%20OF%20COERCION?CMD=VEROBJ&amp;MLKOB=29309215959 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) – the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime&amp;nbsp;— differs significantly between different regions of the world. In 2016, the highest estimated TFR was in [[Niger]] (6.62 children born per woman) and the lowest in [[Singapore]] (0.82 children/woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;— Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most Sub-Saharan African countries have a high TFR, which creates problems due to lack of resources and contributes to [[overpopulation]], most Western countries currently experience a [[sub replacement fertility rate]] which may lead to  [[population ageing]] and [[population decline]].

In many parts of the world, there has been a change in family structure over the past few decades. For instance, in the West, there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the [[extended family]] to those which only consist of the [[nuclear family]]. There has also been a trend to move from marital fertility to non-marital fertility. Children born outside marriage may be born to [[cohabitation|cohabiting couples]] or to [[single parent|single women]]. While births outside marriage are common and fully accepted in some parts of the world, in other places they are highly stigmatized, with unmarried mothers facing ostracism, including violence from family members, and in extreme cases even [[honor killings]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130501013343/http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=91cf943a-3fa6-4fce-afec-4ab2c2a356fd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3523123.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkey condemns 'honour killings' | date=1 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[sex outside marriage]] remains illegal in many countries (such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeontheun.org/voices.asp?p=632 |title=Human Rights Voices&amp;nbsp;– Pakistan, August 21, 2008 |publisher=Eyeontheun.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121175822/http://www.eyeontheun.org/voices.asp?p=632 |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |title=Home |publisher=AIDSPortal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081026065259/http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |archivedate=2008-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |title=Iran |publisher=Travel.state.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801084310/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran,&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; Kuwait,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2f5665ae20b956cb8025675a0033cafb?Opendocument |title=United Nations Human Rights Website&amp;nbsp;– Treaty Bodies Database&amp;nbsp;– Document&amp;nbsp;– Summary Record&amp;nbsp;– Kuwait |publisher=Unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maldives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ja-Ma/Maldives.html |title=Culture of Maldives&amp;nbsp;– history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social |publisher=Everyculture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fakim |first=Nora |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19049000 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;– Morocco: Should pre-marital sex be legal? |publisher=BBC |date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.com/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaOman.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215043802/http://www.interpol.com/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaOman.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2007 |title=Legislation of Interpol member states on sexual offences against children&amp;nbsp;– Oman |publisher=Interpol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauritania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154358.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Mauritania |publisher=State.gov |date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Arab Emirates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dubai FAQs |url=http://www.dubaifaqs.com/education-dubai.php |title=Education in Dubai |publisher=Dubaifaqs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Judd |first=Terri |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/briton-faces-jail-for-sex-on-dubai-beach-863918.html |title=Briton faces jail for sex on Dubai beach&amp;nbsp;– Middle East&amp;nbsp;– World |work=The Independent |date=10 July 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/28/idUSL28849488._CH_.2400 |title=Sudan must rewrite rape laws to protect victims |agency=Reuters |date=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yemen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47387b712f.html/ |title=Refworld &amp;#124; Women's Rights in the Middle East and North Africa&amp;nbsp;– Yemen |publisher=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The social role of the [[mother]] differs between cultures. In many parts of the world, women with dependent children are expected to stay at home and dedicate all their energy to child raising, while in other places mothers most often return to paid work (see [[Working parent|working mother]] and [[Housewife|stay-at-home mother]]).

== Religion ==
{{Further|Women in Christianity|Women in Judaism|Women in Islam|Women in Mormonism|Women in Hinduism|Women in Sikhism|Women in Buddhism}}
Particular religious doctrines have specific stipulations relating to [[gender roles]], social and private interaction between the sexes, appropriate dressing attire for women, and various other issues affecting women and their position in society. In many countries, these religious teachings influence the [[criminal law]], or the [[family law]] of those jurisdictions (see [[Sharia law]], for example). The relation between religion, law and gender equality has been discussed by international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp/html/http%3Cspan%20class=%27pullme%27%3EIt%20has%20become%20increasingly%20clear%20that%20disasters%20are%20setting%20back%20efforts%20in%20development%20%E2%80%93%20they%20can%20cripple%20the%20economy,%20destroy%20infrastructure,%20and%20plunge%20more%20people%20into%20poverty%3C/span%3E://www.unisdr.org/www.sealthedeal2009.org/petition/html/story.asp?NewsID=46370&amp;Cr=religion&amp;Cr1=#.Ustsg_tpCKE |title=United Nations News Centre&amp;nbsp;— Harmful practices against women and girls can never be justified by religion&amp;nbsp;– UN expert |publisher=Un.org |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Main|Female education}}'''Female education''' includes areas of gender equality and access to education, and its connection to the alleviation of poverty. Also involved are the issues of single-sex education and religious education in that the division of education along gender lines as well as religious teachings on education have been traditionally dominant and are still highly relevant in contemporary discussions of educating females as a global consideration.

While the feminist movement has certainly promoted the importance of the issues attached to female education the discussion is wide-ranging and by no means narrowly defined. It may include, for example, [[HIV/AIDS]] education.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries. In some Western countries, women have surpassed men at many levels of education. For example, in the United States in 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60% of master's degrees, and 50% of doctorates.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Literacy ===
{{main|Literacy}}
World literacy is lower for females than for males. The CIA World Factbook presents an estimate from 2010 which shows that 80% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). Literacy rates are lowest in South and West Asia, and in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OECD countries ===

==== Education ====
The educational [[Sex ratio|gender gap]] in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years. Younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification: in 19 of the 30 OECD countries, more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64. In 21 of 27 OECD countries with comparable data, the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men. 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/31/0,2340,en_2649_201185_33710751_1_1_1_1,00.html Education Levels Rising in OECD Countries but Low Attainment Still Hampers Some, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development], Publication Date: 14 September 2004]. Retrieved December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
While women account for more than half of university graduates in several OECD countries, they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields, and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most OECD countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/13/0,2340,en_2649_33703_37682893_1_1_1_1,00.html Women in Scientific Careers: Unleashing the Potential, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development], {{ISBN|9264025375}}, 2006]. Retrieved December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common misconception that women have still not advanced in achieving academic degrees. According to Margaret Rossiter, a [[historian]] of science, women now earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States. However, although there are more women holding bachelor's degrees than men, as the level of education increases, the more men tend to fit the statistics{{clarify|reason="fit the statistics"? gibberish|date=August 2014}} instead of women. At the [[Postgraduate education|graduate level]], women fill 40 percent of the [[doctorate]] degrees (31 percent of them being in engineering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eisenhart, A. Margaret; Finkel, Elizabeth |title=Women (Still) Need Not Apply:The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=13–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While to this day women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men,{{clarify|reason=strongly suspect this is US-centric but cannot see the source|date=August 2014}} they are not being given the same chance to join faculty. Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is, the more difficult and time-consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there. In 1989, Harvard University tenured its first woman in chemistry, Cynthia Friend, and in 1992 its first woman in physics, Melissa Franklin. She also observed that women were more likely to hold their first [[professional]] positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions. According to Smith and Tang, as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions and only 29 percent of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Brainard, Susanne G.; Carlin, Linda |title=A six-year Longitudinal Study of Undergraduate Women in Engineering and Science:The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=24–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jobs ====
In 1992, women earned 9 percent of the PhDs awarded in [[engineering]], but only one percent of those women became professors.{{Citation needed|date = June 2014|reason = Unsourced statistical claim}} In 1995, 11 percent of professors in science and engineering were women. In relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1 percent of the total. Even in [[psychology]], a degree in which women earn the majority of PhDs, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19 percent in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science ?: Meters of Equity|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge: Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are underrepresented in government in most countries. In October 2013, the global average of women in national assemblies was 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm |title=Women in Parliaments: World and Regional Averages |publisher=Ipu.org |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suffrage]] is the civil right to [[vote]]. [[Women's suffrage in the United States]] was achieved gradually, first at state and local levels, starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and in 1920 women in the US received universal suffrage, with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Some Western countries were slow to allow women to vote; notably [[Switzerland]], where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=Experts In Women'S Anti-Discrimination Committee Raise Questions Concerning Reports Of Switzerland On Compliance With Convention |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liechtenstein]], in 1984, through [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|a women's suffrage referendum]].

== Science, literature and art ==
[[File:Clara Schumann 1878.jpg|thumb|upright|German composer [[Clara Schumann]] in 1878]]
{{Main article|Women in science|Women artists|Women writers}}
Women have, throughout history, made contributions to science, [[literature]] and [[art]]. One area where women have been permitted most access historically was that of [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] (prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was undertaken  by women; from the mid 18th century onwards medical monitoring of pregnant women started to require rigorous formal education, to which women did not generally have access, therefore the practice was largely transferred to men).&lt;ref name="Gelis"&gt;Gelis, Jacues. History of Childbirth. Boston: Northern University Press, 1991: 96–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bynum, W.F., &amp; Porter, Roy, eds. Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine. London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1051–1052.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing was generally also considered acceptable for upper class women, although achieving success as a female writer in a male dominated world could be very difficult; as a result several women writers adopted a male pen name (e.g. [[George Sand]], [[George Eliot]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Women have been [[composer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], [[singer]]s, [[Conducting|conductors]], [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. There are music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and [[classical music]] singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women [[record producer]]s, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "... to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "... too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "... to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap |title=CBC Music |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |archivedate=2016-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks, ... the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;

According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the classical music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[music producer]]s, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yazid Sabeg''' (born 8 January 1950 in [[Guelma]], [[Algeria]]), is the [[president]] of the administrative council of the French high-technology firm [[:fr:CS Communication et Systèmes|CS Communication and Systems]] and also a member of the French [[:fr:Institut de Relations Internationales et Stratégiques|Institute of International and Strategic Relations]].

==Origins and education==

Born to a [[Stevedore|docker]] father, he moved to what was then metropolitan [[France]] in 1952, and did his studies at Faidherbe Secondary School in [[Lille]] and then at the [[University of Paris I]] where he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in economic and social sciences.

==Career==

Sabeg began his career at a subsidiary of [[Crédit Lyonnais]] Bank. In 1990, after an experience in [[Spie Batignolles]], he founded a financial firm thanks to which he took control of the Compagnie des Signaux, known as CS Communication et Systèmes.

His success in the business world, coupled with his [[Maghreb]]ian origins, have given him a lot of media coverage.
