{{Use British English|date=June 2016}}

'''Anglicisation''' (or '''anglicization''', see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|English spelling differences]]), occasionally '''anglification, anglifying, Englishing''', refers to modifications made to foreign words, names and phrases to make them easier to spell, pronounce, or understand in English.&lt;ref&gt;English in Wales: diversity, conflict, and change - Page 19 Nikolas Coupland, Alan Richard Thomas - 1990 "'Anglicisation' is one of those myriad terms in general use which everyone understands and hardly anyone defines. It concerns the process by which non-English people become assimilated or bound into an ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The British World: Diaspora, Culture, and Identity - Page 89 Carl Bridge, Kent Fedorowich, Carl Bridge Kent Fedorowich - 2003 "Beyond gaps in our information about who or what was affected by anglicisation is the matter of understanding the process more fully in terms of agency, periodisation, and extent and limitations."&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to the respelling of foreign words, often to a more drastic degree than [[romanisation]]. One example is the word "dandelion", modified from the French ''dent-de-lion'' (“lion’s tooth”, because of the sharply indented leaves).

Anglicising non-English words for use in English is just one case of the [[loanword|widespread domestication of foreign words]] that is common to many languages, sometimes involving shifts in meaning. One example is the German word ''Felleisen'' (a backpack), a germanization of the French word ''valise'' (small suitcase).

This term does not cover the unmodified adoption of foreign words into English (kindergarten); the unmodified adoption of English words into foreign languages (internet, computer, web), or the voluntary or enforced adoption of the English language or of British or American customs and culture in other countries or ethnic groups, also known as social and economic anglicisation. (Examples being the action of the English crown in the Celtic regions of the United Kingdom, in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall; the policy on use of the English language as one of the causes contributing to the [[South African Wars (1879–1915)]];&lt;ref&gt;”Between 1828 and 1834 the British set up a new court system in the [Cape] colony, replacing Dutch with English as the official language, despite the fact that the majority of the settlers only spoke Dutch.”&lt;/ref&gt; or the adoption of English as a personal, preferred language in countries where that language is not native, but has become for historical reasons the language of government, commerce, and instruction.)

== Modified loan words ==
{{main|Loanword}}
Non-English words may be anglicised by changing their form and/or pronunciation to something more familiar to English speakers. Changing grammatical endings is especially common. The Latin word ''obscenus'' {{IPA|/obskeːnʊs/}} has been imported into English in the modified form "obscene" {{IPA|/obˈsiːn/}}. The plural form of a foreign word may be modified to more conveniently fit English norms, like using "indexes" as the plural of index, rather than indices, as in Latin. The word "opera" (itself the plural form of the Latin word ''opus'') is understood in English to be a singular noun, so it has received an English plural form, "operas". The English word "damsel" is an anglicisation of the [[Old French]] ''damoisele'' (modern ''demoiselle''), meaning "young lady". Another form of anglicising is the inclusion of a foreign [[Article (grammar)|article]] as part of a noun (such as [[wikt:alkali|alkali]] from the Arabic ''al-qili''). "Rotten Row", the name of a London pathway that was a fashionable place to ride horses in the 18th and 19 centuries, is an adaptation of the French phrase ''Route du Roi''. The word "genie" has been anglicized via Latin from [[jinn]] or djinn from {{lang-ar|الجن}}, {{transl|ar|ALA|al-jinn}} originally meaning demon or spirit. Some changes are motivated by the desire to preserve the pronunciation of the word in the original language, such as the word "schtum", which is phonetic spelling for the German word ''stumm'', meaning silent.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist 13 May 2017, page 53: "The ultimate concession is to give activists representation on the board in return for keeping schtum."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "charterparty"&lt;ref&gt;a charterparty is a maritime contract between a shipowner and a charterer for the hire of a ship or yacht.&lt;/ref&gt; is an anglicisation of the French [[homonym]] ''charte partie'';&lt;ref&gt;.e. a "split paper", or a document written in duplicate so that each party retains half.&lt;/ref&gt; the "party" element of "charterparty" does not mean "a party to the contract".

The French word "homage" was introduced by the Normans after 1066,&lt;ref&gt;Earl and nobles would pay "homage" to the king.&lt;/ref&gt; and its pronunciation became anglicised as /ˈhɒmɪdʒ/, with stress on the first syllable; but in recent times showbiz and Hollywood have taken to pronouncing "homage" in the French fashion, rhyming with "fromage".{{CitationNeeded|date=November 2018}}

== Modified place names ==
{{main|English exonyms}}
Some foreign place names are commonly anglicised in English. Examples include the [[Denmark|Danish]] city København ([[Copenhagen]]), the [[Russia]]n city Москва Moskva ([[Moscow]]), the [[Sweden|Swedish]] city Göteborg ([[Gothenburg]]), the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city Den Haag ([[The Hague]]), the [[Spain|Spanish]] city of Sevilla ([[Seville]]), and the [[Egypt]]ian city of القاهرة Al-Qāhira ([[Cairo]]).

Such anglicisation was once more common. In the late 19th century, however, use of non-English place names in English began to become more common. When dealing with languages that use the same [[Latin alphabet]] as English, names are now more usually{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} written in English as in their local language, sometimes even with [[diacritical mark]]s that do not normally appear in English. With languages that use non-Latin alphabets, such as the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Korean language|Korean]] [[Hangul]], and other alphabets, a direct [[transliteration]] is typically used, which is then often pronounced according to English rules. Non-Latin based languages may use standard romanisation systems, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Rōmaji]] or [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] [[Pīnyīn]]. The Japanese and Chinese names in English follow these spellings with some common exceptions, usually without Chinese tone marks and without Japanese macrons for long vowels: Chóngqìng to [[Chongqing]] (重慶, 重庆), Shíjiāzhuāng to [[Shijiazhuang]] (石家莊, 石家庄), both in [[China]]; Kyōto to [[Kyoto]] (京都) in [[Japan]].

Many English names for foreign places have been directly taken over from the French version, sometimes unchanged, such as [[Cologne]], [[Rome]], [[Munich]], [[Naples]], sometimes only slightly changed, like [[Vienna]] (Vienne), [[Venice]] (Venise), [[Lisbon]] (Lisbonne), [[Seville]] (Séville). The English city-name for the Czech capital, [[Prague]] (Praha), is taken with spelling unaltered from the French name for the city, itself descended from the Latin name for the city (Praga), which had been borrowed from an earlier Czech name (pre-dating the /g/&gt;/h/ shift).

De-anglicisation has become a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under [[colonialism|colonial]] rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject.&lt;ref name=ALD&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gaeilge.org/deanglicising.html | title=The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland | first=Douglas | last=Hyde | date=25 November 1892 | accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title       = "de-anglicisation", in Free Online Dictionary
| url         = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/de-anglicization
| publisher   =
| accessdate  = 2013-10-21
| quote       = the elimination of English influence, language, customs, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following centuries of [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English rule in Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] delivered an argument for de-anglicisation before the [[National Literary Society|Irish National Literary Society]] in Dublin, 25 November 1892: "When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and, indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English."&lt;ref name=ALD/&gt; Despite its status as an [[official language]], Irish has been reduced to a [[minority language]] in Ireland due to centuries of English rule, as is the case in North America where [[indigenous languages]] have been replaced by that of the British colonists. In the process of removing the signs of their colonial past, anglicised names have been officially discouraged in many places: [[Ireland]]'s Kingstown, named by [[King George IV]], reverted to its original Irish name of [[Dún Laoghaire]] in 1920, even before Irish independence in 1922; [[India]]'s Bombay is now [[Mumbai]], even though this is not the oldest local name (see [[Mumbai#Etymology|Toponymy of Mumbai]]) and "Bombay" is still commonly used in the city; Calcutta is now [[Kolkata]] and Madras is [[Chennai]]. Bangladesh's Dacca is [[Dhaka]]. Many Chinese endonyms have become de-anglicised or otherwise replaced with the more recent [[Hanyu Pinyin]] Romanization scheme: [[Guangzhou|Canton]] is now more commonly called [[Guangzhou]] (廣州, 广州), and [[Peking]] is generally referred to as [[Beijing]] (北京), although this reflected a name change from Beiping (Peiping) to Beijing (Peking) with the de-anglicisation of the name taking place after the name change to reflect a pronunciation change in the newly established [[Beijing dialect]]-based Mandarin.

In Scotland, many place names in [[Scots Gaelic]] were anglicised, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally because of unfamiliarity with Gaelic. Often the etymology of a place name is lost or obscured, such as in the case of [[Kingussie]], from "Cinn a' Ghiuthsaich" (“The Heads of the Pine Forest”). In [[Wales]], a large number of place names were anglicised, with some examples including: [[Caernarfon]] became Carnarvon, [[Conwy]] became Conway, [[Llanelli]] became Llanelly, Caerdydd became [[Cardiff]]. Many of these place names have since reverted, especially in the west of the country (as is the case for Llanelli, Caernarfon, Conwy and Porthmadog), though in the east Welsh and English spellings of place names are often seen side-by side even when very similar to each other, such as with [[Rhyl]]/Y Rhyl, or [[Blaenavon]]/Blaenafon.

In other cases, now well-established anglicised names, whatever their origin, have remained in common use where there is no national pride at stake. This is the case with [[Ghent]] (Gent, or Gand), [[Munich]] (München), [[Cologne]] (Köln), [[Vienna]] (Wien), [[Naples]] (Napoli), [[Rome]] (Roma), [[Milan]] (Milano), [[Athens]] (Αθήνα, Athina), [[Moscow]] (Москва, Moskva), [[Saint Petersburg]] (Санкт-Петербург, Sankt-Peterburg), [[Warsaw]] (Warszawa), [[Prague]] (Praha), [[Bucharest]] (Bucureşti), [[Belgrade]] (Београд, Beograd), [[Lisbon]] (Lisboa), and other European cities whose names have been familiar in their anglicised forms for centuries. However, the present local names sometimes appear as alternatives on maps, and in public places (airports, road signs).

Sometimes a place name might appear anglicised compared with the current name, but the form being used in English is actually an older name that has since been changed. For example, [[Turin]] in the [[Piedmont]] province of [[Italy]] was named Turin in the original [[Piedmontese language]], but is now officially known as [[Torino]] in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0206_060206_torino.html |title=From "Turin" to "Torino": Olympics Put New Name on the Map |date=March 6, 2006 |first=James |last=Owen |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=2008-03-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212064948/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0206_060206_torino.html |archivedate=12 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Olympic Committee]] made the choice to regard the city officially as "Torino" throughout the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. The English and French name for [[Florence]] in Italy is closer to the original name in [[Latin]] (''Florentia'') than is the modern Italian name (Firenze).

== Personal names ==
{{main|List of English translated personal names}}

===Historic names===
In the past, the names of people from other language areas were anglicised to a higher extent than today. This was the general rule for names of Latin or (classical) Greek origin. Today, the anglicised name forms are often retained for the more well-known persons, like [[Aristotle]] for Aristoteles, and [[Adrian IV|Adrian]] (or later [[Hadrian]]) for Hadrianus. However, less well-known persons from antiquity are now often given their full original-language name (in the [[nominative]] case, regardless of its case in the English sentence).

For royalty, the anglicisation of personal names was a general phenomenon, especially until recently, such as [[Charles]] for Carlos, Karoly, and Karl, or [[Frederic (given name)|Frederic]] for Friedrich or Fredrik. Anglicisation of the Latin is still the rule for popes: [[Pope John Paul II]] instead of Ioannes Paulus II, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] instead of Benedictus XVI, [[Pope Francis]] instead of Franciscus.

The anglicisation of medieval Scottish names consists of changing them from a form consistent with [[Scottish Gaelic]] to the [[Scots language]], which is an [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian language]].  For instance, the king known in Scottish Gaelic as Domnall mac [[Causantín mac Cináeda|Causantín]] (Domnall son of Causantín) is known in Scots as [[Donald II of Scotland|Donald, son of Constantine]].

=== Immigrant names ===
{{main|Anglicisation of names}}
During the time in which there were large influxes of immigrants from [[Europe]] to the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 19th and 20th centuries, the names of many immigrants were never changed by immigration officials,(as demonstrated in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'')&lt;ref name=GodfatherIIImmigrationNameChange&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wr-neLAXLx4C&amp;pg=PA214 |title=The Godfather and American Culture: How the Corleones Became "Our Gang"|first=Chris|last=Messenger|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|year=2002|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}
* &lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; "...arrives at [[Ellis Island]] in 1901 (film version) and accepts the change of his name to "Corleone..." — pg. 214, ¶ 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but only by personal choice.

[[French people|French]] immigrants to the United States (of [[Huguenot]] or [[French Canadian]] background) often accommodated those unfamiliar with [[French language|French]] pronunciations and spellings by altering their surnames in either of two ways: spellings were changed to fit the traditional pronunciation (Pariseau became Parizo, Boucher became Bushey, Mailloux became Mayhew), or pronunciations were changed to fit the spelling (Benoît, pronounced {{IPA-fr|bənwa}}, became {{IPAc-en|b|ɛ|n|ˈ|ɔɪ|t}} Benedict). In some cases, it could go either way (Gagné, pronounced {{IPA-fr|ɡaɲe}}, became {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|ɡ|n|i}} or Gonyea), or something only slightly similar; (Bourassa became Bersaw).

Most Irish names have been anglicised. An example is the surnames of many [[Ireland|Irish]] families&amp;nbsp;– for example, [[Ó Briain]] has often become O'Brien, [[Ó Rothláin]] became Rowland, [[O'Neill dynasty|Ó Néill]] became O'Neill, and some surnames may be shortened, like Ó Gallchobhair to just [[Gallagher (surname)|Gallagher]]. Likewise, native [[Scotland|Scottish]] names were altered such as Somhairle to Sorley, Mac Gill-Eain to MacLean, and Mac Aoidh to MacKay. Many [[Wales|Welsh]] names have also been altered, such as "ap Hywell" to [[Powell (surname)|Powell]], or "ap Siôn" to [[Jones (surname)|Jones]].

German names of immigrants were also anglicised (such as Bürger to Burger, Schneider to Snyder) in the course of German immigration waves during times of political and economic instability in the late 19th and early 20th century. A somewhat different case was the politically motivated change of dynasty name in 1917 by the royal family of the United Kingdom from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] to the [[House of Windsor]].  Incidentally, Saxe-Coburg was already an anglicisation of the German original {{lang|de|Sachsen-Coburg}}.

Many Bengali surnames have been anglicised. Banerjee, Chatterjee and Mukherjee are anglicised forms of Bandhopadhay, Chatophadhay and Mukhopadhay respectively{{Dubious|date=September 2016|reason=Too different. Some intermediary must exist, such as colloquial pronunciation or shortened forms. Also citation needed.}}.

The anglicisation of a personal name now usually depends on the preferences of the bearer. Name changes are less common today for Europeans emigrating to the United States than they are for people originating in [[East Asian]] countries (except for [[Japan]], which no longer has large-scale emigration). However, unless the spelling is changed, European immigrants put up with (and in due course accept) an anglicised pronunciation: "[[Lewinsky]]" will be so pronounced, unless the "w" becomes a "v", as in "Levi". "[[Głowacki]]" will be pronounced "Glowacki", even though in Polish pronunciation it is "Gwovatski". "[[Weinstein]]" is usually pronounced with different values for the two "-ein-" parts, ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|aɪ|n|s|t|iː|n}}.

==Ethnonyms==
As is the case with place names and personal names, in some cases ethnic designations may be anglicised based on a term from a language other than that of the group described. For example, the names Germany (the country), German (the language), and Germans (the people) are minor modifications of the Latin designation (''Germania''), and not of the local names (Deutschland, Deutsch, Deutsche).

Some [[ethnonym]]s have been considered offensive, although not always by the group involved, but because they had been used by others or in the past in a derogatory sense and were therefore considered tainted, and requiring replacement for that reason. Examples are [[Gypsy]], [[Negro]], [[Vandal]], [[San people|Bushman]], [[Eskimo]], [[Philistinism]]. This change is not, however, a matter of anglicisation but of [[political correctness]].

== Social anglicisation ==
Social and economic anglicisation was an important objective of the English crown in the Celtic regions of the United Kingdom, in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Cartrball Poets and politics: continuity and reaction in Irish poetry, 1558-1625 - Page 114  - 1998 "... Ulster counties with English and Scots settlers was soon set in motion. The plantation concept was underpinned by the crown's objectives of economic and social anglicisation of these areas. The two east-Ulster counties of Antrim and Down, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Social anglicisation was also a feature in some sectors of society under the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakamal Mukerjee ''A history of Indian civilization'' Volume 2 - Page 411 1958 "For some decades it appeared that the dissemination of Western learning would bring about a complete social anglicisation and wholesale conversion of the people to Christianity in Bengal. But a cultural counter-movement soon started in ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/family_03_welshnaming.shtml|title=BBC Wales  - History - Themes  - Welsh naming|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Vietnamese sentiment''' involves hostility or hatred that is directed towards [[Vietnamese people]], or the state of [[Vietnam]].

== Incidents by country ==

=== Cambodia ===
{{see also|Cambodian genocide|Cambodian–Vietnamese War}}
Anti-Vietnamese sentiment dates back in Cambodia since the [[Khmer Empire]], as Cambodia was constantly invaded by the Vietnamese [[Nguyễn lords]]. The Khmer inhabited [[Mekong Delta]] started to become inundated with Vietnamese and in response the Vietnamese were subjected to Cambodian retaliation.&lt;ref name="Kiernan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Kiernan|title=Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5p7cRyK748C&amp;pg=PA158|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne Univ. Publishing|isbn=978-0-522-85477-0|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Vietnamese successfully conquered [[Champa]] as part of the Vietnamese territory, the Vietnamese then moved to conquer Khmer in Mekong Delta. Following the beginning of [[French Cochinchina]] with the arrival of European troops and missionary, the Cambodians told Catholic European envoys that the Vietnamese persecution against Catholics justified retaliatory attacks launched against the Vietnamese colonists in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="Kiernan2008"/&gt;

In 1978, under the administration of [[Democratic Kampuchea]], especially when Cambodian socialists began to rebel in the eastern zone of Cambodia, [[Pol Pot]] ordered his armies to exterminate 1.5 million eastern Cambodians which branded as "Cambodian with Vietnamese minds" along with the 50 million Vietnamese in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Genocide: Vol. 1-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q30HcvCVuIC&amp;pg=PA132|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-87436-928-1|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a war with the Vietnamese when the Vietnamese began to retaliate over the inhumane genocide and subsequently overthrow the [[Khmer Rouge]] from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty|author2=International Development Research Centre (Canada)|title=The Responsibility to Protect: Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31qFeSkSb5IC&amp;pg=PA58|date=January 2001|publisher=IDRC|isbn=978-0-88936-963-4|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Cambodia [[Norodom Sihanouk]] at the time also plead to United States President [[Lyndon B.

'''Barker Beach''' is a small beach and rocky coastal area on the west side of  [[Alcatraz Island]], off the coast of [[San Francisco]], California. It lies just south of the long two-story [[New Industries Building]]. During the foggy, early morning hours of Friday, January 13, 1939, five inmates - William "Ty" Martin (AZ-370), Henry Young (AZ-244), Rufus McCain (AZ-267), Dale Stamphill (AZ-435), and Arthur "Doc" Barker (AZ-268) - broke out of their D-Block cells and climbed out of a window that had its bars severed in advance, with the sabotage camouflaged with paint and putty. The five men made it to the water's edge and began to look for driftwood to build a raft. In the meantime, their absence was discovered and guards swarmed the island with rifles and machine guns. Dark figures were spotted on the western shore and guards opened fire. Stamphill was shot in the legs multiple times but recovered. Doc Barker took a slug in the head and died several hours later. The remaining three inmates gave up immediately and were recaptured without injury.  The beach was later named after Doc Barker by the National Park Service.&lt;ref name="Maravelis2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maravelis|first=Peter|title=San Francisco Noir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJcQyGgZ3lsC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 October 2005|publisher=Akashic Books|isbn=978-1-888451-91-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[negotiation theory]], the '''best alternative to a negotiated agreement''' or '''BATNA''' is the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. This could include diverse situation, such as suspension of negotiations, transition to another negotiating partner, appeal to the court's ruling, the execution of strikes, and the formation of other forms of alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mk.co.kr/cp/pop/desc.php?from=B&amp;to=C&amp;page=0&amp;so=all|title=::증권용어사전::|website=dic.mk.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator.  A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA.  Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, [[time value of money]] and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.

==Overview==
The BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/ Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | Negotiation Experts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2013}} however without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yarooms.com/blog/batnaman-wins Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | YArooms]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options.{{Third-party-inline|date=February 2015}} This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating. Negotiators also need to be aware of the other negotiator's BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.&lt;ref&gt;Negotiation, Readings, Exercises and Cases, Roy J. Lewicki{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;&lt;ref name="Nolan-Haley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan-Haley|first=Jaqueline M|title=Alternative Dispute Resolution in a Nutshell|year=2001|publisher=Thomson West|isbn=978-0-314-18014-8 |pages=39–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theoretical example of this is ''adversarial approach style negotiation''.&lt;ref name="Nolan-Haley" /&gt; Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury" /&gt; According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.

Attractive alternatives are needed to develop a strong BATNA. In the best-selling book ''Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In'', the authors give 3 suggestions of how to accomplish this:

# Inventing a list of actions one might take if no agreement is reached
# Converting some of the more promising ideas and transforming them into tangible and partial alternatives
# Selecting the alternative that sounds best

In negotiations involving different cultures, all parties need to account for cultural cognitive behaviors and should not let judgments and biases affect the negotiation. The individual should be separate from the objective.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

The purpose here, as [[Philip Gulliver]] mentions, is for negotiation parties to be aware.&lt;ref name=Gulliver&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulliver|first=P.H|authorlink=Philip Gulliver|title=Disputes and Negotiation: A Cross Culture Perspective|year=1979|publisher=Academic Press|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation at all levels, including prejudice-free thoughts, emotion-free behavior, bias-free behavior are helpful according to Morris and Gelfand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Morris|first1=Michael W.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Michele J.|title=Cultural Differences and Cognitive Dynamics: Expanding the Cognitive Perspective on Negotiation|editor1-last=Gelfand|editor1-first=Michele J.|editor2-last=Brett|editor2-first=Jeanne M.|work=The Handbook of Negotiation and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsOfOIzoZigC&amp;pg=PA45|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4586-4|pages=45–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

BATNA was developed by negotiation researchers [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]] of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON), in their series of books on [[Principled negotiation]] that started with ''[[Getting to YES]]'', unwittingly duplicating the [[game theory]] concept of a disagreement point from [[bargaining problem]]s pioneered by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[John Forbes Nash]] decades earlier.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher and Ury|first=Roger and William|title=Getting to YES|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-311875-6|pages=1–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myerson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|title=Nash Equilibrium and the History of Economic Theory|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/rmyerson/research/jelnash.pdf|publisher=Journal of Economic Literature|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nash Equilibrium]] is reached among a group of players when no player can benefit from changing strategies if every other player sticks to their current strategy.&lt;ref name="Hawkins and Steiner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkins and Steiner |first=Jeff and Neil |title=The Nash Equilibrium Meets Batna |url=http://www.hnlr.org/print/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/257-264.pdf |work=Gamed Therory Varied Uses in ADR |publisher=Harvard University Press |accessdate=1 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228140045/http://www.hnlr.org/print/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/257-264.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amy and Phil are in Nash Equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can, taking into account Phil's decision, and Phil is making the best decision he can, taking into account Amy's decision.

{{Distinguish|Taschen Bibliotheca Universalis}}

'''''Bibliotheca universalis''''' (1545&amp;ndash;49) was the first truly comprehensive "universal" listing of all the books of the [[History of printing|first century of printing]]. It was an alphabetical [[bibliography]] that listed all the known books printed in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}}

== ''Bibliotheca'' (1545) ==

The [[Swiss]] scholar [[Conrad Gessner]] started to compile his extensive work on ''Bibliotheca universalis''{{sfn|Gessner|1545}} at the age of 25. He first visited as many of the [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] [[libraries]] as he could find. His motivation was partly a fear of the loss of precious manuscripts, such as the destruction of the library at [[Buda]], by the Turks in 1526.{{sfn|Raven|2004}} He described the project in its title, as involving works "extant and not, ancient and more recent down to the present day, learned and not, published and hiding in libraries".{{sfn|Blair|2010}} He published the completed work in 1545 in Zurich, after some four years of research. At the time, he wrote "In truth I rejoice and thank God because I have finally gotten out of the labyrinth in which I was trapped for almost three years".{{sfn|Norman|2014}}&lt;ref name=Anzovin/&gt; It included his own bio-bibliography.{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}} ''Bibliotheca universalis'' was the first modern bibliography of importance published since the invention of printing,{{sfn|Norman|2014}} and through it, Gessner became known as the "father of bibliography."&lt;ref name=Anzovin/&gt;

The work attempted to be an exhaustive survey of known writing in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and included approximately three thousand authors {{sfn|Blair|2010}} The authors’ forenames were listed alphabetically according to [[mediaeval]] usage, with a reverse index of their surnames.{{sfn|Norman|2014}}{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}} It was intended as an index by subject of all known authors. Gessner listed the writers together with the titles of their works, short biographies, and publication details including place of printing, printers and editors. He added his own annotations, comments, and evaluations of the nature and merit of every entry.&lt;ref name=Anzovin/&gt; It included about twelve thousand titles.{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}}{{sfn|Blair|2010}}{{sfn|Norman|2014}}{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}}

Gessner followed [[Johannes Trithemius]]’s work of placing works in systems of cataloging. Gessner admired Trithemius’s systems and used them as guidelines and templates; however Gessner carried the idea of cataloging and systems a step further. [[Theodore Besterman]], in ''The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography'',   suggests that Gessner’s work to organize knowledge was the forerunner of [[Francis Bacon]]’s works and other [[encyclopedias]] that followed.{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}} Though called "universal", it was intended to be selective.{{sfn|Norman|2014}}

== ''Pandectae'' (1548) ==

In 1548, Gessner followed this with a companion thematic index to ''Bibliotheca universalis'', a large [[folio]], ''Pandectarum sive Partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Tigurini, medici &amp; philosophiae professoris, libri xxi'' (''Pandectae'').{{efn|From [[Pandectae]], a compendium}}{{sfn|Gessner|1548}}
{{sfn|Norman|2014}} This contained thirty thousand topical entries. Each of these entries were cross-referenced to the appropriate author and book, arranged under headings and sub-headings, which were associated with various branches of learning.{{sfn|Norman|2014}}{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}}

The ''Pandectae'' had nineteen sections, each devoted to a scholarly discipline and contained dedications to the best scholar printers of Gessner's time. He listed their publications and accomplishments. The planned scope of 21 books was never completed, since part 20 ''De re medica''. was never published, and part 21 ''De theologia Christiana'' was published separately as ''Partitiones theologicae'' in 1549.{{sfn|Blair|2010}} A further supplement ''Appendix bibliothecae'' containing additions previously published separately by [[Lycosthenes]] (1551) and [[Josias Simmler|Simmler]] (1555) appeared in 1555.{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}}

Gessner made full use of any publishers' catalogues and booksellers' lists which were available in the 16th century that were printed when he was doing his research. These included use of printed catalogues supplied by firms like [[Aldus Manutius]] of [[Venice]] and [[Henri Estienne]] of [[Paris]].{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}}

== ''Bibliotheca selecta'' (1593) ==

Gessner's work, with its heterodox principles and advanced [[Protestant]] scholarship was a direct challenge to the authority of the [[Catholic Church]] which soon banned the work in the [[Index librorum prohibitorum]]. The [[Counter Reformation]]'s response took another generation of Catholic scholarship to produce and appeared on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] press in Rome in 1593 under the programmatic title, ''[[Bibliotheca selecta]]''. This updated "Anti-Gessner" was assembled in 18 books covering the bibliography of the traditional scientific disciplines (Theology, 1-11, Law, 12, Philosophy, 13, Medicine, 14) and the liberal arts, 15-18, by the [[Mantuan]] [[Jesuit]] [[humanism|humanist]] and bibliographer [[Antonio Possevino]].{{fact|date=February 2016}}

'''Cox &amp; Coxon Ltd v Leipst''' [1999] 2 NZLR 15; (1999) 6 NZBLC 102,666; (1998) 8 TCLR 516 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding the award of [[damages (law)|damages]] for "expectation loss" under the [[Fair Trading Act 1986]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1995, the Leipst's purchased a 5-acre lifestyle block in Hastings that contained a pear orchard. Prior to purchasing the property, the real estate agents Cox and Coxon Ltd misrepresented the 1994 pear sales as being $12,000, when it was later discovered to be only $8,801.16.

As a result, the Leipsts sued the real estate agents for damages under the Fair Trading Act, for "expected damages" of $27,233.64, which was calculated being the annual loss of $3,198.84 for 20 years, using a discount rate of 10%.

The District Court made no award of damages, but on appeal to the High Court, they were awarded $16,000.

Cox and Coxon appealed, claiming that expectation losses under contract could not be awarded under the Fair Trading Act, and instead could only calculate damages under tort. The FTA did not clarify the issue.

==Held==
The court, sitting as a bench of 5,  ruled that under the FTA, damages could only be awarded under tort, and not under contract.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8320">The '''encyclopedic novel''' is a literary concept popularised by [[Edward Mendelson]] in two 1976 essays ("Encyclopedic Narrative" and "Gravity's Encyclopedia"). In Mendelson's formulation, encyclopedic novels "attempt to render the full range of knowledge and beliefs of a national culture, while identifying the ideological perspectives from which that culture shapes and interprets its knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "Encyclopedic Narrative", 1269. Quoted in Herman.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that "[b]ecause they are the products of an epic in which the world's knowledge is larger than any one person can encompass, they necessarily make extensive use of [[synecdoche]]". Other qualities include "the full account of at least one technology or science" and the display of "an encyclopedia of literary styles, ranging from the most primitive and anonymous levels ... to the most esoteric of high styles".&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, "Gravity's Encyclopedia". Quoted in Boswell&lt;/ref&gt; Key to Mendelson's definition is a short but significant interval between the era portrayed in the novel and the era of the novel's writing (as in, for example, James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', and Thomas Pynchon's ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''). In more general terms, the [[encyclopedic]] novel is a long, complex work of fiction that incorporates extensive information (which is sometimes fictional itself), often from specialized disciplines of science and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Letzler, 304&lt;/ref&gt; Orderly plot structures are often absent.

There has been considerable debate about the nature and function of the encyclopedic novel since Mendelson's exposition of the concept. Hillary A. Clark attributes to this type of discourse the importance of ordering the information which the writer discovers and retrieves.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 99; For Mendelson see note 1, 108&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Clark points out that encyclopedic texts have a long history, from the Renaissance ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante]] to [[Ezra Pound]]'s  [[modernist]] ''[[The Cantos]]''. She explains that the urge to order the sum of all knowledge grew exponentially during the Renaissance and that by the 20th century we see writers such as Pound and [[James Joyce]] (whose ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' is an example of an encyclopedic novel) simply recycling narratives. The encyclopedist's essential job regardless of the type of discourse, is to gather, recycle, and restate. The encyclopedic writer "returns to the role of the medieval scribe&amp;nbsp;… reading and copying the already known, the popular, as well as the esoteric," and hence the encyclopedic novel assumes an almost "anti-creative" function.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 95, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion of [[encyclopedism]] experienced by the reader of such a novel might represent the author's exploration of the assumptions and practices embodied in the production of a real encyclopedia. Along these lines, a [[post-structuralist]] analysis of the encyclopedic novel sees it as critical of encyclopedism,&lt;ref&gt;Letzler, "Paradox", 2&lt;/ref&gt; the ostensible goal of which is to capture the sum of all human knowledge.&lt;!--cough! as WP's slogan, this is too much fun to rephrase, don't you think?--&gt; This critique suggests that the encyclopedic project is "tainted by its association with master narratives"&lt;ref&gt;Rasula, Jed. "Textual Indigence in the Archive." ''Postmodern Culture'' (May 1999). Quoted in Letzler, "Paradox", 2&lt;/ref&gt; and that it reinforces the "illusion of a totalizing system"&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Luc and Petrus van Ewijk. "Gravity's Encyclopedia Revisited: The Illusion of a Totalizing System in Gravity's Rainbow." ''English Studies'' 90.2 (April 2009): 167-179. Quoted in Letzler, "Paradox", 2&lt;/ref&gt; of knowledge.  Encyclopedic novels in this view are commentaries on the limits of such narratives and systems. Given that the aura of encyclopedism in a work of fiction is necessarily an illusion, it points to a failure—a "failure" which may align with a novelistic intent to "highlight the illusory basis of 'total knowledge'".&lt;ref&gt;Herman&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, encyclopedic fiction suggests that "we should not systematically encyclopedize but seek more 'open' approaches to knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Letzler, "Paradox", 2&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s encyclopedic ''[[Bouvard et Pécuchet]]'' appears to achieve an opposite goal: in his relentless encyclopedic presentation of "facts and theories", the two main characters, Bouvard and Pécuchet, appear to be so absorbed in a world of knowledge, of having to gain knowledge, of needing to put knowledge to practical purpose, that Flaubert appears to suggest the civilization they inhabit lacks creativity and art.&lt;ref&gt;Bersani, 143&lt;/ref&gt;

While an encyclopedia is a factual reference work, a novel stands in opposition to it as a "literary ''nonreferential'' narrative".&lt;ref&gt;Letzler, 305, quoting Dorrit Cohn with added emphasis&lt;/ref&gt; One critical review questions why a novelist would paradoxically reference a fictional universe, and what literary purpose is served by the proliferation of the "junk text" that is often a carrier of the encyclopedic conceit. When excessive real-world data is presented to the reader, the author's purpose is unclear: those readers who already know the material will find it superfluous, and those who do not know it may find that it adds nothing of interest to the text. Giving examples of "junk text" in encyclopedic fiction, the review cites "the pseudo-scientific [[cetology]] chapter" in ''Moby-Dick'' and "minor-character chatter about art and economics" in [[William Gaddis]]'s ''[[The Recognitions]]'' (1955) and ''[[J R]]'' (1975). Yet, a defining characteristic of the encyclopedic novel is the presentation of unwanted or unnecessary information. Such writing "terminate[s] focused attention", and is in danger of boring the reader.&lt;!-- attribute Letzler here? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letzler, 304-308&lt;/ref&gt; One view of the encyclopedic novel's method, therefore, is that it requires the reader to practice modulating his attention to the text, bringing more consciousness to the act of filtering the important from the tangential.&lt;ref&gt;Letzler, 309 ''et seq''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendelson's 1976 essays examine the encyclopedic tendency through the history of literature, considering the ''Divine Comedy'', ''[[Don Quixote]]'', ''[[Faust]]'', ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', and ''[[War and Peace]]'', with an emphasis on the modern ''Ulysses'' and ''Gravity's Rainbow''. Commonly cited examples of encyclopedic novels in the [[postmodern literature|postmodern]] period include, in addition to Pynchon, [[Richard Powers]]' ''[[The Gold Bug Variations]]'' (1991), [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' (1996), and [[Don Delillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;Burn, Stephen J.

'''Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (3 June 1853&amp;nbsp;– 28 July 1942), commonly known as '''Flinders Petrie''', was an English [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] and a pioneer of systematic methodology in [[archaeology]] and preservation of artifacts. He held the first chair of Egyptology in the United Kingdom, and excavated many of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt in conjunction with his wife, [[Hilda Petrie]].&lt;ref&gt;Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology', Sharp, M. S. and Lesko, B. S. (eds)&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider his most famous discovery to be that of the [[Merneptah Stele]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Biblical Archaeologist'', American Schools of Oriental Research 1997, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; an opinion with which Petrie himself concurred.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret S. Drower, ''Flinders Petrie: A Life in Archaeology'', 1995, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/paying-homage-to-pioneering-archaeologist-who-lost-his-head-1.456689 Paying homage to pioneering archaeologist who lost his head, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Petrie was born on 3 June 1853 in Maryon Road, [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], Kent, England, the son of [[William Petrie (electrical engineer)|William Petrie]] (1821–1908) and Anne (née Flinders) (1812–1892). Anne was the daughter of Captain [[Matthew Flinders]], who led the first circumnavigation of Australia. William Petrie was an electrical engineer who developed carbon arc lighting and later developed chemical processes for [[Johnson Matthey|Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=Petrie, William|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|author=T. E. James|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie was raised in a Christian household (his father being a member of the [[Plymouth Brethren]]), and was educated at home. He had no formal education. His father taught his son how to survey accurately, laying the foundation for his archaeological career. At the age of eight, he was tutored in French, Latin, and Greek, until he had a collapse and was taught at home.  He also ventured his first archaeological opinion aged eight, when friends visiting the Petrie family were describing the unearthing of the [[Brading Roman Villa]] in the Isle of Wight. The boy was horrified to hear the rough shovelling out of the contents, and protested that the earth should be pared away, inch by inch, to see all that was in it and how it lay.&lt;ref&gt;William Matthew Flinders Petrie, ''Seventy Years in Archaeology'', H. Holt and Company 1932. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; "All that I have done since," he wrote when he was in his late seventies, "was there to begin with, so true it is that we can only develop what is born in the mind. I was already in archaeology by nature."&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Seventy Years'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
The chair of [[Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology]] at [[University College London|University College]] London was set up and funded in 1892 following a bequest from [[Amelia Edwards]], who died suddenly in that year. Petrie's supporter since 1880, Edwards had instructed that he should be its first incumbent. He continued to excavate in Egypt after taking up the professorship, training many of the best archaeologists of the day.

In 1913 Petrie sold his large collection of Egyptian antiquities to [[University College, London|University College]], London, where it is now housed in the [[Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology]]. One of his trainees, [[Howard Carter]], went on to discover the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922.

==Archaeology career==
[[File:View from tomb Giza 1881.jpg|thumb|A photograph Petrie took of his view from the tomb he lived in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in Giza 1881]]

In his teenage years, Petrie surveyed British prehistoric monuments&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Alice. 2012. 'We seem to working in the same line'. A.H.L.F. Pitt Rivers and W.M.F. Petrie. Bulletin of the History of Archaeology 22(1): pp.. 4–13.&lt;/ref&gt; (commencing with the late Romano-British 'British Camp' that lay within yards of his family home in Charlton) in attempts to understand their geometry (at 19 producing the most accurate survey of [[Stonehenge]]). His father had corresponded with [[Piazzi Smyth]] about his theories of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and Petrie travelled to Egypt in early 1880 to make an accurate survey of [[Giza]], making him the first to properly investigate how they were constructed (many theories had been advanced on this, and Petrie read them all, but none were based on first hand observation or logic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie's published reports of this triangulation survey, and his analysis of the architecture of Giza therein, was exemplary in its methodology and accuracy, disproved Smyth's theories and still provides much of the basic data regarding the pyramid plateau to this day. On that visit, he was appalled by the rate of destruction of monuments (some listed in guidebooks had been worn away completely since then) and mummies. He described Egypt as "a house on fire, so rapid was the destruction" and felt his duty to be that of a "salvage man, to get all I could, as quickly as possible and then, when I was 60, I would sit and write it all."

Returning to England at the end of 1880, Petrie wrote a number of articles and then met [[Amelia Edwards]], journalist and patron of the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now the [[Egypt Exploration Society]]), who became his strong supporter and later [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie#UCL|appointed him as Professor at her Egyptology chair at University College London]].  Impressed by his scientific approach, they offered him work as the successor to [[Édouard Naville]]. Petrie accepted the position and was given the sum of £250 per month to cover the excavation's expenses. In November 1884, Petrie arrived in Egypt to begin his excavations.

He first went to a [[New Kingdom]] site at [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], with 170 workmen. He cut out the middle man role of foreman on this and all subsequent excavations, taking complete overall control himself and removing pressure on the workmen from the foreman to discover finds quickly but sloppily.  Though he was regarded as an amateur and [[Amateur|dilettante]] by more established Egyptologists, this made him popular with his workers, who found several small but significant finds that would have been lost under the old system.
[[File:Sehel-steleFamine (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Famine Stela]] is an inscription located on [[Sehel Island]].]]

In 1886, while working for the Egypt Exploration Fund, Petrie excavated at [[Tell Nebesheh]] in the Eastern Nile Delta. This site is located 8 miles southeast of [[Tanis]] and, among the remains of an ancient temple there, Petrie found a royal sphinx, now located at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Hansen, Erica Ehrenberg, eds. [http://www.books.google.ca/books?id=6lDgYxV0DN8C&amp;pg=PA77 ''Leaving No Stones Unturned: Essays on the Ancient Near East and Egypt in Honor of Donald P. Hansen.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104131948/http://books.google.ca/books?id=6lDgYxV0DN8C&amp;pg=PA77 |date=4 November 2013 }} Eisenbrauns, 2002 {{ISBN|1575060558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Tanis dig, he ran out of funding but, reluctant to leave the country in case it was renewed, he spent 1887 cruising the Nile taking photographs as a less subjective record than sketches. During this time, he also climbed rope ladders at [[Sehel Island]] near [[Aswan]] to draw and photograph thousands of early Egyptian inscriptions on a cliff face, recording embassies to [[Nubia]], [[Famine Stela|famines]] and wars. By the time he reached Aswan, a telegram had reached there to confirm the renewal of his funding. He then went straight to the burial site at [[Fayum]], particularly interested in post-30 BC burials, which had not previously been fully studied. He found intact tombs and 60 of the famous [[Fayum mummy portraits|portraits]], and discovered from inscriptions on the mummies that they were kept with their living families for generations before burial. Under [[Auguste Mariette]]'s arrangements, he sent 50% of these portraits to the [[Egyptian Museum|Egyptian department of antiquities]].

However, when he later found that [[Gaston Maspero]] placed little value on them and left them open to the elements in a yard behind the museum to deteriorate, he angrily demanded that they all be returned, forcing Maspero to pick the 12 best examples for the museum to keep and return 48 to Petrie, who sent them to London for a special showing at the [[British Museum]]. Resuming work, he discovered the village of the Pharaonic tomb-workers.

In 1890, Petrie made the first of his many forays into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], leading to much important archaeological work.  His six-week excavation of [[Tell el-Hesi]] (which was mistakenly identified as [[Lachish]]) that year represents the first scientific excavation of an archaeological site in the [[Holy Land]]. Petrie surveyed a group of tombs in the Wadi al-Rababah (the biblical [[Hinnom]]) of [[Jerusalem]], largely dating to the Iron Age and early Roman periods. Here, in these ancient monuments, Petrie discovered two different metrical systems.

From 1891, he worked on the temple of [[Aten]] at [[Amarna|Tell-el-Amarna]], discovering a {{convert|300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[New Kingdom]] painted pavement of garden and animals and hunting scenes. This became a tourist attraction but, as there was no direct access to the site, tourists wrecked neighbouring fields on their way to it. This made local farmers deface the paintings, and it is only thanks to Petrie's copies that their original appearance is known.

 |title =Petrie's extraordinary visual memory
 |quote =&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mr. Flinders Petrie, a contributor of interesting experiments on kindred subjects to ''Nature'', informs me that he habitually works out sums by aid of an imaginary [[Slide rule|sliding rule]], which he sets in the desired way and reads off mentally.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He does not usually visualise the whole rule, but only that part of it with which he is at the moment concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think this is one of the most striking cases of accurate visualising power it is possible to imagine.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Francis Galton]], (1883).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/inquiriesintohum1907galt#page/66/mode/1up ''Inquiries into Human Facility and Its Development'' (1883), pp.66]; Galton also noted (on p.66) that, in relation to the slide rule's markings, "the artist has not put in the divisions very correctly" (illustration at [https://archive.org/stream/inquiriesintohum1907galt#page/97/mode/1up/search/plate page 97, Plate II, Fig.34]).] 
Galton had conducted research ("Statistics of Mental Imagery", ''Mind'', Vol.5, No.19, (July 1880), pp.301-318.) into the extent to which eminent scientists used "mental imagery". On the basis that Galton, himself, had a great personal ability to create, manipulate and employ vivid mental imagery, he was shocked to discover that most eminent scientists not only did not habitually employ mental imagery, but were also, generally, quite incapable of generating "mental images" at will (Galton, 1880). In order to supply a contrast, Galton cited the extraordinary case of Flinders Petrie -- who could easily manipulate precise technical equipment in the spaces of his own imagination.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of the 'Israel' or Merneptah stele==
In early 1896, Petrie and his archaeological team were conducting excavations on a temple in Petrie's area of concession at [[Luxor]].&lt;ref&gt;Drower, Flinders Petrie, pp.220–221&lt;/ref&gt; This temple complex was located just north of the original funerary temple of Amenhotep III which had been built on a flood plain.&lt;ref name="Drower, Flinders Petrie, p.221"&gt;Drower, Flinders Petrie, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially surprised that this building which they were excavating:
: 'was also attributed to [[Amenophis III]] since only his name appeared on blocks strewn over the site...Could one king have had two mortuary temples? Petrie dug and soon solved the puzzle: the temple had been built by [[Merneptah]], the son and successor of Ramesses II, almost entirely from stone which had been plundered from the temple of Amenophis III nearby. Statues of the latter had been smashed and the pieces thrown into the foundations; fragments of couchant stone jackals, which must have once formed an imposing avenue approaching the pylon, and broken drums gave some idea of the splendour of the original temple. A statue of Merenptah himself was found—the first known portrait of this king....Better was to follow: two splendid stelae were found,&lt;ref&gt;F. Petrie, Temples of Thebes 1896, London, 1897. pls X-XIV&lt;/ref&gt; both of them usurped on the reverse side by Merenptah, who had turned them face to the wall. One, beautifully carved, showed Amenophis III in battle with Nubians and Syrians; the other, of black granite, was over ten feet high, larger than any stela previously known; the original text commemorated the building achievements of Amenophis and described the beauties and magnificence of the temple in which it had stood. When it could be turned over an inscription of Merenptah recording his triumphs over the Libyans and the Peoples of the Sea was revealed; [Wilhelm] Spiegelberg [a noted German philologist] came over to read it, and near the end of the text he was puzzled by one, that of a people or tribe whom Merenptah had victoriously smitten-''"I.si.ri.ar?"'' It was Petrie whose quick imaginative mind leapt[t] to the solution: "Israel!" Spiegelberg agreed that it must be so. "Won't the reverends be pleased?" was his comment. At dinner that evening Petrie prophesied: "This stele will be better known in the world than anything else I have found." It was the first mention of the word "Israel" in any Egyptian text and the news made headlines when it reached the English papers.'&lt;ref name="Drower, Flinders Petrie, p.221"/&gt;

During the field season of 1895/6, at the Ramesseum, Petrie and the young German Egyptologist Wilhelm Spiegelberg became friends. Spiegelberg was in charge of the edition of many texts discovered by his British colleague, and Petrie offered important collections of artefacts to the University of Strasbourg. In 1897, the Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität Straßburg gratefully conferred to Petrie the title of doctor honoris causa,&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Colin, "Comment la création d'une 'bibliothèque de papyrus' à Strasbourg compensa la perte des manuscrits précieux brûlés dans le siège de 1870", in ''La revue de la BNU'', 2, 2010, p. 28-29 ; 33 ; 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 1902 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=The Times |title=Court Circular |date=6 June 1902 |page=10 |issue=36787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1923, Petrie was knighted for services to British archaeology and Egyptology. The focus of his work shifted permanently to Palestine in 1926 (although he did become interested in early Egypt, in 1928 digging a cemetery at Luxor that proved so huge that he devised an entirely new excavation system, including comparison charts for finds, which is still used today).  He began excavating several important sites in the south-west of Palestine, including [[Tell el-Jemmeh]] and [[Tall al-Ajjul|Tell el-Ajjul]].

In 1933, on retiring from his professorship, he moved permanently to [[Jerusalem]], where he lived with Lady Petrie at the British School of Archaeology, then temporarily headquartered at the [[American School of Oriental Research]] (today the [[Albright Institute of Archaeological Research|W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research]]).

==Death and preservation of head==
[[File:Flinders Petrie headstone - Protestant Cemetery - Jerusalem Israel c. 2009 - 2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Petrie's headstone in the Protestant Cemetery, Jerusalem (2009)]]
Petrie died in Jerusalem on 28 July 1942. His body was interred in the [[Mount Zion Cemetery, Jerusalem (Protestant)|Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion]], but he donated his head (and thus his brain) to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of London]]. World War II was then at its height, and the head was delayed in transit. After being stored in a jar in the college basement, its label fell off and no one knew who the head belonged to.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; However, it was eventually identified, and is now stored, but not displayed, at the Royal College of Surgeons.

==Personal life==
Petrie married [[Hilda Urlin]] (1871–1957) in London on 26 November 1896. The couple had two children, [[John Flinders Petrie|John]] (1907–1972) and Ann (1909–1989). The family originally lived in [[Hampstead, London|Hampstead]], where an [[Blue plaque|English Heritage blue plaque]] has been placed on the building they lived in, 5 Cannon Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/283 | title=Flinders Petrie Blue Plaque |publisher=openplaques.org |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Flinders Petrie became a noted mathematician, who gave his name to the [[Petrie polygon]].

==Legacy==
Petrie's painstaking recording and study of artifacts set new standards in archaeology. He wrote: "I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details." By linking styles of pottery with periods, he was the first to use [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] in Egyptology, a new method for establishing the chronology of a site. Flinders Petrie was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]]. After his death, his wife, Hilda Petrie created a student travel scholarship to Egypt on the Centennial of Petrie's birth in 1953.

Many thousands of artefacts recovered during excavations led by Petrie can be found in museums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://egyptartefacts.griffith.ox.ac.uk/?q=destinations-index&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie remains a controversial figure for his pro-[[eugenics]] views and opinions on other social topics, which spilled over into his disputes with the British Museum's Egyptology expert, [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].  Budge's contention that the religion of the Egyptians was essentially identical to the religions of the people of northeastern and central Africa was regarded by his colleagues as impossible, since all but a few followed Petrie in his contention that the culture of Ancient Egypt was derived from an invading Caucasoid "[[Dynastic Race]]" which had conquered Egypt in late prehistory and introduced the Pharaonic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie was a dedicated follower of [[eugenics]], believing that there was no such thing as cultural or social innovation in human society, but rather that all social change is the result of biological change, such as migration and foreign conquest resulting in interbreeding. Petrie claimed that his "Dynastic Race", in which he never ceased to believe, was a "fine" Caucasoid race that entered Egypt from the south in late [[predynastic]] times, conquered the "inferior" and "exhausted" "[[mulatto]]" race then inhabiting Egypt, and slowly introduced the finer Dynastic civilisation as they interbred with the inferior indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Silberman, 1999"&gt;Silberman, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie, who was also affiliated with a variety of far right-wing groups and [[anti-democratic thought]] in England and was a dedicated believer in the superiority of the Northern peoples over the Latinate and Southern peoples,&lt;ref name="Silberman, 1999"/&gt; derided Budge's belief that the ancient Egyptians were an African people with roots in eastern Africa as impossible and "unscientific", as did his followers.

His involvement in [[Palestinian archaeology]] was examined in the exhibition "A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0701/07010401|title=A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection|accessdate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/future-past/exhibiton.htm|accessdate=18 February 2007|title=A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Petrie Medal was created in celebration of Petrie's seventieth birthday, when funds were raised to commission and produce 20 medals to be awarded "once in every three years for distinguished work in Archaeology, preferably to a British subject".&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Ucko and Stephen Quirke, "The Petrie Medal", Public Archaeology, vol. 5, no. 1 (2006), pp. 15-25. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/pua.2006.5.1.15?journalCode=ypua20&lt;/ref&gt; The first medal was awarded to Petrie himself (1925), and the first few recipients included Sir [[Aurel Stein]] (1928), Sir [[Arthur Evans]] (1931), Abbé [[Henri Breuil]] (1934), Prof [[John Beazley|J.D. Beazley]] (1937), Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] (1950), Prof [[Alan Wace|J.B. Wace]] (1953), Sir [[Leonard Woolley]] (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Strong and [[Helen Wang]], "Sir Aurel Stein's Medals at the Royal Geographical Society", in Helen Wang (ed.)

The '''''Four Great Books of Song''''' ({{zh|t=宋四大書|s=宋四大书|p=Sòng sì dà shū}}) was compiled by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] (925–996) and others during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279). The term was coined after the last book ([[Cefu Yuangui]]) was finished during the 11th century. The four encyclopedias were published and intended to collect the whole knowledge of the new state.

The four books are:
* The ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' is a general-purpose ''[[leishu]]'' encyclopedia.
* The ''[[Taiping Guangji]]'' is a collection of [[deities]], [[fairies]], [[Ghost story|ghost stories]] and [[theology]].
* The ''[[Wenyuan Yinghua]]'' is an [[anthology]] of poetry, odes, songs and other writings.
* The ''[[Cefu Yuangui]]'' is a ''[[leishu]]'' encyclopedia of political essays, [[autobiographies]], [[memorials]] and [[decrees]].

They run away to New York City, and end up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They stay in the museum for several nights, sleeping in beds featured in the museum, hiding from museum guards, and bathing in the fountain. For money, they grab coins out of the bottom of the fountain and use them to get food out of the vending machine. Eventually, Claudia finds a statue of an angel she believes was carved by [[Michelangelo]], so she decides to find the previous owner of the statue. This owner, named Mrs. Basil E.

The intent is to create an [[Earth]]-focused guide that allows members to share information about their geographic area and the local sites, activities and businesses, to help people decide where they want to go and what they may find when they get there. It has grown to contain subjects from restaurants and recipes, to [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[history]]. Explicit advertising of businesses was forbidden when the site was run by the BBC, but customer reviews were permitted.&lt;ref name=houserules&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The h2g2 site was founded on 28 April 1999 as the [[Earth]] edition of ''[[The Guide (character)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by the author of the series, [[Douglas Adams]], and his friends and colleagues at [[The Digital Village]].&lt;ref name=pressassoc&gt;{{Cite news

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; "h2g2" is an [[abbreviation]] for the title as well as part of the url. The site was a runner-up for Best Community Site in the [[Yell.com]] awards in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

21 April 2005 marked the launch of h2g2 Mobile, an edition of the guide produced for [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s (Personal Digital Assistants) and [[mobile phones]] that could access the internet, so that people could read h2g2 entries while on the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 24 January 2011, the BBC announced cuts of 25% to its online budget, resulting in a £34 million less investment into the site. A number of sites were to be closed, including [[BBC Switch]], [[BBC Blast]] and [[6-0-6]]. As part of this exercise, the BBC chose to sell h2g2.&lt;ref name="Cutback"&gt;{{cite news

On 3 October 2011, the BBC incarnation of h2g2 closed, leaving only an announcement reading "H2G2 has now left the BBC. The new owners of H2G2 are currently preparing the site for relaunch. Soon you will find The Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything at www.h2g2.com"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - H2G2|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/h2g2/maintenance/h2g2_move2.shtml|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-BBC version of the site went live on 16 October 2011.

== DNA ==

Part of the [[software]] for h2g2 is known as DNA, after the initials of author and site founder [[Douglas Adams]]. The DNA technology was introduced a few months after the BBC takeover and is still used for BBC blogs, messageboards and commenting systems. Before that there was a technology which was written mostly in [[Perl]].

Adams was involved in the website in its early days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Adams's legacy is still felt on h2g2, though it is not a fan site.&lt;ref name=huddersfield/&gt;

'''''Jawāmi ul-Hikāyāt wa Lawāmi' ul-Riwāyāt''''' ("Collections of Stories and Illustrations of Histories", commonly known by the shorter title, ''Jawāmi ul-Hikāyāt'', also transcribed ''Djami al-Hikayat'' and ''Jami al-Hikayat'') (جوامع الحکایات و لوامع الروایات) is a famous collection of Persian anecdotes written in the early 13th century. It was written by [[Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi]], who lived during the reign of [[Shamsuddin Iltutmish]] (Altamash) (r. 1211–1236) the third Muslim Turkic sultan of the [[Sultanate of Delhi]], and the book is dedicated to his minister, ''[[Nizam al-Mulk|Nizam-ul-Mulk]]'' Muhammad, son of Abu Sa'id Junaidi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elliot|first=H.

Jawami ul-Hikayat of Muhammad Ufi| year=1871|publisher=London : Trübner &amp; Co.|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was an encyclopaedia of anecdotage containing mines of interesting information, namely on historical information often not found elsewhere, from mythical times until the end of the rule of the [[Abbasids|Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Mustansir (caliph)|Al-Mustansir]].

The entire text of this 2,500 page book is yet to be edited and printed. Currently, only abridged volumes have been published.

The oldest extant manuscript of this work exists in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], dated 1232.

==Content==
The ''Jawami ul-Hikayat'' contains 4 volumes consisting of chapters of unequal length. Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi used his personal observations, information from many Arab and Persian works (listed as sources in ''Jawami''), as well as information gathered from individual traders concerning the conditions and life in different countries throughout every chapter. This makes the ''Jawami ul-Hikayat'' unique among Persian works.&lt;ref&gt;I.H. Siddiqui, ''Indo-Persian Historiography Up To The Thirteenth Century'', (Primus Books, 2010), 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Scots law}}

'''''Khaliq and Anor v HMA''''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] criminal case decided by the [[High Court of Justiciary]] on appeal, in which it was decided that it was an offence at common law to supply materials that were otherwise legal in the knowledge that they would be used for self-harm.

Two shopkeepers in Glasgow were arrested and charged, ''inter alia'', with supplying to children ‘[[glue-sniffing]] kits’ consisting of a quantity of petroleum-based glue in a plastic bag. They had been previously warned by the police to stop supplying the kits. They gave notice of objection to the indictment, averring that, on the charge of supplying, the facts as libelled did not disclose a crime known to Scots law because there was nothing illegal about the items that they had supplied. Their plea was repelled at a preliminary diet and they appealed.

On appeal, the High Court took the view that, even though Evostik glue and plastic bags might be perfectly legal, everyday items, the two shopkeepers knew perfectly well what the children were going to use the articles for and the charge on the indictment should stand. 'The Court refused to accept that there was any distinction between supply with knowledge of likely abuse and actual administration of a dangerous substance to a child.'&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Joe: 'Legal Change and Scots Private Law', in John W Cairns, and Olivia Robinson (eds): ''Critical Studies in Ancient Law, Comparative Law and Legal History'' (Hart Publishing 2001) p 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Said [[Lord Justice General]] [[George Emslie, Baron Emslie|Emslie]]: ‘There is ample authority for the view that the wilful and reckless administration of a dangerous substance to another causing injury or death is a crime at common law in Scotland’.&lt;ref&gt;SCCR p 492&lt;/ref&gt;

When the case finally came to trial at Glasgow High Court the two were each sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.

This case is reported at 1983 SCCR 483 (CCA); 1984 JC 23; 1984 SLT 137.

*'''[[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA]]''' (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; commonly called "the [[Stimulus (economics)|Stimulus]] Package”): [[legislative act|legislation]] enacting [[Deficit spending#Government deficits|net-deficit spending]] measures voted by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]], in February 2009, often compared with [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus]] measures undertaken by [[Eurozone]] member-states.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://voxeu.org/article/against-european-fiscal-stimulus Eurozone stimulus: A myth, some facts, and impact estimates]" by Volker Wieland, Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability, [[Goethe University]], [[Frankfurt]], 5 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=13640&amp;cpage=1 US fiscal stimulus worked – more evidence]" by [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Bill Mitchell]], 28 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/02/16/greece-and-the-eurozone/ Greece and the Eurozone]" by Mike Whitney,''[[CounterPunch]]'', 16 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==B==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">Most '''countries of the world''' have '''different names''' in different languages. Some countries have also undergone name changes for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all nations, countries and sovereign states. It does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "official", "real", or "correct" name of any country is or was.

Countries are listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English'''. Each English name is followed by its currently best-known equivalents in other languages, listed in English alphabetical order (ignoring accents) by name and by language. Historical and/or alternative versions, where included, are noted as such. Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents are listed, to provide an answer to the question "What is that name in..."?. See also: [[List of alternative country names]]

Please format entries as follows: for languages written in the Latin alphabet, write "'''Name''' (language)", for example, "'''Afeganistão''' (Portuguese)", and add it to the list according to English rules of alphabetical order. For languages written in other [[writing system]]s, write "'''Romanization''' - native script (language)", for example "'''Argentine''' - אַרגענטינע (Yiddish)", and alphabetize it in the list by the romanized form.

The '''''NHL Official Guide &amp; Record Book''''' was the complete statistical record of the [[National Hockey League]], published annually by the league until the league ended its production after the publication of the book following the 2017-18 season.  An augmented and dynamic version of the information contained in the book can now be found at records.nhl.com. The book contains detailed year-by-year data on 2,000 active players, all-time records, club rosters, [[NHL Entry Draft]] information, along with player and goaltender data panels and photos. It has long been considered "the bible of (ice) hockey” and is the book the NHL issues to reporters, broadcasters, scouts and general managers. It is a large-format paperback book and has been in print since 1932.

The first editions were edited by [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] Honoured Member [[Jim Hendy|James C. Hendy]]. League publicist [[Ken McKenzie]] took over editing beginning in 1947. He would later become the founding editor-publisher of [[The Hockey News]]. Statisticians Ron Andrews and Carol Randall managed the book during the NHL's expansion eras of the 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s.  Benny Ercolani has been the Head Statistician since the 1980s.

By the mid-1980s, the old [[digest-sized]] format of the ''NHL Guide'' could no longer accommodate the increased number of league players and clubs. Early in 1984, [[Dan Diamond]], a Toronto-based editor and publisher, proposed a redesign and reorganization of the ''NHL Guide'', converting it to a magazine-sized page and incorporating photographs for the first time. The NHL accepted Diamond's proposal and the redesigned format made its first appearance in the fall of 1984 in a 352-page edition. Twenty-five years later, the book had grown to 656 pages and included a mug-shot photo of every active NHL player.

Traditionally, the Guide's cover is printed every year in the colors of the reigning Stanley Cup champions.

A '''newspaper''' is a [[Periodical literature|periodical]] [[publication]] containing written [[News|information about current events]].

Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics, business, sports and art, and often include materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts, reviews of local services, [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices, [[crossword]]s, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[comic strip]]s, and [[advice column|advice]] columns.

Most newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and [[advertising]] revenue. The [[journalism]] organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often [[metonymy|metonymically]] called newspapers.

Newspapers have traditionally been published [[printing|in print]] (usually on cheap, low-grade [[paper]] called [[newsprint]]). However, today most newspapers are also [[electronic publishing|published]] on [[website]]s as [[online newspaper]]s, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.

Newspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for businessmen. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.

Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].

== Overview ==
Newspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].

Usually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called "[[op-ed]]s" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader "what it all means" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.

A wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.

Most newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].

Many newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&amp;nbsp;million copies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title='&amp;#39;A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'&amp;#39; (2007)|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Recession|late 2000s–early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&amp;sq=newspapers&amp;st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&amp;nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53&amp;nbsp;billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Vranica and Jack Marshall,   "Plummeting Newspaper Ad Revenue Sparks New Wave of Changes: With global newspaper print advertising on pace for worst decline since recession, publishers cut costs and restructure" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/plummeting-newspaper-ad-revenue-sparks-new-wave-of-changes-1476955801?cx_navSource=cx_picks&amp;cx_tag=collabctx&amp;cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s ''Wall Street Journal'' Oct 20, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in advertising revenues affected both the print and online media as well as all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of [[online advertising]] are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.

===Definitions===
Newspapers typically meet four criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Werner Faulstich: "Grundwissen Medien", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Margarete Rehm|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart. Das 17. Jh|publisher=Ib.hu-berlin.de|date=25 April 2000|accessdate=21 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204061954/http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|archive-date=4 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public accessibility: Its contents are reasonably accessible to the public, traditionally by the paper being sold or distributed at newsstands, shops, and libraries, and, since the 1990s, made available over the [[Internet]] with [[online newspaper]] websites. While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).
* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.
* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.
* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.

==History==

===Gazettes and bulletins===
In [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' ("Bulletin of the Court") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="brook xxi"&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998). ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|0-520-22154-0}} (Paperback). Page xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[early modern Europe]], the increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten news-sheets. In 1556, the government of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] first published the monthly ''[[notizie scritte]]'', which cost one ''gazette'', a small coin.&lt;ref name="WAN timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html|title=WAN&amp;nbsp;– A Newspaper Timeline|publisher=Wan and-press.org|date=|accessdate=21 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111093302/http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html|archive-date=11 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[avviso|avvisi]] were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." ''Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212,214,216–217&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper newspapers, as they were typically not intended for the general public and restricted to a certain range of topics.

The Dutch ''[[Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &amp;c.]]'' ('Courant from Italy, Germany, etc.') of 1618 was the first to appear in [[Quarto-size|folio- rather than quarto-size]].

[[File:DP numero1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Diario de Pernambuco]], founded in November 1825 is the second oldest circulating newspaper in South America, after ''[[El Peruano]]'', founded in October of that same year.]]
In Boston in 1690, [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] published ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick]]''. This is considered the first newspaper in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] even though only one edition was published before the paper was suppressed by the government. In 1704, the governor allowed ''[[The Boston News-Letter]]'' to be published and it became the first continuously published newspaper in the colonies. Soon after, weekly papers began publishing in New York and Philadelphia. These early newspapers followed the British format and were usually four pages long. They mostly carried news from Britain and content depended on the editor's interests. In 1783, the ''[[Pennsylvania Evening Post]]'' became the first American daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1965|title=Benjamin Towne: The Precarious Career of a Persistent Printer|journal=[[Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography]]|volume=89|issue=3|pages=316–330|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20089817?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102549248011|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11|doi=10.2307/20089817|jstor=20089817|last1=Teeter|first1=Dwight L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1752, [[John Bushell]] published the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'', which claims to be "Canada's first newspaper." However, its official descendant, the ''Royal Gazette'', is a government publication for legal notices and proclamations rather than a proper newspaper; In 1764, the ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]'' was first printed 21 June 1764 and remains the oldest continuously published newspaper in North America as the ''Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph''. It is currently published as an English-language weekly from its offices at 1040 Belvédère, suite 218, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. In 1808, the ''[[Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Novo Milênio: MNDLP - Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, de 1808 |url=http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/idioma/200009u.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; had its first edition, printed in devices brought from [[England]], publishing news favourable for the government of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] since it was produced by the official press service of the Portuguese crown.

In 1821, after the ending of the ban of private newspaper circulation, appears the first non-imperial printed publication, ''[[Diário do Rio de Janeiro]]'', though there existed already the ''[[Correio Braziliense]]'', published by Hipólito José da Costa at the same time as the ''Gazeta'', but from [[London]] and with forcefully advocated political and critical ideas, aiming to expose the administration's flaws. The first newspaper in Peru was ''El Peruano'', established in October 1825 and still published today, but with several name changes.

====Asia====
{{Main|Media of India|Japanese newspapers|History of Chinese newspapers|l1 = Print media in India}} During the [[Tang Dynasty]] in China (618–906), the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' published the government news; it was [[Woodblock printing|block-printed]] onto paper. It is sometimes considered one of the earliest newspapers to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2665|title = One of the Earliest Newspapers, Written on Silk|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = historyofinformation.com|publisher = Jeremy Norman &amp; Co., Inc.|last = Norman|first = Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded attempt to found a newspaper of the modern type in South Asia was by [[William Bolts]], a Dutchman in the employ of the British East India Company in September 1768 in Calcutta. However, before he could begin his newspaper, he was deported back to Europe. In 1780 the first newsprint from this region, ''[[Hicky's Bengal Gazette]]'', was published by an Irishman, [[James Augustus Hicky]]. He used it as a means to criticize the British rule through journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/exclusive-corrupt-system-and-media_922302.html|title = Exclusive: Corrupt system and media|last = |first = |date = 4 April 2014|work = Zee News|access-date = 3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle East====
{{Main|History of Middle Eastern newspapers}}
The history of [[Middle East]]ern [[newspapers]] goes back to the 19th century. Many editors were not only journalists but also writers, philosophers and politicians. With unofficial journals, these intellectuals encouraged public discourse on politics in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[History of Iran|Persian]] Empires. Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.

The first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in [[Beyoğlu|Pera]]. Indigenous Middle Eastern journalism started in 1828, when [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], [[Khedive]] of Egypt, ordered the local establishment of the gazette ''[[Vekayi-i Misriye]]'' (''Egyptian Affairs'').&lt;ref&gt;''E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913&amp;ndash;1936'', p.&amp;nbsp;952.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first paper written in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Arabic]] on opposite pages, and later in Arabic only, under the title "''al-Waqa'i'a al-Masriya''".&lt;ref&gt;Tripp (ed.), p. 2; Amin, Fortna &amp; Frierson, p. 99; Hill, p.&amp;nbsp;172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first non-official Turkish newspaper, ''Ceride-i Havadis'' (Register of Events), was published by an Englishman, William Churchill, in 1840. The first private newspaper to be published by Turkish journalists, ''Tercüman-ı Ahvâl'' (Interpreter of Events), was founded by [[İbrahim Şinasi]] and [[Agah Efendi]] and issued in 1860.&lt;ref name="Ágoston 433"&gt;Ágoston &amp; Masters, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The first newspaper in Iran, ''Kaghaz-e Akhbar'' (The Newspaper), was created for the government by [[Mirza Saleh Shirazi]] in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Camron Michael Amin|title=The Press and Public Diplomacy in Iran, 1820–1940|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=48|issue=2|pages=269–287|year=2014|doi=10.1080/00210862.2013.871145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first journals in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] appeared in [[Hijaz]], once it had become independent of Ottoman rule, towards the end of World War I.One of the earliest women to sign her articles in the Arab press was the female medical practitioner [[Galila Tamarhan]], who contributed articles to a medical magazine called "''Ya'asub al-Tib''" (Leader in Medicine) in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Sakr, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspaper-type publications though not all of them developed in the same way; content was vastly shaped by regional and cultural preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9055609/newspaper|title=Newspaper&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com|date=|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in printing technology related to the [[Industrial Revolution]] enabled newspapers to become an even more widely circulated means of communication, as new printing technologies made printing less expensive and more efficient. In 1814, ''[[The Times]]'' (London) acquired a printing press capable of making 1,100 impressions per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Philip B. Meggs, ''A History of Graphic Design'' (1998) pp 130–133&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once. This innovation made newspapers cheaper and thus available to a larger part of the population.

In 1830, the first inexpensive "[[penny press]]" newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter's Boston ''[[Boston Evening Transcript|Transcript]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Spencer, ''The Yellow Journalism'' (2007) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Penny press papers cost about one sixth the price of other newspapers and appealed to a wider audience, including less educated and lower-income people.&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;Bird, S. Elizabeth. ''For Enquiring Minds: A Cultural Study of Supermarket Tabloids''. Knoxville: [[University of Tennessee Press]], 1992: 12–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Émile de Girardin]] started "[[La Presse (French newspaper)|La Presse]]" in 1836, introducing cheap, advertising-supported dailies to France. In 1848, [[August Zang]], an Austrian who knew Girardin in Paris, returned to Vienna to introduce the same methods with "[[Die Presse]]" (which was named for and frankly copied Girardin's publication).&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin von Wurzbach|Wurzbach, C.]] (1891).

==Categories==
While most newspapers are aimed at a broad spectrum of readers, usually geographically defined, some focus on groups of readers defined more by their interests than their location: for example, there are daily and weekly business newspapers (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[India Today]]'') and sports newspapers. More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.

===Frequency===

====Daily====
A '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)&lt;ref&gt;Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays&lt;/ref&gt; and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, [[Sunday editions]] of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.

Afternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Weber, . "Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe." ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, unlike most other countries, "daily" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.

In some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').

Daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.

====Weekly and other====
{{main|Weekly newspaper}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, "Stürmerkasten".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]
[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as biweekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or bimonthly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.

===Geographical scope and distribution===

====Local or regional====
A '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.
Almost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.

====National====
{{See also|List of national newspapers}}
[[File:Street Scene - Salta - Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper stand in [[Salta]] ([[Argentina]]).]]
Most nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a '''national newspaper'''. Some national newspapers, such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|national newspapers in the United Kingdom]], but only a [[List of newspapers in the United States|few in the United States]] and [[List of newspapers in Canada|Canada]]. In Canada, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' is sold throughout the country. In the United States, in addition to national newspapers as such, ''[[The New York Times]]'' is available throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herszenhorn|first1=David|title=Ask a Reporter|url=https://global.nytimes.com/learning/students/ask_reporters/Herszenhorn.html|website=global.nytimes.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|date=29 August 2001 |quote=As of January of this year [2001], the national editions of The Times were being printed at 19 different locations across the United States and home delivery was available in 195 markets throughout the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An old man in newsagent's shop, Paris September 2011.jpg|upright|thumb|International newspapers on sale in [[Paris]], France]]
There is also a small group of newspapers which may be characterized as '''international newspapers'''. Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or "international editions" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.

Similarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter ("[[snowbird (person)|snowbird]]s") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.

===Subject matter===
General newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Technology===

====Print====
For centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.
In recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.

====Online====
{{Main|Online newspaper}}
As of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 20172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based "newspapers" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.

Since 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50 % decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This "Best of" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.

==Organization and personnel==
[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona Góra]], Poland]]
In the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010–11 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself—editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names—as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.

Throughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or "desks", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.
[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]

[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printer]]s and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.

The staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.

==Zoned and other editions==
[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]
Newspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]
Most modern newspapers&lt;ref&gt;See K.G. Barnhurst and J. Nerone, ''The Form of News, A History'' (2001) for an overview of newspaper form from the late 17th to late 20th centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; are in one of three sizes:
* [[Broadsheet]]s: {{convert|600|x|380|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}, generally associated with more [[intellectual]] newspapers, although a trend towards "compact" newspapers is changing this. Examples include [[The Daily Telegraph]] in the United Kingdom. 
* [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]]s: half the size of broadsheets at {{convert|380|x|300|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}, and often perceived as [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] in contrast to broadsheets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Examples include ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[The National Enquirer]]'', ''[[Star (magazine)|The Star Magazine]]'', ''[[New York Post]]'', the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]], ''[[The Princely State]]'', ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]''.
** "Microdaily" is infrequently used to refer to a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized [[free daily newspaper]] that offers lower ad rates than its [[broadsheet]] competitors. The content of a microdaily can range from intense local news coverage to a combination of local and national stories.
* [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] or [[Midi (newspaper)|Midi]]: {{convert|470|x|315|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} used by European papers such as ''[[Le Monde]]'' in France, ''[[La Stampa]]'' in Italy, ''[[El País]]'' in Spain and, from 2005 until 2018, ''[[The Guardian]]'' in the United Kingdom.

Newspapers are usually printed on cheap, off-white paper known as [[newsprint]]. Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layout]]s and better design.

To help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'Équipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.

==Circulation and readership==
{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}
[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]
The number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.

According to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers—the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''—with circulations well above 5.5&amp;nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&amp;nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&amp;nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&amp;nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April–Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

[[File:USA Today newsracks.webm|thumb|Buying a newspaper]]
A common measure of a newspaper's health is market penetration, expressed as a percentage of households that receive a copy of the newspaper against the total number of households in the paper's market area. In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|title=Newspapers: Audience&amp;nbsp;– State of the Media 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.

==Advertising==
[[File:C &amp; A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&amp;A]] stores]]
A newspaper typically generates 70–80% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.&lt;ref name="business_model_1996"&gt;{{cite news

|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time&amp;nbsp;– early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321044034/http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 March 2008|title=wallstreetcosmos.com|publisher=wallstreetcosmos.com|date=|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.

In recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Frédéric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==
{{Main|Journalism}}
[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper "Severnyi Kray" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]
Since newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.

In the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who "leak" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' ("opposite the editorial page") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.

[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]
By the late 1990s, the availability of news via [[:Category:24-hour television news channels|24-hour television channels]] and then the availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the [[business model]] of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue—which makes up the bulk of most newspapers' income—has been shifting from print to the new media ([[social media]] websites and news websites), resulting in a general decline in print newspapers' revenues and profits. Many newspapers around the world launched online editions in the 2000s, in an attempt to follow or stay ahead of their audience. One of the big challenges is that a number of online news websites, such as [[Google news]], are free to access. Some online news sites are free, and rely on online advertising; other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. However, in the non-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, the growing middle class and other factors have more than compensated for the emergence of electronic media and newspapers continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;N. Ram, [http://www.hindu.com/af/india60/stories/2007081550100300.htm Newspaper futures: India and the world], 15 August 2007, [[The Hindu]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 1995, ''[[The American Reporter]]'' became the first daily Internet-based newspaper, with its own paid reporters around the world and all-original content. The editor-in-chief and founder is [[Joe Shea]]. The site is owned by 400 journalists.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Lasica, "Net Gain", ''American Journalism Review'', Vol. 18, November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The future of newspapers in countries with high levels of Internet access has been widely debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad sales, the loss of much classified advertising to [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]] and other websites, and precipitous drops in circulation. In the late 1990s the number of newspapers slated for closure, bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risen—especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001.&lt;ref name="E&amp;P0316" /&gt; Revenue has plunged while competition from internet media has squeezed older print publishers.&lt;ref name="E&amp;P0316"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/Specifics-on-Newspapers-from-State-of-News-Media-Report|title = Specifics on Newspapers from 'State of News Media' Report|first = Jennifer|last = Saba|work = [[Editor &amp; Publisher]]|date = 16 March 2009|accessdate = 17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate has become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 recession shaved newspapers' profits, and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13adco.html?src=linkedin|title=Newspapers' Web Revenue is Stalling|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 October 2008| first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a [[Business cycle|cyclical]] trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete, at least in their traditional paper format. As of 2017, an increasing percentage of [[Millennial]]s (young adults) get their news from [[social media]] websites such as [[Facebook]]. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering "digital editions", which can be accessed via [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]]s, and mobile devices such as [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s. Online newspapers may offer new advertising opportunities to newspaper companies, as [[online advertising]] enables much more precise targeting of ads; with an online newspaper, for example, different readers, such as [[Baby boomer]]s and [[Millennial]]s can be sent different advertisements.

[[File:Edward Hicks, American - Noah's Ark - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Noah's Ark'' (1846), by the American folk painter [[Edward Hicks]].]] 

'''Noah's Ark''' ({{lang-he|תיבת נח}}; [[Biblical Hebrew]]: ''Tevat Noaḥ'')&lt;ref group="Notes" name="Ark"&gt;The word "ark" in modern English comes from Old English ''aerca'', meaning a chest or box.(See Cresswell 2010, p.22) The Hebrew word for the vessel, ''teva'', occurs twice in the [[Torah]], in the flood narrative ([[Book of Genesis]] 6-9) and in the [[Book of Exodus]], where it refers to the basket in which [[Jochebed]] places the infant [[Moses]]. (The word for the [[Ark of the Covenant]] is quite different). The ark is built to save Noah, his family, and representatives of all animals from a divinely-sent flood intended to wipe out all life, and in both cases the ''teva'' has a connection with salvation from waters.(See Levenson 2014,p.21)&lt;/ref&gt; appears in the [[Genesis flood narrative]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] chapters 6–9) as the vessel in which [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] spares [[Noah]], his family, and a remnant of all the world's animals from a [[flood myth|world-engulfing flood]].{{sfn|Bailey|1990|p=63}} The flood myth is common to many cultures around the world, and the biblical version appears to have its primary source in the Mesopotamian myth of [[Utnapishtim]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=40}} The earliest known written flood myth is a [[Ziusudra#Sumerian flood myth|Sumerian flood myth]] found in the ''Deluge Tablet'' in which the hero is named [[Ziusudra]].{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|pp=61, 62}} The story in Genesis is repeated, with variations, in the [[Quran]], where the ark appears as ''Safina [[Noah in Islam|Nūḥ]]'' ({{lang-ar|سفينة نوح}} "Noah's boat").

[[Searches for Noah's Ark]] have been made from at least the time of [[Eusebius]] (c. 275–339&amp;nbsp;CE), and believers in the myth continue to search for it in modern times. Many searches have been mounted for the ark, but no confirmable physical proof of the ark has ever been found.&lt;ref name="Cline 2009" /&gt; There is no scientific evidence that Noah's Ark existed as it is described in the bible,&lt;ref name="Moore1983" /&gt; nor is there evidence in the geologic record for the biblical global flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ncse.com/library-resource/yes-noahs-flood-may-have-happened-not-over-whole-earth|title=Yes, Noah's Flood May Have Happened, But Not Over the Whole Earth|date=2016-03-07|work=NCSE|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
===Genesis 6:14–16===
Noah's instructions for the ark are described in Genesis 6:14–16. It is to be 300 [[cubit]]s long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, with three internal divisions (which are not actually called "decks", although presumably this is what is intended), a door in the side, and a ''tsohar'', which may be either a roof or a skylight.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=280–281}} It is to be made of ''gofer'' wood, a word which appears nowhere else in the Bible, and divided into ''qinnim'', a word which always refers to birds' nests elsewhere in the Bible, leading some scholars to emend this to ''qanim'', reeds.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=281}} The finished vessel is to be smeared with ''koper'': in Hebrew the two words are closely related, ''kaparta'' ("smeared") ... bakopper''.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=281}}

===Dimensions===
The dimensions of the ark are based on numerology: the length, 300 cubits, is 60x5, and the height, 30 cubits, is 60/2. {{sfn|Bailey|1990|p=63}} The same preoccupation with the number sixty characterises the vessel of the Babylonian flood-hero.{{sfn|Bailey|1990|p=63}}

==Origins==

===Mesopotamian precursors===
{{Main|Flood myth}}
For well over a century scholars have recognised that the Bible's story of Noah's ark is based on older Mesopotamian models.{{sfn|Kvanvig|2011|p=210}} Because all these flood stories deal with events that allegedly happened at the dawn of history, they give the impression that the myths themselves must come from very primitive origins, but the myth of the global flood that destroys all life only begins to appear in the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] (20th–16th centuries BCE).{{sfn|Chen|2013|p=3-4}} The reasons for this emergence of the typical Mesopotamian flood myth may have been bound up with the specific circumstances of the end of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] around 2004 BCE and the restoration of order by the First Dynasty of [[Isin]].{{sfn|Chen|2013|p=253}}

There are nine known versions of the Mesopotamian flood story, each more or less adapted from an earlier version. In the oldest version, inscribed in the Sumerian city of [[Nippur]] c.1600 BCE, the hero is King [[Ziusudra]]. This is known as the Sumerian Flood Story and probably derives from an earlier version. The Ziusudra version tells how he builds a boat and rescues life when the gods decide to destroy it. This remains the basic plot for several subsequent flood-stories and heroes, including Noah. Ziusudra's Sumerian name means "He of long life". In Babylonian versions his name is [[Atrahasis]], but the meaning is the same. In the Atrahasis version, the flood is a river flood.&lt;ref name="Cline"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |year=2007 |title=From Eden to Exile: Unraveling Mysteries of the Bible |publisher=National Geographic |isbn=978-1-4262-0084-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJW-zhffwk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=From+Eden+to+Exile:+Unraveling+Mysteries+of+the+Bible#v=onepage&amp;q=From%20Eden%20to%20Exile%3A%20Unraveling%20Mysteries%20of%20the%20Bible&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20-27}}

The version closest to the biblical story of Noah, as well as its most likely source, is that of [[Utnapishtim]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=40}} The most complete text of Utnapishtim's story is a clay tablet dating from the 7th century BCE, but fragments of the story have been found from as far back as the 19th century BCE.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=40}} The last known version of the Mesopotamian flood story was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE by a Babylonian priest named [[Berossus]]. From the fragments that survive, it seems little changed from the versions of two thousand years before.{{sfn|Finkel|2014|p=89-101}}

The parallels between Noah's Ark and the arks of Babylonian flood-heroes Atrahasis and Utnapishtim have often been noted. Atrahasis' ark was circular, resembling an enormous [[quffa]], and had one or two decks. Utnapishtim's ark was a [[cube]] and had six decks with seven compartments on each, each divided into nine subcompartments (for 63 subcompartments per deck and 378 total). Noah's Ark was rectangular and had three decks. There is believed to be a linear progression from circular to cubic or square to rectangular. The most striking similarity is the near-identical deck areas of the three arks: 14,400 cubits&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 14,400 cubits&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 15,000 cubits&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for Atrahasis', Utnapishtim's, and Noah's ark, respectively (a difference of 4%). This has led professor Finkel to conclude that "the iconic story of the Flood, Noah, and the Ark as we know it today certainly originated in the landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq."{{sfn|Finkel|2014|loc=chpt.14}}

Linguistic parallels between Noah's ark and the ark of the Babylonian flood-hero Atrahasis have also been noted. The word used for "pitch" (sealing tar or resin) in Genesis is not the normal Hebrew word, but is closely related to the word used in the Babylonian story.{{sfn|McKeown|2008|p=55}} Likewise, the Hebrew word for "ark" (''tevah'') is nearly identical to the Babylonian word for an oblong boat (''ṭubbû''), especially given that "v" and "b" are the same letter in Hebrew: [[bet (letter)|bet]] (ב).{{sfn|Finkel|2014|loc=chpt.14}}

However, the causes for God/gods having sent the flood differ. In the Hebrew myth the flood comes as God's judgment on a wicked humanity. In the Babylonian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the reasons are not given and the flood appears to be the result of the caprice of the gods.&lt;ref name="May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G., and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Atrahasis]] version of the Babylonian flood story, the flood was sent by the gods to reduce human over-population, and after the flood, other measures were introduced to prevent the problem recurring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]], ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YHfiCz4BRwC#v=onepage&amp;q=flood&amp;f=false ''Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, The Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others''], pp. 5–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dundes, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=E__dnnQwGDwC&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=Gilgamesh%2C%20flood&amp;f=false ''The Flood Myth''], pp. 61–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Composition===
{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}
There is consensus among scholars that the [[Torah]] (the first five books of the Bible, beginning with Genesis) was the product of a long and complex process that was not completed until after the [[Babylonian exile]].{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=23}} The Flood narrative in particular shows signs of being composed by the combination of two versions of the story, characterized by different names for God (one story uses "God", one "Yahweh").&lt;ref&gt;Richard Elliot Friedman (1997 ed.), ''Who Wrote the Bible'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the flood closely parallels the story of the creation: a cycle of creation, un-creation, and re-creation, in which the ark plays a pivotal role.{{sfn|Gooder|2005|p=38}} The universe as conceived by the ancient Hebrews comprised a flat disk-shaped habitable earth with the heavens above and [[Sheol]], the underworld of the dead, below.{{sfn|Knight|1990|pp=175–176}} These three were surrounded by a watery "ocean" of chaos, protected by the [[firmament]], a transparent but solid dome resting on the mountains which ringed the earth.{{sfn|Knight|1990|pp=175–176}} Noah's three-deck ark represents this three-level Hebrew cosmos in miniature: the heavens, the earth, and the waters beneath.{{sfn|Kessler|Deurloo|2004|p=81}} In Genesis 1, God created the three-level world as a space in the midst of the waters for humanity; in Genesis 6–8 (the flood narrative) he fills that space with waters again, saving only Noah, his family and the animals with him in the ark.{{sfn|Gooder|2005|p=38}}

[[Talmud]]ic [[Mishnah|tractates]] [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]], [[Avodah Zarah]], and [[Zevahim]] relate that, while Noah was building the ark, he attempted to warn his neighbors of the coming deluge, but was ignored or mocked. In order to protect Noah and his family, God placed lions and other ferocious animals to guard them from the wicked who tried to stop them from entering the ark. According to one [[Midrash]], it was God, or the [[angel]]s, who gathered the animals to the ark, together with their food. As there had been no need to distinguish between clean and unclean animals before this time, the clean animals made themselves known by kneeling before Noah as they entered the ark. A differing opinion said that the ark itself distinguished clean animals from unclean, admitting seven pairs each of the former and one pair each of the latter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

According to Sanhedrin 108b, Noah was engaged both day and night in feeding and caring for the animals, and did not sleep for the entire year aboard the ark.&lt;ref&gt;Avigdor Nebenzahl, ''Tiku Bachodesh Shofer: Thoughts for [[Rosh Hashanah]]'', Feldheim Publishers, 1997, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The animals were the best of their species, and so behaved with utmost goodness. They abstained from procreation, so that the number of creatures that disembarked was exactly equal to the number that embarked. The raven created problems, refusing to leave the ark when Noah sent it forth and accusing the patriarch of wishing to destroy its race, but as the commentators pointed out, God wished to save the raven, for its descendants were destined to feed the prophet [[Elijah]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

According to one tradition, refuse was stored on the lowest of the ark's three decks, humans and clean beasts on the second, and the unclean animals and birds on the top; a differing interpretation described the refuse as being stored on the utmost deck, from where it was shoveled into the sea through a trapdoor. Precious stones, said to be as bright as the noon sun, provided light, and God ensured that food remained fresh.&lt;ref name="JE Noah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ark of Noah"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hirsch |editor-first=E.

[[File:Woodcut of Noah's Ark from Anton Koberger's "German Bible".jpg|thumb|A woodcut of Noah's Ark from [[Anton Koberger]]'s German Bible]]
Interpretations of the ark narrative played an important role in early Christian doctrine. The [[First Epistle of Peter]] (composed around the end of the first century AD&lt;ref&gt;''The Early Christian World,'' Volume 1, p.148, [[Philip Esler]]&lt;/ref&gt;) compared Noah's salvation through water to salvation through water in baptism.{{Bibleref2c|1Pt|3:20–21}}

St. [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (died 235) sought to demonstrate that "the Ark was a symbol of the [[Christ]] who was expected", stating that the vessel had its door on the east side—the direction from which Christ would appear at the [[Second Coming]]—and that the bones of [[Adam]] were brought aboard, together with gold, [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]] (the symbols of the [[Nativity of Christ]]). Hippolytus furthermore stated that the ark floated to and fro in the four directions on the waters, making the sign of the cross, before eventually landing on Mount Kardu "in the east, in the land of the sons of Raban, and the Orientals call it Mount Godash; the [[Armenians]] call it Ararat".&lt;ref name="Knight, K 2007"&gt;{{cite web |author = Hippolytus |title = Fragments from the Scriptural Commentaries of Hippolytus |url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0502.htm |publisher = New Advent |accessdate = 27 June 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070417130437/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0502.htm |archive-date = 17 April 2007 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a more practical plane, Hippolytus explained that the lowest of the three decks was for wild beasts, the middle for birds and domestic animals, and the top level for humans. He says that male animals were separated from the females by sharp stakes so that there would be no breeding on board.&lt;ref name="Knight, K 2007"/&gt;

The early [[Church Father]] and theologian [[Origen]] (c. 182–251), in response to a critic who doubted that the ark could contain all the animals in the world, argued that Moses, the traditional author of the book of Genesis, had been brought up in [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and would therefore have used the larger Egyptian cubit. He also fixed the shape of the ark as a truncated [[pyramid]], square at its base, and tapering to a square peak one cubit on a side; it was not until the 12th century that it came to be thought of as a rectangular box with a sloping roof.{{sfn|Cohn|1996|p=38}}

Early Christian artists depicted Noah standing in a small box on the waves, symbolizing God saving the Christian Church in its turbulent early years. St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), in his work ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', demonstrated that the dimensions of the ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which according to Christian doctrine is the body of Christ and in turn the body of the Church.&lt;ref name="Schaff, P 1890"&gt;{{cite book |last=St. Augustin |editor-last=Schaff |editor-first=Philip |title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers |trans-title=St. Augustin's City of God and Christian Doctrine |series=1 |volume=2 |origyear=c. 400 |year=1890 |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Company |chapter=Chapter 26:That the Ark Which Noah Was Ordered to Make Figures In Every Respect Christ and the Church |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XV.26.html |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420) identified the raven, which was sent forth and did not return, as the "foul bird of wickedness" expelled by [[baptism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jerome |editor=Schaff, P |title=Niocene and Post-Niocene Fathers: The Principal Works of St. Jerome |series=2 |volume=6 |origyear=c. 347–420 |year=1892 |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Company |chapter=Letter LXIX.

In contrast to the Jewish tradition, which uses a term that can be translated as a "box" or "[[chest (furniture)|chest]]" to describe the Ark, surah 29:15 of the Quran refers to it as a ''safina'', an ordinary ship, and surah 54:13 describes the ark as "a thing of boards and nails". [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]], a contemporary of [[Muhammad]], wrote that Noah was in doubt as to what shape to make the ark, and that Allah revealed to him that it was to be shaped like a bird's belly and fashioned of [[teak]] wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baring-Gould|first=Sabine|title=Legends of the Patriarchs and Prophets and Other Old Testament Characters from Various Sources|publisher=James B.

[[Baidawi|Abdallah ibn 'Umar al-Baidawi]], writing in the 13th century, explains that in the first of its three levels wild and domesticated animals were lodged, in the second the human beings, and in the third the birds. On every plank was the name of a prophet. Three missing planks, symbolizing three prophets, were brought from [[Egypt]] by Og, son of Anak, the only one of the [[giant (mythology)|giant]]s permitted to survive the Flood. The body of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] was carried in the middle to divide the men from the women. Surah 11:41 says: "And he said, 'Ride ye in it; in the Name of Allah it moves and stays!'"; this was taken to mean that Noah said, "In the Name of Allah!" when he wished the ark to move, and the same when he wished it to stand still.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The medieval scholar [[Al-Masudi|Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn Masudi]] (died 956) wrote that Allah commanded the Earth to absorb the water, and certain portions which were slow in obeying received [[seawater|salt water]] in punishment and so became [[desert|dry and arid]]. The water which was not absorbed formed the seas, so that the waters of the flood still exist. Masudi says that the ark began its voyage at [[Kufa]] in central [[Iraq]] and sailed to [[Mecca]], circling the [[Kaaba]] before finally traveling to [[Mount Judi]], which surah 11:44 states was its final resting place. This mountain is identified by tradition with a hill near the town of [[Jazirat ibn Umar]] on the east bank of the [[Tigris]] in the province of [[Mosul]] in northern Iraq, and Masudi says that the spot could be seen in his time.&lt;ref name="JE Noah"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=McCurdy|editor-first=J.

[[Encyclopædia Britannica First Edition|The first edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] from 1771 describes the Ark's existence as fact. It also attempts to explain how the ark could house all living animal types: "... Buteo and [[Athanasius Kircher|Kircher]] have proved geometrically, that, taking the common [[cubit]] as a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged in it ... the number of species of animals will be found much less than is generally imagined, not amounting to a hundred species of [[quadrupeds]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ark |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=1771 |publisher=Society of Gentlemen in Scotland |location=Edinburgh |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDz63nYjAVwC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= |accessdate=2018-06-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805213913/https://books.google.com/books?id=kDz63nYjAVwC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2018-08-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also endorses a supernatural explanation for the flood, stating that "many attempts have been made to account for the deluge by means of natural causes: but these attempts have only tended to discredit philosophy, and to render their authors ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Deluge |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=1771 |publisher=Society of Gentlemen in Scotland |location=Edinburgh |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnW408_9_SMC&amp;pg=PA314#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= |accessdate=2018-06-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805213913/https://books.google.com/books?id=xnW408_9_SMC&amp;pg=PA314#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2018-08-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1860 edition attempts to solve the problem of the ark being unable to house all animal types by suggesting a local flood, which is described in the 1910 edition as part of a "gradual surrender of attempts to square scientific facts with a literal interpretation of the Bible" that resulted in "the '[[higher criticism]]' and the rise of the modern scientific views as to the origin of species" leading to "scientific comparative mythology" being the frame in which Noah's Ark was interpreted by 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ark |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=1910 |publisher=Horace Everett Hooper |volume=2 Slice 5 |location=Ark |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34116/34116-h/34116-h.htm#ar112 |date= |accessdate=2018-06-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122810/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34116/34116-h/34116-h.htm#ar112 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the [[Renaissance]] saw much speculation on the nature of the ark that might have seemed familiar to early theologians such as [[Origen]] and [[Augustine]]. At the same time, however, a new class of scholarship arose, one which, while never questioning the literal truth of the ark story, began to speculate on the practical workings of Noah's vessel from within a purely naturalistic framework. In the 15th century, Alfonso Tostada gave a detailed account of the logistics of the ark, down to arrangements for the disposal of dung and the circulation of fresh air. The 16th-century [[geometry|geometer]] Johannes Buteo calculated the ship's internal dimensions, allowing room for Noah's grinding mills and smokeless ovens, a model widely adopted by other commentators.&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|1996|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''open2save''' is a local deals and coupons listing service for consumers in [[India]]. It was launched in January 2008 by AeNwis e-Systems based in [[Bangalore]]. The service is free for consumers and a channel for promoting their deals/coupons for retailers in India.

The service is currently available in Bangalore, [[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]], Chennai and [[Pune]]. The service currently lists over 10,000 deals from 2,000+ retailers.

open2save is available both as an online service  and as an offline service.

==Service details==
The online service lists deals and prices for models across various including mobiles, laptops, [[LCD television|LCD TVs]], digital cameras, clothes etc. Consumers who visit the site can find the best prices or deals in their city based on price, popularity of features. Using the deal information visitors can contact the retailers themselves or contact the open2save team. The open2save team will short list 3-4 retailers with the best deals for the request in the relevant area and have the retailers contact the consumer.

The offline service largely provides discount coupons to corporates, privilege programs and direct to home (local/area specific).

==Business model==
The service is essential a combination of typical '''Price Comparison Services''' like Shopping.com and '''Discount Coupon Service''' like ValPak. The company generates revenue through a combination of pricing modesl including selling leads to retailers, price per coupon distributed, price per coupon downloaded and price per coupon redeemed.

Though the concept is not unique, the implementation of this in a country like India is unique given the challenges of collating information in a structured manner from a relatively large set of retailers who are not organized electronically. open2save is one of the first services of this type along with others like offersforshoppers.com and compareindia.com.

[[Image:Pacta Conventa.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The first ''pacta conventa'', signed by King [[Henry III of France|Henry of Poland]], 1573]]
'''''Pacta conventa''''' (Latin for "articles of agreement") was a contractual agreement, from 1573 to 1764 entered into between the "Polish nation" (i.e., the [[Szlachta|szlachta (nobility)]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) and a newly elected [[monarch|king]] upon his [[Royal elections in Poland|"free election" (''wolna elekcja'')]] to the throne.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;

The document was drawn up by the [[convocation sejm]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-74"/&gt; The ''pacta conventa'' affirmed the king-elect's pledge to respect the laws of the Commonwealth and specified his undertakings and promises in such realms as [[foreign policy]], [[tax]]es, [[public debt]], the military, and so on.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt; They varied from king to king, depending on whatever particular pledges he might have made.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt; An example of the various concrete undertakings found in a king-elect's ''pacta conventa'' is King [[Władysław IV Vasa]]'s pledge to create a [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy]] for the [[Baltic Sea]].

In addition to his own unique ''pacta conventa'', each king-elect was required to sign the [[Henrician Articles]], a set of privileges named after the first king who signed them, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Poland]].&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt; Unlike the ''pacta conventa'', the Henrician Articles were constant and unchanging.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt; The distinction between the two documents gradually faded away over successive elections. Together, those two documents spelled out most of the key details of the Commonwealth political system.&lt;ref name="bardach216-217"/&gt;

'''Pinxton Porcelain''' was a porcelain works created by John Coke and [[William Billingsley (artist)|William Billingsley]] in [[Pinxton]] in Derbyshire, England.

== History ==
Pinxton Porcelain was founded on land at the head of the Cromford canal rented from the Reverend [[D'Ewes Coke]]'s third son who went into business with the businessman and [[porcelain painter]] William Billingsley. Billingsley who had been trained at the Derby works is now renowned for the quality of his porcelain painting particularly his flower painting but he was also interested in perfecting a porcelain recipe which it is thought he obtained from [[Zachariah Boreman]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinxton Porcelain|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461270/Pinxton-porcelain|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billingsley eventually left Pinxton and briefly set up a decorating shop in [[Mansfield]] where he decorated imported porcelain and pottery including some Pinxton porcelain. John Coke continued the business from 1799 to 1806, even taking in Henry Banks as a partner from 1801 to 1802. After John Coke married in 1806, John Cutts carried on until finely closing the factory in 1813.

Coke married Susanna Wilmot in April 1806 and although the porcelain business continued under John Cutts who had been decorating manager until 1813, Coke's interest moved to his coal mining business in Pinxton and he moved his family home to [[Debdale Hall]].

There is continued interest in Pinxton Porcelain and a group was formed in 1996 of people interested in this factory and its wares. The society has published a number of publications and organised exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461270/Pinxton-porcelain | title=About Pinxton Porcelain Society | publisher=Pinxton Porcelain Society | accessdate=2014-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabaret teapot illustrated was made at the Pinxton Porcelain factory and shows Brookhill Hall which was a home of John Coke.

'''Planz''' is an open source [[personal information manager]] developed by the Keeping Found Things Found group at the [[University of Washington Information School]]. It integrates e-mail, website links and content, computer files and folders, and informal notes into a simplified, document-like interface. Its purpose is to make the user's personal information easily accessible for use in planning everyday activities as well as larger projects. Planz is a research prototype rather than a commercial product.

==Purpose==

Planz was conceived in response to research conducted by the Keeping Found Things Found (KFTF) group and elsewhere in the field of [[personal information management]] (PIM). The research suggested that people often have trouble organizing their digital personal information effectively, due to the fact that this information is both extensive and scattered and in many cases cannot easily be combined with other personal information. The developers hoped to accommodate the fluid and often informal nature of human planning by providing users an interface with powerful organizational features while at the same time leaving the structure of that organization to the user's discretion.

==Development==

Planz was developed between 2008 and 2010. The head developer is William Jones, leading the KFTF group. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation. The software has progressed through several development versions, and as of 2010 Planz is not in commercial release.

==Design==

Planz is meant to help people better organize their digital personal information by providing a central document linking related personal information around a conceptual theme, usually in the form of a project, such as a home remodel or a trip to Europe. The interface shows users a document in either a draft or outline view. This document can be edited to show all of a user's projects and tasks in a single, scrollable pane. Headings are used to represent high-level projects ("Re-model the house"); subheadings represent sub-projects and component tasks ("Kitchen"; "Decide on countertops").

Users have the option of working from within the Planz document, sending e-mails and creating documents without leaving Planz, in which case Planz dynamically links these new information items into the document. They also have the option of working from outside the document by dragging and copying files, e-mails, hyperlinks, and other items into Planz in the course of using other applications. The efficient transfer of information between applications was a key objective in the design of Planz, and the interface provides users with specialized tools to facilitate this.

Planz works in many ways like a word processor. Users can enter notes directly, and these notes can be arranged under numerous levels of headings, promoted or demoted, and moved up or down according to importance or priority. From a design standpoint, the document overlay of Planz makes the realization of additional features straightforward, which was an important goal of the development team.

By default, Planz presents a document that is anchored at a "Projects" folder{{Ref_label|b|b|none}}. However, for any folder selected in the file manager, Planz can also be invoked as a right-click option to present a document anchored at this folder instead.

The document presented in a Planz window can be saved as an [[HTML]] file to be viewed in a web browser or edited in a word processor. Structure as well as content is preserved{{Ref_label|c|c|none}}. The structure of a Planz document can also be exported for re-use either as a project template or for immediate use in another project. On the back-end, the file system headings and subheadings correspond to file system folders and sub-folders. Links within Planz correspond either to local files within these folders or to shortcuts which, in turn, can point to files, web pages or e-mail messages. The mapping from headings and links to folders, files, and shortcuts is one-to-one. Thus, Planz works with, and as an alternative to, the file manager. Users can create, modify or delete folders and files through operations initiated within Planz. In the other direction, a process of synchronization works to ensure the document views of Planz are current with respect to changes to the file system made outside of Planz.

Planz is designed to provide for the complete life cycle of personal information management from initial information capture, to information's timely use in completing tasks, to its eventual archival for clutter control and future reference.

==QuickCapture==

QuickCapture is a pop-up utility associated with Planz. Its purpose is to quickly copy the content of a webpage, e-mail message, or document, while also linking back to the original. In Planz this information is structured as a note, and as a shortcut within the file system. QuickCapture is able to work independently from Planz. All communication is via a "XooML" middleware layer.

==Other key functions==

Users can flag headings in Planz as tasks yet to be completed. Flagged headings can optionally appear as tasks or calendar appointments within a separate task management or calendaring application{{Ref_label|d|d|none}}. Shortcuts to these headings can appear as sub-headings under a special "Today+" heading in Planz, as a task to do that day or in the otherwise immediate future.

"PowerD" support makes it easy for users to mark a heading or note as "done" or to "defer" for later completion. The heading or note no longer appears in the Planz document, but can reappear again later either at the user’s request or automatically when a deferred date comes due.

Tasks marked as done are recorded in a journal. The journal is another file system folder with subfolders for year, month, week and day. Like any other folder, the journal can also appear as a single integrated document in Planz. Users can easily take notes and link in information in the form of pictures, videos, and documents, either as a "for the record" of past events or for planning future events.

==Integration with other services==

Planz works with these other applications:

[[Microsoft Outlook]]: Users can flag a heading in Planz to create a task or calendar appointment in Outlook. They can click on a task or appointment to access relevant information. "The Days Ahead" allows them to track deadlines and appointments through dynamic interaction with Microsoft Outlook's Calendar.

[[Microsoft Office]]: New Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote documents can be created from within Planz, or existing Office documents can be linked to Planz. Open documents can also be included in a plan.

[[Web browser]]: Users can links to websites in Planz.

==XooML==

Planz and QuickCapture utilize metadata encoded in XML, called the Cross-Tool Markup Language, or "XooML" (pronounced "zoomul"){{Ref_label|e|e|none}}. The XooML schema specifies the structure of a fragment of metadata as this might apply to any information item addressed by a URI.

Essentially, a XooML-compliant fragment (or, simply, a XooML fragment) is a bundling of attributes. A fragment can have zero or more associations which, in turn, can point to other fragments representing other information items. Fragments are a bundling of attributes. Some bundles apply to the fragment as a whole; some bundles apply to individual associations. Bundles at each level can be held in common (cross-tool) or tool-specific. A XooML-based tool such as Planz then builds a view as follows:

Step one is to retrieve the XooML fragment for the window's anchor URI and synchronize its metadata as needed with the item pointed to by the URI. The current version of Planz, for example, places XooML fragments in association with file folders in order to support the use of folder structure as a means of organizing not only files but also e-mail messages, web references and informal notes. In a step of synchronization, the folder's contents (as determined by file system calls) are compared to the information in the folder's associated XooML fragment. In cases of conflict, the fragment is modified to agree with the file system (i.e., the file system always wins). From the top-level synchronized XooML fragment, Planz builds a top-level Plan.

Step two is to recursively retrieve and process additional XooML fragments as needed. In Planz, for example, the subfolders and folder shortcuts of a folder appear within the folder's Plan as document-like heading associations. For each of these headings that were last shown as "expanded," Planz retrieves folder content information and an associated XooML fragment and then uses the results of their synchronization to determine the display of a sub-Plan.

Step three is to view completion is tool-dependent. In Planz, the process completes when sub-plans have been generated for each in a list of expanded associations encountered during the processing of XooML fragments.

==Notes==

'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} Planz is currently Microsoft Windows-based. However, through use of an XML-based XooML middleware layer (see discussion of XooML elsewhere in this article), the Planz approach readily extends to other file systems and other stores.
'''b.''' {{Note_label|b|b|none}} “Projects” is created on installation of Planz as a sibling folder of “Documents” (or for Windows XP users, “My Projects”).
'''c.''' {{Note_label|c|c|none}} In Microsoft Word, for example, headings are given a “style” of Heading 1, 2, 3… according to heading level within Planz.
'''d.''' {{Note_label|d|d|none}} Planz currently includes special integrations for Microsoft Outlook. But the approach readily extends to other calendaring and task/time management applications.
'''e.''' {{Note_label|e|e|none}} For the complete schema definition, see the KFTF website. [http://kftf.ischool.washington.edu/XMLschema/0.41/XooML.xsd]

A '''plural society''' is defined by [[Fredrik Barth]] as a [[society]] combining [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] contrasts: the [[Economics|economic]] interdependence of those groups, and their [[Ecology|ecological]] specialization (i.e., use of different environmental resources by each ethnic group). The ecological interdependence, or the lack of competition, between ethnic groups may be based on the different activities in the same region or on long–term occupation of different regions in the
Defined by [[J S Furnivall]] as a medley of [[people]]s - [[Demographics of Europe|European]], [[Nationalities of China|Chinese]], [[Demographics of India|Indian]] and [[wiktionary:native|native]], who do mix but do not combine. Each group holds by its own [[religion]], its own [[culture]] and [[language]], its own [[idea]]s and ways. As individuals they meet, but only in the [[marketplace]] in buying and selling. There is a plural society, with different sections of the [[community]] living side by side, within the same [[Politics|political]] unit.

==Plural Societies and hunting Regimes==

During research about plural societies, Asim Ejaz, Student of M.phil Political Science in Islamia university bahawalpur, Pakistan, presented his analytical summary about the book of Arend Lijphart, "democracy in plural societies" that it is so much difficult to achieve and stable democratic government in plural society. As Aristotle says about stable governing system that, “a state aims at being, as far as it can be, a society composed of equal &amp; peers”. For the stability of democratic regimes, there must be social homogeneity and political consensus among the deep social divisions, and, there must be termination of political differences. There are these criteria, because, the factors that help in producing instability and breakdown of democracies.
Arend Lijphart, therefore, used a particular form of democracy, “Consociational Democracy”, which is, according to him, may be difficult but it is not at all impossible to achieve and maintain stable democratic government in plural societies.

Consociational democracy can be characterized by the cooperative attitude and behavior of the leaders of the different segments of the population. In other meanings, there will be elite cooperation. This model of Consociational democracy is both, normative and an empirical. In Austria, Belgium, Netherland and Switzerland, there are sharp political divisions, but due to Consoiciational democracy, there is existence of political stability. In Austria, political stability can be observed in the forms of Catholic-Socialist elite cooperation and grand coalition.

In non-Western countries, as Arend Lijphart highlights twin problems, and there are, sharp cleavages of various kind and political stability. For the successful democratic regimes in the third world, due to plural societies, Consociational democracy is based, also on normative model. A Plural society is a society, divided by segmental cleavages, and, political stability is characterized by system maintenance, legitimacy, civil order and effectiveness. Without these four elements, which are also interdependent, political stability cannot exist. According to Gabriel Almond, there are four types of political systems;

1)	Anglo-American Political System
2)	Continental European Political System
3)	Pre-Industrial Political System
4)	Totalitarian Political System.

He says that Anglo-American and Continental European Political systems show democratic regimes. The Anglo-American political system is a homogenous and secular political system, while the Continental European political system is characterized by a fragmentation of political culture due to plural societies within European countries.

According to Gabriel Almond, Separation of power doctrine is also concerned with political stability. He extends the idea of “separation of power” from three formal branches of government, executives and legislature, to informal political subcultures like parties, interest groups and the media of communication. He much more emphasizes on input structures than the output structures.

Duverger and Neumann argue that there is a close relationship between the number of parties and democratic stability, but a two party system not only seems to correspond to the nature of things because it can moderate better than multiparty systems. In other words, a two party system is the best aggregation. In Switzerland, there is a multiparty system, while in Austria, there is a two party system.

Arend Lijphart says that there are deep divisions between different segments of the population and absence of a unifying consensus in most of the Asian, African and South American countries like Guyana, Surinam and Trinidad. According to Cliffard Geertz, Communal attachment is called “primordial loyalties”, which may be based on language, religion, custom, region, race or assumed blood ties. Each communal group hold its assumed ties, therefore there is political instability and breakdown of democracy up until now.

He argues that due to political development, western countries have created homogeneity among their plural societies, as like idealize British society. But Gabriel Almond says that, in Continental European political system, there is no secularism and political homogeneity, but there is cultural homogeneity. He argues that, non-western countries would become more comprehensive and less remote they use this continental type, which is based on a multi-racial (multi-national) society and lacking in strong consensus.

Furnivall says that democracy is achieved by the European countries with the help of Consociationalism, and, there is fulfillment of the requirements and demands of the divided societies through appropriate processes. On the other hand, in non-western countries, there is lack of strength in social will and social unity due to divided society, and, it is dangerous for both, the democracy and a considerable degree of political unity.

==Consociational Democracy and the Segments of Plural Society==

As Arend Lijhpart argues that there is constitutionalization for the segments of plural societies, and its better solution is consociational or semi-consociational democratic system. This system provides the facility of Mutual Veto regarding the decision making process on the specific issues within the country, to all the segments of society with equality. but Arend Lijhpart highlights Malaysia and Lebanon for its perfect example. In Lebanon, there are Shia's and Sunni's in the Muslim Segment while Christians are in the minority. Similarly in Malaysia, there are Chinese with local Communities.

{{Family law}}
A '''postnuptial agreement''' is a written agreement executed after a couple gets [[marriage|married]], or have entered a [[civil union]], to settle the couple's affairs and [[asset]]s in the event of a [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]]. It may be "[[Notary public|notarized]]" or [[acknowledgement (law)|acknowledged]] and may be the subject of the [[statute of frauds]]. Like the contents of a [[prenuptial agreement]], provisions vary widely but commonly includes provisions for [[division of property]] and [[alimony|spousal support]] in the event of divorce, death of one of the [[spouses]], or breakup of marriage.

==Canada==
In Canada, postnuptial agreements are permitted, and in fact most provinces have statutes specifically allowing them.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, courts subject them to more legal scrutiny than prenuptial agreements. The reason for this is the legal theory that prior to marriage, neither spouse has any legal rights, so a spouse is not giving anything up by signing a prenuptial agreement.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, once married, various family law rights crystallize. Thus, if one enters into a postnuptial agreement, one is giving up rights that one already has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Behrendt|first1=Jeffrey|title=Post Nuptial Agreement|url=http://www.prenup.ca/postnup/|website=Prenup.ca|publisher=Behrendt Professional Corporation|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
As with prenuptial agreements, a court has the discretion to reject the terms of a post-nuptial agreements, for example if the court finds that its terms are insufficient to meet the financial needs of partners and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=Prenuptial agreements 'should be legally binding in divorce cases'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/27/pre-numpial-agreements-legally-binding-divorce-law-commission|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pennells|first1=Sarah|title=Post-nuptial agreements; how they work and what the law says|url=https://www.savvywoman.co.uk/2009/11/post-nuptial-agreements-how-they-work-and-what-the-law-says/|website=savvywoman|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==

===History===
Postnuptial agreements only came to be widely accepted in the United States in the latter half of the 20th century. Before that time, U.S. jurisprudence followed the notion that [[contracts]], such as a postnuptial agreements, could not be valid when executed between a husband and wife. The inability of a husband and wife to contract with one another was due to the concept of marital unity: at the time of marriage, husband and wife become a single entity or person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=G.L.|title=The Legal Unity of Husband and Wife|journal=The Modern Law Review|date=1947|volume=10|issue=1|pages=16–31|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.1947.tb00034.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Robert F.|last2=Ackerman|first2=Robert M.|title=Law and Community: The Case of Torts|date=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0742522008|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NexFPWxEOOEC|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since one may not enter into a contract with one's self, a postnuptial agreement would thus be invalid.

Even after U.S. courts began to reject marital unity as a legal theory, postnuptial agreements were rejected as being seen to encourage [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt; See Sec. 4, et seq., {{cite book|last1=Oldham|first1=J. Thomas|title=Divorce, Separation and the Distribution of Property|date=2006|publisher=Law Journal Press|isbn=978-1588520432|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFID0BiDKrMC|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only in the 1970s that postnuptial agreements started to gain broad acceptance in the United States. Factors that contributed to this acceptance include the increase in divorce during the 1970s, and the implementation of so-called "no fault" divorces pursuant to which a married couple could get a divorce based without the need for an accusation of misconduct against one or both spouses. In the wake of those changes, postnuptial agreements began to find acceptance in American jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="Standler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Standler|first1=Ronald B.|title=Prenuptial and Postnuptial Contract Law in  the  USA|url=http://www.rbs2.com/dcontract.pdf|website=Dr. Ronald B. Standler|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
In the United States, much like [[prenuptial agreement]]s, although laws vary by state there are five basic elements that must generally be met for a postnuptial agreement to be enforceable:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Sean H.|title=Postnuptial Agreements|journal=Wisconsin Law Review|date=2007|page=827|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wlr2007&amp;div=33&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# it must be in writing (oral promises of this kind are always unenforceable);
# it must be executed voluntarily;
# it must be done with full and/or fair disclosure at the time of execution;
# it must not be  [[unconscionable]]; and
# it must be executed (signed) by both parties.

Although not required in all states, it is a good idea for both spouses to be independently represented by lawyers when they negotiate and finalize a postnuptial agreement.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Does a Postnuptial Agreement Work|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/family-law-and-divorce/how-does-postnuptial-agreement-work|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postnuptial agreements typically address one or more of the following concerns:
*Providing for the assignation of marital property at the time of death of one spouse. These agreements may have a surviving spouse waive rights to certain property that they would otherwise have the right to inherit under a will or statutory scheme.
*Agreements made in anticipation of separation. These agreements are entered into to avoid the time and cost of divorce proceedings. The disposition of property, other marital assets, custody, alimony and support and the like are agreed to by the marital partners upon separation and the agreement later, usually, incorporated into the final divorce decree.
*Agreements that seek to affect the spouses' rights in a future divorce. These agreements address the division of the spouses' assets, including property obtained before and during the marriage, and often limit or waive [[alimony]].&lt;ref name="Standler"/&gt;

Provisions that are included in a postnuptial agreement that relate to child custody or child support are not enforceable, nor are provisions that attempt to regulate routine aspects of the marital relationship.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

{{Sociology}}
In [[social science]] and [[politics]], '''power''' is the ability to [[Social influence|influence]] or outright [[Social control|control]] the behaviour of people. The term "[[authority]]" is often used for power perceived as [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] by the [[social structure]]. Power can be seen as evil or [[injustice|unjust]], this sort of primitive exercise of power is historically [[wikt:endemic|endemic]] to humans, however as social beings the same concept is seen as good and as something inherited or given for exercising [[Humanism|humanistic]] objectives that will help, enable and move people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Luthans|author2=Brett C. Luthans|author3=Kyle W. Luthans|title=Organizational Behavior: An Evidence Based Approach, 13th Ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogYoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|date=1 June 2015|publisher=IAP Inc|isbn=978-1-68123-121-1|pages=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it is derived by the factors of interdependence between two entities and the environment. In &lt;!--the corporate environment--&gt;[[business]], the ethical instrumentality of power is achievement, and as such it is a [[zero-sum game]]. In simple terms it can be expressed as being "upward" or "downward". With downward power, a company's superior influences subordinates for attaining organizational goals. When a company exerts upward power, it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of their leader or leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schein |first=Larry E. Greiner, Virginia E. |title=Power and organization development : mobilizing power to implement change |date=1988 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading, Mass. |isbn=0201121859 |edition= Repr. with corrections.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of power need not involve force or the threat of force ([[coercion]]). On one side, it closely resembles what egalitarian and consensual nations (Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) might term as "influence," contrasted with the extreme what some authors identify as "intimidation" in capitalist nations, a means by which power is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handy |first=Charles |title=Understanding organizations |date=1993 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=9780140156034 |edition= 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of using power without oppression is the concept "[[soft power]]," as compared to [[hard power]].

Much of the recent [[Sociology|sociological]] debate about power revolves around the issue of its means to enable{{spndash}}in other words, power as a means to make [[social actions]] possible as much as it may constrain or prevent them. The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] saw power as a [[Structuralism|structural]] expression of "a complex strategic situation in a given [[social setting]]"&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Collin (1980). Forward. In  ''Power/Knowledge'', Foucault, Michel, Pantheon Books, New York, 1980. {{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that requires both constraint and enablement.

== Theories ==

=== Five bases ===
{{Main|French and Raven's five bases of power}}
Social psychologists [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]], in a now-classic study (1959),&lt;ref&gt;French, J.R.P., &amp; Raven, B. (1959). 'The bases of social power,' in D. Cartwright (ed.) Studies in Social Power. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press. {{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work (or fail to work) in a specific relationship.

According to French and Raven, power must be distinguished from influence in the following way: power is that state of affairs which holds in a given relationship, A-B, such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely. Conceived this way, power is fundamentally ''relative'' – it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship, and requires B's recognition of a quality in A which would motivate B to change in the way A intends. A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship, to effect the desired outcome. Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects, including a reduction in A's own power.

French and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities, while not excluding other minor categories. Further bases have since been adduced – in particular by [[Gareth Morgan (author)|Gareth Morgan]] in his 1986 book, ''[[Images of Organization]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1873&amp;context=utk_graddiss|title=Everyday Experiences of Power|date=August 2010|first=Kelly E.|last=de Moll|page=22|format=PDF|publisher=University of Tennessee|location=Knoxville, TN|type=Ph.D. dissertation|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legitimate power ====
{{Main|Legitimate power}}
Also called "positional power," it is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization. Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position. It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power such as a [[uniform]], a title, or an imposing physical office.

==== Referent power ====
{{Main|Referent power}}
Referent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build [[loyalty]]. It is based on the [[charisma]] and [[interpersonal skills]] of the power holder. A person may be admired because of specific personal trait, and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence. Here the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities, and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower. [[Nationalism]] and [[patriotism]] count towards an intangible sort of referent power. For example, soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country. This is the second least obvious power, but the most effective. Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for products endorsements, for example. The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement, although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management|date=2008|first1=Patrick J.|last1=Montana|first2=Bruce H.|last2=Charnov|edition= 4th|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJIQ2XGhneUC&amp;pg=PA257 257]|isbn=9780764139314|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=Hauppauge, NY|oclc=175290009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse is possible when someone that is likable, yet lacks integrity and honesty, rises to power, placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group's position. Referent power is unstable alone, and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect. When combined with other sources of power, however, it can help a person achieve great success.

==== Expert power ====
{{Main|Expert power}}
[[Expert]] power is an individual's power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization's needs for those skills and expertise. Unlike the others, this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified. When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation, suggest solutions, use solid judgment, and generally out perform others, then people tend to listen to them. When individuals demonstrate expertise, people tend to trust them and respect what they say. As subject matter experts, their ideas will have more value, and others will look to them for [[leadership]] in that area.

==== Reward power ====
{{Main|Reward power}}
[[Reward system|Reward]] power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards, it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind such as benefits, time off, desired gifts, promotions or increases in pay or responsibility. This power is obvious but also ineffective if abused. People who abuse reward power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or 'moving things too quickly'. If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants, there's a high probability that they'll do it. The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required. Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases, and managers often can't control promotions all by themselves. And even a CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions. So when somebody uses up available rewards, or the rewards don't have enough perceived value to others, their power weakens. (One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they're to have the same motivational impact. Even then, if rewards are given frequently, people can become satiated by the reward, such that it loses its effectiveness).

==== Coercive power ====
{{Main|Coercive power}}
{{See also|Coercive control}}
[[Coercive]] power is the application of negative influences. It includes the ability to demote or to withhold other rewards. The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld that ensures the obedience of those under power. Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it. Threats and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] are common tools of coercion. Implying or threatening that someone will be fired, demoted, denied privileges, or given undesirable assignments – these are characteristics of using coercive power. Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting, and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold, impoverished style of leadership. This is a type of power is commonly seen in fashion industry by coupling with legitimate power, it is referred in the industry specific literature's as "glamorization of structural domination and exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/02/academic-exposing-ugly-reality-high-fashion-giulia-mensitieri&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles in interpersonal relationships ===
According to Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen in "Close encounters: Communication in Relationships":&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Laura K., and Peter A. Andersen. Close encounters: Communication in Relationships. 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE, 2011. Print. p.267-261&lt;/ref&gt;
# Power as a Perception: Power is a perception in a sense that some people can have objective power, but still have trouble influencing others. People who use power cues and act powerfully and proactively tend to be perceived as powerful by others. Some people become influential even though they don't overtly use powerful behavior.
# Power as a Relational Concept: Power exists in relationships. The issue here is often how much relative power a person has in comparison to one's partner. Partners in close and satisfying relationships often influence each other at different times in various arenas.
# Power as Resource Based: Power usually represents a struggle over resources. The more scarce and valued resources are, the more intense and protracted are power struggles. The scarcity hypothesis indicates that people have the most power when the resources they possess are hard to come by or are in high demand. However, scarce resource leads to power only if it's valued within a relationship.
# The Principle of Least Interest and Dependence Power: The person with less to lose has greater power in the relationship. Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partner are less powerful, especially if they know their partner is uncommitted and might leave them. According to interdependence theory, quality of alternatives refers to the types of relationships and opportunities people could have if they were not in their current relationship. The [[principle of least interest]] suggests that if a difference exists in the intensity of positive feelings between partners, the partner who feels the most positive is at a power disadvantage. There's an inverse relationship between interest in relationship and the degree of relational power.
# Power as [[Enabling]] or Disabling: Power can be enabling or disabling. Research{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} has been shown that people are more likely to have an enduring influence on others when they engage in dominant behavior that reflects [[social skill]] rather than [[intimidation]]. Personal power is protective against pressure and excessive [[Social influence|influence]] by others and/or situational stress. People who communicate through self-confidence and expressive, composed behavior tend to be successful in achieving their goals and maintaining good relationships. Power can be disabling when it leads to destructive patterns of communication.  This can lead to the chilling effect where the less powerful person often hesitates to communicate dissatisfaction, and the demand withdrawal pattern which is when one person makes demands and the other becomes defensive and withdraws(mawasha, 2006).Both effects have negative consequences for relational satisfaction.
# Power as a Prerogative: The prerogative principle states that the partner with more power can make and break the rules. Powerful people can violate norms, break relational rules, and manage interactions without as much penalty as powerless people. These actions may reinforce the powerful person's dependence power. In addition, the more powerful person has the prerogative to manage both verbal and nonverbal interactions. They can initiate conversations, change topics, interrupt others, initiate touch, and end discussions more easily than less powerful people. (See [[expressions of dominance]].)

=== Rational choice framework ===
[[Game theory]], with its foundations in the [[Neoclassical economics|Walrasian]] theory of [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]], is increasingly used in various disciplines to help analyze power relationships. One rational choice definition of power is given by [[Keith Dowding]] in his book ''Power''.

In rational choice theory, human individuals or groups can be modelled as 'actors' who choose from a 'choice set' of possible actions in order to try to achieve desired outcomes. An actor's 'incentive structure' comprises (its beliefs about) the costs associated with different actions in the choice set, and the likelihoods that different actions will lead to desired outcomes.

In this setting we can differentiate between:
# '''outcome power''' – the ability of an actor to bring about or help bring about outcomes;
# '''social power''' – the ability of an actor to change the incentive structures of other actors in order to bring about outcomes.

This framework can be used to model a wide range of social interactions where actors have the ability to exert power over others. For example, a 'powerful' actor can take options away from another's choice set; can change the relative costs of actions; can change the likelihood that a given action will lead to a given outcome; or might simply change the other's beliefs about its incentive structure.

As with other models of power, this framework is neutral as to the use of 'coercion'. For example: a threat of violence can change the likely costs and benefits of different actions; so can a financial penalty in a 'voluntarily agreed' contract, or indeed a friendly offer.

=== Cultural hegemony ===
In the [[Marxism|Marxist]] tradition, the [[Italy|Italian]] writer [[Antonio Gramsci]] elaborated the role of [[ideology]] in creating a [[cultural hegemony]], which becomes a means of bolstering the power of [[capitalism]] and of the [[nation-state]]. Drawing on [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] in [[The Prince]], and trying to understand why there had been no [[Communist]] revolution in [[Western Europe]], while it was claimed there had been one in [[Russia]], Gramsci conceptualised this hegemony as a [[centaur]], consisting of two halves. The back end, the beast, represented the more classic, material image of power, power through coercion, through brute force, be it physical or economic. But the capitalist hegemony, he argued, depended even more strongly on the front end, the human face, which projected power through 'consent'. In Russia, this power was lacking, allowing for a revolution. However, in Western Europe, specifically in [[Italy]], capitalism had succeeded in exercising ''consensual'' power, convincing the working classes that their interests were the same as those of capitalists. In this way revolution had been avoided.

While Gramsci stresses the significance of ideology in power structures, Marxist-feminist writers such as Michele Barrett stress the role of ideologies in extolling the virtues of family life. The classic argument to illustrate this point of view is the use of women as a '[[reserve army of labour]]'. In wartime it is accepted that women perform masculine tasks, while after the war the roles are easily reversed. Therefore, according to Barrett, the destruction of capitalist economic relations is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of women.&lt;ref&gt;Pip Jones, ''Introducing Social Theory'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 2008, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

He shows that power over an individual can be amplified by the presence of a group. If the group conforms to the leader's commands, the leader's power over an individual is greatly enhanced while if the group does not conform the leader's power over an individual is nil.

=== Foucault ===
For [[Michel Foucault]], the real power will always rely on the ignorance of its agents. No single human, group nor single actor runs the dispositif (machine or apparatus) but power is dispersed through the apparatus as efficiently and silently as possible, ensuring its agents to do whatever is necessary. It is because of this action that power is unlikely to be detected that it remains elusive to 'rational' investigation. Foucault quotes a text reputedly written by political economist [[Jean Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon]], entitled ''Recherches et considérations sur la population de la France'' (1778), but turns out to be written by his secretary [[Jean-Baptise Moheau]] (1745–1794) and by emphasizing [[Biologist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] who constantly refers to [[Milieu]]s as a plural adjective and sees into the milieu as an expression as nothing more than water air and light confirming the genus within the milieu, in this case the human species, relates to a function of the population and its social and political interaction in which both form an artificial and natural milieu. This milieu(both artificial and natural) appears as a target of intervention for power according to Foucault which is radically different from the previous notions on sovereignty, territory and disciplinary space inter woven into from a social and political relations which function as a species (biological species).&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Lectures at the College de France, 1977–78: Security, Territory, Population'', 2007, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault originated and developed the concept of "docile bodies" in his book ''Discipline and Punish.'' He writes, "A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32367111|title=Discipline and punish : the birth of the prison|last=1926-1984.|first=Foucault, Michel,|date=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679752552|edition= 2nd Vintage books |location=New York|oclc=32367111}}&lt;/ref&gt; " Foucault claims that there is a shift, during the 18th century, in which political power changed. Instead of using corporeal punishment in order to convince people to adhere to the laws of the day, Foucault says power becomes internalized during this period. Instead of watching someone be drawn and quartered in a public space, political power is exerted on individuals in a way that compels them to obey laws and rules on their own - without this show of force. He builds on the ideas of [[Jeremy Bentham]] regarding the [[Panopticon]] in which prison inmates are compelled to behave and control themselves because they might be in the view of the prison guard. The physical shape of the Panopticon creates a situation in which the prison guard need not be present for this to happen, because the mere possibility of the presence of the guard compels the prisoners to behave. Foucault takes this theory and makes it generalize to everyday life. He claims that this kind of surveillance is constant in modern society, and the populous at large enacts it. Therefore, everyone begins to control themselves and behave according to society's rules and norms.

Feminist philosophers took up Foucault's ideas regarding docile bodies and applied them to the different ways men and women are socialized to use their bodies. For one example, philosopher Sandra Bartky says in her essay, ""Foucault, Femininity, and the Modernization of Patriarchal Power" that “The disciplinary techniques through which the ‘docile bodies’ of women are constructed aim at a regulation that is perpetual and exhaustive - a regulation of the body’s size and contours, its appetite, posture, gestures and general comportment in space, and the appearance of each of its visible parts.&lt;ref&gt;Bartky, Sandra Lee. ''Foucault, femininity, and the modernization of patriarchal power''. na, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;" Bartky theorizes that there is a specific and relentless pressure on women when it comes to bodily movements and comportment; this "docility" manifests as women make themselves smaller, groom themselves in ways that make them appear more feminine, and control their bodily movements in order to be as minimally obtrusive as possible. She also cites diet, exercise, and skin care, among other processes, as sites in which the feminine body is made docile.

=== Clegg ===
[[Stewart Clegg]] proposes another three-dimensional model with his "circuits of power"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deji|2011|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA267 267]}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory. This model likens the production and organizing of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The ''episodic circuit'' is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The ''dispositional circuit'' is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The ''facilitative circuit'' is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at "obligatory passage points" which are channels for [[empowerment]] or disempowerment.

=== Galbraith ===
[[John Kenneth Galbraith|JK Galbraith]] summarizes the types of power as being "condign" (based on force), "compensatory" (through the use of various resources) or "conditioned" (the result of [[persuasion]]), and their sources as "personality" (individuals), "property" (their material resources) and "organizational" (whoever sits at the top of an organisational power structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galbraith|first=John Kenneth|authorlink=John Kenneth Galbraith|title=[[The Anatomy of Power]]|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene Sharp ===
[[Gene Sharp]], an American professor of political science, believes that power depends ultimately on its bases. Thus a political regime maintains power because people accept and obey its dictates, laws and policies. Sharp cites the insight of [[Étienne de La Boétie]].

Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state – regardless of its particular structural organization – ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler(s). If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Gene|title=From dictatorship to democracy: A conceptual framework for liberation|publisher=The Albert Einstein Institution|location=East Boston, MA|url=http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf|format=PDF|date=May 2010|edition= 4th U.S.|isbn=978-1-880813-09-6}} (See [[From dictatorship to democracy|book article]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

His work is thought to have been influential in the overthrow of [[Slobodan Milosevic]], in the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], and other [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent]] revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrow|first1=Ruaridh|title=Gene Sharp: Author of the nonviolent revolution rulebook|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12522848|website=BBC News|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Björn Kraus ===
[[Björn Kraus]] deals with the [[epistemology|epistemological]] perspective upon power regarding the question about possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of [[constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] (named [[relational constructivism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Heiko Kleve: ''Vom Erweitern der Möglichkeiten''. In: [[Bernhard Pörksen]] (ed.): ''Schlüsselwerke des Konstruktivismus''. VS-Verlag, Wiesbaden/Germany 2011. pp. 506–519, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focussing on the valuation and distribution of power, he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all.&lt;ref name=Kraus2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Björn|title=Introducing a Model for Analyzing the Possibilities of Power, Help and Control|journal=Social Work &amp; Society|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:464-sws-582|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from [[Max Weber]]'s definition of power,&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber: ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft.

By using this distinction, proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way, helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kraus2013&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|139 f.}} This perspective permits to get over an "either-or-position" (either there is power, or there isn't), which is common especially in epistemological discourses about power theories,&lt;ref&gt;Reimund Böse, Günter Schiepek: ''Systemische Theorie und Therapie: ein Handwörterbuch''.

Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main/Germany 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and to introduce the possibility of an "as well as-position".&lt;ref name=Kraus2013/&gt;{{Rp|120}}

=== Unmarked categories ===
The idea of ''unmarked categories'' originated in [[feminism]]. The theory analyzes the culture of the powerful. The powerful comprise those people in society with easy access to resources, those who can exercise power without considering their actions. For the powerful, their culture seems obvious; for the powerless, on the other hand, it remains out of reach, élite and expensive.

The ''unmarked category'' can form the identifying mark of the powerful. The unmarked category becomes the standard against which to measure everything else. For most Western readers, it is posited that if a protagonist's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is [[Whites|Caucasian]]; if a sexual identity is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is [[heterosexual]]; if the gender of a body is not indicated, will be assumed by the reader that it is [[male]]; if a disability is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is able bodied, just as a set of examples.

One can often overlook unmarked categories. Whiteness forms an unmarked category not commonly visible to the powerful, as they often fall within this category. The unmarked category becomes the norm, with the other categories relegated to deviant status. Social groups can apply this view of power to race, [[gender identity|gender]], and [[disability]] without modification: the able body is the neutral body.

=== Counterpower ===
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
The term 'counter-power' (sometimes written 'counterpower') is used in a range of situations to describe the countervailing force that can be utilised by the oppressed to counterbalance or erode the power of elites. A general definition has been provided by the anthropologist David Graeber as 'a collection of social institutions set in opposition to the state and capital: from self-governing communities to radical labor unions to popular militias'.&lt;ref name="David Graeber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Fragments of an anarchist anthropology|year=2004|publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-9728196-4-9|page=24|edition= 2nd pr.}} The examples given (self-governing communities, radical labour unions, popular militias) reflect the Idea/Economics/Physical taxonomy&lt;/ref&gt; Graeber also notes that counter-power can also be referred to as 'anti-power' and 'when institutions [of counter-power] maintain themselves in the face of the state, this is usually referred to as a 'dual power' situation'.&lt;ref name="David Graeber"/&gt;  [[Tim Gee]], in his 2011 book ''Counterpower: Making Change Happen'',&lt;ref name="gee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Tim|title=Counter power : making change happen|date=2011|publisher=World Changing|location=Oxford|isbn=1780260326}}&lt;/ref&gt; put forward a theory that those disempowered by governments' and elite groups' power can use ''counterpower'' to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newton|first=Mark|title=Counterpower: Making Change Happen (book review)|journal=The Ecologist|date=17 November 2011|url=http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/1135297/counterpower_making_change_happen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Gee's model, ''counterpower'' is split into three categories: ''idea counterpower'', ''economic counterpower'', and ''physical counterpower''.&lt;ref name="gee" /&gt;

Although the term has come to prominence through its use by participants in the global justice/[[anti-globalization movement]] of the 1990s onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|issue=360|date=September 2003|journal=New Internationalist|first=Graeme|last=Chesters|title=Ideas about power: Representation and counterpower|url=http://newint.org/features/2003/09/01/theories-of-power/|quote=Counterpower is the shadow realm of alternatives, a hall of mirrors held up to the dominant logic of capitalism – and it is growing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word has been used for at least 60 years; for instance [[Martin Buber]]'s 1949 book 'Paths in Utopia' includes the line 'Power abdicates only under the stress of counter-power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buber|first1=Martin|title=Paths in Utopia|date=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=9780815604211|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MXGSnCcRaUwC&amp;pg=PA104 104]|edition= Reprint|origyear=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gee2011Introduction&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Tim|chapter=Introduction|title=Counter Power Making Change Happen|date=2011|chapterurl=http://www.newint.org/books/politics/2011/09/20/reviews%2C%20introduction%20%26%20contents.pdf|isbn=978-1-78026-032-7|location=Oxford|publisher=New Internationalist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|13}}

=== Other theories ===
* [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) defined power as a man's "present means, to obtain some future apparent good" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Ch. 10).
* The thought of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] underlies much 20th century analysis of power. Nietzsche disseminated ideas on the "[[will to power]]," which he saw as the domination of other humans as much as the exercise of control over one's environment.
* Some schools of [[psychology]], notably that associated with [[Alfred Adler]], place power dynamics at the core of their theory (where orthodox [[Freudian]]s might place [[human sexuality|sexuality]]).

== Psychological research ==
Recent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has, the less one takes on the perspective of others, implying that the powerful have less [[empathy]]. [[Adam Galinsky]], along with several coauthors, found that when those who are reminded of their powerlessness are instructed to draw Es on their forehead, they are 3 times more likely to draw them such that they are legible to others than those who are reminded of their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Lauren|title=Power Hour: Psychology test at the Time 100 party|journal=New Yorker|date=26 May 2008|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2008/05/26/080526ta_talk_collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academics and Faculty: Adam Galinsky|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bio/galinsky.htm|website=Kellogg School of Management|publisher=Northwestern University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191910/http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bio/galinsky.htm|archivedate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powerful people are also more likely to take action. In one example, powerful people turned off an irritatingly close fan twice as much as less powerful people. Researchers have documented the [[bystander effect]]: they found that powerful people are three times as likely to first offer help to a "stranger in distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henretty|first1=Aubrey|title=How power shapes executive choice|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/whatsnew/mbaupdate08.htm|website=Kellogg School of Management|publisher=Northwestern University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908051020/http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/whatsnew/mbaupdate08.htm|archivedate=8 September 2008|date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of power has evolved from centuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Gaining prestige, honor and reputation is one of the central motives for gaining power in human nature.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Power also relates with empathy gaps because it limits the interpersonal relationship and compares the power differences. Having power or not having power can cause a number of psychological consequences. It leads to strategic versus social responsibilities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Research experiments were done{{by whom|date=March 2017}} as early as 1968 to explore power conflict.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Handgraaf|first= Michel J.

==== Past research ====
Earlier{{when|date=March 2017}}, research proposed that increased power relates to increased rewards and leads one to approach things more frequently.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In contrast, decreased power relates to more constraint, threat and punishment which leads to inhibitions. It was concluded{{by whom|date=March 2017}} that being powerful leads one to successful outcomes, to develop negotiation strategies and to make more self-serving offers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Later{{when|date=March 2017}}, research proposed that differences in power lead to strategic considerations. Being strategic can also mean to defend when one is opposed or to hurt the decision-maker. It was concluded{{by whom|date=March 2017}} that facing one with more power leads to strategic consideration whereas facing one with less power leads to a social responsibility.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

In an ''ultimatum game'', the person in given power offers an ultimatum and the recipient would have to accept that offer or else both the proposer and the recipient will receive no reward.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

In a ''dictator game'', the person in given power offers a proposal and the recipient would have to accept that offer. The recipient has no choice of rejecting the offer.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

The dictator game gives no power to the recipient whereas the ultimatum game gives some power to the recipient. The behavior observed was that the person offering the proposal would act less strategically than would the one offering in the ultimatum game. [[Self-serving]] also occurred and a lot of pro-social behavior was observed.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

When the counterpart recipient is completely powerless, lack of strategy, social responsibility and moral consideration is often observed from the behavior of the proposal given (the one with the power).&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

=== Abusive power and control ===
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
{{See also|Coercive power}}
Abusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) involve the ways in which abusers gain and maintain power and control over victims for [[abusive]] purposes such as [[psychological abuse| psychological]], [[physical abuse| physical]], [[sexual abuse| sexual]], or [[financial abuse| financial]] abuse. Such abuse can have various causes - such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation| devaluation]], [[envy]] or just for the sake of it - as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism| economic abuse]], thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

== Tactics ==
In everyday situations people use a variety of power tactics to push or prompt people into particular action. There are plenty of examples of power tactics that are quite common and employed every day. Some of these tactics include [[bullying]], collaboration, complaining, criticizing, demanding, disengaging, evading, humor, inspiring, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]], negotiating, socializing, and supplicating. These power tactics can be classified along three different dimensions:&lt;ref name="Falbo, T. 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Falbo | first1 = Toni | last2 = Peplau | first2 = Letitia A.  | title = Power strategies in intimate relationships | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 618–628 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.38.4.618 | date = April 1980 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.38.4.618 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Falbo%20%26%20Peplau%201980.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Raven | first1 = Bertram H. | last2 = Schwarzwald | first2 = Joseph | last3 = Koslowsky | first3 = Meni | title = Conceptualizing and measuring a power/interaction model of interpersonal influence | journal = [[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 307–332 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01708.x | date = February 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01708.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Soft power|Soft]] and [[Hard power|hard]]''': Soft tactics take advantage of the relationship between person and the target. They are more indirect and interpersonal (e.g., collaboration, socializing). Conversely, hard tactics are harsh, forceful, direct, and rely on concrete outcomes. However, they are not more powerful than soft tactics. In many circumstances, fear of [[social exclusion]] can be a much stronger motivator than some kind of physical punishment.
# '''Rational and nonrational''': Rational tactics of influence make use of reasoning, logic, and sound judgment, whereas nonrational tactics rely on emotionality and misinformation. Examples of each include bargaining and persuasion, and evasion and put downs, respectively.
# '''Unilateral and bilateral''': Bilateral tactics, such as collaboration and negotiation, involve reciprocity on the part of both the person influencing and their target. Unilateral tactics, on the other hand, are enacted without any participation on the part of the target. These tactics include disengagement and [[fait accompli]].

People tend to vary in their use of power tactics, with different types of people opting for different tactics. For instance, interpersonally oriented people tend to use soft and rational tactics.&lt;ref name="Falbo, T. 1980"/&gt; [[Machiavellians]], however, tend to use nonrational tactics. Moreover, extroverts use a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bratko | first1 = Denis | last2 = Butkovic | first2 = Ana | title = Stability of genetic and environmental effects from adolescence to young adulthood: Results of Croatian longitudinal twin study of personality | journal = [[Twin Research and Human Genetics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–157 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1375/twin.10.1.151 | date = February 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1375/twin.10.1.151 | pmid = 17539374 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; People will also choose different tactics based on the group situation, and based on whom they are trying to influence. People also tend to shift from soft to hard tactics when they face resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carson | first1 = Paula P. | last2 = Carson | first2 = Kerry D. | last3 = Roe | first3 = C.

=== Balance of power ===
Because power operates both relationally and reciprocally, [[sociologists]] speak of the balance of power between parties to a [[personal relationship|relationship]]: all parties to all relationships have ''some'' power: the sociological examination of power concerns itself with discovering and describing the relative strengths: equal or unequal, stable or subject to periodic change. Sociologists usually analyse relationships in which the parties have relatively equal or nearly equal power in terms of ''constraint'' rather than of power. Thus 'power' has a connotation of unilateralism. If this were not so, then all relationships could be described in terms of 'power', and its meaning would be lost. Given that power is not innate and can be granted to others, to acquire power you must possess or control a form of power currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCornack|first=Steven|title=Reflect &amp; Relate: An introduction to interpersonal communication|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston/NY|isbn=0-312-48934-X|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Power changes those in the position of power and those who are targets of that power.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2010). ''Group Dynamics'' (5th Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approach/inhibition theory ===
Developed by D. Keltner and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Keltner, D., Gruenfeld, D.H., &amp; Anderson, C. (2003). Power, approach, and inhibition. ''Psychological Review, 110,'' 265-284.&lt;/ref&gt; approach/inhibition theory assumes that having power and using power alters psychological states of individuals. The theory is based on the notion that most organisms react to environmental events in two common ways. The reaction of ''approach'' is associated with action, self-promotion, seeking rewards, increased energy and movement. ''Inhibition'', on the contrary, is associated with self-protection, avoiding threats or danger, vigilance, loss of motivation and an overall reduction in activity.

Overall, approach/inhibition theory holds that power promotes approach tendencies, while reduction in power promotes inhibition tendencies.

== Reactions ==

=== Tactics ===
A number of studies demonstrate that harsh power tactics (e.g. punishment (both personal and impersonal), rule-based sanctions, and non-personal rewards) are less effective than soft tactics (expert power, referent power, and personal rewards).&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Berdahl, J. L. (2007). Social power. In A. Kruglanski &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), Social psychology: A handbook of basic principles (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. H. (2008). Motivated compliance with bases of social power. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38,'' 1921–1944.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probably because harsh tactics generate hostility, depression, fear, and anger, while soft tactics are often reciprocated with cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Krause D. E. (2006) Power and influence in the context of organizational innovation. In Schriesheim C. A., Neider L. L. (Eds.), Power and influence in organizations: new empirical and theoretical perspectives (A volume in research in management). Hartford, CT: Information Age. Pp. 21–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Coercive and reward power can also lead group members to lose interest in their work, while instilling a feeling of autonomy in one’s subordinates can sustain their interest in work and maintain high productivity even in the absence of monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, L. G., &amp; Vallerand, R. J. (1996). Supervisors’ beliefs and subordinates’ intrinsic motivation: A behavioral confirmation analysis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71,'' 331–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coercive influence creates conflict that can disrupt entire group functioning. When disobedient group members are severely reprimanded, the rest of the group may become more disruptive and uninterested in their work, leading to negative and inappropriate activities spreading from one troubled member to the rest of the group. This effect is called ''Disruptive contagion or ripple effect'' and it is strongly manifested when reprimanded member has a high status within a group, and authority’s requests are vague and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Kounin, J., &amp; Gump, P. (1958). The ripple effect in discipline. ''Elementary School Journal, 59,'' 158–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resistance to coercive influence ===
Coercive influence can be tolerated when the group is successful,&lt;ref&gt;Michener, H. A., &amp; Lawler, E. J. (1975). Endorsement of formal leaders: An integrative model. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31,'' 216-223.&lt;/ref&gt; the leader is trusted, and the use of coercive tactics is justified by group norms.&lt;ref&gt;Michener, H. A., &amp; Burt, M.R. (1975) Components of authority as determinants of compliance. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31'', 606-614.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, coercive methods are more effective when applied frequently and consistently to punish prohibited actions.&lt;ref&gt;Molm, L. D. (1994) Is Punishment Effective? Coercive Strategies in Social Exchange. ''Social Psychology Quarterly, 57,'' 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in some cases, group members chose to resist the authority’s influence. When low-power group members have a feeling of shared identity, they are more likely to form a ''Revolutionary Coalition'', a subgroup formed within a larger group that seeks to disrupt and oppose the group’s authority structure.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. J. (1975a). An experimental study of factors affecting the mobilization of revolutionary coalitions. ''Sociometry, 38,'' 163-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Group members are more likely to form a revolutionary coalition and resist an authority when authority lacks referent power, uses coercive methods, and asks group members to carry out unpleasant assignments. It is because these conditions create ''reactance'', a complex emotional and cognitive reaction that occurs when individuals feel that their freedom to make choices has been threatened or eliminated.  When reactance occurs, individuals strive to reassert their sense of freedom by affirming their authority.

=== Kelman's compliance-identification-internalization theory of conversion ===
Herbert Kelman&lt;ref&gt;[null Kelman, H. (1958). Compliance, identification, and internalization: Three processes of attitude change. ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 1, 51-60].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H.C. Processes of opinion change. Public Opinion Quarterly, 25, 57–78.&lt;/ref&gt; identified three basic, step-like reactions that people display in response to coercive influence: [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], and [[internalization]]. This theory explains how groups convert hesitant recruits into zealous followers over time.

At the stage of ''compliance,'' group members comply with authority’s demands, but personally do not agree with them. If authority does not monitor the members, they will probably not obey.

''Identification'' occurs when the target of the influence admires and therefore imitates the authority, mimics authority’s actions, values, characteristics, and takes on behaviours of the person with power. If prolonged and continuous, identification can lead to the final stage – internalization.

When ''internalization'' occurs, individual adopts the induced behaviour because it is congruent with his/her value system. At this stage, group members no longer carry out authority orders but perform actions that are congruent with their personal beliefs and opinions. Extreme obedience often requires internalization.

==Power literacy==
Power literacy refers to how one perceives power, how it is formed and accumulates, and the structures that support it and who is in control of it. Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Rightmyer|first2=Elizabeth|title=Literacy for All Students: An Instructional Framework for Closing the Gap|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136879692|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JDbfh3M55lgC|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kincheloe|first1=Joe|last2=Steinberg|first2=Shirley|title=Students as Researchers: Creating Classrooms that Matter|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135714710|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mj2RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2002-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be helpful for heightening power literacy. In a 2014 [[TED talk]] [[Eric Liu]] notes that "we don't like to talk about power" as "we find it scary" and "somehow evil" with it having a "negative moral valence" and states that the pervasiveness of power illiteracy causes a concentration of knowledge, understanding and clout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Eric|title=Transcript of "Why ordinary people need to understand power"|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_liu_why_ordinary_people_need_to_understand_power/transcript?language=en|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe L. Kincheloe]] describes a "cyber-literacy of power" that is concerned with the forces that shape [[knowledge production]] and the construction and transmission of meaning, being more about engaging knowledge than "mastering" information, and a "cyber-power literacy" that is focused on transformative knowledge production and new modes of [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kincheloe|first1=Joe L.|title=Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy: An Introduction|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402082245|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GZm4H8HjAz4C|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Powierza v Daley''' [1985] 1 NZLR 558 is an important [[New Zealand]] case involving where an inquiry about an offer, is just that, or whether instead it is a counteroffer. The legal distinction between the two is important, as an "inquiry" still leaves the original offer live (and still subject to acceptance), whereas a "[[counteroffer]]" cancels the previous offer.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The two parties were negotiating a sale of a property. Daley's, the sellers, sent to Powierza, via their real estate agent Lee, a sale agreement for $405,000, with a condition of a $40,000 deposit. Poweirza agreed to the sale price, but changed the deposit on the sale agreement to $20,000.

The vendor had just changed the deposit from $20,000 to $40,000, and the purchaser changed the deposit back to $20,000, signing the sales agreement, and got Lee to return it to the vendor to consider, which the vendor refused to accept. Nor was his next inquiry of splitting the deposit into 2 instalments accepted either.

Powierza then amended the sales agreement deposit back to the original $40,000, signed it, and returned it to Daley. But by then, the property had been sold elsewhere as Daley had received a higher offer of $435,000 from a 3rd party.

Powierza considered the original sales offer was still open for his acceptance, and sued the Daley's. The Daley's response was that his alterations to the contract were a counteroffer, making the original offer to be at an end.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal upheld that the alteration in the sales agreement was merely an inquiry, and not a counter offer, making the original contract still enforceable against the vendor. Cooke J stated "''The line between rejecting an offer and merely inquiring as to a possible variation can be a fine one, but the basic test is the effect on a reasonable person in the shoes of the offerer''".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7756">The '''RAC–HBC Agreement''' was a series of protocols signed by the [[Russian-American Company]] (RAC) and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) in 1839. Over previous decades both [[monopolies]] secured regions for control of the [[Maritime fur trade]], the RAC being based in [[Russian America]] and the HBC in the [[Columbia Department]] of the [[Oregon Country]]. As the outposts and trading stations of each company grew closer in proximity, a clash of interests occurred in 1834 at [[Fort Stikine#Redoubt Saint Dionysius|Redoubt Saint Dionysius]] on the site of modern [[Wrangell, Alaska]]. Officials from the two companies felt it was necessary to settle their long standing issues. [[Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel|Ferdinand Wrangel]], Governor of [[Russian America]], volunteered to negotiate on behalf of the RAC and the HBC sent [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]], Governor of [[Rupert's Land]].&lt;ref name=Tikhmenev&gt;Tikhmenev, P. A. ''A History of the Russia-American Company.'' ed. Richard A. Pierce and Alton S. Donnelly. Seattle: University of Washington Press. 1978, pp. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Simpson had stated to the HBC committee that if a settlement with the Russians was concluded, "we ought to be able to put down all competition on the Coast..."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James R. ''Farming the Frontier, the Agricultural Opening of the Oregon Country 1786–1846.'' Vancouver, B.C.: University of British Columbia Press. 1985, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the Russian markets, the Governor felt American merchants would lose an important revenue source. The [[Russian Empire|Imperial Government of Russia]] in late 1838 ordered the RAC to end its disputes with the British, before it could strain relations with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson (1985), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson and Wrangel negotiated a commercial treaty in early 1839 while in [[Hamburg]].

The Russians granted the HBC exclusive fur trapping rights in "a strip of land ten miles in width, to the north and south of the [[Stikine River|Stakhina River]], that is, the portion of the seacoast from 54°40′ latitude to a line drawn between [[Cape Spencer (Alaska)|Cape Spencer]] on [[Cross Sound]] and [[Mount Fairweather|Mt. Fairweather]]."&lt;ref name=Tikhmenev/&gt; This lease was to begin on 1 June 1840 and last for one decade. Redoubt Saint Dionysius, with its annual expenses ₽12,000, was handed over to the British.&lt;ref name=Tikhmenev/&gt; In return for the additional areas to trap furs in the British had to send 2,000 [[land otter]] fur pelts. The HBC also had to supply [[Sitka, Alaska|New Archangel]] with 14,000 [[pood]]s of wheat, worth [[Russian ruble|₽]]52,5000, along with a multitude of provisions needed.&lt;ref&gt;Tikhmenev (1978), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden demand for agricultural produce necessitated the creation of the HBC subsidiary, the [[Puget Sound Agricultural Company]] (PSAC). Using British supplies from [[London]] proved to be far less expensive than shipping from [[Kronstadt]] for the RAC. Naval shipments from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] destined for Russian America cost the RAC only ₽80 per ton of supplies, compared to ₽250 from Kronstadt and ₽630 overland through [[Siberia]] to [[Okhotsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Tikhmenev (1978), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from freight transportation often gave an annual profit of [[Pound sterling|£]]4,000 for the HBC.&lt;ref name=Galbraith1&gt;Galbraith, John S. ''The Hudson's Bay Company as an Imperial Factor, 1821 – 1869.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1957, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was continuously renewed, although with several modifications made over the years which followed. A different version was agreed by both companies and came into force on 3 April 1849.&lt;ref name=Galbraith1/&gt; This commercial agreement saw the termination of the PSAC, providing agricultural and pastoral products to New Archangel.&lt;ref name=Gibson1&gt;Gibson (1985), pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Encroachment by American settlers on company property after the [[Oregon Treaty]], combined with the [[California Gold Rush]],&lt;ref name=Tikhmenev1/&gt; left [[Fort Cowlitz]] and [[Fort Nisqually]] understaffed and greatly reduced operational abilities.&lt;ref name=Gibson1/&gt; Despite [[Fort Langley]] and [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] producing much of the wheat quota for Russian America after 1846, the British could not meet the Russians' need for food. The RAC board of directors found the HBC stance for an end to supplying the Russian posts to be "based on quite valid reasons."&lt;ref name=Gibson1/&gt; Additionally, the Russian authorities claimed exclusive rights to the timber, fisheries, and ice within the portion of the [[Alaska Panhandle]] occupied by the HBC, to allow further agreements with other companies for exploitation of resources.&lt;ref name=Galbraith2&gt;Galbraith (1957), pp. 169–172.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Fraser Gold Rush]], numerous small merchants began operating within the HBC concession, undercutting the British fur trading efforts. During the 1860s the [[Labouchere (paddle steamer)|Labouchere]] operated within the leased area.&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;Jack, C. Ian. ''The Stikine Territory Lease and Its Relevance to the Alaska Purchase.'' Pacific Historical Review 36, No. 3 (1967), pp. 289–306.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862 the HBC governing board complained to their Russian counterparts that they did not "afford us any protection and the whole Territory is just as free to Petty Traders who pay no rent..."&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; Despite this economic competition and declining profits, the HBC signed the renewed protocols.&lt;ref name=Galbraith2/&gt;

The final expiration of the agreement occurred on 1 June 1865.&lt;ref name=Tikhmenev1&gt;Tikhmenev (1978), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; An official of the RAC, A. Rutkovski, was sent to London, reaching the British capital in January 1865, offering a proposition to the HBC. In return for an annual payment of £3,000, retaining company posts and rights to an ice harvesting monopoly, the RAC would lease all lands of Russian America south of [[Mount Saint Elias]].&lt;ref name=Galbraith2/&gt; All Russian fur traders would additionally operate only in the name of the HBC. The historian John Galbraith appraised Rutkovski's considered offer as "Such a proposal would have been unhesitatingly accepted had it been made twenty years earlier. But the same uncertainties of the value of the fur trade which induced the Russians to make such an offer in 1865 prevented the Hudson's Bay Company from accepting."&lt;ref name=Galbraith2/&gt; Additionally, by this point the British had already formulated plans to create stations in the [[Yukon]], where the interior trade could continue to be accessed.&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; Shortly after the ratification of the [[Alaska Purchase]] by the [[United States of America]], the HBC inquired if the lease was still in effect. [[Mikhail Tebenkov]] responded that the RAC was itself unaware of the treaty's terms, but stated that the company "can only suppose the cession itself will cause the refusal of our Government to sanction of our agreement with your honourable body for a continuation of the lease of the Stackine Territory."&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; Despite being requesting to end the agreement when the official transfer to the Americans occurred, the HBC felt it could unilaterally continue to operate in the Stikine lisière; an interpretation the Americans didn't acknowledge.&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; The RAC–HBC Agreement later had a part in the [[Alaska boundary dispute]].

'''Radio Courtoisie''' is a French radio station and cultural associative union created in 1987 by [[Jean Ferré]].

''Radio Courtoisie'' defines itself as the "free radio of the real country [referring to the ''pays réel'' concept of [[Charles Maurras]]] and the [[francophone]] world", declaring itself to be "open to all people of the political right, from [[François Bayrou]] to [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.les4verites.com/Radio-Courtoisie-une-interview-de-Henry-de-Lesquen-1314.html "Interview with Henry de Lesquen"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808124906/http://www.les4verites.com/Radio-Courtoisie-une-interview-de-Henry-de-Lesquen-1314.html |date=8 August 2008 }} on the internet site of the ''[[Les 4 Vérités (journal)|Les 4 Vérités]]'' weekly paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Radio Solidarité ===
In September 1981, Bernadette d'Angevilliers and [[Philippe Malaud]], former minister under [[Charles De Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou]], created ''[[Radio Solidarité]]'', with the support of Yannick Urrien. This free radio station had associations with ''[[Rassemblement pour la République|RPR]]'' and with the ''[[Union pour la démocratie française|UDF]]'' and was strongly opposed to the political left of [[François Mitterrand]].

At the time, Ferré was a radio and television columnist for ''[[Le Figaro|Figaro Magazine]]'', of which he had been a founder with [[Louis Pauwels]]. His columns, frequently kind to ''Radio Solidarité'', brought him to the notice of d'Angevilliers who proposed a radio collaboration with him.

In May and June 1982, Ferré created the broadcast formula of the ''Libre Journal'': an hour and a half programme each evening based around a guest belonging to the political right. This formula would be taken up by ''Radio Courtoisie'' and extended to three hours.

Ferré proposed that the radio should be open to "all people of the right". Following this, [[Serge de Beketch]], as many others, was invited to direct a regular Wednesday evening broadcast. However, following the [[European Parliament election, 1984 (France)|1984 European elections]], his invitiation brought on the radio the accusation of having helped the political breakthrough of the [[National Front (France)|French National Front]]. De Beketch was ordered to leave; Ferré defended de Beketch and was also dismissed.

Having been taken off the air, Ferré created the "''Radio Solidarité'' listeners' defense committee" (CDARS). It was under this name, declared to the Paris police prefecture on 12 December 1985, that he founded ''Radio Courtoisie'' (''courtoisie'' means [[courtesy]]). ''Radio Courtoisie'' made its first broadcast on 7 November 1987.

=== Radio Courtoisie ===
From November 1987 until the end of his life, Ferré was the head of the radio station, with title "President of the editorial committee", and a full delegation of successive presidents, François Pitti-Ferrandi, Pierre Dehaye and [[Christian Langlois]]. Every Monday evening Ferré himself hosted a ''Libre Journal'' without interruption until 31 July 2006, the date of his last broadcast.

====Disputes among the staff ====
After Ferré's death on 10 October 2006, a lively dispute pitted [[Henry de Lesquen]], Ferré's successor as head of the station, against a group of four broadcasting patrons including Claude Reichman, who demanded that de Lesquen resign. Claude Reichman was banned from ''Radio Courtoisie'' after a broadcast on 14 November 2006, in which he attacked de Lesquen in terms that de Lesquen judged to be defamatory. He was replaced by Marie Le Méné and Benoîte Taffin. [[Jean-Gilles Malliarakis]] in turn announced he would leave the station during his broadcast of 23 February 2007, having been given notice the same morning. Malliarakis was replaced by David Mascré and Catherine Rouvier.

== The editorial policy instituted by Ferré==
Two objectives were set out in ''Radio Courtoisie'''s file for candidacy submitted in 1986: Respecting the right of freedom of expression for all tribes within the French political right, and protecting and illustrating the French language. In practice, the editorial policy was organized relative to three axes, those of (right-wing) politics, religion (mainly [[traditionalist Catholic]]ism) and culture. While a single broadcast often touched on both political and religious themes, cultural broadcasts rarely strayed into the other areas. A novelty introduced in 2007 was the introduction of a daily information programme, ''le Bulletin de réinformation'', which lasted 15 minutes.

''Radio Courtoisie'' has preserved its editorial freedom by eschewing any form of advertising. It is an associative union-based radio station, and listeners are regularly asked to contribute through an annual membership fee and through donations.

=== Political line ===
In his political blueprint, Ferré had desired that ''Radio Courtoisie'' would be anchored in the political right and at the same time "open to all tribes of the right", from the centre-right to the French National Front, thus linking the extreme-right with the mainstream right. Ferré often explained on air the attacks which were leveled at his radio station: for certain of its detractors, ''Radio Courtoisie'' was the radio station of Le Pen, for others, the station of [[Jacques Chirac]]. He always put to everyone his firm wish (according to him as a Poitiers native) &lt;!--selon lui Poitevine ?--&gt; that his radio station should be open to "all people of the right", that is, including the French National Front.

Ferré was himself a [[royalist]] and personally very [[anti-Gaullist]]. However, in a broadcast of 3 October 1991, he recalled that he had sacrificed his anti-Gaullism on the altar of reconciliation, that he had resolved for his own part never to argue in public against [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]], and that, in any case, he respected some of the great [[Gaullists]] such as Alain Griotteray. As he explained in his own ''Libre journal'' of 16 April 2001, his project was to rally all patriots. On several occasions, Ferré asserted on air at ''Radio Courtoisie'' that he had wished, in accordance with his editorial line, to give full and complete freedom to his broadcasting patrons in their words and in their choice of invited guests. [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]], [[Political liberalism|liberals]], Gaullists, nationalists and royalists were regularly heard on ''Radio Courtoisie''.

For the most specifically political programmes, hosts such as Yannick Urrien, [[Paul-Marie Coûteaux]], Michel de Rostolan, Benoîte Taffin, [[Henry de Lesquen]], Martial Bild, Jacques Garello, Henri Fouquereau, Bernard Antony, Catherine Rouvier, Gérard Marin, Claude Giraud and Emmanuel Ratier were involved. Among former broadcasting patrons were [[Serge de Beketch]] (until his death in 2007) , [[Jean-Gilles Malliarakis]], Alain Paucard, Reichman, Griotteray, ''Commandant'' [[Pierre Guillaume]] and the historian [[Pierre Chaunu]].

Many of the older broadcasters identified as ''[[Maurrassisme|maurrassiens]]''. The incorporation of Maurras' concept of "''pays réel'' (real country) into the ''Radio Courtoisie'''s slogan witnessed to this historical influence.

=== Religious line ===
''Radio Courtoisie'' was not sectarian, except on Sundays, when it became so.&lt;ref&gt;''Lumière de l'Espérance, la radio du dimanche de Radio Courtoisie''&lt;/ref&gt; It generally devoted much space to the Catholic religion, and specifically to traditional Catholics practicing the rite of Saint Pius V: The [[Society of St. Pius X]], the [[Good Shepherd Institute]], and the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]]. Father Guillaume de Tanoüarn, father [[Philippe Laguérie]], and father Grégoire Celier went on air. Jean Ferré also invited as a permanent adviser Father André Wartelle until his death in 2001. Certain guests were less frequent, but more [[political correctness|politically correct]] such as Father Alain de La Morandais.

The host who presented the most openly religious broadcasts included Philippe Maxence and Daniel Hamiche.

=== Cultural line ===
''Radio Courtoisie'' gave a lot of time to history, literature and issues relevant to French-speakers, and to a lesser extent, painting, sculpture, cinema, theatre and poetry. The most culture-oriented programmes were presented by hosts such as Jean-Paul Bled, Philippe de Saint Robert, Dominique Paoli, Philippe Lejeune, Jean Darnel, Aude de Kerros, Philippe d'Hugues, [[Bernard Lugan]], Albert Salon, and Michel Mourlet. Among former hosts were Pierre Debray-Ritzen and the adventurers Alexandre Poussin and Sylvain Tesson at the end of the 1990s.

''Radio Courtoisie'''s programmes last between one and three hours. The ethos of the radio favoured a guest being able to express himself at length, so that he could "get to the bottom of his ideas" and "to the bottom of things".

== Supporting cast ==
*''Radio Courtoisie'' benefits or has benefited from the more or less frequent collaboration of various doyens of the intellectual world such as [[Jean Tulard]] and [[Gabriel de Broglie]] of the ''[[Institut de France]]'', Christian Cabrol of the faculty of medicine, Chantal Delsol, Aymeric Chauprade and Jacques Heers of the [[Sorbonne]], Bertrand Lemennicier of [[Panthéon-Assas University]], [[Yves Roucaute]] of Paris X Nanterre, [[Maurice Druon]] and [[Jacqueline de Romilly]] of the ''[[Académie française]]'', as well as other academics and university staff.
*Other personalities participate in programmes such as [[Pierre-Marie Gallois|General Pierre-Marie Gallois]], the ''[[Le Figaro|Figaro]]'' columnist Ivan Rioufol, [[Alain Peyrefitte]] (an adviser to de Gaulle), and the President of the France-Israel Friendship Association Gilles-William Goldnadel.
*Some ministers of the Fillon government have recently been guests on ''Radio Courtoisie'': [[Xavier Darcos]], education minister, guest of Catherine Rouvier; and [[Valérie Pécresse]], minister of higher education and research, guest of Yannick Urrien.
*More controversial and unexpected personalities have also been guests, generally on a one-off basis: [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Thierry Ardisson]], [[Jacques Vergès]], [[Alain Soral]], [[Dieudonné M'bala M'bala]], the [[Ufology|ufologists]] [[Jean-Pierre Petit]] and Joël Mesnard, and the historical negationist [[Pierre Guillaume]] (not to be confused with the [[Pierre Guillaume (French officer)|soldier of the same name]], who hosted a programme for many years until his death in 2002).

==Other products==
* The publication ''Le Courrier de Radio Courtoisie''. Two issues have appeared: ''Dix mille heures de créations radiophoniques'' in 1992, and ''Dix ans de ferveur'' in 1998.
* The ''Fête de la Courtoisie'': a large annual sales event in May/June bringing together writers who have been on air at ''Radio Courtoisie''. According to the radion, there were to be more thawn 400 attendees in 2008.
* The [[Jean Ferré Prize]], known as the Daudet Prize until 2007: created in honour of [[Alphonse Daudet]] and [[Léon Daudet]], it is awarded each year to the person who, according to ''Radio Courtoisie'' listeners, has best served the French language. Since the death of Ferré, who was the last recipient of the Daudet prize and who was awarded it [[posthumous recognition|posthumous]]ly, the prize is now known as the Jean Ferré prize following protests from the descendants of Léon Daudet who were scandalised by Henry de Lesquen's practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libreforum.com/a-propos-de-l-usurpation-f1/il-n-y-aura-plus-de-prix-daudet-tant-qu-il-y-aura-lesquen-t428.htm#5866 Letter from Jean-Louis Daudet to Henry de Lesquen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Courtoisie has been clearly accessible since January 2008 on the satellite bouquet CanalSat (satellite Astra H1 19°.2) on channel 179. It can also be received by internet via http://tv-radio.com using [https://web.archive.org/web/20081209095104/http://www.tv-radio.com/cgi-bin/tagger.pl?tag=site&amp;metafile=courtoisie%2Fcourtoisie-20k.asx this Windows Media link].

== Controversy ==
On 16 May 1993, ''Radio Courtoisie'' and host Serge de Beketch were convicted of [[defamation|defaming]] Olivier Biffaud, journalist for the daily newspaper ''Le Monde'', and sentenced to pay a single Franc symbolic of damages and interests, as well as 8,000 Francs court costs. De Beketch had declared, mentioning Biffaud's initials, that it would be a good name for a [[sanitary towel]]. The court judged that this phrase "offended against the delicacy and dignity of the person in question".

A Radio Courtoisie interview of Alain Menargues in October 2004 caused controversy due to his claim that the Jews created the first ghettoes because they disliked being around "impure non-Jews.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1004/gross_2004_10_20_04.php3 Jewish World Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1997 to 2006, the French ''[[Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel]]'' broadcasting authority examined ''Radio Courtoisie'', for statements considered potentially racist, injurious or revisionist which were broadcast on air and originated from a host or speaker, issuing three letters,&lt;ref name="CSA2003"&gt;[http://www.csa.fr/actualite/decisions/decisions_detail.php?id=12019 Courrier en 2003 pour infraction aux articles 24, 32 et 33 de la loi du 29 juillet 1881 relative à la liberté de la presse qui répriment l’injure, la diffamation et la provocation à la discrimination et à la haine pour des raisons raciales, éthiques ou religieuses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA200402"&gt;[http://www.csa.fr/actualite/decisions/decisions_detail.php?id=20252 Courrier en 2004 pour lui rappeler la nécessité d’assurer la maîtrise de son antenne suite aux propos d’Alain Ménargue le 12 octobre 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA200501"&gt;[http://www.csa.fr/actualite/decisions/decisions_detail.php?id=24874 Courrier en 2005 pour non respect de la personne humaine, à la suite de propos diffusés les 9 et 10 mars 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and two warnings.&lt;ref name="CSA1997"&gt;[http://www.csa.fr/actualite/decisions/decisions_detail.php?id=4088 Mise en demeure pour les propos d’un invité jugés révisionnistes, décision du CSA le 20 mars 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA200401"&gt;[http://www.csa.fr/actualite/decisions/decisions_detail.php?id=16462 Mise en demeure en 2004, pour des propos considérés par le CSA comme « portant atteinte au respect de la dignité de la personne »]&lt;/ref&gt; As a sanction, the CSA ordered its communiqué to be inserted at the beginning of the programme ''Le Libre Journal' on 13 November 2006 at 6&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="CSA_091106"&gt;[http://www.admi.net/jo/20061111/CSAX0601647S.html Décision no. 2006-647 du 7 novembre 2006 ordonnant, à titre de sanction, l’insertion d’un communiqué dans les programmes du service Radio-Courtoisie]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics of ''Radio Courtoisie'' assert that positions espoused by certain hosts on air are close to those of the extreme right, pointing to broadcasts with contributors from traditionalist Catholicism, the ''[[Mouvement pour la France]]'', the ''[[Mouvement national républicain]]'' and the ''Front National''. They also base this on the opposition described in certain programmes between the so-called ''droite molle'' (soft right, principally including the ''[[Union pour un mouvement populaire]]''), and the rest of the right wing, meaning to the right of the ''UMP''. Those ''Radio Courtoisie'' hosts who are close to the ''Front national'' or who accept them, reject the "extreme right" moniker, with the exception of de Beketch. Le Pen himself recalled on air at ''Radio Courtoisie'' the same refusal to be ascribed to this category, preferring "national right".

Goulart was prolific, and wrote many novelizations and other routine work under various pseudonyms: '''[[Kenneth Robeson]]''', '''Con Steffanson''', '''Chad Calhoun''', '''R.T. Edwards''', '''Ian R. Jamieson''', '''Josephine Kains''', '''Jillian Kearny''', '''Howard Lee''', '''Zeke Masters''', '''Frank S. Shawn''', and '''Joseph Silva'''.&lt;ref&gt;A preface to the reprint of Goulart's sf story ''My Pal Clunky'' in "Year's Best SF 4", by [[HarperPrism]], 1999, {{ISBN|0-06-105902-1}}, p.377&lt;/ref&gt;

Goulart's first professional publication was a 1952 reprint of the [[Science fiction|SF]] story "Letters to the Editor" in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/goulart_ron&lt;/ref&gt; this parody of a [[pulp magazine]] letters column was originally published in the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s ''[[California Pelican (magazine)|Pelican]]''. His early career in advertising and marketing influenced much of his work. In the early 1960s, Goulart wrote the text for ''Chex Press'', a newspaper parody published on [[Ralston Purina]] cereal boxes (Wheat Chex, Rice Chex, Corn Chex). He contributed to ''P.S.'' and other magazines, along with his book review column for ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine]]''. ''Cheap Thrills: An Informal History of the Pulp Magazines'' (1972) is his best known non-fiction book.

==Fiction==
[[Image:RoboDin.jpg|thumb|[[F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre]] illustrated Ron Goulart's story "The Robot Who Came to Dinner" in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' (July–August 2002).]]
Goulart's fiction is characterized by several themes, including humor, technology gone wrong (usually through incompetence rather than malice) and heroes with superhuman powers. His humorous crime and science fiction includes tales about [[robot]]s and historical Hollywood figures, such as [[Groucho Marx]]. In the 1970s, he wrote several novels based on [[Lee Falk]]'s ''[[The Phantom]]'' for Avon Books, using the pseudonym "Frank Shawn" (a play on his wife and son's names). He has also written [[comic book]] stories and short stories about The Phantom for [[Moonstone Books]] from 2003 to present. Goulart has also written novelizations for televisions programs such as Laverne &amp; Shirley, and wrote several "romance" novels under feminine pseudonyms (they contain familiar Goulart themes and are hilarious.)

It is widely known that Goulart [[ghost writer|ghost wrote]] the  ''[[TekWar]]'' series of books credited to the actor [[William Shatner]]&lt;ref name="TekWar"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashley | first = Mike | title = The Mammoth Book of Comic Fantasy | year = 1998 | publisher = [[Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers]] | location = New York, NY |page = 265}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Shatner is said to have written the outlines for the books).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |year= 2008|publisher= Thomas Dunne
|isbn= 978-0-312-37265-1
|page= 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also ghosted novels featuring [[the Phantom]], [[Flash Gordon]] and the pulp character [[Avenger (character)|the Avenger]].

A collection of his mystery short stories, ''Adam and Eve on a Raft'', was published in 2001 by [[Crippen &amp; Landru]].

Goulart is married to author Frances Sheridan Goulart and has two sons, Sean-Lucien and Steffan Eamon.

==Comics==
In the early 1970s, Goulart wrote several scripts for [[Marvel Comics]], mostly adaptations of classic science fiction stories. Later in the decade, he collaborated with artist [[Gil Kane]] on the ''[[Star Hawks]]'' newspaper strip. In the early 1990s, he scripted Marvel's TekWar comics series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comics.org/writer/name/Ron%20Goulart/sort/alpha/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Goulart has been nominated twice for the Edgar Award, once for his 1970 science fiction novel ''After Things Fell Apart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theedgars.com/edgarsDB/index.php |title=Edgar Awards database |publisher=Theedgars.com |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7697">The '''Roxburghe Club''' is an exclusive [[Bibliophilia|bibliophilic]] and [[Text publication society|publishing society]] based in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Origins==
The spur to the Club's foundation was the sale of the enormous [[library]] of the [[John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe|Duke of Roxburghe]] (who had died in 1804), which took place over 46 days in May–July 1812. The auction was eagerly followed by [[Bibliophilia|bibliophiles]], the high point being the sale on 17 June 1812 of a first edition of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'', printed by [[Christophorus Valdarfer]] of Venice in 1471, and sold to the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|Marquis of Blandford]] for £2,260, the highest price ever given for a book at that time. (The Marquis already possessed a copy, but one that lacked 5 pages.) That evening, a group of eighteen collectors met at the St Albans Tavern, St Albans Street (later renamed Waterloo Place) for a dinner presided over by the [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|2nd Earl Spencer]], and this is regarded as the origin of the Roxburghe Club.

A toast drunk on that occasion has been repeated at every annual anniversary dinner since to the "immortal memory of John Duke of Roxburghe, of Christopher Valdarfer, printer of the ''Boccaccio'' of 1471, of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], [[Johann Fust|Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer|Schoeffer]], the inventors of the art of printing, of [[William Caxton]], Father of the British press [and others; and] the prosperity of the Roxburghe Club and the Cause of [[Bibliomania]] all over the world". It was decided to make the dinner an annual event: further members were admitted the following year.  The club was formed by [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]], author of the book 1809 [[Bibliomania (book)|Bibliomania]]; or Book-Madness who served as its first secretary and the club was formalised under Earl Spencer's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, P. (2000). Bibliomania: Book Collecting, Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain. Representations, (71), 24. doi:10.2307/2902924&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The Club has had a total of 344 members since its foundation. The circle has always been an exclusive one, with just one "[[Blackballing|black ball]]" (negative vote) being enough to exclude an applicant. Since 1839 the number of members at any one time has been limited to forty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roxburgheclub.org.uk/ Roxburghe Club website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph exists of the membership in 1892, including the Prime Minister [[Arthur Balfour]] and anthropologist [[Andrew Lang]], as well as [[United States|American]] poet [[James Russell Lowell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roxburgheclub.org.uk/membership/index.php?MemberID=127 Roxburghe Club website].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Henry Huth]], and [[Simon Watson Taylor (surrealist)|Simon Watson Taylor]]. [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury|James Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne]], was then President.

The first female member was [[Mary Eccles, Viscountess Eccles|Mary, Viscountess Eccles]], elected in 1985. In 2011, the Australian comedian [[Barry Humphries]] was elected a member.&lt;ref name=membership&gt;[http://www.roxburgheclub.org.uk/membership/ Club website, ''Membership since 1812''], accessed July 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The President since 1998 has been [[Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont]].

==Publications==
The Club rapidly became more than a merely social institution. Each member was (and remains) expected to sponsor the publication of a rare or curious volume. Other volumes are published by the Club collectively. Initially the volumes were editions of early [[blackletter]] printed texts (the first, in 1814, was the [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]]'s translation of parts of [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], originally printed in 1557); but from as early as 1819 they began to include texts taken from [[manuscript]] originals. The standards of scholarship are high, and the quality of printing, [[facsimile]] reproduction, and binding is lavish. Copies of each volume (in a fine binding) are presented to all members, and a limited number of extra copies (generally in a less lavish binding) may be made available for sale to non-members. From 1839, the total number of copies for each publication, including members' copies, was limited to 100. Recently, the limit was raised to 342 copies: 42 for the club, 300 for the public. The Roxburghe Club is generally recognised as the first "book club" (that is, [[text publication society]]), and was a model for many book societies that appeared later in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Europe]].

The museum was located {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} from central São Carlos and {{convert|250|km|mi|sp=us}} from [[São Paulo|São Paulo City]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museutam.com.br/localizacao.php Visitação e Localição]."

The museum was the creation of [[Rolim Adolfo Amaro]], founder and president of [[TAM Airlines]], and his brother [[João Francisco Amaro]]. The building is annexed to the TAM Airlines Technology Center at [[São Carlos Airport]], in the district of Água Vermelha in São Carlos.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia Portuguese article&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1996, after finishing the restoration work on a [[Cessna 195]], brothers Rolim Adolfo Amaro and João Francisco Amaro decided to buy some classic aircraft, and keep them near São Paulo, in order to make them available for flights on weekends with friends. However, once purchased, it was realised that the small collection could become a museum representative of the memory of aviation and the world. The brothers then decided to create the "Museu Asas de um Sonho" (Wings of a Dream Museum), that was maintained by the Education Service and Culture, a non-profit association founded by TAM on 23 December 1991, to administer the social programs of the company.

In 2006, the museum opened with 32 aircraft, but in future will house more than 80 aircraft.  The opening will also be part of the celebrations of 150 years of the city of São Carlos.

On January 29, 2016, TAM announced that the museum would be ceasing operations due to budget concerns.&lt;ref name="Closure"&gt;"[http://aeromagazine.uol.com.br/artigo/museu-da-tam-encerra-atividades_2505.html Museu da TAM encerra as atividades?]" Aero Magazine. Retrieved on February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebuilding ===
In July 2008 the museum was closed to visitors in order to allow a complete reorganization of its installations, which included an expansion of the covered space from 9.5 thousand square metres to over 20 thousand square metres. Te grand re-opening occurred in June 2010 and among many new features the collection of 90 airplanes now holds the sole surviving [[Savoia-Marchetti S.55|S.55]] seaplane christened "Jahú", a [[F4U Corsair]], a [[Bf 109]], a [[Dassault Mirage III]], a Brazilian aircraft [[Neiva Regente]] among others.

== Aircraft exhibits ==

The museum has 35 aircraft in a historical building measuring 450 metres long by 130 metres wide and 11 metres high. The exhibits planned to be accessible to visitors in 2010 are as follows:

==History==
&lt;!-- Insert old photo here
[[File:Greive, Teylers Painting Gallery I.jpg|thumb|Johan Conrad Greive, ''Interior of Paintings Gallery I'', drawing, 1862.]]--&gt;
In 1884 the expansion of the museum, called "Nieuwe Museum" (New Museum), with the addition of the entrance on the Spaarne and the new Fossil rooms, had just been completed to commemorate 100 years of exhibits in the Oval Room.&lt;ref name=RCE/&gt; The only part of the museum that had not profited from the expansion was the painting gallery, and this was finally done in 1893 by the regular building crew that the museum kept on hand for renovations. The new gallery was not only meant for extra exhibition space on the walls, but tables were set up for print and drawing viewing in the portfolio holders, a practice which has been kept up until today, although the prints in the viewing portfolios are now copies rather than originals.

[[File:Encyclopediaoffoodsandbeverages.PNG|thumb|right|''The Grocer's Encyclopedia'' - front cover]]
'''''The Grocer's Encyclopedia''''' ([[New York City]], 1911) is a book about the growing, preparation, and marketing of foods that was written and published by [[Artemas Ward (writer)|Artemas Ward]], an author and an advertising and marketing innovator who also developed several other successful businesses that brought him great wealth with which he was very generous, becoming noted as a philanthropist.

The book also is known as ''The Encyclopedia of Food and Beverages'', as shown on its front cover. The work was developed out of a rudimentary publication by the author in 1882, ''The Grocer's Handbook'', an effort which motivated him to refine the topic into the encyclopedia during "stolen minutes" throughout the thirty years intervening between the two publications.

The encyclopedia covers more than 1200 topics from [[Abalone]] to Zwetschgenwasser, with 80 color pages and 449 illustrations in all.&lt;ref name="teofad"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Artemas|title=The Grocer's Encyclopedia|year=1911|url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/books/book_63.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia has 12 pages on cheese, 20 on wine, 16 on tea, 7 on [[oyster]]s. It also contains information on [[Kosher]] foods, "new" meats such as [[Kangaroo meat|Kangaroo tails]], [[Cold Storage (supermarket)|Cold Storage]], [[Adulteration]], [[Label]]s, and [[Guild]]s.&lt;ref name=teofad /&gt;

The encyclopedia also provides translations of terms in French, German, Italian, and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref name=teofad /&gt;

The title page of the work is very descriptive:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A COMPENDIUM OF USEFUL INFORMATION CONCERNING FOODS
&lt;br&gt;OF ALL KINDS. HOW THEY ARE RAISED, PREPARED AND
&lt;br&gt;MARKETED. HOW TO CARE FOR THEM IN THE
&lt;br&gt;STORE AND HOME. HOW BEST TO USE
&lt;br&gt;AND ENJOY THEM—AND OTHER
&lt;br&gt;VALUABLE INFORMATION
&lt;br&gt;FOR
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;big&gt;GROCERS AND GENERAL STOREKEEPERS&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;COMPILED BY&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;big&gt;ARTEMAS WARD&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;FORMERLY EDITOR OF&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br&gt;"THE NATIONAL GROCER"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The book also has an [[Addendum#In books|appendix]] of 39 pages which contains a list of 500 names used to describe foods and drinks.

'''''The Times Atlas of World History''''' is a historical atlas first published by Times Books Limited, then a subsidiary of Times Newspapers Ltd and later a branch of [[Collins Bartholomew]], which is a subsidiary of [[HarperCollins]], and which in the latest editions has changed names to become '''''The Times Complete History of the World'''''. The first two editions were created by Barry Winkleman, the editorial director of Times Atlases and Managing Director of Times Books. They were edited by the [[Oxford University|Oxford]] Chichele Professor of Modern History [[Geoffrey Barraclough]]. It contains large full color plates and commentary on each map or set of maps.  Includes approximately 600 maps covering the date span of 3000 BCE to 1975. It has been revised and reprinted for many times and the latest edition is the ninth edition, published in 2015, and reflects on the modern world up to the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008150266/the-times-complete-history-of-the-world&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensions: 1.2 x 11.0 x 14.8&amp;nbsp;inches

==Book Content== 
It contains seven sections:
* The world of early man
* The first civilisations
* The classical civilisations of Eurasia
* The world of divided regions
* The world of emerging West
* The age of European dominance
* The age of global civilisation

The book is prefaced with an eleven page "World Chronology" which is quick-view timeline across general geographic regions. It is suffixed with a Glossary (38 pages), helpful in cross-referencing names and places, and an index (26 pages).

Each section is further divided into given subjects and contain between one and nine maps, charts to show economic, demographic, manufactures, agricultural output, drug trade and other data as needed.  Occasionally illustrations are included on a topic.

In the introduction to the first edition, Geoffrey Barraclough notes that the desire of ''The Atlas'' was to provide a history based on the viewpoint of its creators, hence the spread of Islam, for example, is centred at Mecca, as might have been the view of the seventh century Arabs.

==Publication Information==
''The Atlas'', first published in 1978 in London, UK, sold more than two million copies in many languages. Its stated aim was to describe the major processes and events of world history across a broad canvas and omit tiny details of, say, ruling families, minor battles etc. It wished to give a dynamic view of population migrations, economic developments such as agriculture and industrialisation, wars, the spread of religions and political ideologies.

It was created by Barry Winkleman, the Publishing Director of ''The Times'', and [[Geoffrey Barraclough]], Chichele Professor of Modern History at [[Oxford University]]. They assembled a team of some 100 leading historians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0723005346 |title=The Times Atlas of World History |author=Geoffrey Barraclough |isbn=9780723005346 |website=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  from around the world who wrote the texts and provided the map sources and recruited a team of illustrators and designers to create over 6 maps that were not primarily cartographers but illustrators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The map design was the work of Peter Sullivan, an art teacher and principal graphic artist at ''The Sunday Times'' newspaper in London. The illustration team was from Product Support Graphics, a large design group once part of Rolls Royce Motors in Derby, England,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} who used technical illustration technology to create projections.

''The Atlas'' was the first work of its kind to be published in Chinese{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, in Beijing, in 1981, by The Joint Publishing Company, and was a major success in French (''Encyclopedie Universalis''), German (''Droemer Verlag''), Italian (''Mondadori''), Hungarian (''Akademiai Kiado''), Serbo-Croat (''Cankarjeva Zalozba'') and in other languages. In the UK it was published by [[Collins Bartholomew|Times Books Limited]] and in the USA, where it had a huge success, by [[Hammond Map|Hammond, Inc]].

Following the death of [[Geoffrey Barraclough]] in 1984, three other editors have since edited the atlas. The third edition was edited by [[Norman Stone]], then [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]] for the fourth, and [[Richard Overy]] for the fifth to the present eighth edition. Also, since the fifth edition the atlas was fully updated with digitalized maps and is renamed ''The Times Complete Atlas of World History'', along with its smaller version of ''The Times Compact History of the World'', previously known as ''The Times Concise Atlas of World History''.

===Reviews===
Its critical reception was enthusiastic. For example [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Lord Blake]], [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of the [[Queen's College, Oxford]], called it a "splendid book" (source: inside jacket comment) and the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' called it "the most engrossing new reference book in decades."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In the latest eighth edition of ''The Times Complete History of the World'', [[Harvard University|Harvard]] historian [[Niall Ferguson]] stated that the atlas "conveys a sense not only of time, but also of place"; while English journalist and presenter [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] commented that "in the internet age, proof positive that this reference book still has the edge by a considerable margin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketing.harpercollins.co.uk/Contents/Title/Pages/default.aspx?objId=47972 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721060255/http://marketing.harpercollins.co.uk/Contents/Title/Pages/default.aspx?objId=47972 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Army Heritage and Education Center''' ('''USAHEC'''), at [[Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania]], is the [[U.S. Army]]'s primary historical research facility.  Formed in 1999 and reorganized in 2013, the center consists of the '''Military History Institute''' (MHI), the '''Army Heritage Museum''' (AHM), the '''Historical Services Division''' (HSD), '''Visitor and Education Services''' (VES), the '''U.S. Army War College Library''', and '''Collections Management''' (CM). The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center is part of the [[United States Army War College]], but has its own {{convert|56|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus.

The Heritage and Education Center makes available contemporary and historical materials related to strategic leadership, the global application of Landpower, and U.S. Army Heritage to inform research, educate an international audience, and honor Soldiers, past and present. The USAHEC team strives to:

'''Use''': The premier choice for researching strategic leadership, employment of Landpower, and U.S. Army Heritage

'''Support''': Actively support the USAWC mission and JIIM team with value-added products and analysis 

'''Acquire''': Purchase or accept donations of relevant contemporary and historical materials 

'''Hold''': Account for, process, maintain, and secure all contemporary and historical materials, digitize where appropriate

'''Educate''': Communicate and make available our holdings in a variety of formats and programs

'''Conserve''': Provide long-term care and preservation for contemporary and historical materials using state-of-the-art techniques

The current research collection contains military history books, military newspapers, technical and field manuals, periodicals, veteran’s surveys, photographs, and transcribes oral histories.  The collections include material from as early as the Revolutionary War to current U.S. Army operations. The USAHEC also provides interpretive exhibits and educational outreach programs to foster a greater understanding of the Army's central role in the growth, development and protection of the nation and its way of life.  The USAHEC motto is "Telling the Army story, one Soldier at a time."&lt;ref name= "about"&gt;The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, [http://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/about.cfm "The USAHEC Mission and Organization"].

==History==
The U.S. Army Military History Institute pre-dates the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center by over 30 years. Formed in 1967 as the Military History Research Collection, a branch of the U.S. Army War College Library, the institute became the primary repository for unofficial Army historical materials.  Official U.S. Army records and other materials belong to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/publications/general-info-leaflets/1-about-archives.html About the National Archives of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; For most of its existence, the institute was housed in Upton Hall on [[Carlisle Barracks]]. Built in 1941 as an academic building for the Medical Field Service School, Upton Hall was adequate as a library but ill-suited for the size and preservation needs of a major archive.

[[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Louis Caldera]] formed the Army Heritage and Education Center in June 1999 as a means of bringing an Army museum to Carlisle and promoting the holdings of the institute.  His successor [[Thomas E. White]] approved the construction of a new facility, the present-day Ridgway Hall, in 2001.  He stated:

"We will relocate its [the institute's] documents and holdings—the unofficial history of the United States Army—into a newly built state-of-the art archive, give that facility responsibility for administering historical documents and photographs Army wide, and associate it with an educational facility and a museum".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carlisle.army.mil/ahec/AHEC_history.htm AEC History.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UptonHall.jpg|thumb|right|The U.S. Army Military History Institute resided in Upton Hall, on Carlisle Barracks, from 1967 to 2004.]]
The center, including the holdings of the institute, relocated from Upton Hall to Ridgway Hall in 2004, officially opening on September 24. The Army named the building for former Army Chief of Staff General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]] (1895–1993), commander of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] in World War II and of [[United Nations]] forces in the [[Korean War]].

The '''Army Heritage Museum''', formed with the center in 1999, held its artifacts mostly in storage in various places on Carlisle Barracks before the construction of its Interim Storage Facility beside Ridgway Hall in 2004.

By 2005, the center created the Army Heritage Trail and began placing historical markers and large artifacts such as tanks and field artillery on display for public view. The first permanent structures, the Civil War cabins, officially opened in October of that year. The Trail continued to grow and evolve over time, and continues to expand today.

In 2009, the USAHEC broke ground for the Visitor and Education Center as plans for the growth of the campus continued. In May 2011, the Center opened to the public and serves as the welcome and orientation site for all visitors to the campus. The building features a {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} exhibit space and two multipurpose rooms for conferences and other presentations. Later in the year, the USAHEC opened the state-of-the-art Conservation Facility to house and preserve the U.S. Army's artifact collection. 

==Campus==
[[File:USAHEC Facility 2017.jpg|thumb|The Visitor and Education Center and Ridgway Hall on the campus of the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.]]
The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center consists of the following buildings: the Visitor and Education Center, Ridgway Hall, the Conservation Facility, and the Fabrication Facility. The campus also includes a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) outdoor Army Heritage Trail. The Trail consists of macro-exhibits showcasing various periods of the U. S. Army’s history.

===Ridgway Hall===
Named after Army Chief of Staff General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]] (1895–1993), commander of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] in World War II and of [[United Nations]] forces in the [[Korean War]], Ridgway Hall opened to the public in 2004.  Home of the Military History Institute, the {{convert|66000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} hall holds over 15 million items (books, periodicals, manuscripts, photographs, military publications) on U.S. Army history, covering the Revolutionary War era to current operations.  The collections also include one of the largest [[American Civil War]] photograph collection in the world. The research facility is open to the public during normal operating hours, and enjoys use by scholars, students, genealogists, and researchers of all kinds.

Along with a reading room for researchers, the hall also has several small exhibits that display artifacts and photographs from USAHEC holdings. Currently, the Ridgway Hall exhibits include the General Omar Nelson Bradley Memorial Art Gallery, which features rotating art exhibits&lt;ref name= "gallery"&gt;The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, [http://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/exhibits/Gallery/default.cfm "Gallery"].&lt;/ref&gt; and an exhibit showcasing the highlights of the USAHEC Collection. The "Treasures of the USAHEC" exhibit highlights many types of materials, collected since 1967, which comprise USAHEC's current historical holdings. Objects on display were selected due to their distinctive nature or because they provide a unique perspective on the history of the U.S. Army, as well as what Soldiers found important about themselves, their units, the people they met, and the places where they served. &lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, [http://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/exhibits/Treasures/default.cfm "Treasures of the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center"].  Retrieved 26 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff in Ridgway Hall oversee the [[Library catalog|cataloging]] of books and other items, the processing of archival collections, the transcription of [[Oral history|oral histories]], the writing of research [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] and other [[finding aid]]s, and patron and visitor services.

The Visitor and Education Center opened in May 2011 to the general public. It serves as the welcome and orientation site for visitors to the facility. The building includes a {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} museum exhibit space, currently featuring "The Soldier Experience," a museum store, and two large multipurpose rooms for conferences and lectures.

"The Soldier Experience" is located in the Visitor and Education Center (VEC) of the USAHEC campus and is open during normal business hours. When exploring the gallery, visitors experience the U. S. Army through the eyes of the men and women who lived its history, in war and peace, from the Spanish–American War to current operations. Visitors can stop at the Information Desk to pick up a “dog tag” representing one of six Soldiers whose story is part of the USAHEC collections. Guests use the dog tag to experience Army life as a Soldier does, learning about their Soldier throughout the gallery.

The exhibit also features artifacts, oral history recordings accessible from your smart phone, a movie theater, and the opportunity to write a letter to a currently serving Soldier. In addition, guests may test their marksmanship at the digital shooting range, parachute in to Normandy as part of the D-Day invasion, and experience a night attack during the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Army War College, [http://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/exhibits/SoldierExperience.cfm "Soldier Experience"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation Facility and Collections Management===
The {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} museum conservation facility holds the Army Heritage Museum's artifacts and serves as the curatorial work space.  The Conservation Facility is not open to the public. The building provides state of the art climate controlled storage and contains objects, paper, analytical, and digital laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/conservation/default.cfm|author=USAHEC|website=ahec.armywarcollege.edu|language=en|title=Conservation|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the Collections Management team facilitate the development and preservation of the USAHEC collection by acquiring, conserving, and administering historical materials. The team is responsible for the growth and maintenance of the collection to ensure they are relevant and available for usage. The acquisitions section constantly adds new items to the collection through the donation of historical materials. The USAHEC purchases the newest publications and books to add to its extensive library collections.&lt;ref name= "about"/&gt;

===Army Heritage Trail===
[[Image:1781redoubt.jpg|thumb|right|Re-enactors fire from an American Revolutionary War redoubt on the Army Heritage Trail. It is a replica of Redoubt 10, a British redoubt seized by Continental Army troops at the Siege of Yorktown on October 14, 1781.]]
The  '''[http://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/trail/aht.cfm Army Heritage Trail]''', a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) walking path of outdoor exhibits and markers on various eras in U.S. Army history. Notable exhibits include:
* Replica [[American Revolutionary War]] redoubt from the 1781 [[Siege of Yorktown]],
* Way-station cabin built to resemble those of the [[French and Indian War]]
* Cabins representing an [[American Civil War]] winter encampment
* [[World War II]] induction center
* Recreation of a western front trench system from [[World War I]], shellhole-marked [[no-man's land]], and a corresponding German pillbox.
* [[Vietnam War]] firebase with two [[M102 howitzer]]s, a guard tower, and defensive berm
* [[M4 Sherman]] Tank, [[M60 Patton]] Main Battle Tank, [[Bell AH-1 Cobra]] helicopter, Pak 43/41 88mm German World War II era artillery cannon, 12 pounder Napoleon Civil War era cannon, and many other vehicles and weapons

The Army Heritage Trail is open for visitation dawn to dusk daily. The buildings and structures on the trail are only open when the USAHEC buildings are open.

===Events and Programs===
The USAHEC hosts many types of history events, including lectures, large and small [[living history]] events, workshops, education programs, and more.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, [http://www.carlisle.army.mil/ahec/programs.cfm "Programs"].&lt;/ref&gt; In past years, the USAHEC has hosted Army Heritage Days in recognition of [[Armed Forces Day]] in the United States. The event features re-enactors from all eras of U.S. Army history occupying the Army Heritage Trail, and various displays and demonstrations allow the public to interact with the living historians. Other events have had many different military history themes; in 2009 and 2010 a late-summer event included 18th and 19th century U.S. Army history concentrating on the [[American Revolution]]. In 2011, the theme was the sesquicentennial of the first winter of the [[American Civil War]].

==Affiliated organizations==
The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center is supported by a private non-profit foundation, the [[Army Heritage Center Foundation]], which helps the center with development and educational efforts. It oversaw fundraising for the construction of the Visitor and Education Center and is raising funds for the Army Heritage Center Facility.

In 2007, a survey called "Vegaphobia: disproportionate talk about [[veganism]] in British national newspapers" took place in the United Kingdom, which examined 397 articles containing the terms "vegan", "vegans" and "veganism". That's what the researchers found was that 74.3% of the items are classified as "negatives"; 20.2% "neutral" and only 5.5% "positive". Negative items were in order of frequency: ridiculing veganism; characterize veganism as [[asceticism]]; affirming that veganism is difficult or impossible to sustain; describe veganism as a fashion; portray vegans as sentimentalists; defining vegans as hostile.&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt;

Laura Wright claims that media organisations and wider discourse routinely mischaracterise vegan diets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vegan Studies Project : Food, Animals, and Gender in the Age of Terror|last=Wright|first=Laura|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=EBSCOhost|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlights situations where media outlets report the death of children from a 'vegan diet' rather than the neglect that was the actual cause.&lt;ref name="Wright2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Wright|title=The Vegan Studies Project: Food, Animals, and Gender in the Age of Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwPaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89|date=1 October 2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-4854-4|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''WYCIWYG''' is an [[acronym]] that stands for '''''W'''hat '''Y'''ou '''C'''ache '''I'''s '''W'''hat '''Y'''ou '''G'''et'', commonly displayed in the address bar of [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]-based [[Web browser]]s like [[Mozilla Firefox]] as &lt;tt&gt;wyciwyg://&lt;/tt&gt; when the [[Web browser]] is retrieving [[Web cache|cached]] information.

The term WYCIWYG is a play on the acronym [[WYSIWYG]] ("What You See Is What You Get").

==Usage==

Mozilla Firefox implements a registered, strictly internal &lt;code&gt;wyciwyg&lt;/code&gt; [[uniform resource identifier|uniform resource identifier (URI)]] scheme to sort and later reference locally cached pages that were generated or modified by a script on the client side (a common practice for [[Web 2.0]] sites).

==Security issues==

In 2007 [[Michał Zalewski]] reported that it was possible to bypass the same-origin checks and read from cached (wyciwyg) documents. It was possible at that time to access &lt;tt&gt;wyciwyg://&lt;/tt&gt; documents without proper same domain policy checks. This could have enabled an attacker to steal sensitive data, perform [[cache poisoning]] and execute their own code or display own content with URL bar and [[SSL certificate]] data of the original page ([[URL spoofing]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070907160824/http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffcache/ Firefox wyciwyg:// cache vulnerability demo – Michal Zalewski]&lt;/ref&gt; This was fixed in [[Firefox]] 2.0.0.5 and [[SeaMonkey]] 1.1.3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-24.html Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-24: Unauthorized access to wyciwyg:// documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Windmill of Wijk bij Duurstede''''' (c. 1670) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], on loan to the [[Rijksmuseum]].

The painting shows [[Wijk bij Duurstede]], a riverside town about 20 kilometers from [[Utrecht]], with a dominating cylindrical windmill, harmonised by the lines of river bank and sails, and the contrasts between light and shadow working together with the intensified concentration of mass and space. {{sfn|Slive|2006|p=5}} The attention to detail is remarkable. Art historian [[Seymour Slive]] reports that both from an aeronautical engineering and a hydrological viewpoint the finest levels of details are correct, in the windmill's sails and the river's waves respectively.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=23}}

It is not known for certain when Ruisdael painted the ''Windmill''. The painting is not dated, as very few of his works are after 1653.{{sfn|Slive |2001|p=6}} Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely detective work and speculation. It is assumed that it was painted in 1670.{{sfn|Slive|Hoetink|1981|p=21}}

Unlike many other Ruisdaels the ''Windmill'' seems to have remained in Dutch hands.{{sfn|Slive|2001}} It was acquired by [[Adriaan van der Hoop]] at an unknown date, and bequeathed by him to the young [[Amsterdam Museum]] in 1854. Since 30 June 1885 it has been lent to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam. Its enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the ''Windmill'' ranking third after [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Night Watch|Night Watch]]'' and [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[View of Delft]]''.{{sfn|Slive|Hoetink|1981|p=21}}

Ruisdael's windmill no longer stands, although its foundations can still be seen. Another windmill located a few hundred meters further is often confused with Ruisdael's.{{sfn|Gaasbeek|2010|p=110}} This confusion was created when [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911 wrote about the painting:

{{Quotation|"The [[Rhine]] flows from the left distance, filling almost the whole foreground except for a strip of the right-hand bank which is seen in front. 
The bank is lined with [[piling|piles]]; reeds grow on it in the centre foreground. 
In the right middle distance is the great stone mill, with its sails at the 
back and inclined to the left. It rises far above the low trees around it 
and the [[Duurstede Castle|episcopal palace]] beyond it to the left. To the right of the mill 
is a cottage ; farther to the right rises the church tower of the town. On 
a road along the bank to the right are three women. In the right foreground lie two millstones. On the river in the left distance are two 
sailing-boats. To the right of them, behind a bend in the stream, rise 
two masts. A fine cloudy sky. The mill still stands at this spot where 
the Rhine divides to form the [[Lek (river)|Lek]] and the [[Kromme Rijn|Kromme Rhyn]] (or " Crooked " 
Rhine). But it is not so high as it seems in the picture; and the lower 
part is now square and not round, and has a passage through it. Houses 
now stand where the low trees are seen round the mill. One of Ruisdael's 
finest pictures. [Compare 183 and 936.]

Signed in full on the right at foot ; canvas, 33 inches by 40 inches. 
Engraved by L. C. van Kesteren, W. Steelink the elder, and J. H. Graadt 
van Roggen. Sale. ]. Noe, 1841. In the collection of [[Adriaan van der Hoop|A. van der Hoop]], Amsterdam ; bequeathed to the town 
in 1854. In the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, Van der Hoop bequest, 1910 catalogue, No. 2074."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/40/mode/2up  Entry 105 for The Windmill of Wijk bij Duurstede] in Hofstede de Groot, 1912 (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This scene is very similar to other panorama paintings Ruisdael made of other (unidentified) windmills and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape, such as [[John Constable]].
