Algebraic specification seeks to systematically develop more efficient programs by:

# formally defining [[data type|types of data]], and mathematical operations on those data types
# abstracting implementation details, such as the size of representations (in memory) and the efficiency of obtaining outcome of computations
# formalizing the computations and operations on data types
# allowing for automation by formally restricting operations to this limited set of behaviors and data types.

An algebraic specification achieves these goals by defining one or more data types, and specifying a collection of functions that operate on those data types.  These functions can be divided into two classes:

# [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor functions]]: functions that create or initialize the data elements, or construct complex elements from simpler ones
# [[Method (computer programming)|additional functions]]: functions that operate on the data types, and are defined in terms of the constructor functions.

==Example==
Consider a formal algebraic specification for the [[Boolean data type|boolean]] data type.

One possible algebraic specification may provide two constructor functions for the data-element: a ''true'' constructor and a ''false'' constructor.  Thus, a boolean data element could be declared, constructed, and initialized to a value.  In this scenario, all other [[Boolean algebra|connective elements]], such as [[XOR]] and [[Logical conjunction|AND]], would be ''additional functions''.  Thus, a data element could be instantiated with either "true" or "false" value, and additional functions could be used to perform any operation on the data element.

Alternatively, the entire system of boolean data types could be specified using a different set of constructor functions: a ''false'' constructor and a ''[[Negation|not]]'' constructor.  In that case, an additional function could be defined to yield the value "true."

The algebraic specification therefore describes [[state machine|all possible states]] of the data element, and all possible [[State_machine#Concepts_and_vocabulary|transitions]] between states.

The '''angular diameter''', '''angular size''', '''apparent diameter''', or '''apparent size''' is an angular measurement describing how large a [[sphere]] or [[circle]] appears from a given point of view. In the [[vision sciences]], it is called the [[visual angle]], and in [[optics]], it is the [[angular aperture]] (of a [[lens (optics)|lens]]). The angular diameter can alternatively be thought of as the angle through which an eye or camera must rotate to look from one side of an apparent circle to the opposite side. '''Angular radius''' equals half the angular diameter.

==Formula==
[[File:Angular dia formula.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Diagram for the formula of the angular diameter]]

The angular diameter of a [[circle]] whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the centre of said circle can be calculated using the formula&lt;ref&gt;This can be derived using the formula for the length of a cord found at {{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221042937/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html |archivedate=2014-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arctan \left(\frac{d}{2D}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular diameter, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are the actual diameter of and the distance to the object. When &lt;math&gt;D \gg d&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\delta \approx d / D&lt;/math&gt;, and the result obtained is in [[radians]].

For a spherical object whose ''actual'' diameter equals &lt;math&gt;d_\mathrm{act},&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the ''centre'' of the sphere, the angular diameter can be found by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arcsin \left(\frac{d_\mathrm{act}}{2D}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The difference is due to the fact that the apparent edges of a sphere are its tangent points, which are closer to the observer than the centre of the sphere. For practical use, the distinction is only significant for spherical objects that are relatively close, since the [[small-angle approximation]] holds for &lt;math&gt; x \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathstat.concordia.ca/faculty/rhall/mc/arctan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218190328/http://www.mathstat.concordia.ca/faculty/rhall/mc/arctan.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin x \approx \arctan x \approx x&lt;/math&gt; .

==Use in astronomy==
[[File:Angular diameter.jpg|thumb|300px|Angular diameter: the angle subtended by an object]]

In [[astronomy]], the sizes of [[celestial object]]s are often given in terms of their angular diameter as seen from [[Earth]], rather than their actual sizes. Since these angular diameters are typically small, it is common to present them in [[arcsecond]]s (″). An arcsecond is 1/3600th of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] (1°), and a radian is 180/&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; degrees, so one radian equals 3,600*180/&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; arcseconds, which is about 206,265 arcseconds. Therefore, the angular diameter of an object with physical diameter ''d'' at a distance ''D'', expressed in arcseconds, is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stars and Galaxies |author=Michael A. Seeds |author2=Dana E. Backman |publisher=Brooks Cole |date=2010 |edition=7 |page=39 |isbn=978-0-538-73317-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; = (206,265) ''d'' / ''D'' arcseconds.

These objects have an angular diameter of 1″:
*an object of diameter 1 cm at a distance of 2.06 km
*an object of diameter 725.27&amp;nbsp;km at a distance of 1 [[astronomical unit]] (AU)
*an object of diameter 45&amp;nbsp;866&amp;nbsp;916&amp;nbsp;km at 1 [[light-year]]
*an object of diameter 1 AU (149&amp;nbsp;597&amp;nbsp;871&amp;nbsp;km) at a distance of 1 [[parsec]] (pc)

Thus, the angular diameter of [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]] as viewed from a distance of 1 pc is 2″, as 1 AU is the mean radius of Earth's orbit.

The angular diameter of the Sun, from a distance of one [[light-year]], is 0.03″, and that of [[Earth]] 0.0003″. The angular diameter 0.03″ of the Sun given above is approximately the same as that of a person at a distance of the diameter of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;hs=3cj&amp;q=arctan%286ft+%2F+12756.3+Km%29+in+arcseconds&amp;btnG=Search&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comparison angular diameter solar system.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of angular diameter of the Sun, Moon and planets. To get a true representation of the sizes, view the image at a distance of 103 times the width of the "Moon: max." circle. For example, if this circle is 5 cm wide on your monitor, view it from 5.15 m away.]]
[[File:Jupiter.mit.Io.Ganymed.Europa.Calisto.Vollmond.10.4.2017.jpg|thumb|250px|This photo compares the apparent sizes of [[Jupiter]] and its four [[Galilean moons]] ([[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] at maximum [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]]) with the apparent diameter of the [[full moon|full Moon]] during their [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] on 10 April 2017.]]

The table shows that the angular diameter of Sun, when seen from Earth is approximately 32′ (1920″ or 0.53°), as illustrated above.

Thus the angular diameter of the Sun is about 250,000 times that of [[Sirius]]. (Sirius has twice the diameter and its distance is 500,000 times as much; the Sun is 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, so Sirius is roughly 6 times as bright per unit [[solid angle]].)

The angular diameter of the Sun is also about 250,000 times that of [[Alpha Centauri A]] (it has about the same diameter and the distance is 250,000 times as much; the Sun is 4×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 200,000, so Alpha Centauri A is a little brighter per unit solid angle).

The angular diameter of the Sun is about the same as that of the [[Moon]]. (The Sun's diameter is 400 times as large and its distance also; the Sun is 200,000 to 500,000 times as bright as the full Moon (figures vary), corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 450 to 700, so a celestial body with a diameter of 2.5–4″ and the same brightness per unit solid angle would have the same brightness as the full Moon.)

Even though Pluto is physically larger than Ceres, when viewed from Earth (e.g., through the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]) Ceres has a much larger apparent size.

Angular sizes measured in degrees are useful for larger patches of sky. (For example, the three stars of [[Orion's Belt|the Belt]] cover about 4.5° of angular size.) However, much finer units are needed to measure the angular sizes of galaxies, nebulae, or other objects of the [[night sky]].

Degrees, therefore, are subdivided as follows:
* 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s (°) in a full circle
* 60 [[arc-minute]]s (′) in one degree
* 60 [[arc-second]]s (″) in one arc-minute

To put this in perspective, the [[full moon|full Moon]] as viewed from Earth is about {{frac|1|2}°, or 30′ (or 1800″). The Moon's motion across the sky can be measured in angular size: approximately 15° every hour, or 15″ per second. A one-mile-long line painted on the face of the Moon would appear from Earth to be about 1″ in length.

In astronomy, it is typically difficult to directly measure the distance to an object, yet the object may have a known physical size (perhaps it is similar to a closer object with known distance) and a measurable angular diameter. In that case, the angular diameter formula can be inverted to yield the [[angular diameter distance]] to distant objects as 
:&lt;math&gt;d \equiv 2 D \tan \left( \frac{\delta}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

In non-Euclidean space, such as our expanding universe, the angular diameter distance is only one of several definitions of distance, so that there can be different "distances" to the same object.  See [[Distance measures (cosmology)]].

===Non-circular objects===
Many [[deep-sky object]]s such as [[galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e appear non-circular and are thus typically given two measures of diameter: major axis and minor axis. For example, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] has a visual apparent diameter of {{DEC|5|20}} × {{DEC|3|5}}.

===Defect of illumination===
Defect of illumination is the maximum angular width of the unilluminated part of a celestial body seen by a given observer. For example, if an object is 40″ of arc across and is 75% illuminated, the defect of illumination is 10″.

'''Ascendency''' is a quantitative attribute of an [[ecosystem]], defined as a function of the ecosystem's [[trophic network]].  Ascendency is derived using mathematical tools from [[information theory]].  It is intended to capture in a single index the ability of an ecosystem to prevail against [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] by virtue of its combined organization and size.

One way of depicting ascendency is to regard it as "organized power", because the index represents the magnitude of the power that is flowing within the system towards particular ends, as distinct from power that is dissipated willy-nilly. Almost half a century earlier, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922) had suggested that a system's capacity to prevail in evolution was related to its ability to capture useful power. Ascendency can thus be regarded as a refinement of Lotka's supposition that also takes into account how power is actually being channeled within a system.

In mathematical terms, ascendency is the product of the aggregate amount of material or energy being transferred in an ecosystem times the coherency with which the outputs from the members of the system relate to the set of inputs to the same components ([[Robert Ulanowicz|Ulanowicz]] 1986).  Coherence is gauged by the [[average mutual information]] shared between inputs and outputs (Rutledge et al. 1976).

Originally, it was thought that ecosystems increase uniformly in ascendency as they developed, but subsequent empirical observation has suggested that all sustainable ecosystems are confined to a narrow "window of vitality" (Ulanowicz 2002). Systems with relative values of ascendency plotting below the window tend to fall apart due to lack of significant internal constraints, whereas systems above the window tend to be so "brittle" that they become vulnerable to external perturbations.

Sensitivity analysis on the components of the ascendency reveals the controlling transfers within the system in the sense of [[Justus von Liebig|Liebig]] (Ulanowicz and Baird 1999). That is, ascendency can be used to identify which resource is limiting the functioning of each component of the ecosystem.

It is thought that autocatalytic feedback is the primary route by which systems increase and maintain their ascendencies (Ulanowicz 1997.)

'''Ashesi University''' is a private college located in [[Ghana]], [[West Africa]].

The mission of Ashesi University is to educate ethical, entrepreneurial leaders in Africa.

In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the World Innovation Summit in Education Prize,{{cn|date=November 2018}} one of the world’s biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2018, Ashesi was also awarded a Charter by the President of Ghana, granting it full independence as a nationally recognised degree-granting institution. It was the youngest university to have been granted a Presidential Charter in Ghana’s history, a rare accomplishment.

Ashesi offers a four-year bachelors programme grounded in a multidisciplinary core curriculum, featuring majors in [[Business Administration]], [[Management Information Systems]], [[Computer science|Computer Science]], Electrical and [[Electronic engineering|Electronic Engineering]], [[Computer engineering|Computer Engineering]] and [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical Engineering.]] With an academic program designed in collaboration with some of the world's best universities and organisations, Ashesi continues to shape an educational experience like no other in Africa.

==Membership==
* Association of American Colleges and Universities
* Council of Independent Universities
* Association of African Universities

==History==
Ashesi was founded by [[Patrick Awuah]], a Ghanaian who spent over 15 years living and working in the United States. [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] left Ghana in 1985 to attend [[Swarthmore College]] on a full scholarship, after which he worked for [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] as an engineer and a program manager for eight years. Experiencing first hand the dramatic impact that education can have on one's life, [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] embarked on a mission in 1997 to provide greater educational opportunities in [[Ghana]]. He enrolled in business school at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, both to evaluate the feasibility of his goal and to gain managerial skills with which to found and manage a university.

*1997: Founder Patrick Awuah gives up his US software career to return to [[Africa]].

==The Meaning of Ashesi==
 [[File:Ashesi_Todd_&amp;_Ruth_Warren_Library.jpg |frame|The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi|alt=The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi]]
"If there is anything you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now."
 
These words by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe are the inspiration behind the university's name, Ashesi, which means "beginning" in Fante, a native Ghanaian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi History: Meaning of Ashesi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117100304/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi |date=17 November 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasibility study==
During the summer of 1998, a team of four MBA students from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business travelled to Ghana to conduct extensive market research and evaluate the feasibility of establishing a new university. With the goal of gathering data to provide a foundation for business decisions, the team administered over 3,300 surveys to students and parents; conducted interviews and focus groups with parents, teachers and business leaders; and gathered secondary information from local and international sources. The result was a comprehensive feasibility study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html Early years feasibility study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106021317/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html |date=6 January 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt; analysing Ghanaian tertiary education.

==Ashesi campus==
Set on 100 acres in Berekuso, overlooking Ghana's capital city of Accra, Ashesi’s campus unites traditional Ghanaian design, modern technology and environmental best practices. The  campus has interconnected courtyards, that emphasize a sense of community. The architecture borrows from the Ghanaian vernacular, with echoes of traditional compound houses, as well as elements of traditional Northern dwellings. The natural contours of the site are used in concert with buildings to create exterior gathering spaces throughout campus, as well as ramps that provide wheel chair access to buildings.  Buildings are designed to maximize natural views, light and ventilation.

Ground water is supplemented with harvested rainwater, filtered and treated to provide potable water all year round. A community-scale sewage and organic treatment plant provides environmental and economic benefits by converting waste to biogas for some of the campus’ cooking needs and recycling treated water for landscaping.

==Global Recognition==
On Wednesday 3 May 2018, [[President of the Republic of Ghana]], H.E [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] awarded Ashesi University a Presidential Charter meaning the University will now award degrees to its graduated in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com|title=Akufo-Addo grants Ashesi University Presidential Charter|last=Ibrahim|first=Abubakar|date=3 May 2018|work=Myjoyonline|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashesi, until this year was affiliated to the University of Cape Coast(UCC), Ghana meaning its graduates were awarded a UCC degree.

In 2012, the university was ranked by [[PwC]] as the seventh most respected organisation in Ghana, becoming the first university to make the list. Ashesi's President, Dr. Patrick Awuah, was also ranked the 4th Most Respected CEO in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicle.com.gh/ut-bank-rlg-bosses-outshine-rivals-at-ghanas-most-respected-ceo-awards/ UT Bank, Rlg bosses outshine rivals –at Ghana’s Most Respected CEO awards]. ''http://thechronicle.com.gh''. October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Africa.com again named Ashesi among its list of top 10 African Universities (excluding South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.com/blog/the-top-10-universities-in-africa-part-i/ The Top 10 Universities in Africa (ex South Africa) – 2015 Edition]. ''http://africa.com''. February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been ranked as one of Ghana's 50 Best Places to work (2015), according to a survey by Ghanaian consulting firm Goodman AMC; it was again, the only university on the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com/2015/03/top-50-best-places-to-work-in-ghana.html Top 50 Best Places to Work in Ghana]. ''http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[CNN]] shared the story of Ashesi and its founder on its African Voices programme. In the interview, Ashesi's President said: "If you come back in 30 years, universities will be competing for the best and brightest students. I hope that universities will also be competing on things such as whose students are the most ethical. If that happens, it will change the continent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/world/africa/patrick-awuah-ashesi-ghana/ Millionaire who quit Microsoft to educate Africa's future leaders]. ''http://cnn.com''. May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ashesi's President was ranked by [[Fortune (magazine)]] as one of the World's 50 Greatest Leaders, together with the likes of [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates]], [[Pope Francis]] and founder of [[Amazon.com]], [[Jeff Bezos]]. The list according to Forbes, was made up of men and women who "in an era that feels starved for leadership, will inspire you—some famous, others little known, all of them energizing their followers and making the world better." &lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2014/03/20/worlds-50-greatest-leaders/ The World's 50 Greatest Leaders: 2015]. ''http://fortune.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the [https://www.wise-qatar.org/2017-wise-prize-education-patrick-awuah World Innovation Summit in Education Prize], one of the world’s biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2018, Ashesi was also awarded a Charter by the President of Ghana, granting it full independence as a nationally recognised degree-granting institution. It was the youngest university to have been granted a Presidential Charter in Ghana’s history, a rare accomplishment.

If present on a super-cellular scale, biominerals are usually deposited by a dedicated organ, which is often defined very early in the embryological development.  This organ will contain an organic matrix that facilitates and directs the deposition of crystals.&lt;ref name=Livingston2006/&gt;  The matrix may be collagen, as in deuterostomes,&lt;ref name=Livingston2006/&gt; or based on chitin or other polysaccharides, as in molluscs.&lt;ref name='Checa2009'&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s00114-008-0461-1| pmid = 18843476| year = 2009| last1 = Checa | first1 = A.| last2 = Ramírez-Rico | first2 = J.| last3 = González-Segura | first3 = A.| last4 = Sánchez-Navas | first4 = A.| title = Nacre and false nacre (foliated aragonite) in extant monoplacophorans (=Tryblidiida: Mollusca)| volume = 96| issue = 1| pages = 111–122| journal = Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode = 2009NW.....96..111C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shells-IZE-006-Black.jpg|thumb|Variety of mollusc shells (gastropods, snails and seashells).]]
The mollusc shell is a biogenic composite material that has been the subject of much interest in materials science because of its unusual properties and its model character for biomineralization. Molluscan shells consist of 95–99% calcium carbonate by weight, while an organic component makes up the remaining 1–5%. The resulting composite has a fracture toughness ~3000 times greater than that of the crystals themselves.&lt;ref name="Currey1999"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the biomineralization of the mollusc shell, specialized proteins are responsible for directing crystal nucleation, phase, morphology, and growths dynamics and ultimately give the shell its remarkable mechanical strength. The application of biomimetic principles elucidated from mollusc shell assembly and structure may help in fabricating new composite materials with enhanced optical, electronic, or structural properties.

=== Mineral production and degradation in fungi ===
[[Fungus|Fungi]] are a diverse group of organisms that belong to the [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] domain. Studies of their significant roles in geological processes, "geomycology", has shown that fungi are involved with biomineralization, [[biodegradation]], and metal-fungal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadd|first=Geoffrey M.|date=2007-01-01|title=Geomycology: biogeochemical transformations of rocks, minerals, metals and radionuclides by fungi, bioweathering and bioremediation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953756206003364|journal=Mycological Research|volume=111|issue=1|pages=3–49|doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying fungi's roles in biomineralization, it has been found that fungi deposit minerals with the help of an organic matrix, such as a protein, that provides a nucleation site for the growth of biominerals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Qianwei|last2=Gadd|first2=Geoffrey Michael|date=2017-08-10|title=Biosynthesis of copper carbonate nanoparticles by ureolytic fungi|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|doi=10.1007/s00253-017-8451-x|issn=1432-0614|pmc=5594056|pmid=28799032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal growth may produce a copper-containing mineral precipitate, such as [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]] produced from a mixture of [[Ammonium carbonate|(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Copper(II) chloride|CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The production of the copper carbonate is produced in the presence of proteins made and secreted by the fungi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These fungal proteins that are found extracellularly aid in the size and morphology of the [[carbonate minerals]] precipitated by the fungi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to precipitating carbonate minerals, fungi can also precipitate [[uranium]]-containing phosphate biominerals in the presence of organic [[phosphorus]] that acts a substrate for the process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Xinjin|last2=Hillier|first2=Stephen|last3=Pendlowski|first3=Helen|last4=Gray|first4=Nia|last5=Ceci|first5=Andrea|last6=Gadd|first6=Geoffrey Michael|date=2015-06-01|title=Uranium phosphate biomineralization by fungi|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12771/abstract|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=2064–2075|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12771|issn=1462-2920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi produce a hyphal matrix, also known as [[mycelium]], that localizes and accumulates the uranium minerals that have been precipitated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although uranium is often deemed as toxic towards living organisms, certain fungi such as ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and ''Paecilomyces javanicus'' can tolerate it.

Far from being a rare trait that evolved a few times and remained stagnant, biomineralization pathways in fact evolved many times and are still evolving rapidly today; even within a single genus it is possible to detect great variation within a single gene family.&lt;ref name=Jackson2010/&gt;

The [[homology (biology)|homology]] of biomineralization pathways is underlined by a remarkable experiment whereby the [[nacreous]] layer of a molluscan shell was implanted into a [[human tooth]], and rather than experiencing an immune response, the molluscan nacre was incorporated into the host bone matrix.  This points to the [[exaptation]] of an original biomineralization pathway.

The most ancient example of biomineralization, dating back 2 billion years, is the deposition of [[magnetite]], which is observed in some bacteria, as well as the teeth of [[chiton]]s and the brains of vertebrates; it is possible that this pathway, which performed a [[magnetosensory]] role in the common ancestor of all [[bilaterians]], was duplicated and modified in the Cambrian to form the basis for calcium-based biomineralization pathways.&lt;ref name=Kirschvink2000&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Kirschvink J.L.  |author2=Hagadorn, J.W. |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter= 10 A Grand Unified theory of Biomineralization. |editor=Bäuerlein, E. |title=The Biomineralisation of Nano- and Micro-Structures, |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=139–150|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iron is stored in close proximity to magnetite-coated chiton teeth, so that the teeth can be renewed as they wear.

==Astrobiology==
It has been suggested that biominerals could be important indicators of extraterrestrial life and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on [[Mars]].  Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book | editor2-first=David| editor2-last= Beaty | contribution=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory | editor1-first=Andrew |  editor1-last=Steele | publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) - NASA| place=U.S.A.| pages=72| date=September 26, 2006| id= | contribution-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc| chapter-format=.doc| accessdate=2009-07-22 |authors=MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential applications==
Most traditional approaches to synthesis of nanoscale materials are energy inefficient, requiring stringent conditions (e.g., high temperature, pressure or pH) and often produce toxic byproducts. Furthermore, the quantities produced are small, and the resultant material is usually irreproducible because of the difficulties in controlling agglomeration.&lt;ref name="isbn1-55899-181-6"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas, George Brinton |author2=Komarneni, Sridhar |author3=Parker, John |title=Nanophase and Nanocomposite Materials: Symposium Held December 1–3, 1992, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A. (Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings) |publisher=Materials Research Society |location=Pittsburgh, Pa |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=1-55899-181-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, materials produced by organisms have properties that usually surpass those of analogous synthetically manufactured materials with similar phase composition. Biological materials are assembled in aqueous environments under mild conditions by using macromolecules. Organic macromolecules collect and transport raw materials and assemble these substrates and into short- and long-range ordered composites with consistency and uniformity.
The aim of [[biomimetics]] is to mimic the natural way of producing minerals such as [[apatite]]s. Many man-made crystals require elevated temperatures and strong chemical solutions, whereas the organisms have long been able to lay down elaborate mineral structures at ambient temperatures. Often, the mineral phases are not pure but are made as [[Composite material|composites]] that entail an organic part, often [[protein]], which takes part in and controls the biomineralisation. These composites are often not only as hard as the pure mineral but also tougher, as the micro-environment controls biomineralisation.

===Uranium contaminants in groundwater===
[[File:Autunite-69257.jpg|thumb|Autunite crystal.]]
Biomineralization may be used to remediate groundwater contaminated with [[uranium]].&lt;ref name=Newsome2014&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254113004907|author1=Newsome, L. |author2=Morris, K. |author3=Lloyd, J. R.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The biogeochemistry and bioremediation of uranium and other priority radionuclides|journal=Chemical Geology|year=2014|volume=363|pages=164–184|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.034|bibcode=2014ChGeo.363..164N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biomineralization of uranium primarily involves the precipitation of uranium phosphate minerals associated with the release of phosphate by microorganisms. Negatively charged [[ligands]] at the surface of the cells attract the positively charged uranyl ion (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). If the concentrations of phosphate and UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are sufficiently high, minerals such as [[autunite]] (Ca(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•10-12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) or polycrystalline HUO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may form thus reducing the mobility of UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Compared to the direct addition of inorganic phosphate to contaminated groundwater, biomineralization has the advantage that the ligands produced by microbes will target uranium compounds more specifically rather than react actively with all aqueous metals. Stimulating bacterial phosphatase activity to liberate phosphate under controlled conditions limits the rate of bacterial hydrolysis of organophosphate and the release of phosphate to the system, thus avoiding clogging of the injection location with metal phosphate minerals.&lt;ref name=Newsome2014/&gt; The high concentration of ligands near the cell surface also provides nucleation foci for precipitation, which leads to higher efficiency than chemical precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lloyd, J.

The '''[[Cantilever]] method''' is an approximate method for calculating [[shear force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moments]] developed in [[beam (structure)|beam]]s and [[column]]s of a [[structural system|frame]] or [[structure]] due to lateral loads. The applied lateral loads typically include [[wind]] loads and earthquake loads, which must be taken into consideration while designing buildings. The assumptions used in this method are that the points of [[contraflexure]] (or points of inflection of the moment diagram) in both the vertical and horizontal members are located at the midpoint of the member, and that the direct [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]es in the columns are proportional to their distances from the centroidal [[axis (mathematics)|axis]] of the frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Theory_of_Structures.html?id=7wMkywAACAAJ | title=Theory of Structures | author=S. Ramamrutham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frame is analysed in step-wise (iterative) fashion, and the results can then be described by force [[diagram]]s drawn up at the end of the process. The method is quite versatile and can be used to analyse frames of any number of [[storey]]s or floors.

The position of the centroidal axis (the [[center of gravity]] line for the frame) is determined by using the areas of the end columns and interior columns. The cantilever method is considered as one of the two primary approximate methods (the other being the [[portal method]]) for indeterminate structural analysis of frames for lateral loads. Its use is recommended for frames that are taller than they are wide, and therefore behave similar to a beam cantilevered up from the ground.

'''''The Chamber Music Journal''''' is a [[periodical]] devoted exclusively to non-standard, rare or unknown chamber music of merit. (i.e., not Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms etc.) Between 1990 and 2010, it was published in hardcopy and available by subscription only. Since 2011, it has been exclusively published online. All issues, past and current, are available at no cost. It is under the general editorship of R.H.R. Silvertrust.

The Chamber Music Journal is considered one of the leading chamber music reference sources in English. It features articles with hard-to-find information that often has been published nowhere else, an example being a 13-part series on the 36 string quartets of the important 19th-century French composer [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]]. The chamber music of [[Borodin]], [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], the piano trios of [[Richard Strauss]], the chamber music of the [[Terezin Composers]], [[Joseph Rheinberger]], [[Eric Zeisl]],  [[Max Bruch]], [[Willem Pijper]], [[Zdenek Fibich]], [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], [[Wilhelm Stenhammar]] are among the subjects which appeared in past issues.

Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17 |quote=In ''The Origin'', Darwin provided an alternative hypothesis for the development, diversification, and design of life.

However, many favoured [[The eclipse of Darwinism|competing explanations]] and it was not until the emergence of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b3847&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=178–179, 338, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the [[life sciences]], explaining the [[biodiversity|diversity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html The Complete Works of Darwin Online&amp;nbsp;– Biography.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165048/http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html |date=7 January 2007 }} ''darwin-online.org.uk''.

It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world...It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling." {{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection |editor=Carroll, Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario|isbn= 1-55111-337-6|page=15 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]; instead, he helped to investigate [[marine invertebrates]]. Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]]) encouraged his passion for [[natural science]].&lt;ref name=whowas&gt;{{Harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/WhoWas.html About Charles Darwin]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|five-year voyage]] on {{HMS|Beagle}} established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarian]] ideas, and publication of his [[The Voyage of the Beagle|journal of the voyage]] made him famous as a popular author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 210, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=184, 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|both of their theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beddall | first1 = B.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's education|Darwin-Wedgwood family}}
Charles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|The Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Desmond|first=Adrian J.|title=Charles Darwin|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=13 September 2002|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title= The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author= John H. Wahlert|date= 11 June 2001|work= Darwin and Darwinism|publisher= [[Baruch College]]|accessdate= 26 November 2008|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/68brqWXRx?url=http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/naturalscience/biology/darwin/|archivedate= 22 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier [[Robert Darwin]] and [[Susannah Darwin]] (''née'' Wedgwood). He was the grandson of two prominent [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]: [[Erasmus Darwin]] on his father's side, and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] on his mother's side.

[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of seated boy smiling and looking at the viewer. He has straight mid-brown hair, and wears dark clothes with a large frilly white collar. In his lap he holds a pot of flowering plants| Painting of seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816.]]
Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in November 1809 in the Anglican [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]], but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] attending the nearby Anglican [[Shrewsbury School]] as a [[boarding school|boarder]].&lt;ref name=skool&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 12–15}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=21 21–25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned [[taxidermy]] in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave who had accompanied [[Charles Waterton]] in the South American [[rainforest]].&lt;ref name=eddy&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=48 47–51]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=18–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Darwin's second year at the university he joined the [[Plinian Society]], a student [[natural history|natural-history]] group featuring lively debates in which [[radicalism (historical)#Popular agitation|radical democratic]] students with [[materialism|materialistic]] views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=31–34}} He assisted [[Robert Edmond Grant]]'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of [[marine invertebrates]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]]. One day, Grant praised [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was rather bored by [[Robert Jameson]]'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between [[Neptunism]] and [[Plutonism]]. He learned the [[alpha taxonomy|classification]] of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the [[Royal Museum|University Museum]], one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country [[parson]]. As Darwin was unqualified for the ''[[Tripos]]'', he joined the ''ordinary'' degree course in January 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47–48, 89–91}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[shooting sports|shooting]] to studying. His cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] introduced him to the popular craze for [[beetle]] collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in [[James Francis Stephens]]' ''Illustrations of British entomology''. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] and met other leading [[parson-naturalist]]s who saw scientific work as religious [[natural theology]], becoming known to these [[University don|dons]] as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''&lt;ref name=dar57&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 73–79}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=59 57–67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ''ordinary'' degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (first published in 1802), which made an [[teleological argument|argument for divine design in nature]], explaining [[adaptation]] as God acting through [[Physical law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[John Herschel]]'s new book, ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'' (1831), which described the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] as understanding such laws through [[inductive reasoning]] based on observation, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'' of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit [[Tenerife]] with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the [[tropics]]. In preparation, he joined [[Adam Sedgwick]]'s [[geology]] course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping [[strata]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=69 67–68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=128–129, 133–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey voyage on HMS ''Beagle''===
{{details|Second voyage of HMS Beagle}}
[[File:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|alt=Route from Plymouth, England, south to Cape Verde then southwest across the Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, south to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, the Falkland Islands, round the tip of South America then north to Valparaiso and Callao.

After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a week with student friends at [[Barmouth]], then returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) [[natural history|naturalist]] for a self-funded [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] place on {{HMS|Beagle}} with captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], emphasising that this was a position for a [[gentleman]] rather than "a mere collector". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 105&amp;nbsp;– Henslow, J.

After delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS ''Beagle'' [[hydrography|surveyed and charted]] coasts.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name=kix&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=12 ix–xi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|his journal]] for his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting [[marine invertebrates]], but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.&lt;ref name=fnGal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself'|author=Gordon Chancellor|author2=[[Randal Keynes]]|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Darwin Online]]|accessdate=16 September 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qybOGZ?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with [[plankton]] collected in a calm spell.&lt;ref name=kix /&gt;&lt;ref name=plankton&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=53 21–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]] in [[Cape Verde]], Darwin found that a white band high in the [[volcanic rock]] cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', which set out [[uniformitarian]] concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,{{Ref label|B|II|none}} and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=183–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When they reached [[Brazil]], Darwin was delighted by the [[Bahia coastal forests|tropical forest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=73 41–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but detested the sight of [[slavery]], and disputed this issue with Fitzroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=75 73–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey continued to the south in [[Patagonia]]. They stopped at [[Bahía Blanca]], and in cliffs near [[Punta Alta]] Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct [[mammal]]s beside modern seashells, indicating recent [[extinction]] with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known ''[[Megatherium]]'' by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be like a giant version of the armour on local [[armadillo]]s. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 223–235}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 7]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=138 206–209]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On rides with [[gaucho]]s into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and [[anthropology|anthropological]] insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] had separate but overlapping territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 189–192, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as [[raised beach]]es showing a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 131, 159}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=16 174–179]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HurrahChiloe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook|accessdate=24 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzBb03?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Fuegians on board had been seized during the [[HMS Beagle#First voyage|first ''Beagle'' voyage]], then during a year in England were educated as missionaries. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at [[Tierra del Fuego]] he met "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205–208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with [[Monogenism|a shared origin]] and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 243–244, 248–250, 382–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named [[Jemmy Button]] lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=258 226–227]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin experienced [[1835 Concepción earthquake|an earthquake in Chile]] and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including [[mussel]]-beds stranded above high tide. High in the [[Andes]] he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach.

On the geologically new [[Galápagos Islands]], Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found [[mockingbird]]s allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of [[tortoise]] shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.&lt;ref name=k356&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=388 356–357]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulloway|1982|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the [[marsupial]] [[Potoridae|rat-kangaroo]] and the [[platypus]] seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.&lt;ref name=Crows&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|title=Darwin Online: Coccatoos &amp; Crows: An introduction to the Sydney Notebook|accessdate=2 January 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114015611/http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] "good-humoured &amp; pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=430 398–399].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cape Town]], Darwin and FitzRoy met [[John Herschel]], who had recently written to Lyell praising his [[uniformitarianism]] as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=Rascals&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the [[Falkland Islands wolf|Falkland Islands fox]] were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine".&lt;ref name=xix&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=22 xix–xx]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16 p. 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory===

When the ship reached [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in December 1835 [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_LettersOnGeology.html editorial introduction]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to [[Cambridge]] to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded [[gentleman scientist]], and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]] eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist [[Richard Owen]], who had the facilities of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct [[ground sloth]]s as well as the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a near complete skeleton of the unknown ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' and a [[hippopotamus]]-sized [[rodent]]-like skull named ''[[Toxodon]]'' resembling a giant [[capybara]]. The armour fragments were actually from ''[[Glyptodon]]'', a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=26 16], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=83 73], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=116 106]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206 /&gt; These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 201–205}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=345–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]. The ornithologist [[John Gould]] soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]], "[[Grosbeak|gros-beaks]]" and [[finch]]es, were, in fact, twelve [[Darwin's finches|separate species of finches]]. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 207–210}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and [[expert]]s such as [[Charles Babbage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-346.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 346&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin stayed with his [[freethought|freethinking]] brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]], part of this [[British Whig Party|Whig]] circle and a close friend of the writer [[Harriet Martineau]], who promoted [[Malthusianism]] underlying the controversial Whig [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law reforms]] to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] implications of [[transmutation of species]], promoted by [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]] and younger surgeons influenced by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]]. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=201, 212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in [[John Herschel]]'s letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a [[Physical law|natural cause]] of the origin of new species.&lt;ref name=Rascals /&gt;

Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos [[mockingbird]]s from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "[[wren]]" was also [[Warbler-finch|in the finch group]]. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=9, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[rhea (bird)|rheas]] were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=360}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1643&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|title=Darwin, C.

By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his ''Red Notebook'' on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange ''[[Macrauchenia]]'', which resembled a giant [[guanaco]]. His thoughts on lifespan, [[asexual reproduction]] and [[sexual reproduction]] developed in his "B" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt &amp; alter the race to ''changing'' world" explaining the [[Galápagos tortoise]]s, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a [[genealogy|genealogical]] branching of a single [[tree of life (science)|evolutionary tree]], in which "It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] progressing to higher forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1980|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1583e&amp;pageseq=9 7–10]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=44}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1837|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;pageseq=1 1–13, 26, 36, 74]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=229–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overwork, illness, and marriage===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's health}}
While developing this intensive study of [[transmutation of species|transmutation]], Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his ''Journal'', he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]'', a sum equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1000|1837|r=-3}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}.{{inflation-fn|UK}} He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Victorian era]] began, Darwin pressed on with writing his ''Journal'', and in August 1837 began correcting [[Galley proof|printer's proofs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=21 xix]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's health suffered under the pressure. On 20 September he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah]] pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under [[loam]] and suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, inspiring "a new &amp; important theory" on their role in [[pedogenesis|soil formation]], which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–234}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 404&amp;nbsp;– Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838|accessdate=23 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629192234/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|archivedate=29 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Whewell]] pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the grind of writing and editing the ''Beagle'' reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fanciers]].&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244, 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an [[orangutan]] in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of woman aged about 30, with dark hair in centre parting straight on top, then falling in curls on each side. She smiles pleasantly and is wearing an open necked blouse with a large shawl pulled over her arms|Darwin chose to marry his cousin, [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]].]]
The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe [[boil]]s, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of [[Charles Darwin's illness|Darwin's illness]] remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 252, 476, 531}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=119 115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland. He visited [[Glen Roy]] in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine [[raised beach]]es, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a [[proglacial lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 254}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=377–378}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=86 84]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ''"Marry"'' and ''"Not Marry"''. Advantages included "constant companion and a friend in old age&amp;nbsp;... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=238 232–233]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=256–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malthus and natural selection====
Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', and on 28 September 1838 he noted its assertion that human "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a [[geometric progression]] so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, &amp; adapt it to changes", so that "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name="134e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e–135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of new species.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264–265}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385–388}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=39 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''

{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work..."&lt;ref name="autobio 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=124 120]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By mid December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in [[selective breeding]], and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that "every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 75 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628082830/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking this comparison "a beautiful part of my theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 71|accessdate=17 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628080656/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|archivedate=28 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later called his theory [[natural selection]], an analogy with what he termed the [[artificial selection]] of selective breeding.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;

On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Belief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Belief: historical essay|accessdate=25 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225124103/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/ |archivedate=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." He found what they called "Macaw Cottage" (because of its gaudy interiors) in [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], then moved his "museum" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1839|elected a Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref name=frs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FitzRoy's ''Narrative'' was published in May 1839, Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and Remarks]]'' was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39003&amp;pageno=32 p. 32.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to [[Charles Lyell]], who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]'' on his theory of [[atoll]] formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first "pencil sketch" of his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=292–293}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1556&amp;pageseq=18 xvi–xvii]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=118 114]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], writing with melodramatic humour "it is like confessing a murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=7 183–184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-729.html#back-mark-729.f6|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 729&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in [[marine invertebrates]], dating back to his student days with [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]], by dissecting and classifying the [[barnacle]]s he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of [[creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 320–323, 339–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. [[James Manby Gully|James Gully]]'s [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] spa and was surprised to find some benefit from [[hydrotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1236.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 1236&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

In eight years of work on [[barnacle]]s (Cirripedia), Darwin's theory helped him to find "[[homology (biology)|homologies]]" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some [[genus|genera]] he found minute males [[parasitism|parasitic]] on [[hermaphrodite]]s, showing an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].&lt;ref name=barlowbio117&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=121 117–118]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, it earned him the [[Royal Society]]'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a [[biology|biologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 he became a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London]], gaining postal access to its library.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2007|pp=107, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of the theory of natural selection===

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and [[seed]]s could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his "note on Man". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; "Theory applied to Races of Man", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412–441, 457–458, 462–463}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283–284, 290–292, 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, P. (2011).

His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of [[scarlet fever]], and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 1 July of ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]''. On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 466–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=40–42, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor [[Samuel Haughton]] of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=126 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 374–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 p 459]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the case for [[common descent]], he included evidence of [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] between humans and other mammals.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2008}}{{Ref label|C|III|none}} Having outlined [[sexual selection]], he hinted that it could explain differences between [[Race (human categorization)|human races]].&lt;ref name=SS_man&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=217&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 199]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | p=199}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|1}} He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=506 488]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | pp=199, 488}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|2}} His theory is simply stated in the introduction:
{{quotation|As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be ''naturally selected''. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 p 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of the book he concluded that:
{{quotation|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508 p 492]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last word was the only variant of "evolved" in the first five editions of the book. "[[Evolutionism]]" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with [[Prenatal development (biology)|embryological development]], and Darwin first used the word [[evolution]] in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=59}}, {{harvnb|Freeman|1977|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=80&amp;itemID=A1&amp;viewtype=text 79–80]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Reaction to On the Origin of Species}}
The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|corresponded on it]] with colleagues worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=103–104, 379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|3}} but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radick|2013|pp=174–175}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|Kettlewell|1965|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first review asked, "If a monkey has become a man–what may not a man become?" and said it should be left to theologians as it was too dangerous for ordinary readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=87}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Leifchild|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at [[Richard Owen]], leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=477–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. [[Patrick Matthew]] drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=158, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]]'s response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] and [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] dismissed the ideas, but [[liberal Christianity|liberal clergymen]] interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity".&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/|title=Darwin and design: historical essay|year=2007|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project|accessdate=17 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615191012/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |archivedate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted [[clergy|clerical]] attention from Darwin, with its ideas including [[higher criticism]] attacked by church authorities as [[heresy]]. In it, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that [[miracle]]s broke God's laws, so belief in them was [[atheism|atheistic]], and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume &amp;#91;supporting&amp;#93; the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 487–488, 500}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asa Gray]] discussed [[teleology]] with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on [[theistic evolution]], ''Natural Selection is not inconsistent with [[natural theology]]''.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{Harvnb|Miles|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous confrontation was at the public [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] during a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], where the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]], though not opposed to [[transmutation of species]], argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] argued strongly for Darwin, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]]'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education,&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt; aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate [[order (biology)|biological order]] from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "[[Great Hippocampus Question]]", and discredited Owen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darwinism]] became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]]'s ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' by [[Henry Walter Bates]] provided empirical evidence of natural selection.&lt;ref name=B217&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=217–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], awarded on 3 November 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4652.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 4652&amp;nbsp;– Falconer, Hugh to Darwin, C.

The ''Origin of Species'' was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=507–508}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=128–129, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time{{Ref label|E|V|none}} and became a key fixture of popular culture.{{Ref label|F|VI|none}} Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way.

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued. Having published ''On the Origin of Species'' as an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book". He covered [[human evolution|human descent]] from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

Enquiries about insect [[pollination]] led in 1861 to novel studies of wild [[orchid]]s, showing adaptation of their flowers to [[Pollination syndrome|attract specific moths]] to each species and ensure [[heterosis|cross fertilisation]]. In 1862 ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of [[vine|climbing plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiring visitors included [[Ernst Haeckel]], a zealous proponent of ''Darwinismus'' incorporating [[Lamarckism]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605110511/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Cambridge University Press.

Darwin's book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868) was the first part of his planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of [[pangenesis]] attempting to explain [[heredity]]. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freeman|1977|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A1&amp;pageseq=123 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] had already popularised human prehistory, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] had shown that anatomically humans are apes.&lt;ref name=B217 /&gt; With ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'' published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented [[sexual selection]] to explain impractical animal features such as the [[peacock]]'s plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural [[Race (human categorization)|racial classification]], while emphasising that humans are all one species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=402 385–405]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=339–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the [[evolutionary psychology|evolution of human psychology]] and its continuity with the [[ethology|behaviour of animals]]. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=359–369}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=145 133]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system–with all these exalted powers–Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=422 405]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Orchids, ''[[Insectivorous Plants (book)|Insectivorous Plants]], [[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'', different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including [[Grant Allen]] and [[H. G. Wells]], and [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10359900&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0007087416000352 helped transform plant science] in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

==Legacy==
[[File:Charles Robert Darwin by John Collier.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three-quarter portrait of a senior Darwin dressed in black before a black background. His face and six-inch white beard are dramatically lit from the side. His eyes are shaded by his brows and look directly and thoughtfully at the viewer.|In 1881 Darwin was an eminent figure, still working on his contributions to evolutionary thought that had an enormous effect on many fields of science. Portrait by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]].]]
By the time of his death, Darwin had convinced most scientists that [[evolution]] as [[common descent|descent with modification]] was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in [[Cambridge]] to [[Darwin Day|commemorate his centenary]] and the fiftieth anniversary of ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name=b222&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=222–225}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=449 421]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. [[Ronald Fisher]], an English [[statistics|statistician]], finally united [[Mendelian genetics]] with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/154/4/1419.full The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection An introduction to the book by [[A.

Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], which set the frame of reference for modern debates and refinements of the theory.&lt;ref name=b3847 /&gt;

During Darwin's lifetime, many geographical features were given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the [[Beagle Channel]] was named ''[[Darwin Sound]]'' by [[Robert FitzRoy]] after Darwin's prompt action, along with two or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing [[glacier]] caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=267 216–8]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nearby [[Mount Darwin (Andes)|Mount Darwin]] in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/time_04.html Darwin's Timeline]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]'' was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend [[John Lort Stokes]] sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain [[John Clements Wickham|Wickham]] named ''[[Port Darwin]]'': a nearby settlement was renamed [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=NTDoPaI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918153343/http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archivedate=18 September 2006|title=Territory origins| accessdate=15 December 2006|publisher=Northern Territory Department of Planning and Infrastructure, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annie Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length studio photo of seated girl about nine years old, looking slightly plump and rather solemn, in a striped dress, holding a basket of flowers on her lap.|In 1851 Darwin was devastated when his daughter [[Anne Darwin|Annie]] died. By then his faith in Christianity had dwindled, and he had stopped going to church.&lt;ref name=jvw41&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Darwin's family tradition was [[nonconformist]] [[Unitarianism]], while his father and grandfather were [[freethought|freethinkers]], and his [[baptism]] and [[boarding school]] were [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=skool /&gt; When going to Cambridge to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman, he did not doubt the [[Biblical inerrancy|literal truth]] of the Bible.&lt;ref name=dar57 /&gt; He learned [[John Herschel]]'s science which, like [[William Paley]]'s [[natural theology]], sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw [[adaptation]] of species as [[teleological argument|evidence of design]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=db /&gt; On board HMS ''Beagle'', Darwin was quite [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and would quote the Bible as an authority on [[morality]].&lt;ref name=biorelig&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=87 85–96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution,&lt;ref name=k356 /&gt; and suggested that the very similar [[antlion]]s found in Australia and England evidence of a divine hand.&lt;ref name=Crows /&gt;

By his return, he was [[Historical criticism|critical of the Bible as history]], and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid.&lt;ref name=biorelig /&gt; In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the [[transmutation of species]], he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning.&lt;ref name=Belief /&gt; The [[theodicy]] of Paley and [[Thomas Malthus]] vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the [[ichneumon wasp]] paralysing [[caterpillar]]s as live food for its eggs.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt; He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and ''On the Origin of Species'' reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a [[tribe|tribal]] survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of [[deism|God as an ultimate lawgiver]]. He was increasingly troubled by the [[problem of evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=4–5, 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin remained close friends with the [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of Downe, [[John Brodie Innes]], and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Darwin and the church: historical essay |accessdate=26 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128133709/https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |archivedate=28 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.&lt;ref name=jvw41 /&gt; He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html Letter 12041] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107174817/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html |date=7 November 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

The "[[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope Story]]", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2005}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human society===
Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported [[Reform Act 1832|electoral reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation of slaves]]. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], who he long recalled as "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196–198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century,&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|2008|pp=408–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|G|VII|none}} Darwins interaction with [[Yaghan]]s (Fuegians) such as [[Jemmy Button]] during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle]] had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. At his arrival to [[Tierra del Fuego]] he made a colorful description of "[[Fuegian]] savages".&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt; This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rozzi |first1=Ricardo|author-link=Ricardo Rozzi |date=2018 |title=Transformaciones del pensamiento de Darwin en cabo de hornos: Un legado para la ciencia y la etica ambiental|trans-title=Transformations of Darwin’s thought in cape horn: A legacy for science and environmental ethics |url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-22442018000100267&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es|language=Spanish |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages= |doi=10.4067/S0718-22442018000100267 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While interested in Yaghan culture Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] detailing 32-thousand words.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt;

He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony|last=Barta|title=Mr Darwin's shooters: on natural selection and the naturalizing of genocide|url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a713721865&amp;fulltext=713240928|work=Patterns of Prejudice, Volume 39, Issue 2 |publisher=Routledge |pages=116–137 |doi=10.1080/00313220500106170 |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] in her 1875 book ''[[The Sexes Throughout Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Vandermassen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vandermassen, Griet |title=Sexual Selection: A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial |url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |year=2004 |volume=11 |issue=9 |doi=10.1177/1350506804039812 |accessdate=24 November 2009 |pages=11–13 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012141736/http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was intrigued by his [[Cousin#Additional terms|half-cousin]] [[Francis Galton]]'s argument, introduced in 1865, that [[Historiometry|statistical analysis]] of [[heredity]] showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556–557, 572, 598}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=180 167–173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=419 402–403]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=8 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102150434/http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Galton named this field of study "[[eugenics]]" in 1883.{{Ref label|H|VIII|1}}

==Evolutionary social movements==
[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|[[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|Caricature of Darwin]] from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'']]
{{Further|Darwinism|Eugenics|Social Darwinism}}
Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

[[Thomas Malthus]] had argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families, this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].&lt;ref name=wm&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "[[survival of the fittest]]" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[polygenism|polygenistic]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included "dependence of one being on another"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in "positive eugenics". During the "[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the "feebleminded" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilization]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}

The term "[[Social Darwinism]]" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Kotzin|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt;

==Works==
{{details|Charles Darwin bibliography}}

Darwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of [[coral atoll]]s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on [[barnacle]]s. While ''On the Origin of Species'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''The Descent of Man'' and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''{{small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Darwin was eminent as a [[naturalist]], geologist, [[biologist]], and author. After working as a physician's assistant and two years as a [[medical student]], he was educated as a clergyman; he was also trained in [[taxidermy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|Browne|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|II}}.''' {{Note label|B|II|none}} [[Robert FitzRoy]] was to become known after the voyage for [[biblical literalism]], but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in [[Patagonia]] recorded his opinion that the plains were [[raised beach]]es, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.{{Harv|Browne|1995|pp=186, 414}}

'''{{small|III}}.''' {{Note label|C|III|none}} In the section [[Morphology (biology)|"Morphology"]] of Chapter XIII of ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin commented on [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=452&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 434]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the concluding chapter: "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=497&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 479]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|IV}}.''' {{Note label|D|IV|1}}{{Note label|D|IV|2}}{{Note label|D|IV|3}}
In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' Darwin mentioned [[human evolution|human origins]] in his concluding remark that "In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;

In "Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory" he referred to [[sexual selection]]: "I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous."&lt;ref name=SS_man /&gt;

In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:
"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&amp;itemID=F944&amp;viewtype=text vi]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|V}}.''' {{Note label|E|V|none}} See, for example, WILLA volume 4, ''[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education]'' by Deborah M. De Simone: "Gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of "intellectual chaos" caused by Darwin's Origin of the Species. Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration."

'''{{small|VI}}.''' {{Note label|F|VI|none}} See, for example, the song "A lady fair of lineage high" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

'''{{small|VII}}.''' {{Note label|G|VII|none}} Darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from [[John Edmonstone]] in 1826.&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; Early in the ''Beagle'' voyage, Darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. {{Harv|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=76 74]}} He wrote home about "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." {{harv|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=264 246]}} Regarding [[Fuegians]], he "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like [[Jemmy Button]]: "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here."{{Harv|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205, 207–208]}}

In the ''Descent of Man'', he mentioned the similarity of Fuegians' and Edmonstone's minds to Europeans' when arguing against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=227 214], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 232]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of [[Patagonia]]n men, women, and children, "Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?"{{harv|Darwin|1845|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=115 102]}}

'''{{small|VIII}}.''' {{Note label|H|VIII|1}}{{Note label|H|VIII|2}} [[Genetics|Geneticists]] studied human heredity as [[Mendelian inheritance]], while [[eugenics]] movements sought to manage society, with a focus on social class in the United Kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical [[pseudoscience]]. A shift from voluntary arrangements to "negative" eugenics included [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws in the United States, copied by [[Nazi Germany]] as the basis for [[Nazi eugenics]] based on virulent racism and "[[racial hygiene]]".&lt;br /&gt;({{Cite news | url =http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/5-supp/text/thurtle.html| title =the creation of genetic identity| last = Thurtle| first =Phillip| date =17 December 1996| issue =Supplement: Cultural and Technological Incubations of Fascism| volume = 5| ref = harv| periodical =SEHR| accessdate =11 November 2008}}{{Cite news| url =http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/154/4/1419#The_Eclipse_of_Darwinism| title =The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''conservation and restoration of fur objects''' is the preservation and protection of objects made from or containing [[fur]].  These pieces can include personal items like fur clothing or objects of cultural heritage that are housed in [[museum]]s and [[collection (artwork)|collection]]s.  When dealing with the latter, a [[conservator-restorer]] often handles their care, whereas, for the public, professional [[wikt:furrier|furriers]] can be found in many neighborhoods.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

== Definition of Types of Fur Objects ==

=== Pelts ===
[[File:Puma fur skin.jpg|thumb|Puma Pelt|375x375px]]Pelts are defined as the skin of an animal that still has the hair or fur intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|title=Pelt|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelt|journal=The Free Dictionary|page=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelt|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals used for traditional fur objects alternate between a winter and summer [[Coat (animal)|coat]].  The winter coats of animals are normally more desirable because they are thicker and fuller than the summer coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_l/L101.pdf|title=How to Prepare Pelts|last=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences|first=|date=October 2012|website=How to Prepare Pelts|publisher=New Mexico State University|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pelts are removed from the animal in a process of [[skinning]] and fleshing that removes all the tissue from the skin and pelt.  The pelts are then [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] and [[Tanning (leather)|tanned]] to kill bacteria and create a stable material.  Pelts are traditionally used to create clothing and home accessories like rugs, they can be mounted to create trophies or taxidermy specimens, or they can be sold and kept as is.

==== Differences between hair and fur ====
The only difference between [[hair]] and [[fur]] is semantics.  Technically, both are made from [[keratin]], which is also the protein that makes up [[skin]], [[feather]]s, [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[Hoof|hooves]], [[claw]]s, and [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58251/whats-difference-between-hair-and-fur|title=What’s the Difference Between Hair and Fur?|website=Mental Floss|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;blockquote&gt;"The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles," says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of [[Mammalogy]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. "So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose. Whereas hair is not so dense. There's less of it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;This remains untrue however, because the human head has as the same "follicle density" as a mouse, but it just so happens to be genetically predisposed to stop at the head and not continue down the body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There are three types of hair: ground hair, guard hair, and [[whiskers]].  "Ground hair is used primarily as insulation and is soft, while guard hair is for protection from the elements and tends to be coarse."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Both ground hair and guard hair are classified as fur.  Because human hair acts as both, it can technically be called "fur".  In reality, the keratin fibers that are described variously as [[hair]], [[wool]], or [[fur]], depending on the animal type, are all referring to the same thing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation of leather : and related materials|last=Kite|first=Marion|last2=Thomson|first2=Roy|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2006|isbn=9780750648813|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Taxidermy section - Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology - DSC02419.JPG|thumb|Taxidermy Animals at the Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology]]

=== [[Taxidermy|Taxidermy Specimens]] ===
Taxidermy has been around since the times of the [[Ancient Egyptians]].  While more mummification than traditional taxidermy, the Egyptians still preserved animals in their form by removing the innards and drying the carcass with salts from the [[Nile]] to [[dehydrate]] and preserve.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/a-short-history-of-taxidermy/|title=taxidermy - A Short History of Taxidermy|website=www.ravishingbeasts.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest known pieces of modern taxidermy are from the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the development and perfection of taxidermic techniques were linked to Western Europe’s fascination with the natural world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Through the ages, taxidermy has progressed.  During the Victorian era, taxidermy became closer to what is seen in museums today.  There was a transition from using [[straw]], [[paper]], and other materials to create the mountings for the hides to using internal structures with rods and the actual animal skulls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Taxidermy is still used in museums and collections today.  Most notable is the work of [[Carl Akeley]], who modernized the idea of including taxidermied specimens in recreations of their natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/carl-akeley|title=Carl Akeley|last=admin|date=2011-11-29|website=The Field Museum|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Fur clothing|Clothing and Accessories]]  ===
Human beings have been wearing fur since the beginning of time.  There is evidence that [[Ötzi]], the Iceman, was wearing a pelt when he met his demise 5000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In classic antiquity, the ancient [[Egyptians]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] all used fur or pelts in clothing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In Western Europe, beginning in the 11th Century, luxury furs such as [[Stoat|ermine]], [[mink]], [[sable]], and [[chinchilla]] were reserved for the royalty, [[nobility]], high ranking [[clergy]], and the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashionintime.org/history-fur-fashion-introduction/|title=History of Fur in Fashion: Introduction|date=2011-12-04|website=History of Fashion|language=en-US|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fur and the access to it became a way of sublimating the lower classes in the 16th and 17th centuries and were strictly controlled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[North American fur trade]], during the 17th and 18th centuries, provided enough pelts of [[hare]], [[rabbit]], [[Sheep|lamb]], and [[Gray wolf|wolf]] to appeal to the crowd that could not afford the luxury furs, which remained to be only accessible to the elite.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  The royal families of Europe frequently use ermine to create robes and line their crowns.  However, before the 19th century, fur was used as accents, like linings, accessories, and for trimming gowns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Full fur jackets did not appear on the fashion scene until the mid-19th century as a display of wealth by the newly prosperous middle class.  [[Sealskin|Seal skin]] was one of the first furs to be used for a coat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Fashion went through waves of monkeys, mice, and cat fur dressing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The turn of the century focused on the exotic animals like [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[polar bear]] fur.  The [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]], stopped the exotic animal fur market and the later part of the 20th century focused once again on more accessible fur like rabbit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Today, fur is a very controversial issue with groups like [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] protesting the entire fur industry and designers, like Armani, have decided to go "[http://alive.armani.com/us/pages/politica-del-gruppo-armani-per-la-sostenibilita-e-responsabilita-sociale/fur-free-policy/ fur free]."

==== [[Modern art|Modern Art]] ====
There are several notable instances of pieces of Modern Art in museums and collections made from, in part, of fur.  The most famous is a piece of [[Surrealist Art]] made by [[Méret Oppenheim]] called ''[[Le Déjeuner en fourrure|Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' or ''Luncheon in Fur'', which is in the permanent collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] (see Notable Example below).  Inarguably, it is the most famous piece of art containing fur that is not a piece of furniture.  Oppenheim once wrote of the spirit of her piece, "fur combined with a teacup evokes such a surprising mix of messages and associations. The fur may remind viewers of wild animals and nature, while the teacup could suggest manners and civilization. With its pelt, the teacup becomes soft, rounded, and highly tactile.  It seems attractive to the touch, if not, on the other hand, to the taste: Imagine drinking from it, and the physical sensation of wet fur filling the mouth." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/meret-oppenheim-object-paris-1936|title=MoMA {{!}} Meret Oppenheim. Object. Paris, 1936|website=www.moma.org|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the years, she created other pieces that included fur or hide in some manner.  She became so synonymous with the medium, she was known as "the artist that works with fur;" a label which she refused to embrace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/91443/talking-about-meret-oppenheim-an-interview-with-lisa-wenger/|title=Talking about Meret Oppenheim: An Interview with Lisa Wenger|date=2013-12-06|website=Hyperallergic|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was nonetheless known for.

Furniture is another highly collected area of Modern Art that features fur.  Artist, [[Alvar Aalto]] is famous for representing [[Finland]] in the Modern [[Scandinavian design]].  His chair, Armchair 400 made with reindeer fur is a great example of this.  The MFA in Boston houses another famous [http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/chairchair-35134 chair] with fur made by [[Richard Artschwager]].

==== [[Contemporary art|Contemporary Art]] ====
Contemporary artists are starting to embrace the use of fur as a medium as well.  In 2014, an opera singer and artist named Mateo Blanco, gained notoriety for creating celebrity portraits out of dog fur, which are housed at the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Orlando Odditorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ripleys.com/blog/mateo-blanco-dog-fur/|title=Fluffy Portraits Made with Dog Hair|date=2014-12-10|website=Ripley's Believe It or Not!|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   And, in 2015, [[Danny Rozin]] debuted a piece entitled "[https://vimeo.com/128375543 PomPom Mirror]" as part of a new artist's exhibition at [[Bitforms gallery|bitforms]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/05/an-interactive-fur-mirror-by-daniel-rozin/|title=An Interactive 'Fur' Mirror by Daniel Rozin|date=2015-05-26|website=Colossal|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece uses faux fur and an [[Xbox]] [[kinect]] system to make the fur balls move and create a mirror effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitforms.com/rozin-2015/pompom-mirror|title=bitforms gallery  » PomPom Mirror|website=www.bitforms.com|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leather.jpg|thumb|Leather]]

=== [[Leather]] ===
Leather is the "skin of an animal, with the hair removed, prepared for use by tanning or a similar process designed to preserve it against decay and make it pliable or supple when dry".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/leather|title=the definition of leather|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While technically not fur, leather is a byproduct and the skin on the reverse side of pelts suffer the same kind of damage as leather products which include [[acid hydrolysis]], [[Redox|oxidation]], metals and salts from the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] process, heat, and [[humidity]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These issues also affect fur objects.

==== Dealing with Leather Objects ====
While closely related, the [[Conservation and restoration of leather objects|Conservation and Restoration of Leather Objects]] is a separate specialty.

== Causes of Deterioration of Fur Objects ==
[[File:Anthrenus flavipes larvae adult wool.jpg|thumb|Carpet beetles eating wool]]

=== Insects  ===
"Furs are among the most exquisite delicacies for critters...&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;"  "Fiber-feeding insects need the vitamins and amino acids found in their scavenger diet.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;"  "Clean fur lacks these supplements and must be contaminated with a certain amount of soilage like perspiration, body oils, airborne micro-organisms before insects become and issue.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The only "clean" fur is one that has been sterilized through conservation efforts.  The most common insects that infest fur objects are [[moth]]s and [[Dermestidae|carpet beetles]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Most pests will lay eggs on or inside the object and the larvae will actually cause the most damage as they grow to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Infestation is evidenced by small piles of dust, the [[frass]] and [[Moulting|casts]] of the insects in shedding in their growth cycle.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Evidence of previous infestations on fur objects include the bodies of dead insects and their [[Moulting|casings]] on the surface of the object and "concave scars" with a "scalloped" appearance from their round [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Rodents and other small mammals may also be attracted to fur objects as a food source.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  This kind of infestation would be visible in droppings and larger areas of damage.

=== Temperature and Humidity ===
Temperature is vital for the long-term care of fur objects.  Store rooms should be kept at a relative humidity level of between 45% and 55%, with fluctuations to be expected, but 65% would critical for mold growth,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservation.myspecies.info/node/32|title=standards in the care of skins and taxidermy collections {{!}} Conservation and Collections Care|website=conservation.myspecies.info|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which skin items are highly susceptible to.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  This may require the use of a humidifier or dehumidifier depending on the institution.  Temperature should be kept as stable as possible between 10&amp;nbsp;°C and 22&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  "Warm environments can cause the release of residual fats in skins resulting in hair loss.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;"  Excessive heat causes shrinkage in the fibers, it makes the skin brittle and more prone to tears.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Whereas excess moisture leads to swelling, distortion, putrefaction (if not properly cured) and mold growth.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The combination of both cause the collagen to break down and threaten the physical integrity of the piece.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Some insecticides used as pest prevention like, [[Camphor]], [[Naphthalene|napthalene]], and [[para-dichlorobenzene]] (PDB) can be harmful to some colors if used with dyed fur objects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In general, hair fibers are "difficult to destroy" because keratin is such a strong fiber.  Strong acids will not break down the fiber and strong bases "will do no more than soften or possibly bleach" the fur.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, if a fur object is subjected to that kind of treatment, the hair will become brittle and break off.

=== Improper Storage ===
If fur objects have not been protected from the environment around them then they are susceptible to dirt and dust.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Motes settle between the fibers and create a dirty appearance.  Light exposure is also an issue.  Exposure to ultraviolet light in daylight and artificial light causes pigments in specimens to fade.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icon.org.uk/what-is-conservation/caring-your-collection|title=Caring for your collection {{!}} Icon|website=icon.org.uk|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Light should be kept at between 50 - 100 lux for display and no light in storage.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;      
[[File:Wild cat fur coat, front.jpg|thumb|259x259px|Normal wear and tear]]

=== Handling ===
Fur objects are made from organic materials which are soilable.  For clothing and accessories, the objects are subjected to the wear and tear of everyday use may include, soiling and staining made by food, make-up, sweat, odor, or skin grease that can leave permanent marks on the fur altering both its color and texture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Make-up and oils can cause the hairs to stick together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/community/chi-ugc-article-why-a-fur-coat-needs-cleaning-and-storage-2016-03-30-story.html|title=Why a Fur Coat needs Cleaning and Storage|last=UGC|first=Chicago Tribune|website=Daily Southtown|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wearing can also result in physical damage to the object through overuse.  Friction at the joints, like the armpits, elbows, and collar of a coat can cause bald areas.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Stitching unraveling and rips are also common issues that arise from wearing a fur object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves should be worn when handling fur objects to prevent and transfer.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Taxidermy Issues ===
Older specimens were filled with straw and paper to recreate the musculature of the animals.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/13067/11-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-taxidermy|title=11 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Taxidermy|website=Mental Floss|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the physicality of the animal was changed in mounting, the pelt would have become stretched or distorted to fit the new shape.  A prime example of this was a rhinoceros that belonged to Louis XIV and Louis XV.  "Its skin was varnished and stretched over a frame of wooden hoops.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;"  The skin is now on display at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum national d’Histoire naturelle]] in Paris, but is it unlikely it could be remounted.

== Cleaning ==
The care and cleaning of fur objects should always be undertaken by a trained [[Collection manager|collections manager]] or [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]].

=== Dry Cleaning ===

==== Brushing and Vacuuming ====
[[File:Filbert brush.jpg|thumb|205x205px|Natural hair brush]]
Provided there is no shedding issue, brushing is the first step in cleaning fur objects.  Light brushing, using a paintbrush,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://squirrel.adobeconnect.com/_a751959191/p18c8t9f0v5/?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal|title=HP C2C Seminar_30|website=squirrel.adobeconnect.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help dislodge any particulate soiling, surface dust, and insect frass.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Stiffer natural brushes can be used if the dirt is stubborn but metal brushes should never be used.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  A variable speed vacuum with brushes and other attachments works on most surface dirt as well as removing the remnants of an insect infestation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The vacuum should be set to low and a muslin or net should be placed over the nozzle to protect the object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  HEPA filters should be used if arsenic preservation is suspected.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Sponging ====
Greasy dirt can be removed with a vulcanized rubber&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; sponge known as "soot sponges," because they are also great at removing smoke and soot, which are often the residue of museums or collections that were heated with coal heat in the past.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Cosmetic sponges can also be in conjunction with the vacuum to remove even more surface dirt.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Wet Cleaning ===
Wet cleaning is incredibly harmful to protein materials.  Processes like dry-cleaning [[solvent]]s, [[oil]], [[wax]]es, lubricants, and [[saddle soap]]s actually can remove the natural protective oils causing further drying that can lead to [[embrittlement]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|last=Bachmann|first=Konstanze|publisher=Smithsonian Books|year=1992|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When solvents are absolutely necessary, they should be spot tested before overall use to ensure there is no harmful dyeing or bleaching.  If it was determined safe, the solvent should be applied with a swab going in the direction of the fur.  If possible, absorbent paper should be placed under the strands being treated to separate them from unnecessarily getting solvent on the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Fur objects can often become stiff or distorted, but steaming or spraying water directly on the object can cause damage.  The solution for misshapen objects is increased humidity as a restorative tool.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Freezing ===
The only sure way of removing pest infestation on fur objects is through freezing.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Objects should be placed inside a clear polyester bag, the excess air should be removed and it should be heat sealed.  An alternative is a polyethylene bag with parcel tape.  The bag can be placed in a domestic freezer for at least 14 days at a temperature of -18&amp;nbsp;°C or for 72 hours at -30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  It is important to note that if the atmosphere is maintained at a high humidity point in very low temperatures, the moisture will form frost on the object and with too little humidity, the object will absorb what little moisture there is and dry out, so it is vital to maintain the proper environment even in freezing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Cold storage, at 10&amp;nbsp;°C is recommended at all times to inhibit insect activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pool|first=Marilen|date=Spring 1997|title=Preliminary Analysis of the Effects of Cold Storage on Fur Garments and Mammal Skins|url=http://www.spnhc.org/media/assets/cofo_1997_V13_N1_new.pdf|journal=Collection Forum|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repair and Restoration ==
Conservation efforts must take into account the properties of both the fur and skin.  The objects have already been through the stresses of "fur-skin processing,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which can weaken the object.  Physical damage that happens during the skin processing may only become evident with the passage of time.  If the skin was pared too deeply during fleshing, the result would be eventual hair loss.  It will also become evident, over time, if the fur was removed from the animal too early in the season.  This means that the bulbs of the hair had not fully completed the growth process and the hair will fall out, leaving a sparse pelt.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While, "[m]ost dry animal fiber can be extended or stretched up to 30 percent of its length before break occurs,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/analyzingfurdama541penc|title=Analyzing fur damage with a microscope|last=Pence|first=Roy J. (Roy James)|date=1966-01-01|publisher=[Berkeley, Calif.] : Division of Agricultural Sciences, University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;" it is unclear the object has been through before entering the collection.

=== Filling/Patching and Dyeing ===
Generally, fur objects are fragile and, for a variety of reasons, they can experience loss.  The process of filling is a common practice.  Filling is a standard procedure in which synthetic fur, most commonly made of white [[nylon]] with a "four-way spandex stretch backing.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-010.html|title=SYNTHETIC FILL MATERIALS FOR SKIN, LEATHER, AND FURS|last=Nieuwenhuizen|first=Linda|date=1998-01-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  There are three standard fur lengths that include short (2.5–5.0&amp;nbsp;cm); medium (8.0–10.0&amp;nbsp;cm); and long (10.0–15.0&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The use of white synthetic fur allows for tinting or dying before application.  It is recommended that nylon furs "can be dyed with acid or premetalized dyes according to the manufacturer's directions at pH 5.5 and pH 7 or slightly above, respectively. The dyed fabric must be subjected to an after-scour at 140°F.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;"

The first step in the physical filling is creating a backing that is applied to bridge the area of loss and the fill material.  The "most commonly used materials for backings are inert fabrics coupled with either resins, starches, or cellulose ethers with evaporative solvents, or resins or systems requiring the use of a heat-seal process.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;"  The next step is creating a template of the area of loss.  That template is then transferred to the fur and cut to size.  The patch should be applied to the object with "Acryloid F-10 in acetone" by applying the adhesive directly to a substrate inserted in the hole and placed the edged of the fill directly adjacent sides of the existing fur.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The full should then be cut and textured to match the surrounding fur.  As with all conservation efforts, it should be fully documented and reversible.

Of course, real fur can also be used to patch.  Like fur is often available for common repairs like [[rabbit]] and [[fox]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Preventative Care, Maintenance, and Storage ==
"Of all the items made from natural materials, those derived from animal skins are some of the most versatile and durable found in collections.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-skinandskinProducts_000.pdf|title=Skin and Skin Products (Leather)|last=Minnesota Historical Society|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  However, all fur is subject to damage from light and temperature, therefore care should be taken to mitigate their effects.  Also, an [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management system]] must be employed because organic materials are especially susceptible to pests.

=== Pelts ===
Skin garments and hides should be stored on flat mounts which supports the item when it is in storage and facilitates movement of the object without undue flexing and handling.  If the object needs to be stuffed to maintain shape, unbuffered [[Acid-free paper|acid-free tissue]] should be used.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Taxidermy Specimens ===
The height of taxidermy in the Victorian Age brought forth the invention of "arsenical soap.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marte|first=Fernando|last2=Pequignot|first2=Amandine|last3=Endt|first3=David W. Von|date=2006-01-01|title=Arsenic in taxidermy collections: History, detection, and management|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237749788_Arsenic_in_taxidermy_collections_History_detection_and_management|volume=21|issue=1|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  French [[pharmacist]] and [[Conservation movement|naturalist]], [[Jean-Baptiste Bécœur|Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur]], invented a type of paste in 1738 to prevent pest infestation in taxidermy specimens, preserve skin and prevent the decay of remaining flesh.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.examiner.net/article/20090926/news/309269913/?Start=1|title=Arsenic and old mounts – be careful|last=Fox|first=Gene|website=Examiner|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He came up with a mixture of ground [[Arsenic trisulfide|arsenic]], [[camphor]], [[potassium carbonate]], powdered [[calcium hydroxide]], and soap which kept pests at bay.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  He was renowned for his specimens and treatment of them but, in his lifetime, he refused to disclose his exact recipe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 1820, French taxidermist [[Louis Dufresne]], determined the formula and popularized it,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; making it the standard until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Taxidermist then opted for [[Borax]] because it is nontoxic though, ultimately less effective in pest prevention.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The use of arsenical soap leaves a does not compromise the actual specimen, but is hazardous to both museum workers and guests.  Arsenic can sometimes be detected visually as the compound usually crystallizes into white "arsenic dust" that normally creates deposits at the base of hairs, feathers, around the eyes, in or at the base of ears, around mouths or bills, and on foot pads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   However, the lack of arsenic dust does no preclude specimens from having previous treatment with the compound.  The most efficient way to test is with the ''Arsenic Paper Test'' kit manufactured by the Macherey-Nagel Corporation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The test involves rubbing cotton swab, moistened with distilled water, and rubbing it on the contaminated specimen.  The tip is then cut off and placed in a flask with water, then after an hour, it is added to concentrated [[Hydrochloric acid|chlorydric acid]] and around [[Zinc oxide|zinc]] powder.  A test strip is then introduced and, determining the color, it can be assessed whether the object is contaminated or not.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  "It is safer to assume that all mammal and bird specimens collected and prepared before the 1980s may be contaminated with arsenic, and to follow proper handling guidelines.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8776130/Care_of_Arsenic-Contaminated_Taxidermy_and_Ethnographic_Collections|title=Care of Arsenic-Contaminated Taxidermy and Ethnographic Collections|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

If the object is contaminated with arsenic, proper steps must be taken to remit the toxin and keep the environment safe.  Specimens that test positive must have "Arsenic Contaminated" clearly visible on their label and be separated from other specimens.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1255&amp;context=theses|title=Poisonous Heritage: Pesticides in Museum Collections|last=Omstein|first=Leslie|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves and a protective apron, as well as a [[respirator]], should be mandatory when dealing with these specimens.  The specimen should be vacuumed with a [[HEPA|HEPA filter]] in a well-ventilated space.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  These objects should be continuously tested every two or three years because arsenic was usually applied to the inside of the specimen as well, and can migrate from the inside to the outside of the specimen.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Arsenic was commonly used among [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] specimens as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic35-01-003.html|title=A HISTORY OF PEST CONTROL MEASURES IN THE ANTHROPOLOGY COLLECTIONS, NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION|last=Goldberg|first=Lisa|date=1996-01-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounted specimens should be kept on their original bases for storage purposes and encased in custom [[Ethafoam]] cases.  The Ethafoam should be secured to the mount with cotton twill tape or [[polyethylene]] covered twist ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn14/wn14-2/wn14-205.html|title=Storage Methods for Taxidermy Specimens|last=Fuller|first=Tamsen|date=1992-05-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This limits damage due to handling the fur object.

=== Clothing and Accessories ===
Fur, by nature, is heavy, therefore care should be taken when storing these objects.  When storing fur clothing, well-padded hangars should be employed and no furs should be packed so close to each other that they can crush of flatten one another.  [[Cotton]], [[silk]], or [[Tyvek]] bags should be used to enclose each fur, making sure the weave of the bag is fine enough to keep out insects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saving Stuff: How to Care for and Preserve Your Collectibles, Heirlooms, and Other Prized Possessions|last=Williams|first=Don|last2=Jagger|first2=Louisa|publisher=Fireside/Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2005|isbn=9780743264167|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Straps should never be used to support objects, even if that is their given function.  The piece should either be stored flat or a support should be supplied at the base, allowing the straps or handles to be supported in a natural, unstressed, position.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Display Issues ==
For display, the piece should have adequate support for the weight and fragility of the object so it is not wrinkled or under stress.  In reference to garments, [[mannequin]]s should be tailored appropriately to fit the intended piece and custom mounts should be made for accessories.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Acrylic paint|Acrylic]] mounts provide the best support for heavy materials.  They also can be heated to conform to an object's exact surface shape.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Padding should be applied so the object is not stressed by the hard [[Plexiglas]].  Large pelts should be displayed on tiled boards covered in a "coarse textile to help grip the item.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;"  Metal hangars, pins, or clips should never be used to display fur objects because the metal can react with the oils in the skin and stain the object,&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; known as [[verdigris]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Exhibitors must be aware of the agents of deterioration.  Heat, light, and humidity should be carefully monitored in whatever environment is created for the display of the objects.  Fur objects should not be exposed to more light than 5 footcandles - 18&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  The exhibitor should also plan on rotating pieces during a long exhibition due to fading and physical damage that may occur.  The exhibit space must also be routinely inspected for rodents and other pests.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

[[File:Samson the gorilla (23547597554).jpg|thumb|Samson at the Milwaukee Public Museum]]

=== [https://www.mpm.edu/plan-visit/exhibitions/permanent-exhibits/first-floor-exhibits/samson Samson] at the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] ===
Samson was a [[Gorilla|Silverback Gorilla]] that lived at the [[Milwaukee County Zoo]] from 1950 to 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxidermy.net/forum/index.php?topic=163318.0|title=Tribute To "Samson"|website=www.taxidermy.net|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a crowd favorite for his size and frequent acts of banging on the glass of his enclosure.  After his death of a heart attack, Samson's remains were given to the Milwaukee Public Museum like his brother, Sambo's, had been in 1959 for taxidermy purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Samson's bones were re-articulated sometime after and displayed in the museum's exhibit paying tribute to [[Victorian era]] museology, "The Sense of Wonder," next to an upright human skeleton and a smaller ape.

In 2006, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death, the Milwaukee Public Museum planned to mount an exhibit in his honor with a taxidermy specimen of Samson taking center stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpm.edu/plan-visit/exhibitions/permanent-exhibits/first-floor-exhibits/samson|title=Samson {{!}} Milwaukee Public Museum|website=www.mpm.edu|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "[w]hen curators went to mount his hide, they found his freeze-dried hide had deteriorated too much to use in a taxidermy mount.”&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/29228414.html|title=Samson comes alive!|website=www.jsonline.com|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His pelt was determined to be unsalvageable, to it fell to staff taxidermist, Wendy Christiansen-Senk, to recreate Samson from scratch.

Because Samson was a frequently documented local hero, Christiansen-Senk had a lot of material to work with.  The most invaluable research she had was the insight of former zookeeper and Samson caregiver, Sam LaMalfa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoosociety.org/Education/FunStuff/SamsonMemories.php|title=Memories of Samson the Gorilla {{!}} Zoological Society of Milwaukee|website=www.zoosociety.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her recreation, she consulted Samson's bones, videos of him at the zoo, photographs, his death mask (which is also part of the [[Milwaukee Public Museum|MPM]] collection), and LaMalfa.  "In conventional taxidermy we would use the real skin, tailoring the mannequin to fit the real skin. In this case I had to come up with hair and textures and colors, and try to match the hair on the body of one animal. It's a lot more challenging method.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;" said Christiansen-Senk in 2006 regarding the effort.  Christiansen-Senk molded a [[silicone]] face using Samson’s death mask and thousands of photographs.  She then purchased a replica gorilla skeleton and yak and synthetic hair.  She spent more than a year implanting individual hairs into Samson's silicone face.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/taxidermy/christy-text|title=Still Life|last=Christy|first=Bryan|website=National Geographic|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christiansen-Senk matched the coloring and patterning on Samson so convincingly that LaMalfa said, upon seeing the completed model, "That's him. I'm waiting for him to move so I can talk to him.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The result was so amazing, Christiansen-Senk entered her recreation in the 2009 World Taxidermy Championship, where she won first prize for the best recreation and the Judge's Choice Best in Show against real animal taxidermy entries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Samson remains on permanent exhibit at the Milwaukee Public Museum.     
     
=== ''[[Le Déjeuner en fourrure|Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]  ===
In 1936, [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred H. Barr Jr.]], the young director of New York's Museum of Modern Art approached Méret Oppenheim to negotiate purchasing ''Luncheon in Fur''.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/02/09/466061492/luncheon-in-fur-the-surrealist-tea-cup-that-stirred-the-art-world|title='Luncheon In Fur': The Surrealist Teacup That Stirred The Art World|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oppenheim expressed a willingness to sell and Barr paid $50 to make history. ''Luncheon in Fur'' was the first work by a woman the museum acquired and Oppenheim is dubbed the First Lady of MoMA.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  As the First Lady, Oppenheim reportedly gave instructions for the conservation of her piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/surrealismandmagic/exhibition/seer/bibliophile.html|title=Surrealism and Magic|website=rmc.library.cornell.edu|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those instructions have not been made public, but the piece has been on display in a "Plexiglas [[Display case|vitrine]]" since 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mortality Immortality?: The Legacy of 20th-century Art|last=Corzo|first=Miguel Angel|last2=Getty Conservation Institute|publisher=Getty Publications|year=1999|isbn=9780892365289|location=|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as "balding.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;"

It is assumed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-1010/art-between-wars/surrealism1/a/meret-oppenheim-object-fur-covered-cup-saucer-and-spoon|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Oppenheim glued the cream-and-tan pelt of a Chinese [[gazelle]]&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; to her now famous china.  The adhesive dates from the creation of the object in 1936, so may be breaking down.  Also, the lighting and the fact it is on exhibit so frequently cause conservation concerns.  Ideally, the object would be conserved in accordance with today's standards, but the directive Oppenheim left may speak more towards her intent as an artist and any attempt to conserve the piece could alter its "original state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|last=Appelbaum|first=Barbara|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7506-8274-9|location=Oxford|pages=173–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''The Research Center of Economics, Land and Environment''' (abbreviated as CRETA) was created in [[Pisa]] as a center of independent research and as a link between university research and companies in the city, in order to design and implement plans turning theory into best daily practices and transfer to the companies the benefits of the latest research and help to raise their level of awareness.

In the first year of life, the association has been moving in different sectors, addressing issues related to sustainable development and the local economy, stimulate the creation of Districts of Social Economy, experiences of local currency, promote Ethical Finance and [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] &amp; Solidarity.

The project led to the creation of some art installations and a maxi eco-screen video projection. The work was presented and explained to the audience at two events, cultural and environmental issues in collaboration with other associations and local businesses in order to raise awareness and further stimulate people about the possibilities, practical and creative offers from recycling. With the time more and more time and attention went to issues related to energy and recycling. After local analysis combined with personal knowledge of organizations and companies working in the field of [[renewable energy]] and sustainable design in Pisa, finally CRETA decided to contribute towards more training among the public in order to promote knowledge of the renewable energy sources and promote their use, in other words, to spread awareness.

The observed spectra consist of neutral hydrogen [[Lyman alpha]] absorption lines which are broadened by [[radiation damping]]. These systems can be observed in quantity at relatively high [[redshift]]s of 2-4, when they contained most of the neutral hydrogen in the universe.
They are believed to be associated with the early stages of [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]], as the high neutral hydrogen column densities of DLAs are also typical of sightlines in the [[Milky Way]], and other nearby galaxies. Since they are observed in absorption rather than by their stars, they offer the opportunity to study the dynamics of the gas in early galaxies directly.

[[Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|right|thumb|250px|Diagram of a de Laval nozzle, showing approximate flow velocity (v), together with the effect on temperature (T) and pressure (p)]]
A '''de Laval nozzle''' (or '''convergent-divergent nozzle''', '''CD nozzle''' or '''con-di nozzle''') is a tube that is pinched in the middle, making a carefully balanced, asymmetric [[hourglass]] shape. It is used to accelerate a hot, pressurized [[gas]] passing through it to a higher [[supersonic]] speed in the axial (thrust) direction, by converting the heat energy of the flow into [[kinetic energy]]. Because of this, the [[nozzle]] is widely used in some types of [[steam turbines]] and [[rocket engine nozzle]]s. It also sees use in supersonic [[jet engines]].

Similar flow properties have been applied to [[Jet (fluid)|jet streams]] within [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= C.J. Clarke and B. Carswell|title=Principles of Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics|edition=1st|pages=226| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|ISBN= 978-0-521-85331-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle was first used in a [[rocket engine]] by [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]. Most modern rocket engines that employ hot gas combustion use de Laval nozzles.

==Operation==

Its operation relies on the different properties of gases flowing at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] and [[supersonic]] speeds. The speed of a subsonic flow of gas will increase if the pipe carrying it narrows because the [[mass flow rate]] is constant. The gas flow through a de Laval nozzle is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (gas [[entropy]] is nearly constant). In a subsonic flow [[sound]] will propagate through the gas. At the "throat", where the cross-sectional area is at its minimum, the gas velocity locally becomes sonic (Mach number = 1.0), a condition called [[choked flow]]. As the nozzle cross-sectional area increases, the gas begins to expand and the gas flow increases to supersonic velocities where a sound wave will not propagate backwards through the gas as viewed in the frame of reference of the nozzle ([[Mach number]] &gt; 1.0).

==Conditions for operation==

A de Laval nozzle will only choke at the throat if the pressure and mass flow through the nozzle is sufficient to reach sonic speeds, otherwise no supersonic flow is achieved, and it will act as a [[Venturi tube]]; this requires the entry pressure to the nozzle to be significantly above ambient at all times (equivalently, the [[stagnation pressure]] of the jet must be above ambient).

In addition, the pressure of the gas at the exit of the expansion portion of the exhaust of a nozzle must not be too low. Because pressure cannot travel upstream through the supersonic flow, the exit pressure can be significantly below the [[ambient pressure]] into which it exhausts, but if it is too far below ambient, then the flow will cease to be [[supersonic]], or the flow will separate within the expansion portion of the nozzle, forming an unstable jet that may "flop" around within the nozzle, producing a lateral thrust and possibly damaging it.

In practice, ambient pressure must be no higher than roughly 2–3 times the pressure in the supersonic gas at the exit for supersonic flow to leave the nozzle.

==Analysis of gas flow in de Laval nozzles==

The analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and assumptions:

* For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an [[ideal gas]].
* The gas flow is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (i.e., at constant [[entropy]]). As a result, the flow is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] (frictionless and no dissipative losses), and [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] (i.e., there is no heat gained or lost).
* The gas flow is constant (i.e., steady) during the period of the [[propellant]] burn.
* The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to [[exhaust gas]] exit (i.e., along the nozzle's axis of symmetry)
* The gas flow behaviour is [[compressible flow|compressible]] since the flow is at very high [[velocities]] (Mach number &gt; 0.3).

==Exhaust gas velocity==

As the gas enters a nozzle, it is moving at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities. As the throat contracts, the gas is forced to accelerate until at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the smallest, the axial velocity becomes [[mach number|sonic]]. From the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, the gas expands and the axial velocity becomes progressively more [[supersonic]].
  
The linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_nozz.html Richard Nakka's Equation 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm#intro Robert Braeuning's Equation 1.22.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George P.

Some typical values of the exhaust gas velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; for rocket engines burning various propellants are:

* 1,700 to 2,900&amp;nbsp;m/s (3,800 to 6,500&amp;nbsp;mph) for liquid [[monopropellant]]s,
* 2,900 to 4,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (6,500 to 10,100&amp;nbsp;mph) for liquid [[bipropellant]]s,
* 2,100 to 3,200&amp;nbsp;m/s (4,700 to 7,200&amp;nbsp;mph) for [[solid rocket|solid propellant]]s.

As a note of interest, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is sometimes referred to as the ''ideal exhaust gas velocity'' because it based on the assumption that the exhaust gas behaves as an ideal gas.

As an example calculation using the above equation, assume that the propellant combustion gases are: at an absolute pressure entering the nozzle ''p''&amp;nbsp;= 7.0 MPa and exit the rocket exhaust at an absolute pressure ''p''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1 MPa; at an absolute temperature of ''T'' = 3500 K; with an isentropic expansion factor ''γ'' = 1.22 and a molar mass ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 22&amp;nbsp;kg/kmol. Using those values in the above equation yields an exhaust velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 2802&amp;nbsp;m/s, or 2.80&amp;nbsp;km/s, which is consistent with above typical values.

The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant ''R'', which applies to any [[ideal gas]], or whether they are using the gas law constant ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R/M''.

'''Di-deuterated ethyl linoleate''' (also known as RT001; Di-deuterated linoleic acid ethyl ester, 11,11-D2-Ethyl Linoleate, Ethyl 11,11-D2-Linoleate)&lt;ref&gt;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/124037379&lt;/ref&gt; is an experimental, orally-bioavailable synthetic deuterated [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] (PUFA), an isotopologue of an essential [[omega-6]] PUFA, [[linoleic acid]]. The [[deuterated drug|deuterated]] compound, while identical to natural linoleic acid, is resistant to [[lipid peroxidation]] which makes studies of its [[Lipid_peroxidation#Inhibiting_lipid_peroxidation|cell-protective]] properties worthwhile. 

==Clinical development==
Investigations of 11,11-D2-Ethyl linoleate (RT001) are being conducted in several neurological indications, including [[Friedreich’s ataxia]] and [[Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy]]. A double-blind [[Clinical_trial#Active_control_studies|comparator-controlled]] Phase I/II clinical trial sponsored by [[Retrotope]] and [[Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance]] was conducted to determine the safety profile and appropriate dosing for consequent trials.&lt;ref&gt; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02445794&lt;/ref&gt; RT001 was promptly absorbed and was found to be safe and tolerable over 28 days at the maximal dose of 9 g/day. It improved [[peak workload]] and [[VO2 max|peak oxygen consumption]] in the test group compared to the control group who received the equal doses of normal, non-deuterated ethyl linoleate.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mds.27353&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018 RT001 was given to a patient with [[ALS]] under a "compassionate use scheme".&lt;ref&gt;https://alsnewstoday.com/2018/09/18/experimental-rt001-available-for-als-under-expanded-access-program/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Di-deuterated linoleic acid is recognized by cells as identical to the natural linoleic acid. But when taken up, it is converted into 13,13-D2-arachidonic acid, a heavy isotope version of [[arachidonic_acid]], that gets incorporated into lipid membranes. The deuterated compound resists the non-enzymatic [[lipid peroxidation]] (LPO) through a non-antioxidant based mechanism that protects mitochondrial, neuronal and other lipid membranes, thereby greatly reducing the levels of numerous LPO-derived toxic products such as [[4-Hydroxynonenal|reactive carbonyls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|22705367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{canon Law}}
In the [[jurisprudence of canon law|jurisprudence]] of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], a '''dispensation''' is the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases.&lt;ref name=law284&gt;The Law of Christ Vol. I, pg. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Dispensation |volume=8 |pages=313-315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Since [[law]]s aimed at the good of the entire community may not be suitable for certain cases or persons, the [[legislator]] has the right (sometimes even the duty) to dispense from{{refn|Unlike the English idiom "dispense with", the canonical idiom is "dispense from"|group=note}} the [[law]].&lt;ref name=law284/&gt;

Dispensation is not a permanent power or a special right as in [[privilege (canon law)|privilege]].&lt;ref name=law284/&gt; If the reason for the dispensation ceases entirely, then the dispensation also ceases entirely.&lt;ref name=law285&gt;The Law of Christ Vol. I, pg. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 93], 1983 Code of Canon Law, accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NewAdvent.org [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05041a.htm "Dispensation"], accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt; If the immediate basis for the right is withdrawn, then the right ceases.&lt;ref name=law285/&gt;

===Validity, legality, "just and reasonable cause"===
There must be a "just and reasonable cause"&lt;ref name=can90&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 90 §1], 1983 Code of Canon Law; accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt; for granting a dispensation. The judgement regarding what is "just and reasonable" is made based upon the particular situation and the importance of the law to be dispensed from.&lt;ref name=can90/&gt; If the cause is not "just and reasonable" then the dispensation is illegal and, if issued by someone other than the lawgiver of the law in question or his superior, it is also invalid.&lt;ref name=can90/&gt; If it is uncertain as to whether a sufficiently "just and reasonable cause" exists, the dispensation is both legal and valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 90 §2], 1983 Code of Canon Law; accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical legal theory]], the dispensing power is the corollary of the legislative. The dispensing power, like the legislative, was formerly invested in [[Ecumenical council|general councils]] and even in provincial [[synods]]. But in the west, with the gradual centralisation of authority in the [[Roman curia]], it became ultimately vested in the [[pope]] as the supreme lawgiver of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Despite frequent crises in the diplomatic relations between the [[Holy See]] and temporal governments in the later [[Middle Ages]], the authority of the papacy as the dispenser of [[Actual grace|grace]] and spiritual licences remained largely unchallenged. In the early thirteenth century, [[Pope Innocent III]] (1198–1216) fostered the extension of papal political power. He emphasised, "as had no pope before him, the pope's ''plenitudo potestatis'' ("fullness of power") within the Church." Since the Church comprised the whole of mankind, medieval jurists were accustomed to what we might call shared sovereignty, and freely accepted that the pope had a concurrent jurisdiction with temporal sovereigns.  The temporal princes could administer their own laws, but the princes of the Church, and especially the pope, administered the canon law (so far as it was subject to merely human control).

In the [[decretal]] ''Proposuit'', Innocent III proclaimed that the pope could, if circumstances demanded, dispense from canon law, ''de jure'', with his plenitude of power.  He based his view on ''princeps legibus solutus est'' ("the prince is not bound by the laws").  Because the pope was above the law, time or precedent did not limit his power, and he could dispense with any law.

Such a dispensation was not, strictly speaking, legislative, but rather a judicial, quasi-judicial, or executive act. It was also, of course, subject to the proviso that his jurisdiction to dispense with laws was limited to those laws which were within his jurisdiction or competence.  "[T]his principle would have been a commonplace to anyone who had studied in Bologna."

By this power of dispensation, the pope could release clergy and laity from the obligations of the canon law in all cases that were not contrary to ''[[Divine law|ius divinum]]'' and even in a few cases that were.  This power was most frequently invoked to enable laity to marry notwithstanding impediments of [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] or kinship, and to enable persons labouring under an irregularity (such as of [[bastardy]], servitude, or lack of age) to take orders or become regulars.

Dispensations awarded was classified into three categories:
*The first two categories, rules concerning the procedure of taking [[Holy Orders]], and dispensations concerning tenure of [[benefice]]s, applied only to clergy, and of release from [[religious vows]] for members of [[Catholic religious order]]s.
*The third category, matrimonial dispensations, i.e. regarding marriage, concerned only the laity since [[clerical celibacy|the clergy is celibate]].
*Beside the three main classes of dispensation, the [[Roman Curia]] was ready to grant miscellaneous positive concessions to applicants, from individuals to larger organisations, although the former is rare. This host of dispensations, [[faculty (instrument)|faculties]], and [[indult]]s included permission to eat flesh during [[Lent]], the celebration of offices in [[Chapel of ease|chapels of ease]] and private [[Oratory (worship)|oratories]], and the granting of academic degrees.  Those dispensations relating to academic degrees were mostly issued under the sanction of the canon law, as stated in the constitution of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] beginning ''Cum ex eo''.

==Contemporary use==
As of the early part of the twentieth century, the actual practice of the Roman Catholic Church is based upon the decisions of the [[Council of Trent]], which left the medieval theory intact while endeavouring to guard against its abuses. The proposal put forward by the Gallican and Spanish bishops to subordinate the papal power of dispensation to the consent of the Church in general council was rejected, and even the canons of the council of Trent itself, in so far as they affected reformation of morals or ecclesiastical discipline, were decreed “saving the authority of the Holy See” (Sess. xxv. cap. 21, de ref.). At the same time it was laid down in respect of all dispensations, whether papal or other, that they were to be granted only for just and urgent causes, or in view of some decided benefit to the Church (urgens justaque causa et major quandoque utilitas), and in all cases gratis. The payment of money for a dispensation was ipso facto to make the dispensation void (Sess. xxv. cap. 18, de ref.).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

There are several levels of authority in the Church that are competent to dispense the various demands of Canon Law.  Local [[ordinary (officer)|ordinaries]], for example, are competent to dispense the various [[canonical impediment]]s to the sacrament of marriage.  Some dispensations are reserved to the [[Holy See]], for example, from the impediment to ordination of [[apostasy]].

The power of dispensing lies with the original lawgiver, with his successors or with his superiors, and with those persons to whom they have delegated this right. Since there is no superior above the pope, he can therefore dispense from all [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical laws]]: universal laws introduced by himself, his predecessors or general councils, and particular laws enacted by plenary and provincial councils, bishops and similar prelates. As a general rule the [[pope]] delegates his powers to the various [[congregation (Roman Curia)|congregations]] of the [[Roman Curia]] which are charged with granting dispensations in matters within the sphere of their competence.&lt;ref name=whatis47&gt;"What is Canon Law?" pg. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papal dispensation===
Papal dispensation is a reserved right of the [[pope]] that allows for individuals to be exempted from a specific [[Canon Law]]. Dispensations are divided into two categories: general, and matrimonial. Matrimonial dispensations can be either to allow a marriage in the first place, or to dissolve one.  The authority for the pope to exempt an individual or situation from a law stems from his position as the Vicar of Christ, which implies divine authority and knowledge as well as jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05041a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Dispensation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first marriage of [[Henry VIII of England]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] required a papal dispensation as it breached canon law on [[Affinity (canon law)|Affinity]] because she was the widow of Henry's elder brother [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]].  This was obtained successfully, but when he later wished to divorce her, he was famously unable to get another one, causing his [[English Reformation|break with Rome]]. &lt;!-- cn --&gt;Their daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], a fervent Catholic, would later apply for a secret dispensation absolving her of submitting to the basic rules of Protestant religion when pressured under the threat of death by her father.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--cn end--&gt;

In the earlier Middle Ages, especially the 11th to 12th centuries, the church had developed canon law on affinity and [[consanguinity]] (the first denoting a connection by marriage only, the second a genetic one) to cover very remote relationships, so that a very high proportion of marriages between the small and inter-related European elites needed expensive dispensations from either the Pope or a bishop.  This was recognised as an abuse, and later the relationships covered were reduced.  In 1059, the eleventh canon of the [[Council of Rome]] recognized the impediment of affinity as well as of consanguinity to extend to the seventh degree, the high point of the restrictions.  [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) limited both affinity and consanguinity needing dispensation to the fourth degree, and the [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. XXIV, c. iv, De Ref.) in the 16th century limited the juridical effect of extra-matrimonial intercourse to the second degree of affinity.

==Matrimonial dispensation==
A matrimonial dispensation is the relaxation in a particular case of an impediment prohibiting or annulling a marriage. It may be granted: (a) in favour of a contemplated marriage or to legitimize one already contracted; (b) in secret cases, or in public cases, or in both; (c) in foro interno only, or in foro externo (the latter includes also the former). Power of dispensing in foro interno is not always restricted to secret cases (casus occulti).
These expressions are by no means identical.

''The information in this section concerns [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] in the early 20th century. The canon law in question was considerably changed by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|1917 Code of Canon Law]] and the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] and should not be considered to reflect the present situation.''

=== General powers of dispensation ===
==== The Pope and his Curia ====
The Pope cannot dispense from impediments founded on [[Divine law]] — except, as above described, in the case of [[vows]], espousals and non-consummated marriages, or valid and consummated marriage of [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s before [[baptism]]. In doubtful cases, however, he may decide authoritatively as to the objective value of the doubt. In respect of impediments arising from ecclesiastical law the pope has full dispensing power. Every such dispensation granted by him is valid, and when he acts from a sufficient motive it is also licit.

He is not, however, out of consideration for the public welfare, to exercise this power personally, unless in very exceptional cases, where certain specific impediments are in question. Such cases are error, violence, Holy orders, disparity of worship, public [[conjugicide]], [[consanguinity]] in the direct line or in the first degree (equal) of the collateral Line and the first degree of affinity (from lawful intercourse) in the direct line. As a rule the pope exercises his power of dispensation through the Roman Congregations and Tribunals.

Until around the 1900s, the [[Dataria]] was the most important channel for matrimonial dispensations when the impediment was public or about to become public within a short time. The [[Holy Office]], however, had exclusive control ''in foro externo'' over all impediments connected with or juridically bearing on matters of faith, e. g. disparity of worship, ''mixta religio'', Holy orders, etc. The dispensing power ''in foro interno'' lay with the [[Penitentiaria]], and in the case of pauperes or quasi-pauperes this same Congregation had dispensing power over public impediments in foro externo. The Penitentiaria held as pauperes for all countries outside of Italy those whose united capital, productive of a fixed revenue, did not exceed 5370 lire (about 1050 dollars); and as quasi-pauperes, those whose capital did not exceed 9396 lire (about 1850 dollars). It likewise had the power of promulgating general indults affecting public impediments, as for instance the indult of 15 November 1907. [[Propaganda Fide]] was charged with all dispensations, both in foro inferno and in foro externo, for countries under its jurisdiction, as was the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs for all countries depending on it, e. g. Russia, Latin America and certain [[apostolic vicariate]]s and [[prefectures Apostolic]].

On 3 November 1908, the duties of these various Congregations received important modifications in consequence of the [[Apostolic Constitution]] "Sapienti", in which [[Pope Pius X]] reorganized the Roman Curia. Dispensing power from public impediments in the case of pauperes or quasi-pauperes was transferred from the Dataria and the Penitentiaria to a newly established [[Roman Congregation]] known as the [[Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum]], the Penitentiaria retaining dispensing power over occult impediments in foro interno only. The Holy Office retained its faculties, but restricted expressly under three heads: (1) disparity of worship; (2) mixta religio; (3) the [[Pauline privilege]].

''[[Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]]'' remained the channel for securing dispensations for all countries under its jurisdiction, but being required for the sake of executive unity, to defer, in all matters concerning matrimony, to the various Congregations competent to act thereon, its function became that of intermediary. In America, the United States, Canada and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and in Europe, the British Isles were withdrawn from Propaganda, and placed under the common law of countries with a hierarchy. The Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs lost all its powers; consequently the countries hitherto subject to it must address themselves either to the Holy Office or to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum according to the nature of the impediment.

The powers of any Congregation are suspended during the vacancy of the [[Holy See]], except those of the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]] in the [[internal forum]] (''in foro interno''), which, during that time, are even increased. Though suspended, the powers of a Congregation may be used in cases of urgent necessity.

==== The diocesan bishops ====
We shall treat first of their fixed perpetual faculties, whether ordinary or delegated, afterwards of their habitual and temporary faculties. By virtue of their ordinary power (Jurisdiction) [[bishop]]s can dispense from those prohibent impediments of ecclesiastical law which are not reserved to the pope. The reserved impediments of this kind are espousals, the vow of perpetual [[chastity]], and vows taken in diocesan [[religious institute]]s, mixta religio, public display and solemn blessing at marriages within forbidden times, the [[vetitum]], or [[interdict]] laid on a marriage by the pope, or by the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] in a case of appeal. The bishop may also dispense from diriment impediments after the following manner: —

# By tacit consent of the Holy See he can dispense in foro interno from secret impediments from which the pope is wont to exercise his power of dispensing, in three cases: (a) in marriages already contracted and consummated, when urgent necessity arises (i. e. when the interested parties cannot be separated without scandal or endangering their souls, and there is no time to have recourse to the Holy See or to its delegate) — it is, however, necessary that such marriage shall have taken place in lawful form before the Church, and that one of the contracting parties at least shall have been ignorant of the impediment; (b) in marriages about to be contracted and which are called embarrassing (perplexi) cases, i. e. where everything being ready a delay would be defamatory or would cause scandal; (c) when there is a serious doubt of fact as to the existence of an impediment; in this case the dispensation seems to hold good, even though in course of time the impediment becomes certain, and even public. In cases where the law is doubtful no dispensation is necessary; but the bishop may, if he thinks proper, declare authentically the existence and sufficiency of such doubt.
# By virtue of a decree of the Congregation of the Inquisition or Holy Office (20 February 1888) diocesan bishops and other ordinaries (especially a [[Vicar Apostolic]], [[administrator Apostolic]] and [[Prefect Apostolic]], having jurisdiction over an allocated territory, also [[vicar-general]] ''in spiritualibus'' and a [[vicar capitular]]) may dispense in very urgent (''gravissimum'') danger of death from all diriment impediments (secret or public) of ecclesiastical law, except priesthood and affinity (from lawful intercourse) in the direct line. However, they can use this privilege only in favour of persons actually living in real concubinage or united by a merely civil marriage, and only when there is no time for recourse to the Holy See. They may also legitimize the children of such unions, except those born of adultery or sacrilege. In the decree of 1888 is also included the impediment of clandestinity. This decree permits therefore (at least until the Holy See shall have issued other instructions) to dispense, in the case of concubinage or civil marriage, with the presence of the priest and of the two witnesses required by the Decree "Ne temere" in urgent cases of marriage in extremis. Canonists do not agree as to whether bishops hold these faculties by virtue of their ordinary power or by general delegation of the law. It seems to us more probable that those just described under #1 belong to them as ordinaries, while those under #2 are delegated. They are, therefore, empowered to delegate the former; in order to subdelegate the latter they must be guided by the limits fixed by the decree of 1888 and its interpretation dated 9 June 1889. That is, if it is a question of habitual delegation parish priests only should receive it, and only for cases where there is no time for recourse to the bishop.

Besides the fixed perpetual faculties, bishops also receive from the Holy See habitual temporary indults for a certain period of time or for a limited number of cases. These faculties are granted by fixed "formulæ", in which the Holy See from time to time, or as occasion requires it, makes some slight modifications. These faculties call for a broad interpretation. Nevertheless, it is well to bear in mind, when interpreting them, the actual legislation of the Congregation whence they issue, so as not to extend their use beyond the places, persons, number of cases and impediments laid down in a given indult. Faculties thus delegated to a bishop do not in any way restrict his ordinary faculties; nor (in se) do the faculties issued by one Congregation affect those granted by another. When several specifically different impediments occur in the same case, and one of them exceeds the bishop's powers, he may not dispense from any of them.

Even when the bishop has faculties for each impediment taken separately he cannot (unless he possesses the faculty known as ''de cumulo'') use his various faculties simultaneously in a case where, all the impediments being public, one of them exceeds his ordinary faculties, it is not necessary for a bishop to delegate his faculties to his vicars-general; since 1897 they were always granted to the bishop as ordinary, therefore to the vicar-general also. With regard to other priests a decree of the holy Office (14 December 1898) declared that for the future temporary faculties may be always subdelegated unless the indult expressly states the contrary. These faculties are valid from the date when they were granted in the Roman Curia. In actual practice they do not expire, as a rule, at the death of the pope nor of the bishop to whom they were given, but pass on to those who take his place (the ''vicar capitular'', the administrator or succeeding bishop). Faculties granted for a fixed period of time, or a limited number of cases, cease when the period or number has been reached; but while awaiting their renewal the bishop, unless culpably negligent, may continue to use them provisionally. A bishop can use his habitual faculties only in favour of his own subjects. The matrimonial discipline of the Decree ''[[Ne temere]]'' (2 August 1907) contemplates as such all persons having a true canonical domicile, or continuously resident for one month within his territory, also vagi, or persons who have no domicile anywhere and can claim no continuous stay of one month. When a matrimonial impediment is common to both parties the bishop, in dispensing his own subject, dispenses also the other.

====Vicars capitular and vicars-general ====
A vicar capitular, or in his place a lawful administrator, enjoys all the dispensing powers possessed by the bishop in virtue of his ordinary jurisdiction or of delegation of the law; according to the actual discipline he enjoys even the habitual powers which had been granted the deceased bishop for a fixed period of time or for a limited number of cases, even if the indult should have been made out in the name of the Bishop of N. Considering the actual praxis of the Holy See, the same is true of particular indults (see below). The vicar-general has by virtue of his appointment all the ordinary powers of the bishop over prohibent impediments, but requires a special mandate to give him common-law faculties for diriment impediments. As for habitual temporary faculties, since they are now addressed to the ordinary, they belong also ipso facto to the vicar-general while he holds that office. He can also use particular indults when they are addressed to the ordinary, and when they are not so addressed the bishop can always subdelegate him, unless the contrary be expressly stated in the indult.

==== Parish priests and other ecclesiastics ====
A parish priest by common law can dispense only from an interdict laid on a marriage by him or by his predecessor. Some canonists of note accord him authority to dispense from secret impediments in what are called embarrassing (''perplexi'') cases, i. e. when there is no time for recourse to the bishop, but with the obligation of subsequent recourse ad cautelam, i. e. for greater security; a similar authority is attributed by them to confessors. This opinion seems yet gravely probable, though the Penitentiaria continues to grant among its habitual faculties a special authority for such cases and restricts somewhat its use.

===Particular indults of dispensation ===
When there is occasion to procure a dispensation that exceeds the powers of the ordinary, or when there are special reasons for direct recourse to the Holy See, procedure is by way of ''supplica'' (petition) and private [[rescript]]. The supplica need not necessarily be drawn up by the petitioner, nor even at his instance; it does not, however, become valid until he accepts it. Although, since the Constitution "Sapienti", all the faithful may have direct recourse to the Roman Congregations, the supplica is usually forwarded through the ordinary (of the person's birthplace or domicile, or since the Decree "Ne temere" the residence of one of the petitioners), who transmits it to the proper Congregation either by letter or through his accredited agent; but if there is question of sacramental secrecy, it is sent directly to the Penitentiaria, or handed to the bishop's agent under a sealed cover for transmission to the Penitentiaria. The supplica ought to give the names (family and Christian) of the petitioners (except in secret cases forwarded to the Penitentiaria), the name of the Ordinary forwarding it, or the name of the priest to whom, in secret cases, the rescript must be sent; the age of the parties, especially in dispensations affecting consanguinity and affinity; their religion, at 1east when one of them is not a Catholic; the nature, degree and number of all impediments (if recourse is had to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum or to the Holy Office in a public impediment, and to the Penitentiaria at the same time in a secret one, it is necessary that the latter should know of the public impediment and that recourse has been had to the competent Congregation). The supplica must also contain the causes set forth for granting the dispensation and other circumstances specified in the Propaganda Fide Instruction of 9 May 1877 (it is no longer necessary, either for the validity or liceity of the dispensation, to observe the paragraph relating to incestuous intercourse, even when probably this very thing had been alleged as the only reason for granting the dispensation). When there is question of consanguinity in the second degree bordering on the first, the supplica ought to be written by the bishop's own hand. He ought also to sign the declaration of poverty made by the petitioners when the dispensation is sought from the Penitentiaria ''in formâ pauperum''; when he is in any way hindered from so doing he is bound to commission a priest to sign it in his name. A false declaration of poverty henceforth does not invalidate a dispensation in any case; but the authors of the false statement are bound in conscience to reimburse any amount unduly withheld (regulation for the Roman Curia of 12 June 1908). For further information on the many points already briefly described see the special canonical works, wherein are found all necessary directions as to what must be expressed so as to avoid nullity. When a supplica is affected (in a material point) by [[obreption]] or [[subreption]] it becomes necessary to ask for a so-called "reformatory decree" in case the favour asked has not yet been granted by the Curia, or for the letters known as "Perinde ac valere" if the favour has already been granted. If after all this a further material error is discovered, letters known as "Perinde ac valere super perinde ac valere" must be applied for.&lt;ref&gt;See Gasparri, "Tractatus de matrimonio" (2nd ed., Rome, 1892), I, no. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispensation rescripts are generally drawn up ''in formâ commissâ mixtâ'', i. e. they are entrusted to an executor who is thereby obliged to proceed to their execution, if he finds that the reasons are as alleged (''si vera sint exposita''). Canonists are divided as to whether rescripts in formâ commissâ mixtâ contain a favour granted from the moment of their being sent off, or to be granted when the execution actually takes place. Gasparri holds it as received practice that it suffices if the reasons alleged be actually true at the moment when the petition is presented. It is certain, however, that the executor required by Penitentiaria rescripts may safely fulfil his mission even if the pope should die before he had begun to execute it. The executor named for public impediments is usually the ordinary who forwards the supplica and for secret impediments an approved confessor chosen by the petitioner. Except when specially authorized, the person delegated cannot validly execute a dispensation before he has seen the original of the rescript. Therein it is usually prescribed that the reasons given by the petitioners must be verified. This verification, usually no longer a condition for valid execution, can be made, in the case of public impediments, extrajudicially or by subdelegation. In foro interno it can be made by the confessor in the very act of hearing the confessions of the parties. Should the inquiry disclose no substantial error, the executor proclaims the dispensation, i. e. he makes known, usually in writing, especially if he acts in foro externo, the decree which dispenses the petitioners; if the rescript authorizes him, he also legitimizes the children. Although the executor may subdelegate the preparatory acts, he may not, unless the rescript expressly says so, subdelegate the actual execution of the decree, unless he subdelegates to another ordinary. When the impediment is common to, and known to, both parties, execution ought to be made for both; wherefore, in a case in foro interno, the confessor of one of the parties hands over the rescript, after he has executed it, to the confessor of the other. The executor ought to observe with care the clauses enumerated in the decree, as some of them constitute conditions sine quâ non for the validity of the dispensation. As a rule, these clauses affecting validity may be recognized by the conditional conjunction or adverb of exclusion with which they begin (e. g. dummodo, "provided that"; et non aliter, "not otherwise"), or by an ablative absolute. When, however, a clause only prescribes a thing already of obligation by law it has merely the force of a reminder. In this matter also it is well to pay attention to the stylus curiœ, i. e. the legal diction of the Roman Congregations and Tribunals, and to consult authors of repute.

=== Causes for granting dispensations ===
Following the principles laid down for dispensations in general, a matrimonial dispensation granted without sufficient cause, even by the pope himself, would be illicit; the more difficult and numerous the impediments the more serious must be the motives for removing them. An unjustified dispensation, even if granted by the pope, is null and void, in a case affecting the Divine law; and if granted by other bishops or superiors in cases affecting ordinary ecclesiastical law. Moreover, as it is not supposable that the pope wishes to act illicitly, it follows that if he has been moved by false allegations to grant a dispensation, even in a matter of ordinary ecclesiastical law, such dispensation is invalid. Hence the necessity of distinguishing in dispensations between motive or determining causes (''causœ motivœ'') and impulsive or merely influencing causes (''causœ impulsivœ''). Except when the information given is false, still more when he acts spontaneously (''motu proprio'') and "with certain knowledge", the presumption always is that a superior is acting from just motives. It may be remarked that if the pope refuses to grant a dispensation on a certain ground, an inferior prelate, properly authorized to dispense, may grant the dispensation in the same case on other grounds which in his judgment are sufficient. Canonists do not agree as to whether he can grant it on the identical ground by reason of his divergent appreciation of the latter's force.

Among the sufficient causes for matrimonial dispensations we may distinguish canonical causes, i. e. classified and held as sufficient by the common law and canonical jurisprudence, and reasonable causes, i. e. not provided for nominally in the law, but deserving of equitable consideration in view of circumstances or particular cases. An Instruction issued by Propaganda Fide (9 May 1877) enumerated sixteen canonical causes. The "Formulary of the Dataria" (Rome, 1901) gave twenty-eight, which suffice, either alone or concurrently with others, and act as a norm for all sufficient causes; they are: smallness of place or places; smallness of place coupled with the fact that outside it a sufficient dowry cannot be had; lack of [[dowry]]; insufficiency of dowry for the bride; a larger dowry; an increase of dowry by one-third; cessation of [[family feud]]s; preservation of [[peace]]; conclusion of peace between princes or states; avoidance of lawsuits over an inheritance, a dowry or some important business transaction; the fact that a fiancée is an orphan or has the care of a family; the age of the fiancée over twenty-four; the difficulty of finding another partner, owing to the fewness of male acquaintance, or the difficulty the latter experience in coming to her home; the hope of safeguarding the faith of a Catholic relation; the danger of a denominationally mixed marriage; the hope of converting a non-Catholic party; the keeping of property in a family; the preservation of an illustrious or honourable family; the excellence and merits of the parties; defamation to be avoided, or scandal prevented; [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] already having taken place between the petitioners, or [[rape]]; the danger of a civil marriage; of marriage before a Protestant minister revalidation of a marriage that was null and void; finally, all reasonable causes judged such in the opinion of the pope (e. g. the public good), or special reasonable causes actuating the petitioners and made known to the pope, i. e. motives which, owing to the social status of the petitioners, it is opportune should remain unexplained out of respect for their reputation. These various causes have been stated in their briefest terms. To reach their exact force, some acquaintance is necessary with the ''stylus curiœ'' and the pertinent works of reputable authors, always avoiding exaggerated formalism. This list of causes is by no means exhaustive; the Holy See, in granting a dispensation, will consider any weighty circumstances that render the dispensation really justifiable.

===Costs of dispensations ===
The [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. XXIV, cap. v, De ref. matrim.) decreed that dispensations should be free of all charges. Diocesan chanceries are bound to conform to this law (many pontifical documents, and at times clauses in indults, remind them of it) and neither to exact nor accept anything but the modest contribution to the chancery expenses sanctioned by an Instruction approved by [[Innocent XI]] on 8 October 1678, and known as the Innocentian Tax (''[[Taxa Innocentiana]]''). Rosset holds that it is also lawful, when the diocese is poor, to demand payment of the expenses it incurs for dispensations. Sometimes the Holy See grants ampler freedom in this matter, but nearly always with the monition that all revenues from this source shall be employed for some good work, and not go to the diocesan curia as such. Henceforth every rescript requiring execution will state the sum which the diocesan curia is authorized to collect for its execution.

In the Roman Curia the expenses incurred by petitioners fall under four heads:
# expenses (''expensœ'') of carriage (postage, etc.), also a fee to the accredited agent, when one has been employed. This fee is fixed by the Congregation in question;
# a tax (''taxa'') to be used in defraying the expenses incurred by the Holy See in the organized administration of dispensations;
# the ''componendum'', or [[Charity (practice)|eleemosynary]] (alms) fine to be paid to the Congregation and applied by it to pious uses;
# an alms imposed on the petitioners and to be distributed by themselves in good works.

The moneys paid under the first two heads do not affect, strictly speaking, the gratuity of the dispensation. They constitute a just compensation for the expenses the petitioners occasion the Curia. As for the alms and the componendum, besides the fact that they do not profit the pope nor the members of the Curia personally, but are employed in pious uses, they are justifiable, either as a fine for the faults which, as a rule, give occasion for the dispensation, or as a check to restrain a too great frequency of petitions often based on frivolous grounds. And if the Tridentine prohibition be still urged, it may be truly said that the pope has the right to abrogate the decrees of councils, and is the best judge of the reasons that legitimize such abrogation. The custom of tax and componendum is neither uniform nor universal in the Roman Curia.

==Secular law equivalent==
Dispensation is the canonical equivalent of ''license''&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition; pg. 423&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to [[Black's Law Dictionary]], is the authorisation to do something which would normally be illegal if the competent authority had not granted permission.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition; pg. 829&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10899">The '''Dwight H. Terry Lectureship''', also known as the '''Terry Lectures''', was established at [[Yale University]] in 1905&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/ Yale University - "Dwight H. Terry Lectureship"]&lt;/ref&gt; by a gift from Dwight H. Terry of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Its purpose is to engage both scholars and the public in a consideration of religion from a [[humanitarian]] point of view, in the light of modern science and philosophy.  The subject matter has historically been similar to that of the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Scotland, and several lecturers have participated in both series.

==Establishment of the Lectureship==
The 1905 deed of gift establishing the lectureship states:

{{cquote|The object of this foundation is not the promotion of scientific investigation and discovery, but rather the assimilation and interpretation of that which has been or shall be hereafter discovered, and its application to human welfare, especially by the building of the truths of science and philosophy into the structure of a broadened and purified religion. The founder believes that such a religion will greatly stimulate intelligent effort for the improvement of human conditions and the advancement of the race in strength and excellence of character. To this end it is desired that a series of lectures be given by men eminent in their respective departments, on ethics, the history of civilization and religion, biblical research, all sciences and branches of knowledge which have an important bearing on the subject, all the great laws of nature, especially of evolution ... also such interpretations of literature and sociology as are in accord with the spirit of this foundation, to the end that the Christian spirit may be nurtured in the fullest light of the world’s knowledge and that mankind may be helped to attain its highest possible welfare and happiness upon this earth.&lt;ref name="yup"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=81 Yale University Press - "The Terry Lectures Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although commitment to the gift was made in 1905 it did not mature until 1923, which is when the first Terry lectures were held.

==Lecture format==
The lectures are free and open to the public.  A single installment generally consists of four lectures by the same visiting scholar, given over the course of a month or less.  Many of the lectures have been edited into books published by the [[Yale University Press]], and remain in print to this day (see below)  Since 1999, the lectures have been recorded and archived on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100411232503/http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/past_00-04.html Terry Lectures website] as audio and/or video streams.

{{italic title}}
'''''Encyclopaedia Biblica: A Critical Dictionary of the Literary, Political and Religion History, the Archeology, Geography and Natural History of the Bible''''' (1899), edited by [[Thomas Kelly Cheyne]] and [[John Sutherland Black|J. Sutherland Black]], is a critical encyclopedia of the [[Bible]]. In [[theology]] and [[biblical studies]], it is often referenced as ''Enc. Bib.'', or as ''Cheyne and Black''.

==Description==
[[File:C+B-Ethiopia-Fig3-PyramidOfMeroe.PNG|thumb|right|150px|An image illustrating the article 'Ethiopia' – one of the [[Nubian pyramids]] at [[Meroe]]]]
It has an article for every single name and place both in the Bible and in its traditional [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], as well as for each of the books of these, together with many improper nouns appearing in these (such as ''nebi'im'', 'mole', 'owl') and other more general subjects (such as 'music', 'tents', etc.). Many of these articles are given in great detail, and usually include mention of the various spellings for each word as used by the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Septuagint]] (differentiating between each of the most important ancient manuscripts), and by other ancient versions; the largest article is that on the Gospels, which is over 5 MB in size, despite being almost completely plain text (and therefore over half a million words long). It is thus an extremely large work – in PDF form it constitutes a total of about 190 MB of mostly plain text (this would equate to nearly 20 million words, even at 10 characters per word).

It is frequently referenced by other respected Bible-related encyclopedias of the period, such as the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;for example, it is a source for [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05646b.htm the article 'Eve'] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and 11th Edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref&gt;,{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hosea |volume=13 |pages=784–786 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Henry Wheeler |last2=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' has some articles ('marriage' for example) which quote large sections from it nearly verbatim. It is also referenced by works such as the ''[[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibleencyclopedia.com/aaron.htm the article on Aaron], for example&lt;/ref&gt; It is hence, indirectly, also a source for some articles of the [[English Wikipedia]], mainly related to the Judaeo-Christian religion.

A measure of its importance of some of the contributors is gained from the fact that the Jewish Encyclopedia dedicates the majority of the article 'Jerahmeel' to discussing Cheyne's theory of the Jerahmeelites, despite regarding it as arbitrary.

The articles are still of value and interest to modern scholars,&lt;ref&gt;As reading material suggested by the University of Calgary, for example: [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~lipton/dict.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As a source for the archaeology department at [[Tel Aviv University]][http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/directory/dir_anson_rainey.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]]ic writers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/2132/ e.g.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to religio-political commentators such as [[Jihad Watch]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jihadwatch.org/2008/03/blogging-the-quran-sura-17-the-night-journey-verses-2-111.html Blogging the Qur’an: Sura 17, “The Night Journey,” verses 2-111], [[Jihad Watch]], referenced as 'enc. bib.'{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;!-- Blogs are not normally considered reliable--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; however, modern archaeological research and discoveries have made portions of it obsolete, and modern interpretations are of even older material is likely to be very different. For example, the Jerahmeelite/Arabian theory (see below) has long been ignored. It is no longer restricted by [[copyright]] and has become available [[online]] ([[Wikisource:Encyclopaedia Biblica|at wikisource]], for example).

== Cheyne's 'surprising' theory about the Jerahmeelites ==

Professor Cheyne put forth a surprising&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel"&gt;[[Jewish Encyclopedia]], [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=J&amp;artid=223 Jerahmeel]&lt;/ref&gt; theory concerning the [[Jerahmeel]]ites. In his view they were a powerful north-Arabian tribe, with which the Hebrews came into conflict on their first approach to the land. A part of the Jerahmeelites was absorbed by the Hebrews, but there were many contests between the Israelites and the main body of the Jerahmeelites all through the period of [[Books of Kings|the Kings]]. Even among the post-exilic opponents of Nehemiah, the Jerahmeelites appear again. Cheyne believes that echoes of these conflicts once reverberated throughout the [[Old Testament]], but that, owing to the corruption of the Masoretic Text, they must now be reawakened by conjectural emendation of the text.

Carrying out this idea, Cheyne finds the chief elements of Israel's origin, religion, and history in Jerahmeel. Babylonia and Assyria sink into insignificance beside Jerahmeel in so far as influence on the Old Testament is concerned. "Amalekites" is a corruption of "Jerahmeelites"; "Beer-lahai-roi" (Gen. xvi. 14) is a corruption of "Well of Jerahmeel"; "Ephraim" is often a corruption of "Jerahmeel." The epithet of [[Jericho]], "city of palm-trees," is a corruption of "city of Jerahmeel"; the names of Saul, of Kish, his father, and of most of the sons of Saul are held to be corruptions of "Jerahmeel"; and Isaiah's "Maher-shalal-hash-baz" is held to be a corruption of "Jerahmeel will be deserted." "Jerahmeel" has been displaced by "Babylon" in Isa. xiii. and xiv.; and Ezekiel's three wise men were "Enoch, Jerahmeel, and Arab." This list might be continued indefinitely.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt;

By the same principle, he derives other names from "Rehoboth", "Zarephath", "Mizraim", and "Arab";  he does '''not''' equate "[[Mizraim]]" with Egypt (the usual interpretation). The vast majority of names of places and people in the bible are connected by Cheyne to Jerahmeel, or one of these.

The ingenuity of Cheyne's method may be admitted;&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt; but the thesis must be rejected as altogether arbitrary.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt; That it has received serious attention is owing solely to the great service rendered by its sponsor in other departments of Old Testament research.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt;

Cheyne frequently mentions this theory in his Encyclopaedia articles, often appending his view to articles written by people with more mainstream interpretations. He does, however, detail the alternative (and therefore mainstream) views, while doing so. Hence the articles are respected, as long as Cheyne's theory about these names is ignored.

The study of '''extraterrestrial atmospheres''' is an active field of research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Department of Atmospheric Science, University of Washington | url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/academic/planets.html | accessdate=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; both as an aspect of astronomy and to gain insight into Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NASA GISS: Research in Planetary Atmospheres | url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/planets/ | accessdate=2007-05-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516075433/http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/planets/ | archivedate=2007-05-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Earth, many of the other [[astronomical object]]s in the [[Solar System]] have [[atmosphere]]s. These include all the [[gas giants]], as well as [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Pluto|Pluto]]. Several [[Natural satellite|moons]] and other bodies also have atmospheres, as do [[comet]]s and the [[Sun]]. There is evidence that [[extrasolar planet]]s can have an atmosphere. Comparisons of these atmospheres to one another and to Earth's atmosphere broaden our basic understanding of atmospheric processes such as the [[greenhouse effect]], [[aerosol]] and cloud physics, and [[atmospheric chemistry]] and dynamics.

==Planets==

===Inner planets===
{{hatnote|Earth is excluded from this enumeration because this article is about extraterrestrial atmospheres. For information about the terrestrial atmosphere, see [[atmosphere of Earth]].}}

====Mercury====
{{main|Atmosphere of Mercury|}}
Due to its small size (and thus its small gravity), [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] has no substantial atmosphere. Its extremely thin atmosphere mostly consists of a small amount of helium and traces of sodium, potassium, and oxygen. These gases derive from the [[solar wind]], radioactive decay, meteor impacts, and breakdown of Mercury's crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/mercury/Atmosphere/atmosphere.html|title=Thin Atmosphere of Mercury, Formation and Composition - Windows to the Universe|author=|date=|website=www.windows.ucar.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31275|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120721222817/http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31275|deadurl=yes|title=ESA Science &amp; Technology: Mercury Atmosphere|author=|date=21 July 2012|archivedate=21 July 2012|website=esa.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury's atmosphere is not stable and is constantly being refreshed because of its atoms escaping into [[space]] as a result of the planet's heat.

====Venus====
{{main|Atmosphere of Venus}}
[[File:Venuspioneeruv.jpg|thumb|right|Atmosphere of Venus in UV, by [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]] in 1979]]
Venus' atmosphere is mostly composed of [[carbon dioxide]]. It contains minor amounts of [[nitrogen]] and other trace elements, including compounds based on [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[carbon]], and [[oxygen]]. The atmosphere of Venus is much hotter and denser than that of Earth, though shallower.  As greenhouse gases warm a lower atmosphere, they cool the upper atmosphere, leading to compact [[thermosphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=J. | last=Picone | first2= J. | last2=Lean | title=Global Change in the Thermosphere: Compelling Evidence of a Secular Decrease in Density | year=2005 | pages=225–227 | journal=2005 NRL Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | first= H. | display-authors= etal | last=Lewis | title=Response of the Space Debris Environment to Greenhouse Cooling |date=April 2005 | page=243 | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris }}&lt;/ref&gt; By some definitions, Venus has no stratosphere.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!---&lt;ref&gt;{{author1=De Pateris, I | author2=Lissauer, J | title=Planetary Science | date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;

The [[troposphere]] begins at the surface and extends up to an altitude of 65 kilometres (an altitude at which the [[mesosphere]] has already been reached on Earth). At the top of the troposphere, temperature and pressure reach Earth-like levels. Winds at the surface are a few metres per second, reaching 70&amp;nbsp;m/s or more in the upper troposphere. The [[stratosphere]] and mesosphere extend from 65&amp;nbsp;km to 95&amp;nbsp;km in height. The thermosphere and exosphere begin at around 95 kilometres, eventually reaching the limit of the atmosphere at about 220 to 250&amp;nbsp;km.

The air pressure at Venus' surface is about 92 times that of the Earth. The enormous amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere creates a strong [[greenhouse effect]], raising the surface temperature to around 470&amp;nbsp;°C, hotter than that of any other planet in the Solar System.

====Mars====
{{main|Atmosphere of Mars|Climate of Mars}}
The Martian atmosphere is very thin and composed mainly of [[carbon dioxide]], with some [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]]. The average [[surface pressure]] on Mars is 0.6-0.9 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]], compared to about 101 kPa for Earth. This results in a much lower atmospheric [[Volumetric heat capacity|thermal inertia]], and as a consequence Mars is subject to strong [[atmospheric tide|thermal tides]] that can change total atmospheric pressure by up to 10%. The thin atmosphere also increases the variability of the planet's temperature. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of approximately −140&amp;nbsp;°C (−220&amp;nbsp;°F) during the polar winters to highs of up to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;nbsp;°F) in summers.

===Gas giants===
The four outer planets of the Solar System are [[gas giants]]. They share some atmospheric commonalities. All have atmospheres that are mostly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] and that blend into the liquid interior at pressures greater than the [[critical pressure]], so that there is no clear boundary between atmosphere and body.

====Jupiter====
{{main|Atmosphere of Jupiter}}
[[Image:Redjunior.jpg|thumb|275px|Oval BA on the left and the Great Red Spot on the right]]
[[Jupiter]]'s upper atmosphere is composed of about 75%&amp;nbsp;hydrogen and 24%&amp;nbsp;helium by mass, with the remaining 1% consisting of other elements. The interior contains denser materials such that the distribution is roughly 71%&amp;nbsp;hydrogen, 24%&amp;nbsp;helium and 5% other elements by mass. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of [[methane]], [[water vapor]], [[ammonia]], and [[silicon]]-based compounds. There are also traces of [[carbon]], [[ethane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[neon]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphine]], and [[sulfur]]. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains [[crystal]]s of frozen ammonia, possibly underlaid by a thin layer of [[water]].

Jupiter is covered with a cloud layer about 50&amp;nbsp;km deep. The clouds are composed of [[ammonia]] crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the [[tropopause]] and are arranged into bands of different [[latitude]]s, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued ''zones'' and darker ''belts''. The interactions of these conflicting [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns cause storms and [[turbulence]]. The best-known feature of the cloud layer is the [[Great Red Spot]], a persistent [[anticyclone|anticyclonic]] [[storm]] located 22° south of the equator that is larger than Earth. In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller in size. The feature was named [[Oval BA]], and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior.

Observations of the [[Oval BA|Red Spot Jr.]] storm suggest [[Jupiter]] could be in a period of global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Velocities and Temperatures of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and the New Red Oval and Implications for Global Climate Change | bibcode=2006APS..DFD.FG005M | last=Marcus| first=Philip S. |display-authors=etal | journal=[[American Physical Society]] | volume=59 | pages=FG.005 |date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=New Storm on Jupiter Hints at Climate Change | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060504_red_jr.html | last=Goudarzi | first=Sara | publisher=[[Space.com]] | date=2006-05-04 | accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is hypothesized to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic [[vortex|vortices]] in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region heating up. The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new vortices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Prediction of a global climate change on Jupiter | url=http://www.me.berkeley.edu/cfd/people/marcus/nature02470.pdf | last=Marcus | first=Philip S. | date=2004-04-22 | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=428 | issue=6985 | pages=828–831 | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate=2007-05-09 | doi=10.1038/nature02470 | pmid=15103369 | bibcode=2004Natur.428..828M | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416201459/http://www.me.berkeley.edu/cfd/people/marcus/nature02470.pdf | archivedate=2007-04-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Researcher predicts global climate change on Jupiter as giant planet's spots disappear | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/04/21_jupiter.shtml | last=Yang | first=Sarah | date=2004-04-21 | publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] | accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saturn====
The outer atmosphere of [[Saturn]] consists of about 93.2% hydrogen and 6.7% helium. Trace amounts of ammonia, [[acetylene]], ethane, phosphine, and methane have also been detected. As with Jupiter, the upper clouds on Saturn are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to be composed of either [[ammonium hydrosulfide]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SH) or water.

The Saturnian atmosphere is in several ways similar to that of Jupiter. It exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, and occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals caused by storms. A storm formation analogous to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the Great White Spot, is a short-lived phenomenon that forms with a roughly 30-year periodicity. It was last observed in 1990. However, the storms and the band pattern are less visible and active than those of Jupiter, due to the overlying ammonia hazes in Saturn's troposphere.

Saturn's atmosphere has several unusual features. Its winds are among the Solar System's fastest, with [[Voyager program|Voyager]] data indicating peak easterly winds of 500&amp;nbsp;m/s. It is also the only planet with a warm polar vortex, and is the only planet other than Earth where [[eyewall]] clouds have been observed in [[hurricane]]-like structures.

====Uranus====
{{main|Atmosphere of Uranus|Climate of Uranus}}
The atmosphere of [[Uranus]] is composed primarily of gas and various ices. It is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium, 2% methane and traces of acetylene. Like Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has a banded cloud layer, although this is not readily visible without enhancement of visual images of the planet. Unlike the larger gas giants, the low temperatures in the upper Uranian cloud layer, down to 50 [[Kelvin|K]], causes cloud formation from methane rather than ammonia.

Less storm activity has been observed in the Uranian atmosphere than in those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to the overlying methane and acetylene hazes in its atmosphere making the planet look like a bland, light blue globe.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Images taken in 1997 with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] showed storm activity in that part of the atmosphere emerging from the 25-year-long Uranian winter. The general lack of storm activity may be related to the lack of an internal energy generation mechanism for Uranus, a feature unique among the gas giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Uranus' Atmosphere | url=http://www.sparknotes.com/astronomy/uranus/section3.rhtml | accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neptune====
[[Image:Neptune storms.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Great Dark Spot]] (top), [[Scooter (spot on Neptune)|Scooter]] (middle white cloud), and [[Wizard's eye]]/Dark Spot 2 (bottom).]]
The atmosphere of [[Neptune]] is similar to that of Uranus. It is about 80% hydrogen, 19% helium, and 1.5% methane. However the weather activity on Neptune is much more active, and its atmosphere is much bluer than that of Uranus. The upper levels of the atmosphere reach temperatures of about 55 [[Kelvin|K]], giving rise to methane clouds in its troposphere, which gives the planet its ultramarine color. Temperatures rise steadily deeper inside the atmosphere.
 
Neptune has extremely dynamic weather systems, including the highest wind speeds in the Solar System, thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat. Typical winds in the banded equatorial region can possess speeds of around 350&amp;nbsp;m/s, while storm systems can have winds reaching up to around 900&amp;nbsp;m/s, nearly the speed of sound in Neptune's atmosphere. Several large storm systems have been identified, including the Great Dark Spot, a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia, the Scooter, a white cloud group further south than the Great Dark Spot, and the Wizard's eye/Dark Spot 2, a southern cyclonic storm.

[[Neptune]], the farthest [[planet]] from Earth, has increased in brightness since 1980. Neptune's brightness is statistically correlated with its stratospheric temperature. Hammel and Lockwood hypothesize that the change in brightness includes a solar variation component as well as a seasonal component, though they did not find a statistically significant correlation with [[solar variation]]. They propose that the resolution of this issue will be clarified by brightness observations in the next few years: forcing by a change in sub-solar latitude should be reflected in a flattening and decline of brightness, while solar forcing should be reflected in a flattening and then resumed rise of brightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2006GL028764.shtml|title=AGU - American Geophysical Union|author=|date=|website=AGU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other bodies in the Solar System==

===Natural satellites===
Ten of the many natural satellites in the Solar System are known to have atmospheres: [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] and [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]]. Ganymede and Europa both have very tenuous oxygen atmospheres, thought to be produced by radiation splitting the water ice present on the surface of these moons into hydrogen and oxygen. Io has an extremely thin atmosphere consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide ({{chem|SO|2}}), arising from volcanism and sunlight-driven sublimation of surface sulfur dioxide deposits. The atmosphere of Enceladus is also extremely thin and variable, consisting mainly of water vapor, nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide vented from the moon's interior through [[cryovolcanism]]. The extremely thin carbon dioxide atmosphere of Callisto is thought to be replenished by sublimation from surface deposits.

====Moon====
{{main|Atmosphere of the Moon}}

====Titan====
{{main|Atmosphere of Titan}}
[[Image:Titan-Complex 'Anti-greenhouse'.jpg|thumb|right|True-color image of layers of haze in Titan's atmosphere.]]
[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] has by far the densest atmosphere of any moon. The Titanese atmosphere is in fact denser than [[Earth]]'s, with a surface pressure of 147 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]], one and a half times that of the Earth. The atmosphere is 98.4% [[nitrogen]], with the remaining 1.6% composed of [[methane]] and trace amounts of other gases such as hydrocarbons (including [[ethane]], [[diacetylene]], [[methylacetylene]], [[cyanoacetylene]], [[acetylene]], [[propane]]), [[argon]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[cyanogen]], [[hydrogen cyanide]] and [[helium]]. The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the [[Sun]]'s [[ultraviolet]] light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan has no [[magnetic field]] and sometimes orbits outside Saturn's [[magnetosphere]], directly exposing it to the [[solar wind]]. This may [[ion]]ize and carry away some molecules from the top of the atmosphere.

Titan's atmosphere supports an opaque cloud layer that obscures Titan's surface features at visible wavelengths. The [[haze]] that can be seen in the adjacent picture contributes to the moon's [[anti-greenhouse effect]] and lowers the temperature by reflecting sunlight away from the satellite. The thick atmosphere blocks most visible wavelength light from the Sun and other sources from reaching Titan's surface.

====Triton====
{{main|Atmosphere of Triton}}
[[Triton (moon)|Triton]], Neptune's largest moon, has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere with small amounts of methane. Tritonian atmospheric pressure is about 1[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]. The surface temperature is at least 35.6 K, with the nitrogen atmosphere in equilibrium with [[solid nitrogen|nitrogen ice]] on Triton's surface.

Triton has increased in absolute temperature by 5% since 1989 to 1998.&lt;ref name="MIT Triton"&gt;{{cite web| title=MIT researcher finds evidence of global warming on Neptune's largest moon | url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1998/triton.html | date=1998-06-24 | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | accessdate=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Global warming on Triton | url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A9833826AH&amp;q=&amp;uid=&amp;setcookie=yes | last=Elliot | first=James L. | authorlink=James L.

"At least since 1989, Triton has been undergoing a period of global warming. Percentage-wise, it's a very large increase," said [[James L. Elliot]], who published the report.&lt;ref name="MIT Triton"/&gt;

Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that only happens once every few hundred years. Elliot and his colleagues believe that Triton's warming trend could be driven by seasonal changes in the absorption of solar energy by its polar ice caps. One suggestion for this warming is that it is a result of frost patterns changing on its surface. Another is that ice albedo has changed, allowing for more heat from the Sun to be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Global Warming Detected on Triton | url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19980526052143data_trunc_sys.shtml | date=1998-05-28 | publisher=Scienceagogo.com | accessdate=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnie J. Buratti ''et al.'' argue the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes on the moon, such as massive venting. Because Triton's [[Bond albedo]] is among the highest within the [[Solar System]], it is sensitive to small variations in spectral [[albedo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does global warming make Triton blush? | url=http://www.bio.indiana.edu/~palmerlab/Journals/170.pdf | last=Buratti | first=Bonnie J. | display-authors=etal | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=397 | issue=6716 | date=1999-01-21 | pages=219–20 | doi=10.1038/16615 | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate=2007-05-10 | pmid=9930696 | bibcode=1999Natur.397..219B | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611233151/http://www.bio.indiana.edu/~palmerlab/Journals/170.pdf | archivedate=2007-06-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pluto]] has an extremely thin  atmosphere that consists of [[nitrogen]], [[methane]], and [[carbon monoxide]], derived from the ices on its surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nitrogen in Pluto's Atmosphere|author= Ken Croswell|url=http://www.kencroswell.com/NitrogenInPlutosAtmosphere.html|year=1992|accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two models &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Seasonal Nitrogen Cycles on Pluto | last=Hansen | first=C | last2=Paige | first2=D | journal=Icarus | date=Apr 1996 | doi=10.1006/icar.1996.0049 |bibcode = 1996Icar..120..247H | volume=120 | issue=2 | pages=247–265| citeseerx=10.1.1.26.4515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Evidence That Pluto's Atmosphere Does Not Collapse From Occultations Including The 2013 May 04 Event | last=Olkin | first=C | last2=Young | first2=L | display-authors=etal | journal=Icarus | date=March 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.03.026 |bibcode = 2015Icar..246..220O | volume=246 | pages=220–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that the atmosphere does not completely freeze and collapse when Pluto moves further from the Sun on its extremely [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]]. However, some other models do show this. Pluto needs 248 years for one complete orbit, and has been observed for less than one third of that time. It has an average distance of 39 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun, hence in-depth data from Pluto is sparse and difficult to gather. Temperature is inferred indirectly for Pluto; when it passes in front of a star, observers note how fast the light drops off. From this, they deduce the density of the atmosphere, and that is used as an indicator of temperature.

One such [[occultation]] event happened in 1988.

One astronomer has speculated the warming may be a result of eruptive activity, but it is more likely Pluto's temperature is heavily influenced by its elliptical orbit. It was closest to the [[Sun]] in 1989 ([[apsis|perihelion]]) and has slowly receded since. If it has any thermal inertia, it is expected to warm for a while after it passes perihelion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Pluto's atmosphere does not collapse | url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2013/09051420-plutos-atmosphere-does-not-collapse.html | last=Lakdawalla | first=E. | date=April 17, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "This warming trend on Pluto could easily last for another 13 years," says [[David J.

==Exoplanets==
[[File:17pHolmes 071104 eder vga.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Telescopic image of Comet [[17P/Holmes]] in 2007]]
Several planets outside the Solar System ([[exoplanet]]s) have been observed to have atmospheres. At the present time, most atmosphere detections are of hot Jupiters or hot Neptunes that orbit very close to their star and thus have heated and extended atmospheres. Observations of exoplanet atmospheres are of two types. First, transmission photometry or spectra detect the light that passes through a planet's atmosphere as it transits in front of its star.  Second, the direct emission from a planet atmosphere may be detected by differencing the star plus planet light obtained during most of the planet's orbit with the light of just the star during secondary eclipse (when the exoplanet is behind its star).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Hot atmospheres could have iron rain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/352/new-world-of-iron-rain New World of Iron Rain].

=== Abiotic oxygen ===
There are geological and atmospheric processes that produce free oxygen, so the detection of oxygen is not necessarily an indication of life.&lt;ref name='NAOJ2014'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://astrobiology.com/2015/09/oxygen-is-not-definitive-evidence-of-life-on-extrasolar-planets.html |title=Oxygen Is Not Definitive Evidence of Life on Extrasolar Planets |work=NAOJ |publisher=Astrobiology Web |date=10 September 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes of life result in a mixture of chemicals that are not in [[chemical equilibrium]] but there are also abiotic disequilibrium processes that need to be considered. The most robust atmospheric [[biosignature]] is often considered to be molecular [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) and its [[photochemical]] byproduct [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}). The [[photolysis]] of water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) by [[UV rays]] followed by [[hydrodynamic escape]] of hydrogen can lead to a build-up of oxygen in planets close to their star undergoing [[runaway greenhouse effect]]. For planets in the [[habitable zone]], it was thought that water photolysis would be strongly limited by [[Cold trap (astronomy)|cold-trapping]] of water vapour in the lower atmosphere. However, the extent of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O cold-trapping depends strongly on the amount of non-[[Condensation|condensible]] gases in the atmosphere such as [[nitrogen]] N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[argon]]. In the absence of such gases, the likelihood of build-up of oxygen also depends in complex ways on the planet's accretion history, internal chemistry, atmospheric dynamics, and orbital state. Therefore, oxygen, on its own, cannot be considered a robust biosignature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/785/2/L20| title = Abiotic Oxygen-Dominated Atmospheres on Terrestrial Habitable Zone Planets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 785| issue = 2| pages = L20| year = 2014| last1 = Wordsworth | first1 = R. | last2 = Pierrehumbert | first2 = R. |arxiv = 1403.2713 |bibcode = 2014ApJ...785L..20W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of nitrogen and argon to oxygen could be detected by studying [[infrared|thermal]] [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201116654| title = Thermal phase curves of nontransiting terrestrial exoplanets| journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics| volume = 532| pages = A1| year = 2011| last1 = Selsis | first1 = F.| last2 = Wordsworth | first2 = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11485">[[File:String technique twinkle star.png|thumb|350px|right|Hypothetical [[cello]] fingering of "[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]" with [[Position (string technique)|hand positions]] with ordinals, fingers with numbers, and strings indicated with [[Roman numerals]]. The A could instead have been played [[Stopped note|open]] like the D and the entire line could have been in 1st position.]]

In [[music]], '''fingering''', or on stringed instruments '''stopping''', is the choice of which [[finger]]s and hand [[Position (string technique)|positions]] to use when playing certain [[musical instrument]]s.  Fingering typically changes throughout a [[piece (music)|piece]]; the challenge of choosing good fingering for a piece is to make the hand movements as comfortable as possible without changing hand position too often. A fingering can be the result of the working process of the [[composer]], who puts it into the manuscript, an [[editor]], who adds it into the printed score, or the [[performer]], who puts his or her own fingering in the score or in performance.

A '''substitute fingering''' is an alternative to the indicated fingering, not to be confused with [[finger substitution]]. Depending on the instrument, not all the fingers may be used. For example, saxophonists do not use the right thumb and string instruments (usually) only use the fingers.

==Instruments==

===Brass instruments===
Fingering applies to the [[Rotary valve#Use in brass instruments|rotary]] and [[Piston valve#Brass instruments|piston valves]] employed on many brass instruments.

The [[trombone]], a fully chromatic brass instrument without valves, employs equivalent numbered notation for slide positions rather than fingering.

===Keyboard instruments===
On [[musical keyboard|keyboard instruments]] all digits are used and the thumb is considered to be a finger. So there are numbers from 1 (thumb) to five.
The numbers are related to the fingers themselves, not to the hand position on the keyboard.
After [[Cristofori]] invented the [[pianoforte]] from the [[harpsichord]] in 1700, and after it became popular in the decades after 1740, eventually replacing the harpsichord, the piano technique developed tremendously (it was parallel with the piano builders´ progress and piano pedagogy, and as part of it piano fingering changed).

====Piano====
There are only few publications about piano fingering.

It is mentioned by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (son of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]) in his book ''Versuch über die wahre Art, das Clavier zu spielen'' (''Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments'', {{ISBN|0-393-09716-1}}) where he dedicated several paragraphs to this topic (see the German original: [http://www.koelnklavier.de/quellen/versuch/kap1-1a.html "Von der Fingersetzung"]).

The British pianist [[Tobias Matthay]] wrote a small book ''Principles of Fingering'' ({{ISBN|0900180420}}).

In 1971 [[Julien Musafia]] published his book "The Art of Fingering in Piano Playing" (M.C.A., New York, N.Y., 90 pages).&lt;ref name=Musafia&gt;{{cite web|last=Musafia|first=Julien|title=The Art of Fingering in Piano Playing|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/21254231/Musafia-The-Art-of-Fingering-in-Piano-Playing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes musical examples mostly from the Beethoven's Violin and Piano Sonatas and from the Preludes and Fugues of Shostakovich.

In 2012 [[Rami Bar-Niv]] published his book "The Art of Piano Fingering -- Traditional, Advanced, and Innovative" (AndreA 1060, Tel Aviv, Israel, 212 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Piano Fingering and Establishing a Home Digital Recording Center|author=Lyn Bronson|title=Books &amp; Recordings|year=Summer 2012|publisher= California Music Teacher|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book teaches the craft of piano fingering using music examples, photos and diagrams, exercises, and injury-free techniques.

===String instruments===
[[File:Cello first position.svg|thumb|right|Cello first position fingerings]]
[[File:GuitarFingeringScore.png|thumb|left|Fingered music for guitar: the numbers '''1''' to '''4''' indicate the stopping fingers, '''0''' an open note, circled numbers strings, and dashed numbers slipping]]

On string instruments fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, beginning with the index finger, the thumb not being counted because it does not normally play on a string, and 0 indicating an [[open string (music)|open string]]. In those cases on string instruments where the thumb ''is'' used (such as high notes on a cello in [[thumb position]]), it is represented by a symbol the shape of an O with a vertical stem below(somewhat similar to Ǫ or ϙ, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of the Orchestra |last=Del Mar |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Del Mar |year=1981 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0-520-05062-2 |pages=482–484 (1987 paperback edition) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitar music indicates thumb, occasionally used to finger bass notes on the low E string, with a 'T'. [[Position (string technique)|Position]] may be indicated through [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] (e.g., 3rd) or [[Roman numeral]]s. A string may also be indicated through Roman numerals, often I-IV, or by its open-string note. A change in positions is referred to as a [[Shift (string technique)|shift]].  Guitar music indicates position with Roman numerals and string designations with circled numbers.

The [[classical guitar]] also has a fingering notation system for the [[Classical guitar#Plucking of the string|plucking]] hand, known as ''pima'' (or less commonly ''pimac''), abbreviations of Spanish; where '''p'''=''pulgar'' (thumb), '''i'''=''índice'' (index finger), '''m'''=''medio'' (middle finger), '''a'''=''anular'' (ring finger)&lt;!-- In Spanish, "anular" is spelled with a single "n". --&gt; and, very rarely, '''c'''=''chico'' (little finger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustguitar.org/curriculum.php#1 |title=Course of Study for Classical Guitar |publisher=University of Santo Tomas Conservatory of Music Guitar Department |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually only notated in scores where a passage is particularly difficult, or requires specific fingering for the plucking hand. Otherwise, plucking-hand fingering is generally left to the discretion of the guitarist.

===Woodwind instruments===
{{See also|Recorder (musical instrument)#Fingering}}

Fingering of woodwind instruments is not always simple or intuitive, depending on how the [[acoustic impedance]] of the bore is affected by the distribution and size of apertures along its length, leading to the formation of [[standing wave]]s at the desired pitch. Several alternate fingerings may exist for any given pitch.

Simple [[flute]]s (including [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s) as well as [[bagpipe]] [[chanter]]s have [[tone hole|open holes]] which are closed by the pads of the player's fingertips. Some such instruments use simple keywork to extend the player's reach for one or two notes. The keywork on instruments such as modern [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[clarinet]]s, or [[oboe]]s is elaborate and variable. Modern flutes typically use the [[Boehm system]] of keywork, while clarinets typically use a [[Boehm system (clarinet)|similarly named system]] invented by [[Hyacinthe Klosé]]. Another system of clarinet keywork, the [[Öhler system]], is used mostly in Germany and Austria.

====Cross-fingering====
&lt;!--[[Cross-fingering]] and [[cross fingering]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
{{Redirects|Cross-fingering|the fiddling technique|Bariolage}}
{{See also|Crossed fingers}}

'''Cross-fingering''' is any fingering, "requiring a closed hole or holes below an open one."&lt;ref name="Randel"&gt;Randel, Don Michael (2003). ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p.228. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674011632}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Opening successive tone holes in woodwind instruments shortens the standing wave in the bore. However, the standing wave propagates past the first open hole, so its frequency can be affected by closing other tone holes further downstream. This is called cross fingering, and in some instruments is used to produce the 'sharps and flats' missing from their natural scales."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, John and Wolfe, Joe. ''International Congress on Acoustics'', Rome, Session 8.09, pp.14-15 quoted in Larsen, Grey (2011). ''The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle'', p.42 n.VI Mel Bay. {{ISBN|9781610658898}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Baroque period cross-fingering improved, allowing music in an increasing variety of keys, but in the Classical and Romantic periods flute design changes such as larger tone holes made cross-fingering less practical while keywork increasingly provided an easy alternative to playing chromatic notes without cross-fingerings.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen (2011), p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boehm system was developed in part to replace cross-fingerings.&lt;ref name="Randel"/&gt; The first key added to the flute, the short F key,&lt;ref name="Randel"/&gt; crossed the flute's body, replacing a fingering with an open hole above a closed one, and is presumably the origin of the name for such "cross" fingerings.

'''Fork fingering''' is any fingering where a central hole is uncovered while the holes to each side are kept covered. One advantage of the [[Giorgi flute]] was that it removed the necessity of fork fingering for playing chromatic notes.&lt;ref&gt;Randel (2003), p.352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] introduced an innovation in fingering for the organ and the [[Clavichord|clavier]]. (A similar, although according to Bach's son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] less radical, innovation was introduced by [[François Couperin]], at roughly the same time in 1716, in his book ''[[L'art de toucher le clavecin]]''.) Prior to Bach, playing rarely involved the thumb. Bach's new fingering retained many features of the conventional fingering up until that point, including the passing of one finger under or over another (playing many of Bach's works requires such fingering, especially passing the third finger over the fourth or the fourth finger over the fifth.), but introduced the far greater use of the thumb.  Modern fingering also uses the thumb to a similar extent, and involves the passing of the thumb under the other fingers, but does not, as Bach's did, generally involve the passing of any other fingers over or under one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=J.S. Bach, Volume 1|author=Schweitzer, Newman, Albert Schweitzer|translator-first=Ernest|translator-last=Newman|chapter=IX. The Artist and Teacher|author2=C M Widor|year=1967|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-21631-4|pages=206–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[Mark Lindley|Lindley]] and Boxall showed that the above relies solely on C.P.E. Bach's testimony: all the extant fingerings from J.S.Bach and his circle use the ancient methods, with very limited use of the thumb. More recently it has been shown that all his harpsichord works and most of the organ works as well are playable with the old technique.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lindley and Maria Boxall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12034">In [[marketing]], '''geodemographic segmentation''' is a [[Multivariate statistics|multivariate statistical]] classification technique for discovering whether the individuals of a population fall into different groups by making [[quantitative property|quantitative]] comparisons of multiple characteristics with the assumption that the differences within any group should be less than the differences between groups.

== Principles ==
Geodemographic segmentation is based on two simple principles:
*People who live in the same neighborhood are more likely to have similar characteristics than are two people chosen at random.
*Neighborhoods can be categorized in terms of the characteristics of the population which they contain. Any two neighborhoods can be placed in the same category, i.e., they contain similar types of people, even though they are widely separated.

== Clustering algorithms ==

The use of different algorithms leads to different results, but there is no single best approach for selecting the best algorithm, just as no algorithm offers any theoretical proof of its certainty.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622811002256 | doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2011.11.004 | volume=34 | title=Comparison of two fuzzy algorithms in geodemographic segmentation analysis: The Fuzzy C-Means and Gustafson–Kessel methods | journal=Applied Geography | pages=125–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most frequently used techniques in geodemographic segmentation is the widely known k-means clustering algorithm. In fact most of the current commercial geodemographic systems are based on a k-means algorithm. Still, clustering techniques coming from artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, or fuzzy logic are more efficient within large, multidimensional databases (Brimicombe 2007).

Neural networks can handle non-linear relationships, are robust to noise and exhibit a high degree of automation. They do not assume any hypotheses regarding the nature or distribution of the data and they provide valuable assistance in handling problems of a geographical nature that, to date, have been impossible to solve. One of the best known and most efficient neural network methods for achieving unsupervised clustering is the [[Self-Organizing Map]] (SOM). SOM has been proposed as an improvement over the k-means method, for it provides a more flexible approach to census data clustering The SOM method  has been recently  used by Spielman and Thill (2008) to develop geodemographic clustering of a census dataset concerning New York City.

Another way of characterizing an individual polygon's similarity to all the regions is based on fuzzy logic. The basic concept of fuzzy clustering is that an object may belong to more than one clusters. In binary logic, the set is limited by the binary yes – no definition, meaning that an object either belongs or not to a cluster.  Fuzzy clustering allows a spatial unit to belong to more than one clusters with varying membership values. Most studies concerning geodemographic analysis and fuzzy logic employ the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm and the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; (Feng and Flowerdew  1999).

== Systems ==
Famous geodemographic segmentation systems are '''[[Claritas Prizm]]''' (US), PSYTE HD (Canada), Tapestry (US),  CAMEO (UK), ACORN (UK) and MOSAIC (UK) system.  New systems targeting subgroups of the population are also emerging. For example, Segmentos examines the geodemographic lifestyles of Hispanics in the United States. Both MOSAIC and ACORN use [[Onomastics]] to infer the ethnicity from resident names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/methods/festival/programme/urb/webber.ppt|title=Using Intelligent Systems to infer ethnicity from names, Richard Webber, UCL 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paristechreview.com/2013/09/17/onomastics-business/|title=Onomastics for business: can discrimination help development? - Paris Innovation Review|website=www.paristechreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PSYTE HD===
PSYTE HD Canada&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160419204522/https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/location-intelligence/gis-data-sets/psyte-hd-canada.html Market segmentation system for Canada PSYTE HD Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; is a geodemographic market segmentation system that classifies Canadian postal codes and Dissemination Areas into 57 unique lifestyle groups and mutually exclusive neighborhood types. PSYTE HD Canada is built on the [[Canadian Census]] demographic and socioeconomic base in addition to various other third party data inputs combined in a state of the art cluster build environment. The resultant clusters represent the most accurate snapshots of Canadian neighborhoods available. PSYTE HD Canada is an effective tool for analyzing customer data and potential markets, gaining market intelligence and insight, and interpreting consumer behavior across the diverse Canadian marketplace.

===CAMEO system===
The CAMEO Classifications are a set of consumer classifications that are used internationally by organisations as part of their sales, marketing and network planning strategies.

[https://www.cameodynamic.com/ CAMEO UK] has been built at postcode, household and individual level and classifies over 50 million British consumers. It has been built to accurately segment the British market into 68 distinct neighbourhood types and 10 key marketing segments.

Internationally [http://www.callcredit.co.uk/products-and-services/consumer-marketing-data/segmentation-analysis/cameo-global-classifications Global CAMEO] is the largest consumer segmentation system in the world, covering 40 nations. There is also single global classification [http://www.callcredit.co.uk/products-and-services/consumer-marketing-data/segmentation-analysis/cameo-global-classifications/cameo-international CAMEO International] which segments across borders.

CAMEO was developed and is maintained by [http://www.callcredit.co.uk/products-and-services/consumer-marketing-data/segmentation-analysis Callcredit Information Group].

=== Acorn system ===
A Classification Of Residential Neighborhoods ([[ACORN (demographics)|Acorn]]) is developed by CACI in London. It is the only geodemographic tool currently available that is built using current year data rather than 2011 Census information.  Acorn  helps to analyse and understand consumers in order to increase engagement with customers and service users to deliver strategies across all channels. Acorn segments all 1.9 million UK postcodes into 6 categories, 18 groups and 62 types.

=== MOSAIC system ===
[[Mosaic (geodemography)|Mosaic UK]] is Experian's people classification system. Originally created by Prof Richard Webber (visiting Professor of Geography at Kings College University, London) in association with Experian. The latest version of Mosaic was released in 2009. It classifies the UK population into 15 main socio-economic groups and, within this, 66&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segmentationportal.com/?hostRegion=UK|title=Segmentation|first=|last=Experian|website=www.segmentationportal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; different types.

Mosaic UK is part of a family of Mosaic classifications that covers 29 countries including most of Western Europe, the United States, Australia and the Far East.

Mosaic Global is Experian's global consumer classification tool. It is based on the simple proposition that the world's cities share common patterns of residential segregation. Mosaic Global is a consistent segmentation system that covers over 400 million of the world's households using local data from 29 countries. It has identified 10 types of residential neighbourhood that can be found in each of the countries.

=== geoSmart system ===

In [[Australia]], geoSmart is a geodemographic segmentation system based on the principle that people with similar demographic profiles and lifestyles tend to live near each other. It is developed by an Australian supplier of geodemographic solutions, RDA Research.

geoSmart geodemographic segments are produced from the [[Australian Census]] ([[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]) demographic measures and modeled characteristics, and the system is updated for recent household growth. The clustering creates a single segment code that is represented by a descriptive statement or a thumbnail sketch.

In Australia, geoSmart is mainly used for database segmentation, customer acquisition, trade area profiling and letterbox targeting, although it can be used in a broad range of other applications.

=== The Output Area Classification ===
{{See also|ONS coding system}}
The Output Area Classification (OAC) is the UK Office for National Statistics' (ONS) free and open geodemographic segmentation based upon the UK Census of Population 2011. It classifies 41 census variables into a three-tier classification of 7, 21, and 52 groups.

The perceived advantages of OAC over other commercial classifications stem from the fact that the methodology is open and documented, and that the data is open and freely available to both the public and commercial organizations, subject to licensing conditions.

OAC has a wide variety of potential applications, from geographic analysis to social marketing and consumer profiling. The UK public sector is one of the main users of OAC.

=== ESRI Community Tapestry ===
This method classifies US neighborhoods into 65 market segments, based on socioeconomic and demographic factors, then consolidates these 67 segments into 14 types of LifeModes with names such as "High Society", "Senior Styles", and "Factories and Farms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/data/esri_data/tapestry|title=Esri Data - Current Year Demographic &amp; Business Data - Estimates &amp; Projections|website=www.esri.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest spatial granularity of data is produced at the level of the U.S. Census Block Group.

The '''''Haute Qualité Environnementale''''' or HQE ('''High Quality Environmental standard''') is a standard for [[green building]] in [[France]], based on the principles of [[sustainable development]] first set out at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]]. The standard is controlled by the [[Paris]]-based ''Association pour la Haute Qualité Environnementale (ASSOHQE).''

==Coverage==
The standard specifies criteria for the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assohqe.org/documents_referentiels.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Managing the impacts on the outdoor environment'''
* Harmonious relationship between buildings and their immediate environment
* Integrated choice of construction methods and materials
* The avoidance of nuisance by the construction site.
* [[low energy building|Minimizing energy use]]
* Minimizing water use
* Minimizing waste in operations
* Minimizing building maintenance and repair

'''Creating a pleasant indoor environment'''
* Hydrothermal control measures
* Acoustic control measures
* Visual attractiveness
* Measures to control smells
* Hygiene and cleanliness of the indoor spaces
* Air quality controls
* Water quality controls

==Future development==
On 16 June 2009, it was announced that the CSTB ''([[Centre Scientifique et Technique du Batiment]])'' and its subsidiary CertiVéA had signed a memorandum of understanding to work together with the global arm of the United Kingdom's [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) to develop a pan-European building environmental assessment method. The BRE developed and markets ([[BREEAM]] (the BRE Environmental Assessment Method), which has similarities to the French HQE. Unfortunately, BREEAM and HQE are still disseminating their own standards round the world, leaving little doubt that no pan-European method will emerge in the near future, at least stemming from these two organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Email reply from BRE in 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==International development==
Since 2013, the HQE brand is now available for buildings and districts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behqe.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2016 HQE is present in 24 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.construction21.org/france/articles/fr/hqe-batiment-durable-une-nouvelle-offre-pour-repondre-aux-enjeux-de-la-ville-durable.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High time-resolution astrophysics''' (HTRA) is a section of [[astronomy]]/[[astrophysics]] involved in measuring and studying astronomical phenomena in time scales of 1 [[second]] [[Orders of magnitude (time)|and smaller]] (t.b.c.). This breed of astronomy has developed with higher efficiency [[Sensor|detectors]] and larger [[telescope]]s to get more [[photon]]s per second along with better computers to store and analyse the vast amounts of data acquired in one night.

Pre-existing objects can now fall into this category such as [[gamma-ray burst]] [[Visible spectrum|optical]] transients and [[pulsars]], although this relatively new science is concentrated in the optical/[[infrared]] regime and time limits are yet to be set as to what is high time-resolution.

A '''hotbed''' is a biological term for an area of decaying [[organic matter]] that is warmer than its surroundings.  The heat gradient is generated by the [[decompose|decomposition]] of organic substituents within the pile by microorganism metabolization.

A hotbed covered with a small glass cover (also called a '''hotbox''') is used as a small version of a hothouse (heated [[greenhouse]]). Oftentimes, this bed is made of [[manure]] from animals such as [[horse]]s.  These animals pass undigested plant [[cellulose]] in their [[droppings]], creating a good environment for microorganisms to come and break down the cellulose and create a hotbed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hotbed|title=Definition of HOTBED|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some egg-laying animals, such as the [[brush turkey]], make or use hotbeds to [[Avian incubation|incubate]] their eggs.

By extension, the term ''hotbed'' is used metaphorically to describe an environment that is ideal for the growth or development of something, especially of something undesirable.

{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}

An '''idler-wheel''' drive is a system used to transmit the rotation of the main shaft of a motor to another rotating device, for example the platter of a record-reproducing [[Phonograph|turntable]] or the crankshaft-to-camshaft gear train of an automobile.

==Friction drive==
An idler-wheel may be used as part of a [[friction drive]] mechanism, as in a [[phonograph]], or as a [[belt tensioner]] in a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt drive]] system.

==Idler gear==
[[File:Gears large.jpg|thumb|Gears in a machine. The middle, medium-sized gear is an idler gear.|alt=Part of a machine with three gears connected to one another.]]
An idler gear is a gear wheel that is inserted between two or more other gear wheels. The purpose of an idler gear can be two-fold. Firstly, the idler gear will change the direction of rotation of the output shaft. Secondly, an idler gear can assist to reduce the size of the input/output gears whilst maintaining the spacing of the shafts.

===Gear ratio===
An idler gear does not affect the [[gear ratio]] between the input and output shafts. Note that in a sequence of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.

Likewise, the size of an idler wheel in a non-geared friction drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the output shaft. A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant speed regardless of the size of the idler wheel (unless of course there is slippage, which should nor occur in most friction drive systems when operating correctly; however, there are instances where an idler wheel can double as a clutch, or if there is a sudden or unusually heavy load on the system. These situations can cause the ratio of rotations between the wheels to vary, unlike a gear system, which will always rotate at a certain rate unless something is very wrong and the gears starts skipping teeth, or teeth are broken off).

===Applications===
;Reversing
An intermediate gear which does not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an idler gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be referred to as a reverse idler. For instance, the typical [[automobile]] [[manual transmission]] engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears. Since a driven gear (gear "A") rotating clockwise will drive a second gear ("B") counterclockwise, adding a third gear to the string means that gear "C" will be spinning the same direction as "A". A typical transmission is designed with "A" and "B" gears, so when the engine spins, the outputs shaft spins the ''opposite'' direction, which drives the vehicle ''forward''. A reverse idler gear setup is actually typically an "A" and a "C" gear, which are not in contact with each other until a "B" gear is moved between them. Since the transmission is designed to move the car ''forwards'' when the output is spinning in the ''opposite'' direction from the input shaft, when added to the "B" idler gear, it forces the "C" gear to spin in the same direction as the "A" gear, and thus the input and output shafts are spinning in the same direction, which drives the car in reverse.

Another scenario is a series of rollers, such as used for pressing paper. Each roller has to be powered, but adding a motor to each one is wasteful (and it can be difficult to synchronize rotational speed with independent drive systems). One could simply add a gear onto the end of the shaft of each roller, but that means that each roller would be spinning the opposite direction of the one before (and therefore rubbing against each other as the turn). By simply adding a small idler gear between each larger gear, the result is a series of rollers, all being powered in the same direction.

;Transmission over distance
Idler gears can also transmit rotation among distant shafts in situations where it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, but the mass and rotational inertia ([[moment of inertia]]) of a gear is [[quadratic function|quadratic]] in proportion to its [[radius]]. Instead of idler gears, of course, a [[toothed belt]] or a [[roller chain]] can be used to transmit torque over distance. For short distances, a train of idlers may be used; whether an odd or even number is used determines whether the final output gear rotates the same direction as the input gear or not. For longer distances, a roller chain or belt is quieter and creates less friction, although gears are typically stronger, depending on the strength of the roller chain. A case where numerous idler gears might be used is as described above, where there are a number of output gears that need to be driven simultaneously.

[[Continuous track|'''Caterpillar track''']] '''idler wheels'''

A tracked vehicle uses a combination of wheels and rollers, including [[Sprocket|''drive sprockets'']], ''idler wheels'', ''track return rollers'' and ''road wheels''. It is quite similar in concept to a [[conveyor belt]], only instead of a machine carrying objects on top of a powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a [[Sprocket|''drive sprocket'']] (or drive wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On the opposite end of the vehicle, there is an ''idler wheel'', which provides a [[pulley|pulley wheel]]  of sorts. On some applications, the drive sprocket and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the drive sprocket and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the drive sprocket is on the front (see [[M4 Sherman]] for an example). Since the drive sprocket can be at either the front (M4 Sherman, many other WWII tanks) or the rear ([[T-90]], most modern tanks) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the drive sprocket (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the drive sprocket and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its ''rotation''), this has nothing to do with the term "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The ''road wheels'' are a series of non-powered wheels between the drive sprocket and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the drive sprocket, in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. ''Track return rollers'' may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid "road" for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created "road", while the drive sprocket forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down "fresh" track. The idler picks the "used" track back up, and returns it back to the drive sprocket in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a "track-laying machine" (not to be confused with [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see [[corduroy road]], [[plank road]]). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.

Note that there are some non-powered tracked transports (i.e. [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a drive sprocket. There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the [[Caterpillar D9]] bulldozer (and numerous other Caterpillar brand bulldozers), [[Tucker Sno-Cat|Tucker Sno-cat]] and [[Mattracks Inc.|Mattracks]] rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks in the shape of a triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the drive sprocket at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one drive sprocket (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-[[axle]] truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic [[half-track]] system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.

Planning and designing manufacturing processes and equipment is a main aspect of being an industrial technologist. An Industrial Technologist is often responsible for implementing certain designs and processes.
== Accreditation and certification ==

The USA based [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in Industrial Technology in the USA. An instructor or graduate of an Industrial Technology program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering [[Production Planning]] &amp; Control, Safety, Quality, and Management/Supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) for accrediting Industrial Technology programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U.S. for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in
the United States.(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge base ==

"A career in industrial technology typically entails formal education from an accredited college or university. Opportunities are available to professionals with all levels of education. Those who hold associate degrees typically qualify for entry-level technician and technologist positions, such as in the maintenance and operation of machinery. Bachelor's degree-holders could fill management and engineering positions, such as plant manager, production supervisor and quality systems engineering technologist. A graduate degree in industrial technology could qualify individuals for jobs in research, teaching and upper-level management".&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

Industrial Technology includes wide-ranging subject matter and could be viewed as an amalgamation of [[industrial engineering]] and business topics with a focus on practicality and management of technical systems with less focus on actual engineering of those systems.

Typical curriculum at a four-year university might include courses on [[manufacturing|manufacturing process]], technology and impact on society, mechanical and electronic systems, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control|control]], [[materials science]], [[packaging]], [[Operations management|production and operations management]], and manufacturing facility planning and design. In addition, the Industrial Technologist may have exposure to more [[Vocational education|vocational-style education]] in the form of courses on [[CNC]] manufacturing, [[welding]], and other tools-of-the-trade in manufacturing.

== Industrial technologist ==

Industrial technology program graduates obtain a majority of positions which are applied engineering and/or management oriented.  Since "industrial technologist" is not a common job title in the United States, the actual bachelor's degree or associate degree earned by the individual is obscured by the job title he/she receives. Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a bachelor's degree include quality systems engineering technologist, manufacturing engineering technologist, industrial engineering technologist, plant manager, production supervisor, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Common Industrial Technology Jobs "&gt;{{cite web|title= What Are Some Common Jobs in the Field of Industrial Technology? |url=http://learn.org/articles/What_are_Some_Common_Jobs_in_the_Field_of_Industrial_Technology.html|publisher=utr zfeqaLearn.org|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a two-year associate degree include project technologist, manufacturing technologist, process technologist, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

A technologist curriculum may focus or specialize in a certain technical area of study. Examples of this includes [[electronics]], [[manufacturing]], [[construction]], [[graphics]], [[automation]]/[[robotics]], [[CADD]], [[nanotechnology]], [[aviation]], etc.

== Technological development in industry ==

A major subject of study is technological development in industry. This has been defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the introduction of new tools and techniques for performing given tasks in production, distribution, data processing (etc.);
* the mechanization of the production process, or the achievement of a state of greater autonomy of technical production systems from human control, responsibility, or intervention;
* changes in the nature and level of integration of technical production systems, or enhanced interdependence;
* the development, utilization, and application of new scientific ideas, concepts, and information in production and other processes; and
* enhancement of technical performance capabilities, or increase in the efficiency of tools, equipment, and techniques in performing given tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. ''Technological Development in Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', ISR Publications, Manchester UK, revised second edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-29-4}}.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Studies in this area often employ a multi-disciplinary research methodology and shade off into the wider analysis of [[business]] and [[economic growth]] (development, performance). The studies are often based on a mixture of industrial field research and desk-based data analysis and aim to be of interest and use to practitioners in business management and investment (etc.) as well as academics. In [[engineering]], [[construction]], [[textiles]], [[food]] and [[drugs]], [[chemicals]] and [[petroleum]], and other industries, the focus has been on not only the nature and factors facilitating and hampering the introduction and utilization of new technologies but also the impact of new technologies on the production organization (etc.) of firms and various social and other wider aspects of the technological development process.&lt;ref&gt;''Technological Development In Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

How and When Technological development in industry Performed :
#Technological Processes based always on (Material, Equipment, Human skills and operating circumstances.
#So, If any of these parameters changed, we have to re-calibrate this technology to match the designed product.
#This re-calibration can't be considered as a technology change because industrial technology is not more than an Engineering guide to achieve the required specification of the designed product.
#To calibrate any industrial technology, we should make a documented copy of manufacturing experiments until matching the final product specifications based on original technology, new changed parameters and scientific basics.
#Finally, documentation of the new change should be done to the original industrial technology for that new case as a new addition.
#Any application of industrial technology for 1st time or after a long time stop,Technology processes should be tested by a primary samples triers as a Re-calibration process.

The '''killer ape theory''' or '''killer ape hypothesis''' is the theory that [[war]] and interpersonal [[aggression]] was the driving force behind [[human evolution]]. It was originated by [[Raymond Dart]] in the 1950s; later it was developed further in ''[[African Genesis]]'' by [[Robert Ardrey]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Ardrey"&gt;{{cite book

According to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other [[primate]] species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many [[murder]]ous instincts.

The theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do [[violence]] was a fundamental part of human [[psychology]]. The [[hunting hypothesis]] is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both.

==Definition==
The expression ''killer ape'' does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression.

As founder of this thesis, [[Raymond Dart|Raymond A. Dart]] (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article ''The predatory transition from ape to man'', 1953.&lt;ref name="Dart"&gt;{{cite journal

==The predatory transition from ape to human==

===The step from ape to human===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] refers to the Australian anatomist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology.

The question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Smith]] excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion.

Until [[Raymond Dart]] found the [[Australopithecus africanus]] (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved.

===The "Taung Child"===
This approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “[[Taung Child]]”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. [[Robert Broom]] (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the [[Australopithecus africanus]].

However, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow.

Both [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Broom|Broom]], as well as [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry.

===The findings of Makapan===
Osseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes.

These findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed.

This new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals.

===The "proto-men"===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] to bring them more in line with humans.

Observations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in ''The predatory transition from ape to man'' by [[Raymond Dart]].&lt;ref name="Dart"/&gt; He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior.

===The eating habits===
Concerning the eating habits from then until now, [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive [[cannibalism]]) are the results.

A deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive.

==Reception==
The comment written by the editor of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]]. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of ''nobody else''.”

Another obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] thesis by a scientific convention at [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] ([[Zambia]], Southern Africa), which led [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]] into writing his book ''African Genesis''. He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor.

The ethologist [[Konrad Lorenz]] also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;{{cite book

| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rIVK7wuY3kIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction he describes rival butterfly fish defending their territory, leading him to raise the question of whether humans, too, tend to intraspecific conflict.

The [[Seville Statement on Violence]], released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular [[warfare]] as genetically determined.

A 2008 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Dan Jones stated that "A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the [[Cinderella effect]]). [[Chimpanzee]]s have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between [[ingroup and outgroup]] which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced [[blood feud]]s due to better functioning [[justice system]]s may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = D. | title = Human behaviour: Killer instincts | doi = 10.1038/451512a | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 512–515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18235473| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book ''War, Peace, and Human Nature'' (2013), edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]].&lt;ref name=Haas&amp;Piscitelli&gt;See for example Jonathan Haas and [[Matthew Piscitelli]] (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/2968441/The_Prehistory_of_Warfare_Misled_by_Ethnography?login=&amp;email_was_taken=true "The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography"] In War, Peace, and Human Nature edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]], pp. 168-190. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in fiction==
Movies such as ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on [[Pierre Boulle]]’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic.

This theory can be seen in the opening sequence of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and also appears in the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs.  (The names of ''Dart'' and ''[[Ardrey]]'' were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into "''Drayer''" who purportedly came up with his world's "killer ape theory".)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2582">In [[mathematics]], '''Laplace's principle''' is a basic [[theorem]] in [[large deviations theory]] which is similar to [[Varadhan's lemma]]. It gives an [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic expression]] for the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]] of exp(&amp;minus;''&amp;theta;&amp;phi;''(''x'')) over a fixed set ''A'' as ''&amp;theta;'' becomes large. Such expressions can be used, for example, in [[statistical mechanics]] to determining the limiting behaviour of a system as the temperature tends to [[absolute zero]].

==Statement of the result==

Let ''A'' be a [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue-measurable]] [[subset]] of ''d''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; and let ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a [[measurable function]] with

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A e^{-\varphi(x)} \,dx &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to \infty} \frac1{\theta} \log \int_A e^{-\theta \varphi(x)} \, dx = - \mathop{\mathrm{ess \, inf}}_{x \in A} \varphi(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ess&amp;nbsp;inf denotes the [[essential infimum]]. Heuristically, this may be read as saying that for large ''&amp;theta;'',

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A e^{-\theta \varphi(x)} \, dx \approx \exp \left(-\theta \mathop{\mathrm{ess \, inf}}_{x \in A} \varphi(x) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

The Laplace principle can be applied to the family of [[probability measure]]s '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;theta;''&lt;/sub&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}_\theta (A) = \left( \int_A e^{-\theta \varphi(x)} \, dx \right) \bigg/ \left( \int_{\mathbf{R}^{d}} e^{-\theta \varphi(y)} \, dy \right)&lt;/math&gt;

to give an asymptotic expression for the probability of some event ''A'' as ''&amp;theta;'' becomes large. For example, if ''X'' is a standard [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]] on '''R''', then

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} \varepsilon \log \mathbf{P} \big[ \sqrt{\varepsilon} X \in A \big] = - \mathop{\mathrm{ess \, inf}}_{x \in A} \frac{x^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for every measurable set ''A''.

'''Lawler’s algorithm''' is a powerful technique for solving a variety of constrained scheduling problems.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nahmias. Production and Operations Analysis. 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-07-126370-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[algorithm]] handles any precedence constraints. It schedules a set of simultaneously arriving tasks on one processor with precedence constraints to minimize maximum tardiness or lateness. Precedence constraints occur when certain jobs must be completed before other jobs can be started.

==Objective Functions==
The [[objective function]] is assumed to be in the form &lt;math&gt;min \, max_{0\le i \le n} \, g_i(F_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; is any [[nondecreasing function]] and &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the flow time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Y-T. Leung. Handbook of scheduling: algorithms, models, and performance analysis. 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-58488-397-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When &lt;math&gt;g_i (F_i) = F_i - d_i = L_i&lt;/math&gt;, the objective function corresponds to minimizing the maximum lateness, where &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is due time for job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; lateness of job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Another expression is &lt;math&gt;g_i (F_i) = max {(F_i-d_i,0)}&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to minimizing the maximum tardiness.

==Algorithm==

The algorithm works by planning the job with the least impact as late as possible. Starting at &lt;math&gt;t = \sum p_j&lt;/math&gt;.
 &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; set of already scheduled jobs (at start: S = &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;)
 &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; set of jobs which successors have been scheduled (at start: all jobs without successors)
 &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; time when the next job will be completed (at start: &lt;math&gt;t = \sum p_j&lt;/math&gt;)
 '''while'''&lt;math&gt;J \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;:
     select &lt;math&gt;j \in J&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_j(t) = min_{k \in J}f_k(t)&lt;/math&gt;
     schedule &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; such that it completes at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
     add &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, delete &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; and update &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.
     &lt;math&gt;t = t - p_j&lt;/math&gt;
 '''end while'''

The '''Malta Environment and Planning Authority''' (MEPA) was the national agency responsible for the environment and planning in [[Malta]]. The national agency was established to regulate the environment and planning on the Maltese islands of Malta, [[Gozo]] and other small islets of the Maltese [[archipelago]].  MEPA is bound to follow the regulations of the Environment Protection Act (2001) and the Development Planning Act (1992) of the Laws of Malta. The national agency is also responsible for the implementation of Directives, Decisions and [[Regulations]] under the EU Environmental [[Acquis]] as Malta is a member of the [[European Union]], while considering other recommendations and opinion of the Union. The Authority employs over 420 government workers, from a wide range of educational backgrounds, all within their merit of [[profession]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/organisation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818062627/http://www.mepa.org.mt/organisation |archivedate=2015-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mepa.org.mt/home?l=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002073155/http://www.mepa.org.mt/home?l=1 |archivedate=2009-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Officio delle Case''' was the planning authority during the [[Order of St. John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolnet.gov.mt/history/wirt/Kavallieri/bini-belt/UnderneathVal.htm|title=Underneath Valletta|website=www.schoolnet.gov.mt|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==

MEPA acts as the national representation under a number of international environmental conventions and multilateral agreements.
These include information supported by the [[Aarhus Convention]]:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*On access to information;
*Public participation in decision-making;
*Access to justice in environmental matters.

==Governance==

The Agency is governed by a board of professional, whose responsibility is to provide strategic guidance within, laid by the laws of Malta. The board comprising a maximum of 15 personnel led by the [[Executive Chairman]], Perit Vincent Cassar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.mt/en/Government/Government%20of%20Malta/Ministries%20and%20Entities/Officially%20Appointed%20Bodies/Pages/Authorities/Malta-Environment-and-Planning-Authority.aspx|title=Malta Environment and Planning Authority|website=www.gov.mt|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members within the board, include two representative members of the [[Parliament of Malta]], who are knowledgeable and experienced about matters relating to the environment and development such ranging from: commercial, industrial and [[social affairs]]. A number of appointed boards and committees provide strategic guidance or expert advise to the [[wikt:Special:Search/directorate|directorates]] to ensure that the organization fulfils its functions and responsibilities efficiently and effectively, in line with legal obligations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Responsibility==

MEPA’s operational functions and responsibilities are carried out by the work of four main [[structures]], namely:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*The Chairman’s Office is responsible for providing the framework within which the MEPA Board together with the [[Government agency|Commissions]] and [[Committee]]s operate.
*The [[secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] is the point of reference for issuing and communicating the Board's and Commissions' decisions and in this context are a primary point of contact for ministries, departments and agencies as well as the general public.
*The [[Communication]]s Office and Complaints office are an integral part of the function of this office.

==Aim==

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the implementation of the aims and supervise and control the Directorates. The CEO and other directors, are responsible for developing the necessary strategies. The Planning Directorate processes environment and planning applications. It is responsible for enforcement, policy development and plan making, transport planning and research and other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56189/mepa_executive_chairman_at_governments_mercy#.VdxvAsRHmrU|title=MEPA executive chairman at government’s mercy|publisher=|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==

The [[Enforcement]] Directorate is responsible for both Development Control and [[Environmental Protection]] and for supporting the Authority in enforcement campaigns including Direct Action, enforcement, [[surveillance]] and actions as necessary to ensure compliance with the building development permits and to protect the environment to help achieve a sustainable environmental improvement. The Environment Protection Directorate advises Government on environmental standards and policies, draws up plans and provides a licensing regime to safeguard and monitor the environment and controls the activities having environmental impact. The Directorate for Corporate Services, is responsible for [[Human Resources]], [[Information Technology]], [[Cartography|Mapping]] and Land-surveying, support services and [[Finance]]. There are a number of boards and committees, which provide strategic guidance for the Directorates to ensure the organization fulfils its functions and responsibilities efficiently and effectively, in line with its legal obligations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The '''Manufacturing Engineering Centre''' ('''MEC''') is an international R&amp;D Centre of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing and Information Technology.  The MEC was founded in 1996 under the directorship of Professor Duc Truong Pham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | title = Professor Duc Truong Pham | url = http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/mechanical-engineering/people/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=22591&amp;Name=professor-duc-truong-pham | publisher = University of Birmingham | date = | accessdate = 5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre forms part of [[Cardiff University]], which dates back to 1883 and is one of Britain's major civic universities.

The MEC's purpose is to conduct research and development in all major areas of Advanced Manufacturing and use the output to promote the introduction of new manufacturing technology and practice to industry. It was the first autonomous [[research center|research centre]] created by Cardiff University.&lt;ref name="psychcentral"&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | title = Cardiff University experts solve manufacturing problem | url = http://psychcentral.com/news/archives/2006-01/cu-cue011706.html | publisher = Psych Central | date = | accessdate = 5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The MEC conducts basic, strategic and applied research as well as technology transfer with partners from 22 countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas.  The research spans a broad spectrum of subjects, from [[Robotics]] and Microsystems, Sensor Systems, High-speed [[Automation]] and [[Intelligent Control]], [[Rapid manufacturing]], MicroManufacturing, [[Nanotechnology]], Quality Engineering, [[Multimedia]], [[Virtual Reality]] and Enterprise Information Management.

Since 1996, the Centre has received over £50 million in grants and contracts and has attracted hundreds of industrial partners.  In 2004, the MEC won two EC 6th Framework Networks of Excellence contracts totalling 15M Euros in value.  The two Networks of Excellence led by the MEC, I*PROMS and 4M, involve some 50 centres of excellence in the field of Advanced Manufacturing across the EU. 
  
As a Centre of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration (CETIC) sponsored by the [[Welsh Assembly]] Government (WAG) and the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF), the MEC has contributed significantly to the Welsh economy, having completed thousands of projects with local companies and helped to generate and safeguard jobs in the region.&lt;ref name="cardiff"&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Manufacturing Engineering Centre (MEC) - Quality of Research | url = http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/rae/results/mec/ | publisher = Cardiff University | date =  | accessdate = 5 November 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220823/http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/rae/results/mec/ | archivedate = 5 November 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Under Professor Pham's leadership, the MEC was awarded the DTI University/Industry First Prize by the [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] for its success in  building research partnerships with industry (March 1999), and the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for Higher and Further Education in recognition of its contribution made to the economy (February 2001).&lt;ref name="cardiff" /&gt;

[[File:William Scott Luce Window Malmesbury Abbey.jpg|thumb|A Morris &amp; Co. [[stained glass window]] to a design by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] installed in [[Malmesbury Abbey]]. The window shows characteristic themes based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]].]]

'''Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.''' (1861–1875) was a [[furniture|furnishings]] and [[decorative arts]] manufacturer and retailer founded by the artist and designer [[William Morris]] with friends from the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]]. With its successor '''Morris &amp; Co.''' (1875–1940) the firm's [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-inspired aesthetic and respect for [[craft|hand-craftsmanship]] and traditional [[textile arts]] had a profound influence on the decoration of churches and houses into the early 20th century.

Although its most influential period was during the flourishing of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in the 1880s and 1890s, Morris &amp; Co. remained in operation in a limited fashion from [[World War I]] until its closure in 1940.  The firm's designs are still sold today under licences given to [[Sanderson and Sons]] part of the [[Walker Greenbank]] wallpaper and fabrics business (which owns the "Morris &amp; Co." brand&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkergreenbank.com/morris-and-co-anniversary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty of London]].

==Early years==
[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Design for ''Trellis'' wallpaper, 1862]]

Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., "Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals," was jointly created by Morris, [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Peter Paul Marshall|P. P. Marshall]], and [[Philip Webb]] in 1861 to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1901, "William Morris"&lt;/ref&gt; The  prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, [[stained glass]],  metal-work, paper-hangings, [[chintz]]es (printed fabrics), and [[carpet]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Morris, William |volume=18 |pages=871–873 |first=Arthur |last=Waugh }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first headquarters of the firm were at 8 [[Red Lion Square]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The work shown by the firm at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] attracted much notice, and within a few years it was flourishing. In the autumn of 1864 a severe illness obliged Morris to choose between giving up his home at [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in Kent and giving up his work in London. With great reluctance he gave up Red House, and in 1865 established himself under the same roof with his workshops, now relocated to larger premises in Queen Square, [[Bloomsbury]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. A great wave of church-building and remodelling by the [[Church of England]] in the 1840s and 1850s increased the demand for ecclesiastical decoration of all kinds, especially stained glass.  But this market shrank in the general depression of the later 1860s, and the firm increasingly turned to secular commissions.&lt;ref name="Bus"&gt;Charles Harvey and Jon Press, "The Businessman." in Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  On its non-ecclesiastical side, the product line was extended to include, besides painted windows and mural decoration, furniture, metal and glass wares, cloth and paper wall-hangings, [[embroidery|embroideries]], [[jewellery]], woven and knotted carpets, [[silk]] [[damask]]s, and [[tapestry|tapestries]].

Morris was producing repeating patterns for wallpaper as early as 1862, and some six years later he designed his first pattern specifically for fabric printing. As in so many other areas that interested him, Morris chose to work with the ancient technique of [[woodblock printing on textiles|hand woodblock printing]] in preference to the [[roller printing on textiles|roller printing]] which had almost completely replaced it for commercial uses.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry, pp. 36"&gt;Parry, ''William Morris Textiles'', pp. 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganization and expansion==
In August 1874, Morris determined to restructure the partnership, generating a dispute with Marshall, Rossetti, and Madox Brown over the return on their shares. The company was dissolved and reorganized under Morris's sole ownership as Morris &amp; Co. on 31 March 1875.&lt;ref name="Bus" /&gt;

During these years, Morris took up the practical art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He spent much of his time at the [[Staffordshire]] dye works of [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Thomas Wardle]], mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate [[indigo dye|indigo]] dyeing as a practical industry, and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, like [[Rose madder|madder]], which had been driven almost out of use by the [[aniline dyes|anilines]].

Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry, pp. 36"/&gt;

[[File:L L Pocock Pond at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|''The Pond at Merton Abbey'' by [[Lexden Lewis Pocock]] is an idyllic representation of the works in the time of William Morris.]]
In June 1881, Morris relocated his dyeworks from Queen Square to an early eighteenth-century silk-throwing works at [[Merton Abbey Mills]], after determining that the water of the [[River Wandle]] was suitable for dyeing.  The complex, on {{convert|7|acre|m2}}, included several buildings and a dyeworks, and the various buildings were soon adapted for stained-glass, textile printing, and fabric- and carpet-weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, ''William Morris'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Morris had taught himself [[tapestry]] weaving in the medieval style and set up a tapestry workshop with his apprentice [[John Henry Dearle]] at Queen Square.&lt;ref name="Text1"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris Textiles'', New York, Viking Press, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;  Dearle executed Morris and Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by [[Walter Crane]] in 1883.&lt;ref name="Tapestry"&gt;Waggoner, ''The Beauty of Life'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Dearle was soon responsible for the training of all tapestry apprentices in the expanded workshop at Merton Abbey, and partnered with Morris on designing details such as fabric patterns and floral backgrounds for tapestries based on figure drawings or ''cartoons'' by Burne-Jones (some of them repurposed from stained glass cartoons).&lt;ref name="Text1" /&gt; and animal figures by Philip Webb. Suites of tapestries were made as part of whole-house decorating schemes, and tapestries of Burne-Jones angels and scenes from the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] were a staple of Morris &amp; Co. into the twentieth century.

==Important commissions==
Two significant secular commissions helped establish the firm's reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at [[St. James's Palace]] and the "green dining room" at the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert]]) of 1867. The green dining room (preserved as the Morris Room at the V&amp;A) featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones, panels with branches of fruit or flowers by Morris, and olive branches and a frieze by Philip Webb. The St. James's commission comprised decorative schemes for the Armoury and the Tapestry Room, and included panels of stylized floral patterns painted on ceilings, [[cornice]]s, [[Dado (architecture)|dado]]s, windows, and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Parry, "Domestic Decoration." In Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Morris &amp; Co. were responsible for the windows at [[All Saints Church, Wilden|All Saints]] church in the village of [[Wilden, Worcestershire|Wilden]] near to [[Stourport-on-Severn]]. They were designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] for [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred Baldwin]], his wife's brother-in-law.

[[Standen]] near [[East Grinstead]], [[West Sussex]], was designed between 1892 and 1894 by Philip Webb for a prosperous [[London]] solicitor, James Beale, his wife Margaret, and their family. It is decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers.

Stanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris &amp; Co. before Morris's death in 1896. It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of [[Holy Grail tapestries|tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail]] for the dining room, to which Morris devoted his energies, the rest of the work being executed under the direction of Dearle.&lt;ref name="Dom"&gt;Linda Parry, "Domestic Decoration." In Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Morris &amp; Co. commissions include the ceiling within the dining room of [[Charleville Forest Castle]], Ireland, interiors of Bullers Wood House, now [[Bullers Wood School]] in [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]], and stained glass windows at [[Adcote]].

==Last stages==
[[File:Morris and Company Textile Printing Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|Textile printing at [[Merton Abbey Mills|Merton Abbey]] c. 1890, from a booklet commemorating the 50th anniversary of the firm, 1911]]

As Morris pursued other interests, notably [[socialism]] and the [[Kelmscott Press]], day-to-day work at the firm was delegated. Morris's daughter [[May Morris|May]] became the director of the embroidery department in 1885, when she was in her early twenties.  Dearle, who had begun designing repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles in the late 1880s,&lt;ref name="Text2"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris Textiles'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; was head designer for the firm by 1890, handling interior design commissions and supervising the tapestry, weaving, and fabric-printing departments at [[Merton Abbey Mills|Merton Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ed.: ''William Morris'', Abrams, 1996, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Dearle's contributions to textile design were long overshadowed by Morris. Dearle exhibited his designs under the Morris name rather than his own in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts Exhibition]]s and the major Morris retrospective of 1899,&lt;ref name="TAC"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''Textiles of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement'', Thames and Hudson, revised edition 2005, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; and even today many Dearle designs are popularly offered as "William Morris" patterns.

On Morris's death in 1896, Dearle became Art Director of the firm, which changed its name again to Morris &amp; Co. Decorators Ltd. in 1905.&lt;ref name="Dom" /&gt; Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932.&lt;ref name="TAC" /&gt; The firm was finally dissolved in the early months of [[World War II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">The '''National Vulnerability Database''' is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP). This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. NVD includes databases of security checklists, security related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics. NVD supports the [[Information Security Automation Program]] (ISAP).

On Friday March 8, 2013, the database was taken offline after it was discovered that the system used to run multiple government sites had been compromised by a software vulnerability of [[Adobe ColdFusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/14/adobe_coldfusion_vulns_compromise_us_malware_catalog/ "Adobe software vulnerabilities blamed for NIST NVD infection."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/14/us_malware_catalogue_hacked/ "US national vulnerability database hacked."]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2017, threat intel firm [[Recorded Future]] revealed that the median leg between a CVE2 being revealed to ultimately being published to the NVD is 7 days and that 75% of vulnerabilities are published unofficially before making it to the NVD, giving attackers time to exploit the vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/75--of-vulns-shared-online-before-nvd-publication/d/d-id/1329066"75% of Vulns Shared Online Before NVD Publication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to providing a list of [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVEs), the NVD scores vulnerabilities using the [[Common Vulnerability Scoring System|Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)]] which is based on a set of equations using metrics such as access complexity and availability of a remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/cvsseq2.htm |title=NVD - CVSS v2 Equations |website=nvd.nist.gov |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221044001/http://nvd.nist.gov/cvsseq2.htm |archive-date=2013-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ornamental animal''' is an animal kept for display or curiosity, often in a [[park]].  A wide range of mammals, birds and fish have been kept as ornamental animals.  Ornamental animals have often formed the basis of [[Introduced species|introduced]] populations, sometimes with negative ecological effects, but a history of being kept as ornamental animals has also preserved breeds, types and even [[species]] which have become rare or [[extinction|extinct]] elsewhere.

This article does not cover animals kept in [[zoo]]s, [[wildfowl]] collections or [[aquarium|aquaria]].

==History==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
Ornamental animals have been kept for many centuries in several cultures.

==Introduced species==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
Some ornamental animals have escaped from captivity and have formed [[feral]] populations.

==Conservation==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
A number of animals have been protected from local or worldwide extinction by being kept as ornamental animals.

==List of ornamental animals==
The following are breeds or species whose history has included a significant period as ornamental animals, either globally or in particular regions (animals kept primarily in modern zoos, aquaria or waterfowl collections are not included):
{{Expand list|date=December 2010}}
&lt;!-- Please limit list to types kept primarily as ornamental animals, not animals kept for conservation, deliberate introductions or escapes from farms or zoos. --&gt;

===Deer===
*'''[[Père David's Deer|Pere David's deer]]''' (''Elaphurus davidianus'').  Became extinct in the wild before 1900, but survived in the park of the Chinese Emperor near Peking.  Died out there too, but survived in [[Woburn Park]] in England.  Now reintroduced to the wild in [[China]].
*'''[[Reeves's Muntjac|Reeves's muntjac]]''' (''Muntiacus reevesi'').  Escaped from [[Woburn Park]] in England, and now established as a [[feral]] animal throughout much of lowland England, causing considerable damage to native woodland.
*'''[[Sika Deer|Sika]]''' (''Cervus nippon'').  Established in the [[UK]] and other places from park escapes.  Poses a [[Genetic pollution|hybridisation threat]] to other deer species such as [[Red Deer]] ''Cervus elephas''.
*'''[[Water Deer|Water deer]]''' (''Hydropotes inermis'').  Another species which has escaped from Woburn Park, having a feral population in the surrounding area of England.

===Cattle===
*'''[[British White]]'''.  White cattle with red or black ears were kept in parks in Britain and Ireland over many hundreds of years.  [[Polled livestock|Polled]] (hornless) herds and individuals of these formed the basis of the usually black-eared British White.
*'''[[Galloway cattle|Galloway]]'''.  Polled, woolly cattle, originally from [[Scotland]] but also often kept as park animals in Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries, especially as colour forms such as the [[Belted Galloway]].
*'''[[White Park cattle|White Park]]'''.  A white, usually black-eared beef breed derived from [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]ed herds and individuals of the British park cattle.
**'''[[Chillingham Cattle|Chillingham]]'''.  A red-eared type of White Park which lives only as a feral animal at [[Chillingham Castle]] in northern England (and at one other site).
**'''[[Vaynol (cattle)|Vaynol]]'''.  A black-eared type of White Park recognised as a separate rare breed, from the [[Vaynol]] estate in [[North Wales]].

===Sheep===
*'''[[Black Welsh Mountain sheep|Black Welsh Mountain]]'''.  A colour variety of [[Welsh Mountain Sheep]], with a history as an ornamental animal.
*'''[[Castlemilk Moorit]]'''.  A short-tailed breed of sheep, developed in Scotland as an ornamental animal from crosses of other breeds and [[Mouflon|wild sheep]].
*'''[[Hebridean (sheep)|Hebridean]]'''.  A black, short-tailed breed of [[sheep]], often multi-horned.  It is derived from multi-coloured sheep kept in the [[Hebrides]] since the [[Iron Age]], which became extinct there in the late 19th century.  A population survived in parks in England and [[Scotland]], where they became always black, probably from cross-breeding with another ornamental breed, Jacob sheep.
*'''[[Jacob (sheep)|Jacob]]'''.  A pied, often multi-horned breed of sheep which was kept in parks in England for several centuries.  Unrelated to other British sheep, but of uncertain origin.

===Goats===
*'''[[Bagot goat|Bagot]]'''.  A small, pied goat with large horns, kept at [[Blithfield Hall]], Staffordshire, England, reputedly since the [[Middle Ages]], and probably derived originally from [[Valais Blackneck|similar goats]] from the [[Rhone]] region of [[Switzerland]] and [[France]].

===Other mammals===
*'''[[Eastern grey squirrel]]''' (''Sciurus carolinensis''). Introduced as an ornamental animal to England and other places, and established as a feral animal; implicated in the steep decline in mainland [[Great Britain]] of the native [[Red Squirrel]] (''Sciurus vulgaris'').
*'''[[Red-necked wallaby]]''' (''Macropus rufogriseus'').  Escaped or introduced to various areas in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[New Zealand]].

'''Palustrine wetlands''' include any inland [[wetland]] that lacks flowing water, contains ocean-derived salts in concentrations of less than 0.5 [[parts per thousand]], and is non-[[tide|tidal]].&lt;ref name=Cowardin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cowardin|first1=L.

Palustrine wetlands are one of five categories of wetlands within the [[Cowardin classification system]].  The other categories are:&lt;ref name=Cowardin /&gt;
* [[Marine (ocean)|Marine]] wetlands, exposed to the open ocean
* [[Estuarine]] wetlands, partially enclosed by land and containing a mix of fresh and salt water
* [[Riverine]] wetlands, associated with flowing water
* Lacustrine wetlands, associated with a [[lake]] or other body of fresh water

{{Wiktionary|philandry}}

'''Philandry''' is fondness, love, or admiration towards [[men]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t140.e58312 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Philandry |edition=2nd revised |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=philandry |title=Philandry |work=[[WordNet]] |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[antonym]] is ''[[misandry]]''. Philandry is not to be confused with [[androphilia]], which is [[sexual attraction]] to men or [[masculinity]] (and whose antonym is ''[[androphobia]]'').

== Etymology ==
''Philandry'' comes from ''philo-'' (loving) and Greek ''andro'' (man). The parallel [[Greek language|Greek]]-based terms with respect to women (females) are [[philogyny]] for "fondness towards women" and [[misogyny]] for "hatred of women". Parallel terms for humanity in general are [[philanthropy]] and [[misanthropy]].

The lines are produced by transitions from a higher energy level of an electron to a level with [[principal quantum number]] ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4. The lines have wavelengths:

*4551&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)
*5411&amp;nbsp;Å (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)
*10123&amp;nbsp;Å (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4)

The transitions from the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8 states overlap with [[hydrogen]] lines and are not seen in stellar spectra.

In 1896, Pickering published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectra of the star [[Puppis|&amp;zeta;-Puppis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Pickering|first = E.

In [[Buddhist studies]], particularly East Asian Buddhist studies, '''post-canonical Buddhist texts''', '''Buddhist apocrypha''' or '''Spurious Sutras and Sastras''' designate texts that are not accepted as canonical by some historical Buddhist schools or communities who referred to a [[Tripitaka|canon]]. The term is principally applied to texts that purport to represent Buddhist teaching translated from Indian texts, but were written in East Asia.{{sfn|Muller|1998|p=63}}&lt;ref name="李学竹"&gt;李学竹.

'''Psychological biblical criticism''' &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051212143640/http://www.aramaicnt.org/site/index.php?mode=article&amp;entry=95 Psychological Biblical Criticism: An exciting hermeneutic in the study of Scripture]&lt;/ref&gt; is a re-emerging field within [[biblical criticism]] that seeks to examine the psychological dimensions of scripture through the use of the [[behavioral science]]s. The title itself involves a discussion about "the intersections of three fields: [[psychology]], the Bible, and the tradition of rigorous, critical reading of the biblical text." (Kille, 2001). Known figures within biblical scholarship advocating this interdisciplinary field in the United States include [[Rev. D. Andrew Kille]] (2001; 2004), [[J. Harold Ellens]] (2004), [[Wayne G. Rollins]] (1983; 1999; 2004), and, in Europe, [[Eugen Drewermann]] (Beier, 2004), [[Gerd Theissen]] (1983, 1987, 2007).

Rollins was the first to define psychological biblical criticism as having the [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] intent of examining
{{quote|"... texts, their origination, authorship, modes of expression, their construction, transmission, translation, reading, interpretation, their transposition into kindred and alien forms, and the history of their personal and cultural effect, as expressions of the structure, processes, and habits of the human psyche, both in individual and collective manifestations, past and present." (1999:77–78)}}

==The worlds of Scripture==
Unlike many other forms of [[biblical criticism]], psychological biblical criticism is not a particular ''method'' for interpretation, but is rather a ''perspective'' (Kille, 2001). This approach to the biblical text seeks to complement studies on the cultural, sociological, and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] influences on scripture, by discussing the psychological dimensions of: the authors of the text, the material they wish to communicate to their audience, and the reflections and meditations of the reader. As a result, the material under study involves three dimensions of text (Rollins, 1983; Kille, 2001; 2004). 

===The world ''behind'' the text===
What was the author of the text thinking? What was their background, why were they writing? What situations drove them to put pen to paper and produce this work? What is the cultural, historical, and social context of the text? Although traditional uses of psychological theory in the study of ancient texts have sought to generate a complete psychoanalysis of scriptural writers, there has always been the hindrance of temporal and cultural distance between the analyst and analysand. Psychological biblical criticism best serves not as a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] tool, but as another heuristic for use alongside traditional methods of historical and cultural criticism, illuminating aspects of purpose and meaning in the language and cognition of texts (Kille, 2001: 22–23; 2004: 23–25). In essence, a study of the world behind the text involves such questions as "... what makes them write the way they do and what realities, truths, and insights they want to share with us." (Rollins, 1983: 99).

===The world ''of'' the text===
Why did [[King Saul]] decide try to skewer [[David]]—his greatest warrior—with a spear? Why did [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] hand [[Jesus]] over? What is the meaning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] Chapter 1? To analyze the world of the text is to "describe the qualities of a character as he or she is presented in the text" (Kille, 2001:24), their actions and relationships, as well as develop insight into the motivations the writer has programmed into them. Kille in particular warns that one should be wary of trying to reach beyond the world of the text to the actual historical persons, since one may accidentally perform the function of [[eisegesis]] rather than [[exegesis]]. The world of the text may also shine light on the conditions and intent of the writer. On the one hand the characters and events within the text may reflect more the writer's socio-cultural situation than actual events, while at the same time they may inform us as to what the writer desires from us—transformation, repentance, enlightenment, etc. (Kille, 2004).

===The world ''in front of'' the text===
{{quote|"... we often come to Scripture with the question 'What is this book?', but discover that this book asks us, 'Who is this that reads it?' ... Each of us carries... a set of values, a list of personal problems, a well seasoned worldview, and a large dose of humanity, wherever we go and to whatever task we undertake. When we approach Scripture we come with the same baggage. It is not possible to come in any other way."|sign=Wayne G. Rollins, 1983:98}}

How do I approach the text? What does the text ask of me? How do I respond to it? What meaning do I give to this relationship? The world in front of the text discusses the interplay between the text before our very eyes and the [[Eisegesis|eisegetical]] processes that take place within our mind. In this exchange the interest is not in the psychological world of the writer, or the original meaning of the text and the characters displayed, but in how the reader manipulates, interprets, and is filled by the text; how they make it relevant to their lives, how it "speaks" to them, and how this relationship reflects their personal world (Rollins 1983: 97–100; Kille, 2001: 25–27; 2004: 27–29).

==The Bible and psychology in transition==
{{quote|"Psychology and Biblical studies are thus inevitably interlinked, regardless of what the immediate focus or concern of either is. Hence, whether we are exploring the biblical text or the living human document, the mutual illumination of psychology and biblical studies is imperative because a properly enlightened anthropology is required for both ... Because both disciplines deal with the psycho-spiritual domains, neither of these can ignore the other or it is not adequately serious about itself."|sign=[[J. Harold Ellens]], 2004:284}}

A psychological study of the [[hermeneutical]] levels of religious texts has the capability of granting a better understanding not only of the text itself, but also of the mind that produced it, the mind that it describes, and the mind that interacts with it. This knowledge has promise for interdisciplinary application as well, by informing the field of [[religious studies]], the [[psychotherapeutic encounter]], and the [[psychology of religion]]. Hence, proponents of psychological biblical criticism argue that it has the potential of crossing the gap between psychology and religion, providing a platform for dialogue without reducing religion to mere drives and internal objects, but by discussing the aspects of this very human mode of meaning ([[J. Harold Ellens|Ellens]], 2004).

A '''secondary city''' often follows after a [[primate city]] and can be seen in the [[urban hierarchy]].
Secondary cities have between “500,000 to 3 million inhabitants, but are often unknown outside of their national or regional context. Many secondary cities in the [[Global South]] are expected to undergo massive expansions in the next few decades, comparable to city growth in Europe and North America over the past two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Brillembourg &amp; Hubert Klumpner, "[http://www.nsl.ethz.ch/index.php/content/view/full/2582 Gran Horizonte: Taking a Walk in the Urban Planet]", Network City and Landscape. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

"A secondary city is largely determined by population, size, function, and economic status. Commonly, secondary cities are geographically defined urban jurisdictions or centres performing vital governance, logistical, and production functions at a sub-national or sub-metropolitan region level within a system of cities in a country. In some cases, their role and functions may expand to a geographic region of the global realm. The population of secondary-cities range between 10 and 50% of a country's largest city, although some can be smaller than this. They will likely constitute a sub-national or sub-metropolitan second-tier level of government, acting as centres for public administration and delivery of education, knowledge, health, community, and security services; an industrial centre or development growth pole; a new national capital; or a large city making up a cluster of smaller cities in a large metropolitan region."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014&gt;Roberts B. and Hohmann R. (2014), [http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/CIVIS%20SECONDARY%20CITIES_Final.pdf The Systems of Secondary Cities - The neglected drivers of urbanizing economies], CIVIS #7, Cities Alliance: Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, secondary cities “usually form more recent poles of growth, often also with a more diffuse genealogy, than larger metropoles. The ambivalent situation of these towns (in the periphery of the center and in the center of the periphery, in so far as these notions still retain their meaning) generates a particular, and by definition highly hybrid, socio-cultural urban dynamic which in turn influences the outlook of social, political and economic life in the more visible national metropoles.”&lt;ref&gt;Ann Cassiman, Filip De Boeck, Steven Van Wolputte,(2009, September), ''Recentering the City: An Anthropology of Secondary Cities in Africa.'' Institute for Anthropological Research in Africa (IARA), University of Leuven, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary cities have their own socio-economic and political culture that may differ from other cities such as Primate cites. Moreover, in the '''secondary city''' (and more generally in the margin of the state) there often is more room for improvisation. Local commerce, trading routes and smuggling networks determine the economic sphere in important ways; local forms of associational life (the middle ground of ‘civil society’) has a far greater influence on local politics than is the case in larger urban centers, and the functioning of local, decentralized political authorities is often shaped and cross-cut to a far greater extent by constantly shifting alliances between local stakeholders.”&lt;ref&gt;Dennis A. Rondinelli, "Dynamics of Growth of Secondary Cities in Developing Countries". In ''Geographical Review'', American Geographical Society, '''Vol. 73''', No. 1 (Jan., 1983), pp. 42-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
According to [[UN-HABITAT]], "slum population now expands annually by 25 million. In 1950 there were 86 cities in the world with a population over one million, today there are 400, and by 2015, there will be at least 550."&lt;ref&gt;UN Population Division,''[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2007/2007WUP_Highlights_web.pdf World urbanization prospects]'', 2007 Revision, New York 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, cities have absorbed nearly two-thirds of the global population explosion since 1950 and are currently growing by a million babies and migrants each week.&lt;ref&gt;''Population information program, population reports: meeting the urban challenge,'' '''Vol. xxx''', No. 4, fall 2002, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, countries like India are developing secondary cities to absorb informals—as India's chief economic planner, Montek singh Ahluwalia in 2007, observes: "One hundred million people are moving to cities in the next 10 years, and it’s important that these 100 million are absorbed into second-tier cities instead of showing up in Delhi or Mumbai."&lt;ref&gt;Anand Giridharadas,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/world/asia/13nagpur.html?_r=0 Second Tier’ City to Rise Fast Under India’s Urban Plan]", New York Times, May 13, 2007. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, where primary cities long monopolized growth, secondary cities like Tijuana, Curitiba, Temuco, Salvador and Belem are now booming, "with the fastest growth of all occurring cities with between 100,000 and 500,000 inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel villa and Jorge Rodriguez, "Demographic trends in Latin America’s metropolises,1950-1990", in Alan Gilbert, ''The mega-city in Latin America'', Tokyo 1996, pp. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, China "may still be under the radar for many westerners but China's second and third-level cities will rise in profile over the next few years."&lt;ref&gt;The Travel and Expense News Source, [http://www.berteloot.com/2013/02/02/special-report-chinas-secondary-cities/ "Special Report: China's Secondary Cities"], February 2, 2013. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; New city developments by governments and other organizations are now focusing on secondary cities. Sociologist [[Saskia Sassen]] suggests that “small cities can be a global platform for companies' global expansion.”&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/23/cities-world-ten-forbeslife-cx_mw_1023cities.html World's Next Great Cities]", Forbes, October 23, 2010. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in China, "[t]he world's top hotel companies are clambering to open properties in China's second- and third-tier cities across all their brands. The sheer size of even tertiary cities, coupled with the growth in domestic travel and the potential gains of modern, international meeting facilities, has led to hotel development at unprecedented levels."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cei.asia/Article/308459,big-hotel-openings-in-chinas-secondary-cities.aspx Big Hotel openings in China's Secondary Cities], CEI Asia, July 12, 2012. Accessed September 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These new developments are tying to integrate secondary cities into the global and local economy as well from the examples that are seen from China. Another development is that [[China Eastern Airlines]] has increased its number of flights to secondary cities in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesstraveller.asia/asia-pacific/news/china-eastern-linking-up-secondary-chinese-cities China Eastern links secondary Chinese cities], ''Business Traveller'', November 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
According to the World Bank, secondary Cities make up almost 40% of the world cities population. Nearly two-thirds of these are located in Africa and Asia: "They form an important part of an emerging global system of cities."&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, ''Systems of Cities Integrating National and Local Policies Connecting Institutions and Infrastructures.'' 2009, World Bank: Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; While the large cities play a significant role in shaping the new economic geography of cities in fostering global trade, travel and investment, it is secondary cities which will have a much stronger influence in the future upon the economic development of countries."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014a&gt;Roberts B. and Hohmann R. (2014), [https://www.conftool.com/landandpoverty2014/index.php/Roberts-348_paper.doc?page=downloadPaper&amp;filename=Roberts-348_paper.doc&amp;form_id=348&amp;form_version=final Secondary Cities: Managing Urban Land Governance Systems]. Paper presented at the World Bank and Land Poverty 2014: Uses of Spatial Data in Urban Management&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categories===
Secondary cities fall into three categories or typologies:

# Sub-national cities being centres of local government, industry, agriculture, tourism and mining; 
# City cluster development associated with expanded, satellite and new town cities which surround large urban metropolitan regions, and; 
# Economic trade corridors which are urban growth centre or poles planned or developing along major transport corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts B. (2014) The Systems of Secondary Cities. Definition, Trends and Policy Responses in International Development. Cities Alliance: Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

"While the industrial revolution and 20th century national self-sufficiency industrialization policies, were to have a profound impact in shaping the development of countries, the current thrust of globalization is changing the dynamics and development of cities, especially developing cities, in ways few would have envisaged half a century ago. There is now growing levels of functional specialization and linkages occurring within the system of secondary cities. The new economic geography has increased competition in small, medium sized cities from international producers and markets. Growing specialization of production systems, supply chains, SMART logistics and inter-modal transfer systems, and the externalization of decision making by expanded consultation, decision-making and investment decisions well outside local government jurisdictions."&lt;ref name=Roberts2014a/&gt; If the efficiency of secondary cities were to improve this could double or triple the GDP of many poor cities and rural regions. In the countries where there is a less distorted system of secondary cities, countries that are not dominated by one mega city, there is generally lower levels of regional development disparities, higher levels of national productivity and income per capita"&lt;ref&gt;Roberts B. (2014), "System of Secondary Cities: Why they are Important to the Sustainable Development of Nations and Regions", Power Point presentation for the Networking Event: Secondary Cities- Key Links for Equitable and Sustainable City Systems organised by Cities Alliance and IADB at the WUF 7 in Medellin&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual dysfunction''' (or '''sexual malfunction''' or '''sexual disorder''') is difficulty experienced by an individual or a couple during any stage of a normal [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], including physical pleasure, [[Sexual desire|desire]], preference, [[sexual arousal|arousal]] or [[orgasm]]. According to the [[DSM-5]], sexual dysfunction requires a person to feel extreme distress and [[interpersonal]] strain for a minimum of six months (excluding substance or medication-induced sexual dysfunction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolen-Hoeksema|first=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=2 Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10121|isbn=978-1-259-06072-4|pages=366–367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual dysfunctions can have a profound impact on an individual's perceived quality of sexual life.&lt;ref name= "eden"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eden K.J., Wylie K.R. | year = 2009 | title = Quality of sexual life and menopause | url = | journal = Women's Health | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 385–396 | doi = 10.2217/whe.09.24 | pmid = 19586430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexual disorder'' may not only refer to physical sexual dysfunction, but to [[paraphilia]]s as well; this is sometimes termed ''disorder of sexual preference''.

A thorough sexual history and assessment of general health and other sexual problems (if any) are very important. Assessing performance [[anxiety]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[worry]] are integral to the optimal management of sexual dysfunction. Many of the sexual dysfunctions that are defined are based on the [[human sexual response cycle]], proposed by [[Masters and Johnson|William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson]], and then modified by [[Helen Singer Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=William H.

==Categories==
Sexual dysfunction disorders may be classified into four categories: [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder|sexual desire disorders]], [[sexual arousal disorder|arousal disorders]], [[Anorgasmia|orgasm disorders]] and [[sexual pain disorder|pain disorders]].

===Sexual desire disorders===
{{Main|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder}}
Sexual desire disorders or decreased [[libido]] are characterized by a lack or absence for some period of time of [[sexual desire]] or [[libido]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or of [[sexual fantasies]]. The condition ranges from a general lack of sexual desire to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. The condition may have started after a period of normal sexual functioning or the person may always have had no or low sexual desire.

The causes vary considerably, but include a possible decrease in the production of normal [[estrogen]] in women or [[testosterone]] in both men and women. Other causes may be aging, fatigue, pregnancy, medications (such as the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]) or psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety. While a number of causes for low sexual desire are often cited, only some of these have ever been the object of empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice, William (2007): "Sexual Desire Disorders in Men." in ed. Leiblum, Sandra:  ''Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy'' (4th ed.)  The Guilford Press.  New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual arousal disorders===
{{main|Sexual arousal disorder}}
Sexual arousal disorders were previously known as [[Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|frigidity]] in women and [[impotence]] in men, though these have now been replaced with less judgmental terms. Impotence is now known as [[erectile dysfunction]], and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems that can be broken down into four categories as described by the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'': lack of desire, lack of arousal, pain during intercourse, and lack of orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hartley H | year = 2006 | title = The 'pinking' of Viagra culture: Drug industry efforts to create and repackage sex drugs for women | doi = 10.1177/1363460706065058 | journal = Sexualities | volume = 9 | issue = 3| page = 365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both men and women, these conditions can manifest themselves as an aversion to, and avoidance of, sexual contact with a partner. In men, there may be partial or complete failure to attain or maintain an erection, or a lack of sexual excitement and pleasure in sexual activity.

There may be physiological origins to these disorders, such as decreased blood flow or lack of vaginal lubrication. Chronic disease can also contribute, as well as the nature of the relationship between the partners.

Additionally, the condition postorgasm illness syndrome (POIS) may cause symptoms when aroused, including adrenergic-type presentation; rapid breathing, paraesthesia, palpitations, headaches, aphasia, nausea, itchy eyes, fever, muscle pain and weakness and fatigue.

From the onset of arousal, symptoms can persist for up to a week in patients.

The aetiology of this condition is unknown, however it is believed to be a pathology of either the immune system or autonomic nervous systems. It is defined as a rare disease by the NIH but the prevalence is unknown.  It is not thought to be psychiatric in nature, but it may present as anxiety relating to coital activities and thus may be incorrectly diagnosed as such. There is no known cure or treatment.&lt;ref name="rarediseases.info.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome | title=Postorgasmic illness syndrome &amp;#124; Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erectile dysfunction===
{{Main|Erectile dysfunction}}
Erectile dysfunction or impotence is a sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis. There are various underlying causes, such as damage to the [[nervi erigentes]] which prevents or delays erection, or diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease, which simply decreases blood flow to the tissue in the penis, many of which are medically reversible.

The causes of erectile dysfunction may be psychological or physical. Psychological erectile dysfunction can often be helped by almost anything that the patient believes in; there is a very strong placebo effect. Physical damage is much more severe. One leading physical cause of ED is continual or severe damage taken to the nervi erigentes. These nerves course beside the prostate arising from the sacral plexus and can be damaged in prostatic and colorectal surgeries.

Diseases are also common causes of erectile dysfunctional; especially in men. Diseases such as cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, kidney failure, vascular disease and spinal cord injury are the source of erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2013). Sexual Dysfnctions. In Abnormal Psychology. McGraw Hill Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its embarrassing nature and the shame felt by sufferers, the subject was taboo for a long time, and is the subject of many urban legends. Folk remedies have long been advocated, with some being advertised widely since the 1930s. The introduction of perhaps the first pharmacologically effective remedy for impotence, [[sildenafil]] (trade name Viagra), in the 1990s caused a wave of public attention, propelled in part by the news-worthiness of stories about it and heavy advertising.

It is estimated that around 30 million men in the United States and 152 million men worldwide suffer from erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = NIH. Consensus Development Panel on Impotence.| year = 1993 | title = Impotence | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 270 | issue = | pages = 83–90 | doi=10.1001/jama.270.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayta I, Mckinlay J, Krane R | year = 1999 | title = The likely worldwide increase in erectile dysfunction between 1995 and 2025 | url = | journal = BJU Int | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 50–56 | doi=10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.00142.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, social stigma, low health literacy and social taboos lead to under reporting which makes an accurate prevalence rate hard to determine.

The Latin term [[impotentia coeundi]] describes simple inability to insert the [[penis]] into the [[vagina]]. It is now mostly replaced by more precise terms.

===Premature ejaculation===
{{Main|Premature ejaculation}}

Premature ejaculation is when ejaculation occurs before the partner achieves orgasm, or a mutually satisfactory length of time has passed during intercourse. There is no correct length of time for intercourse to last, but generally, premature ejaculation is thought to occur when ejaculation occurs in under two minutes from the time of the insertion of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;Waldinger M.D., Berenden H.H., Blok B.F., et al. ''Premature Ejaculation and Serotengeric Anti-depressants - Induced Delayed Ejaculation: The Involvement of the Serotonergic System.'' Behavioural Brain Res. 1998;92(2): 111-118&lt;/ref&gt; For a diagnosis, the patient must have a chronic history of premature ejaculation, poor ejaculatory control, and the problem must cause feelings of dissatisfaction as well as distress the patient, the partner or both.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz V.A. &amp; Close J.D. ''Male Sexual Dysfunction'' Primary Care 2010;37(3): 473 - 489.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically attributed to psychological causes, new theories suggest that premature ejaculation may have an underlying neurobiological cause which may lead to rapid ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;Lauman E.O., Nicolosi, A., Glasser D.B., et al. ''Sexual Problems among women and men aged 40 to 80 years: Prevalence and Correlates Identified in a GLobal Study of Sexual Attitudes and Behaviours.'' International Journal of Impotence Research. 2005;7(1): 39 - 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orgasm disorders===
{{Main|Anorgasmia}}
Orgasm disorders, specifically anorgasmia, present as persistent delays or absence of orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase in at least 75% of sexual encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|first1=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-259-06072-4|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disorder can have physical, psychological, or pharmacological origins. [[SSRI]] antidepressants are a common pharmaceutical culprit, as they can delay orgasm or eliminate it entirely. A common physiological culprit of anorgasmia is [[Sexual dysfunction#menopause|menopause]], where one in three women report problems obtaining an orgasm during sexual stimulation following menopause.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan. "Abnormal Psychology". McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages; 6 Edition, 2013. p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to this there are what is called post-orgasm disorders, which would better categorise the condition: postorgasm illness syndrome (see post-orgasm disorders section).

===Sexual pain disorders===
Sexual pain disorders affect women almost exclusively and are also known as [[dyspareunia]] (painful intercourse) or [[vaginismus]] (an involuntary spasm of the muscles of the vaginal wall that interferes with intercourse).

Dyspareunia may be caused by insufficient lubrication ([[vaginal dryness]]) in women. Poor lubrication may result from insufficient excitement and stimulation, or from hormonal changes caused by [[menopause]], [[pregnancy]], or breastfeeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sex.

It is unclear exactly what causes vaginismus, but it is thought that past sexual trauma (such as [[rape]] or [[Domestic violence|abuse]]) may play a role. Another female sexual pain disorder is called [[vulvodynia]] or [[vulvar vestibulitis]]. In this condition, women experience burning pain during sex which seems to be related to problems with the skin in the vulvar and vaginal areas. The cause is unknown.

===Post-orgasmic diseases===
Post-orgasmic diseases cause symptoms shortly after [[orgasm]] or [[ejaculation]]. [[Post-coital tristesse]] (PCT) is a feeling of [[depression (mood)|melancholy]] and [[anxiety]] after sexual intercourse that lasts for up to two hours. [[Sexual headache]]s occur in the skull and neck during sexual activity, including masturbation, arousal or orgasm.

In men, [[postorgasmic illness syndrome]] (POIS) causes severe [[myalgia|muscle pain]] throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following [[ejaculation]]. The symptoms last for up to a week.&lt;ref name=Balon2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Sexual Dysfunction | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |veditors=Balon R, Segraves RT | year=2005 | isbn=9780824758264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wylie2015&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH64CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Post%20orgaasmic%20illness%20syndrome&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Post-orgasmic%20illness%20syndrome&amp;f=false | title=ABC of Sexual Health | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2015 | pages=75 | isbn=9781118665565 | editor=Wylie KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GARD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Postorgasmic illness syndrome | encyclopedia=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) | publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] | accessdate=30 July 2015 | year=2015 | url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome/resources/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some doctors speculate that the frequency of POIS "in the population may be greater than has been reported in the academic literature",&lt;ref name=Ashby2010&gt;{{cite journal | title=Postorgasm illness syndrome--a spectrum of illnesses. |vauthors=Ashby J, Goldmeier D | journal=J.

Symptomology of POIS may present as adrenergic-type presentation; rapid breathing, paraesthesia, palpitations, headaches, aphasia, nausea, itchy eyes, fever, muscle pain and weakness and fatigue.

From the onset of orgasm, symptoms can persist for up to a week in patients.

The aetiology of this condition is unknown, however it is believed to be a pathology of either the immune system or autonomic nervous systems. It is defined as a rare disease by the NIH but the prevalence is unknown.  It is not thought to be psychiatric in nature, but it may present as anxiety relating to coital activities and thus may be incorrectly diagnosed as such. There is no known cure or treatment.&lt;ref name="rarediseases.info.nih.gov"/&gt;

[[Dhat Syndrome]] is another condition which occurs in men. It is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] which causes anxious and dysphoric mood after sex, but is distinct from the low-mood and concentration problems (acute aphasia) seen in postorgasm illness syndrome.

===Pelvic floor dysfunction===
{{Main|Pelvic floor dysfunction}}
Pelvic floor dysfunction can be an underlying cause of sexual dysfunction in both women and men, and is treatable by physical therapy.&lt;ref name="malepelvicfloor.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://malepelvicfloor.com/sd.html | title=Male Pelvic Floor: Advanced Massage and Bodywork}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | author = | year = 2008 | title = The Role of Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy in the Treatment of Pelvic and Genital Pain-Related Sexual Dysfunction | url = | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 513–523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncommon sexual disorders in men===
Erectile dysfunction from [[vascular disease]] is usually seen only amongst [[old age|elderly]] individuals who have [[atherosclerosis]]. Vascular disease is common in individuals who have [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[hypertension]] and those who smoke. Any time [[blood flow]] to the penis is impaired, erectile dysfunction is the end result.

[[Hormone]] deficiency is a relatively rare cause of erectile dysfunction. In individuals with testicular failure like in [[Klinefelter syndrome]], or those who have had [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]] or childhood exposure to [[mumps virus]], the testes may fail and not produce testosterone. Other hormonal causes of erectile failure include brain tumors, [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]] or disorders of the [[adrenal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip_300/381_love_tip.html Strange sexual disorders] Ask Men. Retrieved on February 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural abnormalities of the penis like [[Peyronie's disease]] can make sexual intercourse difficult. The disease is characterized by thick fibrous bands in the penis which leads to a deformed-looking penis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangesexualdisorders.com/ Analysis of abnormal sexual disturbances] 2010-02-18{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drugs are also a cause of erectile dysfunction. Individuals who take drugs to lower [[blood pressure]] or use [[antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, sedatives, narcotics, antacids or alcohol can have problems with sexual function and loss of libido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=A |last2=Chaudhry |first2=M |last3=Elewski |first3=B |title=Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea nigra, and piedra |journal=Dermatologic Clinics |volume=21 |pages=395–400, v |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/S0733-8635(03)00031-7 |pmid=12956194 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Priapism]] is a painful erection that occurs for several hours and occurs in the absence of [[sexual stimulation]]. This condition develops when blood gets trapped in the penis and is unable to drain out. If the condition is not promptly treated, it can lead to severe scarring and permanent loss of erectile function. The disorder occurs in young men and children. Individuals with [[sickle-cell disease]] and those who abuse certain medications can often develop this disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777603-overview Priapism in Emergency Medicine], [[eMedicine]]. Retrieved on 2010-02-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

There are many factors which may result in a person experiencing a sexual dysfunction. These may result from emotional or physical causes. Emotional factors include interpersonal or psychological problems, which can be the result of [[clinical depression|depression]], sexual fears or guilt, past sexual trauma, and sexual disorders,&lt;ref name="Michetti_et_al_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michetti |first1=P M |last2=Rossi |first2=R |last3=Bonanno |first3=D |last4=Tiesi |first4=A |last5=Simonelli |first5=C |title=Male sexuality and regulation of emotions: a study on the association between alexithymia and erectile dysfunction (ED) |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=170–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16151475 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901386}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Sexual dysfunction is especially common among people who have [[anxiety disorders]]. Ordinary anxiousness can obviously cause erectile dysfunction in men without psychiatric problems, but clinically diagnosable disorders such as [[panic disorder]] commonly cause avoidance of intercourse and premature ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astrokapoor.com/ask/premature-ejaculation-treatment@60.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pain during intercourse is often a comorbidity of anxiety disorders among women.&lt;ref name="Coretti"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Coretti G, Baldi I|title=The Relationship Between Anxiety Disorders and Sexual Dysfunction |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=24 |issue=9 |date=August 1, 2007|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/anxiety/article/10168/54881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical factors that can lead to sexual dysfunctions include the use of drugs, such as alcohol, [[nicotine]], [[narcotic]]s, stimulants, [[antihypertensive drug|antihypertensives]], [[antihistamine]]s, and some psychotherapeutic drugs.&lt;ref name="Saks"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Saks BR|title=Common issues in female sexual dysfunction |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=25 |issue=5 |date=April 15, 2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/sexual-issues/article/10168/1153918}}&lt;/ref&gt; For women, almost any physiological change that affects the reproductive system—[[premenstrual syndrome]], pregnancy and the postpartum period, menopause—can have an adverse effect on libido.&lt;ref name="Saks"/&gt; Injuries to the back may also impact sexual activity, as can problems with an enlarged prostate gland, problems with blood supply, or nerve damage (as in [[sexuality after spinal cord injury|sexual dysfunction after spinal cord injuries]]). Diseases such as [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[tumor]]s, and, rarely, tertiary [[syphilis]] may also impact the activity, as could the failure of various organ systems (such as the heart and lungs), [[endocrine]] disorders ([[thyroid]], [[pituitary]], or [[adrenal gland]] problems), hormonal deficiencies (low [[testosterone]], other [[androgen]]s, or [[estrogen]]) and some [[birth defect]]s.

Pelvic floor dysfunction is also a physical and underlying cause of many sexual dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="malepelvicfloor.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pelvicpainhelp.com/pelvic-floor-dysfunction/ | title=Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, Perineum Pain, Sore Pelvis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.beyondbasicsphysicaltherapy.com/sexual-dysfunction | title=Sexual Dysfunction &amp;#124; Beyond Basics Physical Therapy &amp;#124; New York City, Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 2746737 | pmid=18448734 | doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31816bbe85 | volume=111 | issue=5 | title=Female sexual function and pelvic floor disorders | author=Handa VL, Cundiff G, Chang HH, Helzlsouer KJ | journal=Obstet Gynecol | pages=1045–52| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of heterosexual relationships, one of the main reasons for the decline in sexual activity among these couples is the male partner experiencing erectile dysfunction. This can be very distressing for the male partner, causing poor body image, and it can also be a major source of low desire for these men.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; In aging women, it is natural for the vagina to [[Menopause#Urogenital atrophy|narrow and become atrophied]]. If a woman has not been participating in sexual activity regularly (in particular,  activities involving vaginal penetration) with her partner, if she does decide to engage in penetrative intercourse, she will not be able to immediately accommodate a penis without risking pain or injury.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; This can turn into a vicious cycle, often leading to female sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

According to Emily Wentzell, American culture has anti-aging sentiments that have caused sexual dysfunction to become "an illness that needs treatment" instead of viewing it as the natural part of the aging process it is. Not all cultures seek treatment; for example, a population of men living in Mexico often accept erectile dysfunction as a normal part of their maturing sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wentzell|first1=Emily|title=Aging Respectably by Rejecting Medicalization: Mexican Men's Reasons for Not Using Erectile Dysfunction Drugs|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|date=2013|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.1111/maq.12013|pmid=23674320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female sexual dysfunction===

Several theories have looked at female sexual dysfunction, from medical to psychological perspectives. Three social psychological theories include: the self-perception theory, the overjustification hypothesis, and the insufficient justification hypothesis:

*Self-perception theory: people make attributions about their own attitudes, feelings, and behaviours by relying on their observations of external behaviours and the circumstances in which those behaviours occur
*Overjustification hypothesis: when an external reward is given to a person for performing an intrinsically rewarding activity, the person's intrinsic interest will decrease
*Insufficient justification: based on the classic [[cognitive dissonance]] theory (inconsistency between two cognitions or between a cognition and a behavior will create discomfort), this theory states that people will alter one of the cognitions or behaviours to restore consistency and reduce distress

The importance of how a woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore as opposed to a pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

About one third of the women experienced sexual dysfunction, which may lead to women's loss of confidence in their sexual lives. Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally; however, some had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their sex partners. The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since being in an extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable. Inability to concentrate on the sexual activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work may also cause a woman's sexual dysfunction. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body's condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/sexual_dysfunction_in_women/overview_of_sexual_dysfunction_in_women.html | title=Overview of Sexual Dysfunction in Women - Women's Health Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menopause===
The female sexual response system is complex and even today, not fully understood. The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions that have been linked to menopause include lack of desire and libido; these are predominantly associated with hormonal physiology.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Specifically, it is the decline in serum estrogens that causes these changes in sexual functioning. Androgen depletion may also play a role, but currently this is less clear. The hormonal changes that take place during the menopausal transition have been suggested to affect women's sexual response through several mechanisms, some more conclusive than others.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

===Aging in women===
Whether or not aging directly affects women's sexual functioning during menopause is another area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically in the areas of desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm.&lt;ref name= "eden"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Laumann Edward O., Paik Anthony, Rosen Raymond C. | year = 1999 | title = Sexual Dysfunction in the United States: Prevalence and Predictors | url = | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 281 | issue = 6| pages = 537–44 | doi=10.1001/jama.281.6.537 | pmid=10022110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; This means that it is important to understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Furthermore, the impact that a relationship status can have on quality of life is often underestimated.

Testosterone, along with its metabolite dihydrotestosterone, is extremely important to normal sexual functioning in men and women. Dihydrotestosterone is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women.&lt;ref name= "king"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kingsberg S.A. | year = 2002 | title = The impact of aging on sexual function in women and their partners | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 431–437 | doi=10.1023/A:1019844209233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are, on average, about half of what they were before the women were 40. Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; this is because the ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

Sexual desire has been related to three separate components: drive, beliefs and values, and motivation.&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt; Particularly in postmenopausal women, drive fades and is no longer the initial step in a woman's sexual response (if it ever was).&lt;ref name= "king" /&gt;

==Treatment==

Several decades ago the medical community believed the majority of sexual dysfunction cases were related to psychological issues.  Although this may be true for a portion of men, the vast majority of cases have now been identified as having a physical cause or correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jarow J, Nana-Sinkam P, Sabbagh M | year = 1996 | title = Outcome analysis of goal directed therapy for impotence | url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 155 | issue = 5| pages = 1609–1612 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(01)66142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the sexual dysfunction is deemed to have a psychological component or cause, [[psychotherapy]] can help. Situational anxiety arises from an earlier bad incident or lack of experience. This anxiety often leads to development of fear towards sexual activity and avoidance. In return evading leads to a cycle of increased anxiety and [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] of the penis. In some cases, erectile dysfunction may be due to marital disharmony. Marriage [[Relationship counseling|counseling]] sessions are recommended in this situation.

Lifestyle changes such as discontinuing [[smoking]], drug or [[alcohol abuse]] can also help in some types of erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme. [http://www.merck.com/pubs/mmanual_ha/sec3/ch59/ch59a.html "Male genital and sexual disorders"] 2010-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Several oral medications like Viagra, [[Tadalafil|Cialis]] and [[Vardenafil|Levitra]] have become available to help people with erectile dysfunction and have become first line therapy. These medications provide an easy, safe, and effective treatment solution for approximately 60% of men. In the rest, the medications may not work because of wrong diagnosis or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] history.

Another type of medication that is effective in roughly 85% of men is called intracavernous pharmacotherapy and involves injecting a vasodilator drug directly into the penis in order to stimulate an erection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodríguez Vela |first1=L |last2=Moncada Iribarren |first2=I |last3=Gonzalvo Ibarra |first3=A |author4=Sáenz de Tejada y Gorman I |title=Treatment of erectile dysfunction using intracavernous pharmacotherapy |journal=Actas Urologicas Espanolas |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=291–319 |year=1998 |pmid=9658642}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has an increased risk of [[priapism]] if used in conjunction with other treatments, and localized pain.&lt;ref name=Diaz /&gt;

When conservative therapies fail, are an unsatisfactory treatment option, or are contraindicated for use, the insertion of a [[penile prosthesis]], or penile implant, may be selected by the patient.  Technological advances have made the insertion of a penile prosthesis a safe option for the treatment of erectile dysfunction which provides the highest patient and partner satisfaction rates of all available ED treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rajpurkar A, Dhabuwala C | year = 2003 | title = Comparison of satisfaction rates and erectile function in patients treated with sildenafil, intracavernous prostaglandin E1 and penile implant surgery for erectile dysfunction in urology practice | url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 170 | issue = 1| pages = 159–163 | doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000072524.82345.6d| pmid = 12796670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Females===
There are no approved pharmaceuticals for addressing female sexual disorders, although several are under investigation for their effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Amato&gt;Amato P, MD. An update on therapeutic approaches to female sexual dysfunction {{cite web|url=http://www.femalesexualdysfunctiononline.org/commentaries/commentaries.cfm?abs_id%3Dabs_007 |title=Female Sexual Dysfunction Online &amp;#124; A Blog to Document the High's and Low's of My Life |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004092107/http://www.femalesexualdysfunctiononline.org/commentaries/commentaries.cfm?abs_id=abs_007 |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}. 2007. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A vacuum device is the only approved medical device for arousal and orgasm disorders. It is designed to increase blood flow to the clitoris and external genitalia.&lt;ref name=Amato/&gt; Women experiencing pain with intercourse are often prescribed pain relievers or desensitizing agents. Others can be prescribed lubricants or hormone therapy.&lt;ref name=Amato/&gt;  Many patients with female sexual dysfunction are often also referred to a counselor or therapist for psychosocial counseling.&lt;ref name=Amato/&gt;

====Menopause====
Estrogens are responsible for the maintenance of collagen, elastic fibers, and vasoculature of the urogenital tract, all of which are important in maintaining vaginal structure and functional integrity; they are also important for maintaining vaginal pH and moisture levels, both of which aid in keeping the tissues lubricated and protected.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Prolonged estrogen deficiency leads to atrophy, fibrosis, and reduced blood flow to the urogenital tract, which is what causes menopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness and pain related to sexual activity and/or intercourse.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; It has been consistently demonstrated that women with lower sexual functioning have lower estradiol levels.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

Androgen therapy for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) has a small benefit but its safety is not known.&lt;ref name=Wri2015/&gt; It is not approved as a treatment in the United States.&lt;ref name=Wri2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=JJ|last2=O'Connor|first2=KM|title=Female sexual dysfunction.|journal=The Medical Clinics of North America|date=May 2015|volume=99|issue=3|pages=607–28|pmid=25841603|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2015.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If used it is more common among women who have had an oophorectomy or who are in a postmenopausal state. However, like most treatments, this is also controversial. One study found that after a 24-week trial, those women taking androgens had higher scores of sexual desire compared to a placebo group.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; As with all pharmacological drugs, there are side effects in using androgens, which include hirutism, acne, ploycythaemia, increased high-density lipoproteins, cardiovascular risks, and endometrial hyperplasia is a possibility in women without hysterectomy.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Alternative treatments include topical estrogen creams and gels can be applied to the vulva or vagina area to treat vaginal dryness and atrophy.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

==Clinical studies==
In modern times, the genuine clinical study of sexual problems is usually dated back no further than 1970 when [[William Masters and Virginia Johnson|Masters and Johnson's]] ''[[Human Sexual Inadequacy]]'' was published. It was the result of over a decade of work at the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation in St. Louis, involving 790 cases. The work grew from Masters and Johnson's earlier ''[[Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response]]'' (1966).

Prior to Masters and Johnson the clinical approach to sexual problems was largely derived from the thinking of [[Freud]]. It was held with [[psychopathology]] and approached with a certain pessimism regarding the chance of help or improvement. Sexual problems were merely symptoms of a deeper malaise and the diagnostic approach was from the psychopathological. There was little distinction between difficulties in function and variations nor between perversion and problems. Despite work by psychotherapists such as Balint sexual difficulties were crudely split into [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder|frigidity]] or [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], terms which too soon acquired negative connotations in popular culture.

The achievement of ''Human Sexual Inadequacy'' was to move thinking from psychopathology to ''learning'', only if a problem did not respond to educative treatment would psychopathological problems be considered. Also treatment was directed at couples, whereas before partners would be seen individually. Masters and Johnson saw that sex was a joint act. They believed that sexual communication was the key issue to sexual problems not the specifics of an individual problem. They also proposed co-therapy, a matching pair of therapists to the clients, arguing that a lone male therapist could not fully comprehend female difficulties.

The basic Masters and Johnson treatment program was an intensive two-week program to develop efficient sexual communication. Couple-based and therapist led the program began with discussion and then sensate focus between the couple to develop shared experiences. From the experiences specific difficulties could be determined and approached with a specific therapy. In a limited number of male only cases (41) Masters and Johnson had developed the use of a female surrogate, an approach they soon abandoned over the ethical, legal and other problems it raised.

In defining the range of sexual problems Masters and Johnson defined a boundary between dysfunction and deviations. Dysfunctions were transitory and experienced by the majority of people, dysfunctions bounded male primary or secondary [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], [[premature ejaculation]], [[ejaculatory incompetence]]; female primary [[orgasmic dysfunction]] and situational orgasmic dysfunction; pain during intercourse ([[dyspareunia]]) and [[vaginismus]]. According to Masters and Johnson [[sexual arousal]] and [[orgasm|climax]] are a normal physiological process of every functionally intact adult, but despite being autonomic it can be inhibited. Masters and Johnson treatment program for dysfunction was 81.1% successful.

Despite the work of Masters and Johnson the field in the US was quickly overrun by enthusiastic rather than systematic approaches, blurring the space between 'enrichment' and therapy. Although it has been argued that the impact of the work was such that it would be impossible to repeat such a clean experiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6777">'''Shona music''' is the [[music]] of the [[Shona people]] of [[Zimbabwe]]. There are several different types of traditional Shona music including [[mbira]], [[singing]], [[Hosho (instrument)|hosho]] and [[drum (musical instrument)|drumming]].  Very often, this music will be accompanied by [[dance|dancing]], and participation by the audience.  In Shona music, there is little distinction between the performer and the audience, both are often actively involved in the music-making, and both are important in the religious ceremonies where Shona Music is often heard.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Mbira==
[[Image:Mbira dzavadzimu.jpg|thumb|An [[Mbira#Mbira dzavadzimu|Mbira Dzavadzimu]]]]
{{Main|Mbira}}

The mbira is a traditional instrument of the Shona People often used in religious ceremonies.  There are several different varieties of mbira including the [[Mbira#Mbira dzavadzimu|Mbira Dzavadzimu]] and [[Mbira#Mbira Nyunga Nyunga|Mbira Nyunga Nyunga]].

Shona music is well known as representative of mbira ("thumb piano") music. The performer of the "[[kushaura]]" (lead mbira part) often acts also as the lead vocalist, selecting a known melody or mbira pattern to accompany selected lyrics, usually a phrase or a few lines of text which are then commented upon improvisationally. The performer of the "kutsinira" (second mbira part) plays a pattern which interlocks with the "kushaura" in a way that creates the repeated notes which identify mbira music. The "kutsinira" part is sometimes the same part as the "kushaura", but following the kushaura one pulse behind. The mbira players are accompanied by another less active singer who plays the [[hosho (instrument)|hosho]] (a rattle) and responds to the improvised lyrics of the singer and, most importantly, embellishes and complements the lead vocal melody. (Garfias 1971){{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Drumming==
Drums are always associated with dance and can be used for various dances.

===Mhande Drums===
# [[Shauro]]- used for the lead rhythm
# [[Tsinhiro]]- used for the response rhythm

===Dinhe Drums===
# [[Mhito]]- used for the lead rhythm
# [[Mitumba miviri]]- used for the response rhythm

===Chokoto Drums===
(these are two headed)
# [[Chimudumbana]]- small, for lead rhythm
# [[Chigubha]]- big, for response rhythm

==Hosho==
[[Image:Hosho instrument.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[Hosho (instrument)|Hosho]]]]
{{Main|Hosho (instrument)}}

Shona music is often accompanied by the '''[[Hosho (instrument)|hosho]]''', a hollowed-out maranka gourd containing ''hota'' seeds or other objects that is shaken to generate a sound.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

== Ancient Shona Music ==
Traditional ancient Shona musics consist of [[Mbira dzavadzimu]] played by multiple players, [[Hosho (instrument)|Hosho]] and [[Ngoma drums]].Ancient shona music is mainly played at spiritual ceremonies called Bira.

==Modern==
Traditional Shona music has been adapted to modern instruments such as electric guitars and western drumsets, for example by musicians such as [[Thomas Mapfumo]], [[Stella Chiweshe]], and [[Oliver Mtukudzi]]. This music is also associated with the [[Chimurenga]] movement.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Shona music in the West==
Shona music has become popular in the West and even in the East such as Japan.  In the United States, Shona music has become popular in Colorado, California, the Pacific Northwest and in some places of Argentina, largely due to the seeding influence of musicians such as [[Dumisani Maraire]], [[Ephat Mujuru]], Thomas Mapfumo and [[Erica Azim]].{{cn|date =October 2017}}

===Shona music on Marimba===
Shona marimbas are diatonic and are made with F#'s and without. They are different from other marimbas through their larger keys and resonators beneath the keys (to produce a buzzing sound). Often traditional mbira songs are translated to the marimba.

The [[sociology of science|sociology]] and [[philosophy of science]], as well as the entire field of [[science studies]], have in the 20th century been occupied with the question of large-scale patterns and trends in the development of [[science]], and asking questions about how science "works" both in a philosophical and practical sense.

==Science as a social enterprise==

Science as a social enterprise has been developing exponentially for the past few centuries. In antiquity, the few people who were able to engage in natural inquiry were either wealthy themselves, had rich benefactors, or had the support of a religious community. Today, scientific research has tremendous government support and also ongoing support from the private sector.

Available methods of communication have improved tremendously over time. Instead of waiting months or years for a hand-copied letter to arrive, today scientific communication can be practically instantaneous. Earlier, most natural philosophers worked in relative isolation, due to the difficulty and slowness of communication. Still, there was a considerable amount of cross-fertilization between distant groups and individuals.

Nowadays, almost all modern scientists participate in a [[scientific community]], hypothetically global in nature (though often based around a relatively few nations and institutions of stature), but also strongly segregated into different fields of study. The scientific community is important because it represents a source of established knowledge which, if used properly, ought to be more reliable than personally acquired knowledge of any given individual. The community also provides a [[feedback]] mechanism, often in the form of practices such as [[peer review]] and [[reproducibility]]. Most items of scientific content (experimental results, theoretical proposals, or literature reviews) are reported in [[scientific journal]]s and are hypothetically subjected to peer scrutiny, though a number of scholarly critics from both inside and outside the scientific community have, in recent decades, began to question the effect of commercial and government investment in science on the peer review and publishing process, as well as the internal disciplinary limitations to the scientific publication process.

A major development of the [[Scientific Revolution]] was the foundation of scientific societies: [[Academia Secretorum Naturae]] (Accademia dei Segreti, the Academy of the Mysteries of Nature) can be considered the first scientific community; founded in [[Naples]] 1560 by [[Giambattista della Porta]]. The Academy had an exclusive membership rule: discovery of a new law of nature was a prerequisite for admission. It was soon shut down by [[Pope Paul V]] for alleged [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].

The Academia Secretorum Naturae was replaced by the [[Accademia dei Lincei]], which was founded in [[Rome]] in 1603. The Lincei included [[Galileo]] as a member, but failed upon his condemnation in 1633. The [[Accademia del Cimento]], [[Florence]] 1657, lasted 10 years. The [[Royal Society]] of London, 1660 to the present day, brought together a diverse collection of scientists to discuss theories, conduct experiments, and review each other's work. The [[Académie des Sciences]] was created as an institution of the government of France 1666, meeting in the King's library. The [[Akademie der Wissenschaften]] began in [[Berlin]] 1700.

Early scientific societies provided valuable functions, including a community open to and interested in [[empirical]] inquiry, and also more familiar with and more educated about the subject. In 1758, with the aid of his pupils, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the Turin Academy.

Much of what is considered the modern institution of science was formed during its professionalization in the 19th century. During this time the location of scientific research shifted primarily to [[university|universities]], though to some extent it also became a standard component of [[industry]] as well. In the early years of the 20th century, especially after the role of science in the [[World War I|first World War]], governments of major industrial nations began to invest heavily in scientific research. This effort was dwarfed by the funding of scientific research undertaken by all sides in [[World War II]], which produced such "wonder weapons" as [[radar]], [[rocket]]ry, and the [[atomic bomb]]. During the [[Cold War]], a large amount of government resources were poured into science by the United States, [[USSR]], and many European powers. It was during this time that [[DARPA]] funded nationwide computer networks, one of them eventually under the [[internet protocol]]. In the post-Cold War era, a decline in government funding from many countries has been met with an increase of industrial and private investment. The funding of science is a major factor in its historical and global development.  So although science is hypothetically international in scope, in a practical sense it has usually centered around wherever it could find the most funding.

===Major events in the history of scientific communication===
[[File:Gutenberg.press.jpg|right|thumb|[[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]-era [[printing press]]es allowed the rapid spread of new ideas across 15th and 16th century Europe.]]

*The [[cave painting]]s depicted events, with no commentary. From 40,000 BC to 15,000 BC.
*The [[Ishango Bone]] dated 25,000 years ago could only show [[Tally marks|tallies]] in [[mathematical notation]].
*The clay tablets of Mesopotamia show the ''scale'' of the commentary or the information: the argument and logic of a discovery would be limited to what fit on the tablet. From late [[4th millennium]] onwards.
*[[Poetry]] and [[rhyme]] allowed people to remember memorable events more easily. For example, the [[China|Chinese]] [[generation name]]s are taken from a poem selected by each family.
*The [[parchment]] and [[paper]] [[scroll]]s which arose in Greek and in Chinese culture could start to contain the history and development of ideas and discoveries. Parchment was invented in [[Pergamon]] in the 2nd century BC, while the manufacture of paper was described for the first time in 105 AD in China. It was brought to Western world only in the 13th century.
*The [[codex]] or [[book]] of medieval times allowed ''random access'' to specific passages. The systematic printing and production of books could then allow the systematic production of new ideas. From late 1st century onwards.
*By the 20th century, the scale and scope of scientific work allowed [[collaboration]] of researchers and the definition of consistent [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s for this collaboration in scientific work.

==Political support==
One of the basic requirements for a scientific community is the existence and approval of a political sponsor; in England, the [[Royal Society]] operates under the aegis of the monarchy; in the US, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] was founded by Act of the [[United States Congress]]; etc. Otherwise, when the basic elements of knowledge were being formulated, the political rulers of the respective communities could choose to arbitrarily either support or disallow the nascent scientific communities. For example, [[Alhazen]] had to feign madness to avoid execution. The polymath [[Shen Kuo]] lost political support, and could not continue his studies until he came up with discoveries that showed his worth to the political rulers. The admiral [[Zheng He]] could not continue his voyages of exploration after the emperors withdrew their support. Another famous example was the suppression of the work of [[Galileo]], by the twentieth century, Galileo would be pardoned.

==Patterns in the history of science==
{{see also|Scientific consensus#Scientific consensus and the scientific minority}}

One of the major occupations with those interested in the history of science is whether or not it displays certain patterns or trends, usually along the question of change between one or more scientific theories. Generally speaking, there have historically been three major models adopted in various forms within the [[philosophy of science]].

[[File:Three models of theory change.png|right|frame|Three models of change in scientific theories, depicted graphically to reflect roughly the different views associated with [[Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Kuhn]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]].]]

The first major model, implicit in most early histories of science and generally a model put forward by practicing scientists themselves in their textbook literature, is associated with the criticisms of [[logical positivism]] by [[Karl Popper]] (1902&amp;ndash;1994) from the 1930s. Popper's model of science is one in which [[scientific progress]] is achieved through a [[Falsifiability|falsification]] of incorrect theories and the adoption instead of theories which are progressively closer to truth. In this model, scientific progress is a linear accumulation of facts, each one adding to the last. In this model, the [[physics]] of [[Aristotle]] (384 BC{{spaced ndash}}322 BC) was simply subsumed by the work of [[Isaac Newton]] (1642&amp;ndash;1727) ([[classical mechanics]]), which itself was eclipsed by the work of [[Albert Einstein]] (1879&amp;ndash;1955) ([[Theory of relativity|Relativity]]), and later the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] (established in 1925), each one more accurate than the last.

A major challenge to this model came from the work of the historian and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] (1922&amp;ndash;1996) in his work ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' published in 1962. Kuhn, a former physicist, argued against the view that scientific progress was linear, and that modern scientific theories were necessarily just more accurate versions of theories of the past. Rather, Kuhn's version of scientific development consisted of dominant structures of thought and practices, which he called "[[paradigm]]s", in which research went through phases of "[[normal science|normal]]" science ("puzzle solving") and "[[revolutionary science|revolutionary]]" science (testing out new theories based on new assumptions, brought on by uncertainty and crisis in existing theories). In Kuhn's model, different paradigms represented entirely different and [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurate]] assumptions about the universe.  The mode was thus uncertain about whether paradigms shifted in a way which necessarily relied upon greater attainment of truth. In Kuhn's view, Aristotle's physics, Newton's classical mechanics, and Einstein's Relativity were entirely different ways to think about the world; each successive paradigm defined what questions could be asked about the world and (perhaps arbitrarily) discarded aspects of the previous paradigm which no longer seemed applicable or important. Kuhn claimed that far from merely building on the previous theory's accomplishments, each new paradigm essentially throws out the old way of looking at the universe, and comes up with its own vocabulary to describe it and its own guidelines for expanding knowledge within the new [[paradigm]].

Kuhn's model met with much suspicion from scientists, historians, and philosophers. Some scientists felt that Kuhn went too far in divorcing scientific progress from truth; many historians felt that his argument was too codified for something as polyvariant and historically contingent as scientific change; and many philosophers felt that the argument did not go far enough. The furthest extreme of such reasoning was put forth by the philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924&amp;ndash;1994), who argued that there were no consistent methodologies used by all scientists at all times which allowed certain forms of inquiry to be labeled "scientific" in a way which made them different from any other form of inquiry, such as [[witchcraft]]. Feyerabend argued harshly against the notion that falsification was ever truly followed in the history of science, and noted that scientists had long undertaken practices to arbitrarily consider theories to be accurate even if they failed many sets of tests. Feyerabend argued that a pluralistic methodology should be undertaken for the investigation of knowledge, and noted that many forms of knowledge which were previously thought to be "non-scientific" were later accepted as a valid part of the scientific canon.

Many other theories of scientific change have been proposed over the years with various changes of emphasis and implications. In general, though, most float somewhere between these three models for change in scientific theory, the connection between theory and truth, and the nature of scientific progress.

==The nature of scientific discovery==

Individual ideas and accomplishments are among the most famous aspects of science, both internally and in larger society.  Breakthrough  figures like [[Sir Isaac Newton]] or [[Albert Einstein]] are often celebrated as [[genius]]es and [[hero]]es of science.  Popularizers of science, including the news media and scientific biographers, contribute to this phenomenon.  But many scientific historians emphasize the collective aspects of scientific discovery, and de-emphasize the importance of the [[eureka effect|"Eureka!" moment]].

A detailed look at the history of science often reveals that the minds of great thinkers were primed with the results of previous efforts, and often arrive on the scene to find a crisis of one kind or another.  For example, Einstein did not consider the physics of motion and gravitation in isolation.  His major accomplishments solved a problem which had come to a head in the field only in recent years &amp;mdash; empirical data showing that the speed of light was inexplicably constant, no matter the apparent speed of the observer.  (See [[Michelson-Morley experiment]].)  Without this information, it is very unlikely that Einstein would have conceived of anything like relativity.

The question of who should get credit for any given discovery is often a source of some controversy.  There are many priority disputes, in which multiple individuals or teams have competing claims over who discovered something first.  Multiple simultaneous discovery is actually a surprisingly common phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;''How We Know: An Exploration of the Scientific Process,'' by Goldstein, I.F. and Goldstein, M. (Westview / Da Capo {{ISBN|978-0-306-80140-2}} , 1981) page 255&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps largely explained by the idea that previous contributions (including the emergence of contradictions between existing theories, or unexpected empirical results) make a certain concept ready for discovery.  Simple priority disputes are often a matter of documenting when certain experiments were performed, or when certain ideas were first articulated to colleagues or recorded in a fixed medium.

Many times the question of exactly which event should qualify as the moment of discovery is difficult to answer.  One of the most famous examples of this is the question of the discovery of [[oxygen]].  While [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] were able to concentrate oxygen in the laboratory and characterize its properties, they did not recognize it as a component of air.  Priestly actually thought it was ''missing'' a hypothetical component of air, known as [[phlogiston theory|phlogiston]], which air was supposed to absorb from materials that are being burned.  It was only several years later that [[Antoine Lavoisier]] first conceived of the modern notion of oxygen &amp;mdash; as a substance that is consumed from the air in the processes of burning and respiration.

By the late 20th Century, scientific research has become a large-scale effort, largely accomplished in institutional teams.  The amount and frequency of inter-team collaboration has continued to increase, especially after the rise of the [[Internet]], which is a central tool for the modern scientific community.  This further complicates the notion of individual accomplishment in science.

[[File:SoriDicksonia.jpg|thumb|The underside of a fertile frond of ''[[Dicksonia antarctica]]''. Each circular brown structure is an individual sorus.]]

A '''sorus''' (pl. '''sori''') is a cluster of [[sporangium|sporangia]] (structures producing and containing [[spore]]s) in [[fern]]s and [[fungi]]. This [[New Latin]] word is from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:σωρός|σωρός]] (''sōrós'' 'stack, pile, heap').

In [[lichen]]s and other fungi, the sorus is surrounded by an external layer.  In some red algae it may take the form of a depression into the thallus.

In ferns, these form a yellowish or brownish mass on the edge or underside of a fertile [[frond]]. In some species, they are protected during development by a scale or film of tissue called the '''indusium''', which forms an umbrella-like cover. 

Sori occur on the [[sporophyte]] generation, the sporangia within producing [[haploid]] meio[[spore]]s. As the sporongia mature, the indusium shrivels so that spore release is unimpeded. The sporangia then burst and release the spores.

The shape, arrangement, and location of the sori are often valuable clues in the identification of fern [[taxa]]. Sori may be circular or linear. They may be arranged in rows, either parallel or oblique to the costa, or randomly. Their location may be marginal or set away from the margin on the frond lamina. The presence or absence of indusium is also used to identify fern taxa.

The field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of “[[sustainability]]” a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it "brings together scholarship and practice, global and local perspectives from north and south, and disciplines across the natural and social sciences, engineering, and medicine".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C., &amp; Dickson, N. M. 2003. Sustainability science: The emerging research program. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'' 100(14): 8059-8061.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist [[William C. Clark]] proposes that it can be usefully thought of as "neither 'basic' nor 'applied' research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs" and that it "serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C. 2007. "Sustainability Science: A room of its own". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of  Science'' 104: 1737-1738; published online on February 6, 2007, 10.1073/pnas.0611291104&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], pollution and land and water degradation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=73 Sustainability Science]". ''Task Force on Conceptual Foundations''. [[Earth System Governance Project]]. earthsystemgovernance.net. Retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability science, like [[sustainability]] itself, derives some impetus from the concepts of [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental science]].&lt;ref name="ensci.iastate.edu"&gt;[http://www.ensci.iastate.edu Environmental Science: Iowa State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability&lt;ref&gt;Komiyama, H., Takeuchi, K. 2006. Sustainability science: building a new discipline. Sustainability Science 1:1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[sustainability measurement]] provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of "sustainability" or "sustainable development". In an overview presented on its website in 2008 the Sustainability Science Program at [[Harvard University]] described the field in the following way, stressing its [[interdisciplinarity]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Sustainability science' is problem-driven, interdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to facilitate the design, implementation, and evaluation of effective interventions that foster shared prosperity and reduced poverty while protecting the environment. It is defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it employs. It thus draws as needed from multiple disciplines of the natural, social, medical and engineering sciences, from the professions, and from the knowledge of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119091925/http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html|archive-date=November 19, 2008 |title=Overview |work=Sustainable Science Program |publisher=Harvard University |access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Susan Kieffer|Susan W. Kieffer]] and colleagues, in 2003, suggested, more specifically, that sustainability science is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the cultivation, integration, and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences (such as geology, ecology, climatology, oceanography) coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate, and minimize the consequences, regionally and worldwide, of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future&amp;nbsp;– that is, in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards.&lt;ref&gt;Kieffer, S.W., Barton, P., Palmer, A.R., Reitan, P.H., &amp; Zen, E. 2003. "Megascale events: Natural disasters and human behavior". Geological Society of America Abstracts with programs: 432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been noted that the new paradigm &lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;must encompass different magnitudes of scales (of time, space, and function), multiple balances (dynamics), multiple actors (interests) and multiple failures (systemic faults).&lt;ref&gt;Reitan, P. 2005. Sustainability science – and what’s needed beyond science. Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy 1(1):77-80. [http://ejournal.nbii.org/archives /vol1iss1/communityessay.reitan.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124163750/http://ejournal.nbii.org/archives/ |date=2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others take a much broader view of sustainability science, emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system, such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancing society's well-being. In a 2012 article entitled "Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption," published in Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society, the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices, as well as in solving the problems they create, the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being, and others.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Halina Szejnwald|title=Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|date=24 January 2012|volume=54|issue=1|pages=20–25|doi=10.1080/00139157.2012.639598|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2012/January-February%202012/science-needs_Full.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broad objectives==
The case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s, promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report ''[[Our Common Future]]'' in 1987, and noted in the ''[[Agenda 21]]'' plan that emerged from the ''[[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]'' in 1992 and further developed at the ''[[World Summit on Sustainable Development]]'', held in Johannesburg in 2002.

The topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, Joanne 2009. Advancing sustainability science: report on the International Conference on Sustainability Science (ICSS) 2009. ''Sustainability Science'' '''4''': 233-242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published as ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology'', edited by [[Robert Kates]], with a preface by William Clark.&lt;ref name="hks.harvard.edu"&gt;Kates, Robert W., ed. (2010). ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology''. CID Working Paper No. 213. Center for International Development, Harvard University. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, December 2010. [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/publications/faculty-working-papers/cid-working-paper-no.-213 Abstract] and [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/69257/1249838/version/1/.../213.pdf PDF file] available on the Harvard Kennedy School website; retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"/&gt; This is work in progress. The 2012 Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, R. (2012). Encyclopedia of sustainability science and technology. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge structuring of issues===
Knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected. This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia, industry and government.

===Coordination of data===
The key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines, topics and organisations. A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an “overview” of what is known. Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed.

===Interdisciplinary approaches===
The attempt, by sustainability science, to understand the integrated “whole” of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific, social and economic disciplines, public and private sectors, academia and government. In short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination.

'''Waste minimisation''' is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of [[waste]] produced.  By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more [[sustainable]] society.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=United States Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;  Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and/or changing societal patterns of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and production.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite web|author=Davidson, G.|date=2011|title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review.|publisher=Retrieved from https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most environmentally resourceful, [[economic efficiency|economically efficient]], and [[cost effective]] way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most [[waste management]] strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.

Traditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on [[re-use]], [[recycling]],  and [[waste-to-energy]] conversion.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing.  To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process, [[life cycle assessment#Cradle-to-grave|cradle-to-grave analysis]] (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and details of the composition of the waste.

The main sources of waste [[Waste by country|vary from country to country]]. In the [[UK]], most waste comes from the construction and [[demolition]] of buildings, followed by [[mining]] and quarrying, industry and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7009/7009.pdf ROYAL COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION: Urban Environment] 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste.  Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the [[supply chain]].  For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs.

==Benefits==
Waste minimisation can [[environment protection|protect the environment]] and often turns out to have positive economic benefits.  Waste minimisation can improve:&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;
*Efficient production practices.  Waste minimisation can achieve more output of product per unit of input of [[raw material]]s.
*Economic returns.  More efficient use of products means reduced costs of purchasing new materials improving the financial performance of a company.
*[[Reputation|Public image]].  The environmental profile of a company is an important part of its overall reputation and waste minimisation reflects a proactive movement towards [[environmental protection]].
*Quality of products produced.  New innovation and technological practices can reduce waste generation and improve the quality of the inputs in the production phase.
*[[Environmental responsibility]].  Minimising or eliminating waste generation makes it easier to meet targets of environmental regulations, policies, and standards. The environmental impact of waste will be reduced.

==Industries==
In industry, using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products.

Waste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings. However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part.

There are government incentives for waste minimisation, which focus on the environmental benefits of adopting waste minimisation strategies. In the [[UK]], several pilot schemes such as The Catalyst Project and the Dee Waste Minimisation Project, have shown the efficacy of such policies. Fourteen companies in [[Merseyside]] took part in the Catalyst Project; the project generated overall savings of £9 million and landfill waste was reduced by 12,000 tonnes per year. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Processes==

: 
* [[Reuse]] of scrap material
: Scraps can be immediately re-incorporated at the beginning of the manufacturing line so that they do not become a waste product. Many industries routinely do this; for example, [[paper mill]]s return any damaged rolls to the beginning of the production line, and in the manufacture of plastic items, off-cuts and scrap are re-incorporated into new products.
* Improved [[quality control]] and [[process monitoring]]
: Steps can be taken to ensure that the number of reject batches is kept to a minimum.  This is achieved by increasing the frequency of inspection and the number of points of inspection. For example, installing automated continuous monitoring equipment can help to identify production problems at an early stage.
* Waste exchanges
: This is where the waste product of one process becomes the raw material for a second process. Waste exchanges represent another way of reducing waste disposal volumes for waste that cannot be eliminated.
* Ship to [[point of use]]
: This involves making deliveries of incoming [[raw material]]s or components direct to the point where they are assembled or used in the manufacturing process to minimise handling and the use of [[protective wrapping]]s or enclosures.
* [[Zero waste]]
: This is a whole systems approach that aims to eliminate waste at the source and at all points down the supply chain, with the intention of producing no waste. It is a design philosophy which emphasizes waste prevention as opposed to end of pipe waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dickinson, J.|author2=Snow, W.K.|date=2001|last-author-amp=yes|title=The end of waste: Zero Waste by 2020.|url=http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/Reports/TheEndofWaste.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product design===

Waste minimisation and resource maximisation for [[Manufacturing|manufactured products]] can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of [[wikt:component|component]]s used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.

In some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of [[raw material]]s used to make a product, but instead reduce the volume or [[toxicity]] of the waste created at the end of a product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.  (See section [[Waste minimisation#Durability|Durability]]).

====Fitting the intended use====
In this strategy, products and packages are optimally designed to meet their intended use.  This applies especially to packaging materials, which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of [[paper]], [[metal]]s, [[glass]] and [[plastic]]s in its packaging.

====Durability====
Improving [[durable goods|product durability]], such as extending a [[vacuum cleaner]]'s useful life to 15 years instead of 12, can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.

But in some cases it has a negative [[environmental impact]].  If a product is too durable, its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed.  For example, a washing machine produced 10 years ago may use twice as much water, detergent and energy as one produced today. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Therefore, extending an older machine's useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new model.  Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts.

Most proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Recycling a product is easier if it is constructed of fewer materials.  Car manufacturers have recently reduced the number of plastics used in their cars from twenty or more to three or four, {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} hence simplifying the recovery of plastics from scrapped cars. However, exceptions (like having a combination of paper and plastic or plastic coating on glass) do exist, and might enable a product to fulfill its role with the minimum of resources.

Making refillable glass [[bottle]]s strong enough to withstand several journeys between the [[consumer]] and the [[bottling plant]] requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make.  If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey..

Many choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions.

==Retail==
Various aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of [[disposable tableware]] in restaurants.
===Reusable shopping bags===
Reusable bags are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a "bag credit" for re-usable shopping bags, although at least [[Kroger|one chain]] reversed its policy, claiming "it was just a temporary bonus".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wcpo.com/money/consumer/dont-waste-your-money/kroger-ends-reusable-bag-discount Kroger ends reusable bag discount], WCPO TV, Cincinnati&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount.&lt;ref name="brookingsbag"&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/why-a-bag-tax-works-better-than-a-reusable-bag-bonus/ Why a Bag Tax Works Better Than a Reusable Bag Bonus], Brookings Inst., 8-Jan-2014&lt;/ref&gt;.  (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.)  While there is a minor inconvenience involved, this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.

==Households==
This section details some waste minimisation techniques for [[household]]ers.

Appropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods; buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also, if a pack or [[can (disambiguation)#Container|can]] is to be thrown away, any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/etiquette.html Removing food remains to reduce waste]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home [[composting]], the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation.

The resources that households use can be reduced considerably by [[electricity consumption|using electricity]] thoughtfully (e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed) and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage, and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions.

In a domestic situation, the potential for minimisation is often dictated by [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].  Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow [[fashion trend]]s when the older products are still usable.  Adults working full-time have little free time, and so may have to purchase more [[convenience food|convenient foods]] that require little preparation, or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family.

The amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes.  Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total [[resource consumption]].  Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have [[eco-labelling]], which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Pullapart|PullApart]] combines both [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[consumer]] packaging [[Statistical survey|surveys]], in a [[Curbside collection|curbside]] packaging [[recycling]] classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available, consumers can be proactive and use them.

==Health-care facilities==

Health-care establishments are massive producers of waste.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2011|title=Waste from Health Care facilities Fact Sheet No 253|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs253/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of health-care waste are:  hospitals, laboratories and research centres, mortuary and autopsy centres, animal research and testing laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Waste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste.  Good management and control practices among health-care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.

===Practices===

There are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2014|title=Waste minimization, recycling and reuse.|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/medicalwaste/058to060.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Source reduction'''
*Purchasing reductions which ensures the selection of supplies that are less wasteful or less hazardous.
*The use of physical rather than chemical cleaning methods such as steam disinfection instead of chemical disinfection.
*Preventing the unnecessary wastage of products in nursing and cleaning activities.

'''Management and control measures at hospital level'''
*Centralized purchasing of hazardous chemicals.
*Monitoring the flow of chemicals within the health care facility from receipt as a raw material to disposal as a hazardous waste.
*The careful separation of waste matter to help minimize the quantities of hazardous waste and disposal.

'''Stock management of chemical and pharmaceutical products'''
*Frequent ordering of relatively small quantities rather than large quantities at one time.
*Using the oldest batch of a product first to avoid expiration dates and unnecessary waste.
*Using all the contents of a container containing hazardous waste.
*Checking the expiry date of all products at the time of delivery.
