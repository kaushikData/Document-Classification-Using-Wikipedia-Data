      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23470">The '''Anglophone Problem''', as it is commonly referred to in [[Cameroon]], is a socio-political issue rooted in Cameroon's colonial legacies from the [[Scramble for Africa|Germans]], [[British colonization of Africa|British]], and the [[Scramble for Africa|French]].

The issue classically and principally opposes many Cameroonians from the Northwest and Southwest regions, many of whom consider themselves anglophones, to the Cameroon government. This is based on the fact that these two regions (formally [[Southern Cameroons|British Southern Cameroons]]) were controlled by Britain as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] and [[United Nations trust territories|trust territory]] of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] respectively." 

== Background ==
While many Northwesterners and Southwesterners believe there is an anglophone problem, some do not. In fact, the term "anglophone" today creates a lot of controversy, as many former [[French language|French-speaking]] Cameroonians who are either bilingual or speak only English (most of whom have gone through the English sub-system of education) consider themselves as anglophones. The root of the Anglophone problem in Cameroon can be traced back to the Foumban Conference of 1961 that united the two territories, with different colonial legacies, into one state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Anglophone Problem is increasingly dominating the political agenda of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konings|first=Piet|year=1997|title=The Anglophone Problem in Cameroon|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem has led to arguments and actions (protests, strikes, etc.) that argue for [[federalism]] or separation from the union by the Anglophones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Failure to address the Anglophone Problem threatens Cameroon's ability to create national unity between the two groups of people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Origins ==

=== The European colonizers ===
The roots of the Anglophone problem can be traced back to [[World War I]], when Cameroon was known as [[Kamerun|German Kamerun]]. The [[German Empire]] first gained influence in Cameroon in 1845 when Alfred Saker of the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] introduced a mission station.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|last=Olson|first=James|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|isbn=0-313-27917-9|location=|pages=169|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, German merchants established a factory: the Woermann Company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On July 5, 1884, local tribes provided the Woermann Company with rights to control the Kamerun River, consequently setting the foundation for the later [[German colonization of Africa|German colonization]] of Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1916, during World War I, [[French colonial empire|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] joined forces to [[Kamerun Campaign|attack and seize]] German Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] would award France and Britain mandates over Cameroon as punishment of the Germans who lost the war. Most of German Kamerun was given to the French, over 167,000 square miles of territory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The British were given [[British Cameroons|Northern Cameroons]], about 17,500 square miles of territory and [[Southern Cameroons]], 16,580 square miles. Each colonizer would later influence the colonies with their [[European languages]] and cultures, thus rendering them as Anglophones and Francophones. The large difference in awarded territory has resulted in present-day Cameroon having a huge majority Francophone population and a very small minority Anglophone population.

=== Gaining independence ===
Following [[World War II]], a wave of independence flowed rapidly throughout Africa. The [[United Nations]] obliged that Britain and France relinquish their colonies and guide them towards independence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cameroon-info.net/article/cameroon-bamenda-provincial-episcopal-conference-memorandum-to-president-paul-biya-on-the-current-situation-in-278001.html|title=Bamenda Provincial Episcopal Conference [BAPEC]|last=Anglophone Archbishops|first=|date=December 22, 2016|work=newspaper|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were three political options for British Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They could become independent by uniting with [[Nigeria]] or with [[French Cameroons|French Cameroun]]. No option of self-determination by becoming independent was given.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most desired option was independence with the least popular being unification with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, during the [[British Cameroons referendum, 1961|British Plebiscite of 1961]], the British argued that Southern Cameroons was not economically viable enough to sustain itself as an independent nation and could only survive by joining with Nigeria or La République du Cameroun (the Republic of Cameroon).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though documents on the United Nations' "Non-Self-Governing Territories" state, "integration should be the result of the freely expressed wishes of the territory's peoples",&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International organisation and integration: a collection of the texts of documents relating to the United Nations, its related agencies and regional international organisations|last=Van Panhuys|first=H.F|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media Dordrecht|year=1968|isbn=978-1-4899-6229-4|location=|pages=288|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations would later reject Southern Cameroons' appeal to have independence as a sovereign nation placed on the ballot.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The plebiscite questions were:   
# ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Federation of Nigeria?'' 
#  ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Republic of Cameroun?''
The United Nations documents defined the basis of integration as: "Integration with an independent State should be on the basis of complete equality between the peoples of the erstwhile Non-Self-Governing Territory and those of the independent country with which it is integrated. The peoples of both territories should have equal status and rights of citizenship... at all levels in the executive, legislative and judicial organs of government."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With this promise in mind, on [[February 1961]], British Northern Cameroons voted to join Nigeria, while British Southern Cameroons voted to join La République du Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern West Cameroon Revisited (1950-1972): Unveiling Inescapable Traps|last=Ndi|first=Anthony|publisher=Langaa RPCIG|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Foumban Conference of July 17–21, 1961 ===
The purpose of the [[Foumban Constitutional Conference]] was to create a [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] for the new Federal state of British Southern Cameroon and La République du Cameroun. The conference brought together representatives from La République du Cameroun, including [[Ahmadou Ahidjo|Amadou Ahidjo]], their president, with representatives from Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating an Anglophone Identity: A study of the politics of recognition and representation in Cameroon|last=Konings|first=Piet|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|year=2003|isbn=9004132953|location=Netherlands|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before the Foumban Conference, there were reports that more than one hundred people were killed by terrorists in Loum, [[Bafang]], Ndom, and [[Douala]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africafederation.net/SouthernCameroon.htm|title=The Legal Argument for Southern Cameroon Independence|last=Dounge|first=Germanus|date=January 18, 2017|website=www.africafederation.net|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports worried unification advocates who wanted British Cameroon to unify with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For the conference, the location of Foumban had been carefully chosen to make Ahidjo, appear as if he had everything under control. Mr. Mbile, a Southern Cameroonian representative at the conference noted, "Free from all the unrest that had scared Southern Cameroonians, the Francophone authorities had picked the place deliberately for the occasion. The entire town had been exquisitely cleaned up and houses splashed with whitewash. Food was good and receptions lavish. The climate in Foumban real or artificial went far to convince us that despite the stories of 'murder and fire,' there could be at least this island of peace, east of the Mungo."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Before the Foumban Conference, all the parties in Southern Cameroons, the Native Authority Councils and the traditional leaders attended the [[Bamenda Conference]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This conference decided on a common proposal to present when negotiations with La République du Cameroun arrived. Among many things, the Bamenda Conference agreed on a non-centralized federation to ensure there was a distinction between the powers of the states and the powers of the federation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Most of the proposals from the Bamenda Conference were ignored by Ahidjo.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anglophone Cameroon Predicament|last=Atanga|first=Mufor|publisher=Langaa Research &amp; Publishing CIG|year=2011|isbn=9956717118|location=Bamenda|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these proposals included having a [[bicameral]] legislature and decentralizing power, but instead a [[unicameral]] system was established with a centralized system of power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

At the Foumban conference, Ahidjo presented delegates with a draft constitution. By the end of the conference, instead of creating an entirely new constitution, the contributions of the Southern Cameroons delegates were reflected in suggestions made to the draft initially presented to them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[John Ngu Foncha]] and Ahidjo intended for the Foumban Constitutional Conference to be brief, however delegates left the three day conference with the impression that there would be sequential conferences to continue the drafting of the constitution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Mbile later noted, "We may have done more if we had spent five months instead of five days in writing our constitution at Foumban."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Constitution for the new Federal Republic was agreed in Yaoundé in August 1961, between Ahidjo and Foncha, pending approval by the House of Assembly of the two states.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the end, the West Cameroon House of Assembly never ratified the Constitution.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, on October 1, 1961, the Federal Republic of Cameroon nevertheless came to fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On May 6, 1972, Ahidjo announces his decision to convert the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] into a [[unitary state]], on the provision that the idea was supported via referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggestion violated the articles in the Foumban document that read: 'any proposal for the revision of the present constitution, which impairs the unity and integrity of the Federation shall be inadmissible,' and 'proposals for revision shall be adopted by simple majority vote of the members of the Federal Assembly, provided that such majority includes a majority of the representatives ... of each of the Federated States,'... not through referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such violations easily allowed for the passing of the referendum that turned the Federal Republic into the United Republic of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking into account these actions, the evidence shows that the Francophone's intentions may have not been to form a federal state, but rather to annex Southern Cameroons and not treat them as equals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1984, Ahidjo's successor, [[Paul Biya]], replaced the name "United Republic of Cameroon" with "La République du Cameroun," the same name the francophone Cameroon had before federation talks.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achankeng|first=Fonkem|year=2014|title=The Foumban "Constitutional" Talks and Prior Intentions of Negotiating: A Historico-Theoretical Analysis of a False Negotiation and the Ramications for Political Developments in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Global Initiatives: Policy, Pedagogy, Perspective|volume=9|pages=149|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With changes in the Constitution of 1996, reference to the existence of a territory called the British Southern Cameroons that had a "functioning self-government and recognized international boundaries" was essentially erased.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== The Anglophone problem ==
Despite the non-acknowledgement/denial of the Anglophone problem from Francophone government leaders,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; there exists a discontent by Anglophones, both young and old, as to how Anglophones are treated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This discontent presents itself in calls for federation or separation with movements that are garnering strength.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the core of Anglophone grievances is the loss of the former West Cameroons as a "distinct community defined by differences in official language and inherited colonial traditions of education, law, and public administration."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eyoh|first=Dickson|year=1998|title=Conflicting Narratives of Anglophone Protest and the Politics of Identity in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2016, in a letter to [[Paul Biya]], the Anglophone Archbishops of Southern Cameroons define the Anglophone problem as follows:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The failure of successive governments of Cameroon, since 1961, to respect and implement the articles of the Constitution that uphold and safeguard what British Southern Cameroons brought along to the Union in 1961.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The flagrant disregard for the Constitution, demonstrated by the dissolution of political parties and the formation of one political party in 1966, the sacking of Jua and the appointment of [[Salomon Tandeng Muna|Muna]] in 1968 as the Prime Minister of West Cameroon, and other such acts judged by West Cameroonians to be unconstitutional and undemocratic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# The cavalier management of the 1972 Referendum which took out the foundational element (Federalism) of the 1961 Constitution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The 1984 Law amending the Constitution, which gave the country the original East Cameroon name (The Republic of Cameroon) and thereby erased the identity of the West Cameroonians from the original union. West Cameroon, which had entered the union as an equal partner, effectively ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The deliberate and systematic erosion of the West Cameroon cultural identity which the 1961 Constitution sought to preserve and protect by providing for a bi-cultural federation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Separation ===
Movements which advocate the separation of English-speaking Cameroon from French-speaking Cameroun exist, led by the [[Cameroon Action Group]], the [[Southern Cameroons Youth League]], the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]], the [[Southern Cameroon Peoples Organization]] and the [[Ambazonia Movement]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Federation ===
Advocates of Federation want a return to the constitution agreed upon in the 1961 Foumban Conference that acknowledges the history and culture of the two regions while giving equal power to the two.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This federation had been dismantled on 20 May 1972 by the larger French-speaking Cameroon and extended the latter's executive power throughout West Cameroon.  Federation advocates include the instrumental Consortium of the leaders of three Cameroon-based trade unions: Lawyers, Teachers, and Transporters. It also includes some Cameroonians in the diaspora led by a well organized US-based Anglophone Action Group, Inc. (AAG).  AAG was one of the first groups in the diaspora to endorse the Cameroon-based Consortium as a peaceful alternative to achieving a return to the pre-1972 federated system. Opponents of federation include the ruling [[Cameroon Peoples Democratic Movement]].

=== Unitary ===
Unitarianism do not want Federation or Separation, but rather a decentralized unitary government; whereas, now the government is highly centralized in power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This violates the tenets of the 1996 Constitution as decentralization has yet to be implemented.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Struggle for political representation ==
In March 1990, the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF) led by [[John Fru Ndi]], was founded on the perception of widespread Anglophone alienation. The SDF was the first major opposition party to the People's Democratic Movement, led by Paul Biya.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Symptoms of Anglophone discontent ==
Below are various reasons that Anglophones feel marginalized, systemically, by the government. 
* The National Entrance Examinations into Schools that develop the human resources of Cameroon are set by the French Subsystem of Education. This makes it difficult for Anglophones and Francophones to compete on an equal playing field. The Examination Board members are all Francophone, which places some bias against Anglophone candidates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* There are five Ministries that concern education and none of them are Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Of the 36 Ministers who defended the budgets for the Ministries last month, only one was Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* In the 1961 Constitution, the Vice President was the second most important person in state protocol. Today, the Prime Minister (appointed Anglophone) is the fourth most important person in State Protocol, after the President of the Senate and the President of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Prioritization of French over English ===

* State institutions put documents and public notices in French, with no English translations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* National Entrance Examinations into some professional schools are set in French only, sometimes even in English-speaking regions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most of the heads of government offices only speak French, even in the English-speaking regions. Visitors and clients to government offices are then expected to speak in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most Senior Administrators and members of the Forces of Law and Order in the Northwest and Southwest Regions are French-speaking and there is a lack of effort for them to demonstrate an understanding of anglophone culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* Members of Inspection Teams, Missions and Facilitators for Seminars sent from the Ministries in Yaoundé to Southern Cameroon are mostly French speaking, and English speaking audience are expecting to understand them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* Most of the Military Tribunals in the Northwest and Southwest Regions conduct their courts in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Finance documents such as the COBAC Code, the CIMA Code and the [[OHADA]] Code are all in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* The Magistrates in the Southern Cameroon regions are disproportionately Francophone. In addition, other government-appointed officials such as the Senior Divisional Officers, the Divisional Officers, Commissioners, and Commandants are disproportionately Francophone. There are Francophone principals in Anglophone schools, and Hospitals, Banks and Mobile Telephone Companies are predominantly Francophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Spiraling ==
{{As of|2017}}, the Anglophone problem is still on-going. It has spiraled into violence with police officers and gendarmes shooting dead several civilians. Official sources have put the number at 17 dead, but local individuals and groups have talked of 50 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/10/02/cameroon-s-anglophone-crisis-resulted-in-17-deaths-amnesty//|title=Cameroon's Anglophone crisis resulted in 17 deaths - Amnesty {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical members of some secessionist groups have killed several police officers and gendarmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/11/29/four-soldiers-killed-in-cameroon-s-anglophone-region//|title=Four soldiers killed in Cameroon's Anglophone region {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15,000 refugees have fled Southern Cameroons into neighboring Nigeria, with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] expecting that number to grow to 40,000 if the situation continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1179202/cameroons-anglophone-crisis-is-threatening-to-spin-out-of-control/|title=Cameroon’s Anglophone crisis is threatening to spin out of control|last=Dahir|first=Abdi Latif|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
Without clearly acknowledging the existence of the Anglophone problem, the President of Cameroon has attempted to appease tensions by making a number of announcements:
* President Biya ordered the creation of a Common Law department at the Supreme Court and the School of Administration and Magistracy, ENAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameroonpostline.com/biya-orders-creation-of-common-law-depts-at-supreme-court-enam/|title=Biya Orders Creation Of Common Law Depts At Supreme Court, ENAM {{!}} CameroonPostline|website=www.cameroonpostline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 2017 traditional end-of-year address, he announced there will be an effective decentralization scheme implemented by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/16-president-paul-biya-to-the-nationzzz|title=President Paul BIYA to the Nation|website=www.prc.cm|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of decentralization is one of the major tenets of [[Constitution of Cameroon#Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon of 1996|Cameroon's 1996 constitution]] which was spearheaded by the Anglophone opposition groups in parliament.
[[List of active separatist movements in Africa|Several separatist or secessionist groups]] have emerged or become more prominent as a result of the harsh response by the government to the Anglophone problem. These groups desire to see Southern Cameroons completely separate from ''[[Cameroon|La République du Cameroun]]'' and form its own state, sometimes referred to as ''[[Ambazonia]]''. Some groups such as the ''Southern Cameroon Ambazonia United Front'' (SCACUF) are using diplomatic means in an attempt to gain independence for the Anglophone regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ambagov.org/|title=Click To Learn More About The Interim Government of Ambazonia - AmbaGov|website=ambagov.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other groups have begun to employ armed confrontation with artisan weapons against the deployed gendarmes and soldiers in those regions.

'''Basic hostility''' is a [[psychological]] concept first described by psychoanalyst [[Karen Horney]]. Horney described it as a bad attitude which child develops as a result of "basic evil". Horney generally defines ''basic evil'' as "invariably the lack of genuine warmth and affection".&lt;ref&gt;Horney, Karen. The neurotic personality of our time. WW Norton &amp; Company, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Basic evil includes all range of inappropriate parental behavior&amp;nbsp;– from lack of affection to [[child abuse|abuse]]

==The pattern of basic hostility==
* The child wants to leave, but cannot. Although the child wants to avoid the abuse, his parents are perpetrating it.
* The child cannot move away or fight back against his parents because he is dependent on them.
* The child therefore redirects his feelings and expressions of hostility toward people he does not depend on for support.

According to Horney, some children find Basic Hostility to be an aggressive coping strategy and continue using it to deal with life's problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23372">In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], a '''canonical transformation''' is a change of [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''', ''t'') → ('''Q''', '''P''', ''t'')}} that preserves the form of [[Hamilton's equations]]. This is sometimes known as '''form invariance'''. It need not preserve the form of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] itself. Canonical transformations are useful in their own right, and also form the basis for the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s (a useful method for calculating [[constant of motion|conserved quantities]]) and [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] (itself the basis for classical [[statistical mechanics]]).

Since [[Lagrangian mechanics]] is based on [[generalized coordinates]], transformations of the coordinates {{math|'''q''' → '''Q'''}} do not affect the form of [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]] and, hence, do not affect the form of [[Hamilton's equations]] if we simultaneously change the momentum by a [[Legendre transformation]] into

:&lt;math&gt;P_i=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{Q}_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, coordinate transformations (also called '''point transformations''') are a ''type'' of canonical transformation. However, the class of canonical transformations is much broader, since the old generalized coordinates, momenta and even time may be combined to form the new generalized coordinates and momenta.  Canonical transformations that do not include the time explicitly are called '''restricted canonical transformations''' (many textbooks consider only this type).

For clarity, we restrict the presentation here to [[calculus]] and [[classical mechanics]].  Readers familiar with more advanced mathematics such as [[cotangent bundle]]s, [[exterior derivative]]s and [[symplectic manifold]]s should read the related [[symplectomorphism]] article.  (Canonical transformations are a special case of a symplectomorphism.)  However, a brief introduction to the modern mathematical description is included at the end of this article.

==Notation==
Boldface variables such as {{math|'''q'''}} represent a list of {{mvar|N}} [[generalized coordinates]] that need not transform like a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] under [[rotation]], e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \equiv \left (q_{1}, q_{2}, \ldots, q_{N-1}, q_{N} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

A dot over a variable or list signifies the time derivative, e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}} \equiv \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dot product]] notation between two lists of the same number of coordinates is a shorthand for the sum of the products of corresponding components, e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} \equiv \sum_{k=1}^{N} p_{k} q_{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product (also known as an "inner product") maps the two coordinate lists into one variable representing a single numerical value.

==Direct approach==
The functional form of [[Hamilton's equations]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\mathbf{p}} &amp;= -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
\dot{\mathbf{q}} &amp;= \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition, the transformed coordinates have analogous dynamics

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\mathbf{P}} &amp;= -\frac{\partial K}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \\
\dot{\mathbf{Q}} &amp;= \frac{\partial K}{\partial \mathbf{P}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''K''('''Q''', '''P''')}} is a new Hamiltonian (sometimes called the Kamiltonian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that must be determined.

In general, a  transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''', ''t'') → ('''Q''', '''P''', ''t'')}} does not preserve the form of [[Hamilton's equations]].  For time independent transformations between {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} and {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}} we may check if the transformation is restricted canonical, as follows.  Since restricted transformations have no explicit time dependence (by definition), the time derivative of a new generalized coordinate {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{Q}_{m} &amp;= \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} + \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}} \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}} - \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
&amp;= \lbrace Q_m , H \rbrace
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{⋅, ⋅} }} is the [[Poisson bracket]].

We also have the identity for the conjugate momentum ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H}{\partial P_{m}} =  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{q}}{\partial P_{m}} +  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}}{\partial P_{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the transformation is canonical, these two must be equal, resulting in the equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left( \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial p_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= -\left( \frac{\partial q_{n}}{\partial P_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}} \\
\left( \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial q_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= \left( \frac{\partial p_{n}}{\partial P_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The analogous argument for the generalized momenta ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' leads to two other sets of equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left( \frac{\partial P_{m}}{\partial p_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= \left( \frac{\partial q_{n}}{\partial Q_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}} \\
\left( \frac{\partial P_{m}}{\partial q_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= -\left( \frac{\partial p_{n}}{\partial Q_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the '''direct conditions''' to check whether a given transformation is canonical.

==Liouville's theorem==
The direct conditions allow us to prove [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]], which states that the ''volume'' in  phase space is conserved under canonical transformations, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \int d\mathbf{q} d\mathbf{p} = \int d\mathbf{Q} d\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Integration by substitution#Substitution for multiple variables|calculus]], the latter integral must equal the former times the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] {{mvar|J}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int d\mathbf{Q} d\mathbf{P} = \int J d\mathbf{q} d\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where the Jacobian is the [[determinant]] of the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of [[partial derivative]]s, which we write as

:&lt;math&gt;J \equiv \frac{\partial (\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P})}{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})}&lt;/math&gt;

Exploiting the "division" property of [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]s yields

:&lt;math&gt; J \equiv \frac{\partial (\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P})}{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{P})} \left/ \frac{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})}{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{P})} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating the repeated variables gives

:&lt;math&gt;J \equiv  \frac{\partial (\mathbf{Q})}{\partial (\mathbf{q})} \left/ \frac{\partial (\mathbf{p})}{\partial (\mathbf{P})} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

Application of the '''direct conditions''' above yields {{math|''J'' {{=}} 1}}.

==Generating function approach==
{{main|Generating function (physics)}}
To ''guarantee'' a valid transformation between {{math|('''q''', '''p''', ''H'')}} and {{math|('''Q''', '''P''', ''K'')}}, we may resort to an indirect '''generating function''' approach. Both sets of variables must obey [[action (physics)|Hamilton's principle]]. That is the [[Action Integral]] over the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{qp}=\mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{QP}=\mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t)&lt;/math&gt; respectively, obtained by the Hamiltonian via ("inverse") [[Legendre transformation]], both must be stationary (so that one can use the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] to arrive at equations of the above-mentioned and designated form; as it is shown for example [[Hamilton equations#Deriving Hamilton's equations|here]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \left[ \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) \right] dt &amp;= 0 \\
\delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \left[ \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) \right] dt &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One way for both [[calculus of variations|variational integral]] equalities to be satisfied is to have

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda \left[ \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) \right] = \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{dG}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

Lagrangians are not unique: one can always multiply by a constant {{mvar|λ}} and add a total time derivative {{math|{{sfrac|''dG''|''dt''}}}} and yield the same equations of motion (see for reference: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Classical_Mechanics/Lagrange_Theory#Is_the_Lagrangian_unique.3F]).

In general, the scaling factor {{mvar|λ}} is set equal to one; canonical transformations for which {{math|''λ'' ≠ 1}} are called '''extended canonical transformations'''. {{math|{{sfrac|''dG''|''dt''}}}} is kept, otherwise the problem would be rendered trivial and there would be not much freedom for the new canonical variables to differ from the old ones.

Here {{mvar|G}} is a [[generating function (physics)|generating function]] of one old [[canonical coordinates|canonical coordinate]] ({{math|'''q'''}} or {{math|'''p'''}}), one new [[canonical coordinates|canonical coordinate]] ({{math|'''Q'''}} or {{math|'''P'''}}) and (possibly) the time {{mvar|t}}.  Thus, there are four basic types of generating functions (although it should be noted that mixtures of these four types can exist), depending on the choice of variables. As will be shown below, the generating function will define a transformation from old to new [[canonical coordinates]], and any such transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} is guaranteed to be canonical.

===Type 1 generating function===
The type 1 generating function {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} depends only on the old and new generalized coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;G \equiv G_{1}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{Q}, t)&lt;/math&gt;
To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) = \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{p} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
\mathbf{P} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows.   The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} =\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|'''Q'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}. Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''Q'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = -\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.  Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;K = H + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple.  For example, let 
:&lt;math&gt;
G_{1} \equiv \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{Q}
&lt;/math&gt;
This results in swapping the generalized coordinates for the momenta and vice versa 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{p} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{Q} \\
\mathbf{P} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} = -\mathbf{q}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and {{math|''K'' {{=}} ''H''}}.  This example illustrates how independent the coordinates and momenta are in the Hamiltonian formulation; they are equivalent variables.

===Type 2 generating function===
The type 2 generating function {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} depends only on the old [[generalized coordinates]] and the new generalized momenta
:&lt;math&gt;G \equiv -\mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P} + G_{2}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{P}, t)&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; terms represent a [[Legendre transformation]] to change the right-hand side of the equation below.  To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) =   -\mathbf{Q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the old coordinates and new momenta are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{p} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
\mathbf{Q} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows.   The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}. Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''P'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized coordinates {{math|'''Q'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}. We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.  Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;K = H + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple.  For example, let 
:&lt;math&gt;G_{2} \equiv \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{q}; t) \cdot \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''g'''}} is a set of {{mvar|N}} functions.  This results in a point transformation of the generalized coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{q}; t)&lt;/math&gt;

===Type 3 generating function===
The type 3 generating function {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} depends only on the old generalized momenta and the new generalized coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;
G \equiv \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p} + G_{3}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{Q}, t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; terms represent a [[Legendre transformation]] to change the left-hand side of the equation below.  To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) = \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}} + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{q} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \\
\mathbf{P} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows. The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} = -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|'''Q'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''Q'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}. Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;
K = H + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial t}
&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple.

===Type 4 generating function===
The type 4 generating function &lt;math&gt;G_{4}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{P}, t)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the old and new generalized momenta
:&lt;math&gt;
G \equiv \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P} + G_{4}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{P}, t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; terms represent a [[Legendre transformation]] to change both sides of the equation below.    To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) = -\mathbf{Q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}} + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{q} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \\
\mathbf{Q} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows. The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{q} = -\frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{p}}
&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''P'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} &lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized coordinates {{math|'''Q'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.  Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;
K = H + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial t}
&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

==Motion as a canonical transformation==
Motion itself (or, equivalently, a shift in the time origin) is a canonical transformation. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}(t) \equiv \mathbf{q}(t+\tau)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(t) \equiv \mathbf{p}(t+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, then [[action (physics)|Hamilton's principle]] is automatically satisfied

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \left[ \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) \right] dt = \delta \int_{t_{1}+\tau}^{t_{2}+\tau}  \left[ \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t+\tau) \right] dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

since a valid trajectory &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{q}(t), \mathbf{p}(t))&lt;/math&gt; should always satisfy [[action (physics)|Hamilton's principle]], regardless of the endpoints.

==Modern mathematical description==
In mathematical terms, [[canonical coordinates]] are any coordinates on the phase space ([[cotangent bundle]]) of the system that allow the [[canonical one-form]] to be written  as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i\,dq^i&lt;/math&gt;

up to a total differential ([[exact form]]). The change of variable between one set of canonical coordinates and another is a '''canonical transformation'''.   The index of the [[generalized coordinate]]s {{math|'''q'''}} is written here as a ''superscript'' (&lt;math&gt;q^{i}&lt;/math&gt;), not as a ''subscript'' as done above (&lt;math&gt;q_{i}&lt;/math&gt;).  The superscript conveys the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant transformation properties]] of the generalized coordinates, and does ''not'' mean that the coordinate is being raised to a power.  Further details may be found at the [[symplectomorphism]] article.

==History==
The first major application of the canonical transformation was in 1846, by [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay|Charles Delaunay]], in the study of the [[Earth-Moon-Sun system]]. This work resulted in the publication of a pair of large volumes as ''Mémoires'' by the [[French Academy of Sciences]], in 1860 and 1867.

The '''Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue''', otherwise known as the [[Henry Dunant]] Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, or HD, is a private diplomacy organisation based in [[Switzerland]] that assists in [[mediation]] between conflicting parties to prevent or end armed conflicts.&lt;ref name=HDC&gt;

Founded in 1999, the aim of the organisation is to promote and facilitate dialogue among the leadership of the main belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It also conducts research and analysis on mediation and [[peacemaking]] in support of its operational work to improve international efforts to secure and sustain peace. To do so, HD opens channels of communication and mediates between parties in conflict, as well as facilitates dialogue and provides support to the broader mediation and peacebuilding community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/centre-humanitarian-dialogue|website=Geneva Peacebuilding Platform|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HD will facilitate dialogue in both confidential settings as well as public ones.

It is headquartered in Geneva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/centre-humanitarian-dialogue-hd-centre-0|website=International Geneva|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also the location of its Middle East and North Africa programme. HD has regional offices in Africa and Asia.

==History==
The initial intention of HD was to explore new concepts of humanitarian innovation by serving as a venue for dialogue on humanitarian issues - where discreet discussions could take place among those who could have a practical impact on humanitarian policy and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | pages = 114–116
 | isbn = 0313375763}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The organisation evolved this approach to include negotiations in support of humanitarian objectives&lt;ref name="discreetcharms"&gt;{{cite web
 | title =The discreet charms of the international go-betweens
 | publisher =The Economist
 | date =3 July 2008
 | url =http://www.economist.com/node/11670918
 | accessdate =24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aimed to create space for humanitarian activities in conflict environments. It quickly broadened, at the behest of conflicting parties in Aceh,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The discreet charms of the international go-betweens&lt;/ref&gt; to include the resolution of the conflict through mediation and conflict prevention.

In July 2015, in recognition of its important role in the mediation of armed conflicts, HD was granted a special status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Conseil fédéral conclut un accord sur les privilèges et immunités avec le Centre pour le dialogue humanitaire|url=https://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=fr&amp;msg-id=58018|website=Confederation Suisse|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] of Switzerland. Through this status, HD was awarded certain privileges and immunities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Council concludes agreement with Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue on privileges and immunities|url=http://www.noodls.com/viewNoodl/28941994/federal-department-of-foreign-affairs-of-the-swiss-confedera/federal-council-concludes-agreement-with-centre-for-humanita|accessdate=22 August 2015|agency=Noodls}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
intended to enable its peacemaking efforts worldwide.

===Leadership===
The Founding Executive Director of HD was Martin Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Griffiths|url=http://www.inter-mediate.org/martin_griffiths.html|website=Intermediate|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our staff|url=http://www.eip.org/en/people/staff|website=European Institute for Peace|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the organization for more than 10 years, from 1999 to July 2010, when he stepped down from his position. Griffiths was replaced for a brief period (July 2010 to March 2011) by [[Angelo Gnaedinger]], former Director General of the [[ICRC]] and the then HD Regional Director for the Middle East. Following this transitional period, [[David Harland]] was appointed as HD's new Executive Director in April 2011.

==Activities==
HD aims to bring parties together through mediation and dialogue on issues of common concern in conflict zones.&lt;ref name="Annual Report 2011, p. 2"&gt;Annual Report 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, this includes the following activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Open and maintain channels to or between parties to a conflict;
* Help prepare environments for mediation and the resolution of armed conflict;
* Facilitate dialogue in support of wider mediation and dialogue processes, and;
* Provide support to other mediation initiatives through advice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fritz|first1=Jan Marie|title=Moving Toward a Just Peace: The Mediation Continuum|date=18 November 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400728851|page=263|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=T4bEBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=centre+for+humanitarian+dialogue&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; people and operational assistance.

'''Cheating''' is the receiving of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], sleaze and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/search~S0?/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(cheating+)/1%2C63%2C63%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;8%2C8%2C |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on [[morality]], [[ethics]] or [[Convention (norm)|custom]], making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to [[infidelity]]. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a ''cheat'' in [[British English]], and a ''cheater'' in [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]]. A person described as a "cheat" doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on deceiving tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it.

[[File:Cheating.JPG|thumb|A small [[cheat sheet]] can be used to cheat during an academic examination.]]

[[Academic]] cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 64% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 58% say they have [[plagiarized]]. 95% of students admit to some form of cheating. This includes tests, copying homework, and papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by [[Rutgers University]] professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a [[Gallup survey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academicintegrity.org/icai/integrity-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; In McCabe's 2001 of 4500 high school students, "74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone's homework or peeked at someone's test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated."&lt;ref&gt;The Case of the Purloined Paper by Brigid Schulte&lt;/ref&gt; The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic; services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students, despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to [[educator]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |title=Ohiomatyc.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[MP3]] players can hold digitalized notes; [[graphing calculators]] store formulas to solve math problems.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reader's Digest]]'', pp. 123-7, March 2006; Cheating: "but everybody is doing it".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese civil service examination|Chinese civil service examinations]], the main route to career success for literate men in imperial China, was bedeviled for centuries by rampant cheating and examiner-bribery, as detailed in books like the Ming-dynasty ''[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 Book of Swindles]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport, games and gambling ==

=== Sports ===
{{Main article|Unsportsmanlike conduct}}
Cheating in sports is the intentional breaking of rules in order to obtain an advantage over the other teams or players. Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as "[[Doping in sport|doping]]"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors.
[[File:Lance Armstrong--2002--w.jpg|thumb|Lance Armstrong]]
High-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include [[Lance Armstrong]]'s use of [[steroid]]s in professional [[cycling]] - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s disqualification following the [[100 metres]] final at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and admissions of [[steroid]] use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as [[José Canseco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm |title=Canseco:Steroids made my baseball career possible |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ken Caminiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |title=Sports Illustrated:Steroids in baseball |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2002-06-23 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226205128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in [[figure skating]] when [[Tonya Harding]]'s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break [[Nancy Kerrigan]]'s leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, when [[Diego Maradona]] [[Hand of God goal|used his hand to punch the ball]] into the goal of [[England national football team|England]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Peter Shilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |title=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051451/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football.

Illegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as [[baseball]] and [[cricket]], which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a [[pitcher]] using a [[Spitball|doctored baseball]] (e.g. putting [[graphite]] or [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]] on the baseball), or a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] using a [[corked bat]] are some examples of this. [[Tennis]] and [[golf]] are also no strangers to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibited - such as in [[American football]] via the use of [[stickum]] on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly &amp; illegally using "stickum" throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling-pats-cheaters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/02/whos_cheating_now_jerry_rice_admits_stickum_use_af.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/jerry-rice-calls-out--cheating--patriots-but-admitted-to-using-stickum-200324269.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in [[professional bodybuilding]], cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in [[natural bodybuilding]] leagues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Cheating may also be seen in [[coaching]]. One of the most common forms of this is the use of [[bribery]] and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] in the player recruitment process. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in [[college sports]] recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with [[gambling|gamblers]] and [[match fixing]] (see also the section below on cheating in the gambling industry). The most famous coach of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Runnin' Rebels basketball team, [[Jerry Tarkanian]], was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense [[NCAA]] scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking [[corporate espionage]] or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams' strategies and tactics. The [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]], in which the [[New England Patriots]] were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the [[Denver Broncos]] during their back to back titles in the late 90's to circumvent the league's salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. During the [[2007 Formula One Season]], driver [[Fernando Alonso]] was labelled a "cheat" for exchanging confidential information between the teams of [[Scuderia Ferrari]] and [[Mclaren]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |title=Fernando is just a 'cheat' |publisher=thesun.co.uk |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-21 |location=London |first=Michael |last=Spearman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114233444/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[collusion]]. 

An example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]] when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team's silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1959181.stm | work=BBC News | title=Three-year Ban for Skating Judge | date=April 30, 2002 | accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Skating Union]] modified its [[ISU Judging System|judging system]] as a result of this case. 

Cheating is also used to refer to movements in [[strength training]] that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Video games ===
{{Main article|Cheating in video games}}
[[File:Action Replay Amiga500.jpg|thumb|The [[Action Replay]] card allows Amiga computer owners to cheat in videogames]]
In video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the [[Konami code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/gradius-nes-6035|title=Gradius Cheats &amp; Codes|publisher=IGN|language=English|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, [[hacking (computers)|hacks]] and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair [[collusion]] between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as "[[fog of war]]", and reports on enemy positions to game partners).

Attitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game's content unless the player's accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. On one hand, cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or one-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the [[Role-Playing Game]] (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as [[MMORPG]]s the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibited - though often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The [[Terms of Service#Video games|Terms of Service]] from many games where this is possible, directly prohibits this activity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One area where there is little consensus as of yet involves modern [[Free-to-play]] business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being 'Pay to win'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/08/13/separating-free-to-play-and-pay-to-win |title=Separating Free-to-Play and Pay-To-Win |publisher=IGN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; - sometimes considered a form of "cheating" that is actually legitimatized by the system - whilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair.

Another form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a [[software bug]]. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy's [[pathfinding]]; if a player can cause an enemy to become "stuck" in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually dispatch the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early [[first-person shooter]] games and involved skipping a weapon's reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons; resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files are substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc. - for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the Terms of Service of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambling ===
[[File:Georges de La Tour - Cheater with the Ace of Diamonds - WGA12334.jpg|thumb|''Cheater with the [[Ace of Diamonds]]'', by [[Georges de La Tour]]]]
{{see also|Cheating in casinos}}

The wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in [[gambling]] is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome.
A boxer who takes a dive, a [[casino]] which plays with secretly [[loaded dice]], a rigged [[roulette wheel]] or [[slot machine]], or a [[doctored deck of cards]], are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game's outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter [[odds]] may be regarded as [[salesmanship]] rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising [[skepticism]].
Doping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by [[cheering]] for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629123454/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of [[insider trading]]. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.
An [[advantage play]]er typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the [[casino]] industry have claimed that all [[advantage play]] is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of [[Nevada]], whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In "hole carding", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.
One way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as [[match fixing|throwing a game or taking a dive]]. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the [[Black Sox Scandal]], when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in [[boxing]] when [[Jake LaMotta]] famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against [[Marcel Cerdan]], a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.

== Business ==

Various [[Trade regulation|regulation]]s exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/u/unfair-competitive-advantage-energy/|title=unfair-competitive-advantage-energy (law)}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[competition law]], or the prohibition of [[insider trading]].

The most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as [[fraud]].

Balescu, ''Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics'', (John Wiley, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; are systems of particles which retain a definite volume, and are at sufficiently high temperatures (compared to their [[Fermi Energy|Fermi energy]]) that [[quantum]] effects can be neglected. A system of [[hard spheres]], interacting only by hard collisions (e.g., billiards, marbles), is a model classical fluid. Such a system is well described by the [[Percus–Yevick approximation|Percus-Yevik equation]]. Common liquids, e.g., liquid air, gasoline etc., are essentially mixtures of classical fluids. Electrolytes, molten salts, salts dissolved in water, are classical charged fluids. A classical fluid when cooled undergoes a freezing transition. On heating it undergoes an evaporation transition and becomes a classical gas that obeys [[Boltzmann]] statistics.
 
A system of charged classical particles moving in a uniform positive neutralizing background is known as a one-component plasma (OCP). This is well described by the Hyper-netted chain equation (see [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method|CHNC]]). 
An essentially very accurate way of determining the properties of classical fluids is provided by the method of [[molecular dynamics]].
An [[Free electron model|electron gas confined in a metal]] is NOT a classical fluid, whereas a very high-temperature plasma of electrons could behave as a classical fluid. Such non-classical [[Fermi gas|Fermi systems]], i.e., quantum fluids, can be studied using [[quantum Monte Carlo]] methods, Feynman [[path integral formulation|path integral]] equation methods, and  approximately via [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method|CHNC]] integral-equation methods.

'''Communication rights''' involve [[freedom of opinion]] and [[Freedom of expression|expression]], [[democracy|democratic]] [[Media (communication)|media]] [[governance]], [[media ownership]] and media control, participation in one's own culture, [[linguistic rights]], [[right to education|rights to education]], [[right to privacy|privacy]],  [[Right to assemble|assemble]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].  They are also related [[social exclusion|inclusion and exclusion]],  quality and [[accessibility]] to  means of communication.&lt;ref name=WACCA&gt;[http://centreforcommunicationrights.org/index.php/introduction.html What are communication rights?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109023820/http://centreforcommunicationrights.org/index.php/introduction.html |date=2014-11-09 }} How do they relate to [[human rights]]? How do they differ from  [[freedom of expression]] ? Centre for Communication Rights. [[World Association for Christian Communication|WACC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A "right to communicate" and "communication rights" are closely related, but not identical. The former is more associated with the [[New World Information and Communication Order]] debate, and points to the need for a formal legal acknowledgment of such a right, as an overall framework for more effective implementation. The latter emphasizes the fact that an array of international rights underpinning communication already exists, but many are often ignored and require active mobilization and assertion.&lt;ref name=WACCA /&gt;

==History==
The concept of the right to communicate began in 1969 with [[Jean D’Arcy]], a pioneer in French and European television in the 1950s and by 1969 Director of the United Nations Radio and Visual Services Division, where he was involved in international policy discussions arising out of the recent innovations in satellite global communications.  He recognized that the communication rights relating to freedom of expression embodied in the U. N. [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) adopted in 1948 would need to be re-examined in the context of global, interactive communication between individuals and communities. He called for the need for the recognition of a human right to communicate that would encompass earlier established rights.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy, Jean - [http://righttocommunicate.com/?q=node/117  The Right to Communicate] (edited by L. S. Harms).&lt;/ref&gt;  He thus was the first to link communication and ''universal'' human rights. His call was taken up by academics, policy experts, and public servants who evolved into the [[Right to Communicate Group]], the many non-governmental and civil society organisations that made up the Platform for Co-operation on Communication and Democratisation, and the Communication Rights in the Information Society (CRIS) Campaign.

The first broad-based debate on media and communication globally, limited mainly to governments, ran for a decade from the mid-1970s. Governments of the South, by then a majority in the UN, began voicing demands in [[UNESCO]] concerning media concentration, the flow of news, and ‘[[cultural imperialism]]’. The MacBride Report (1981) studied the problem, articulating a general ‘right to communicate’. The debate was compromised, however, by Cold War rhetoric, and fell apart after the US and the UK pulled out of UNESCO.

The ''MacBride Report'' became unavailable until the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC) sponsored its republication in 1988. WACC held the secretariat of the CRIS Campaign 2000–05.

Interest in the right to communicate languished during the 1980s as there was no mass movement to promote it for the simple reason few people had direct experience with interactive communication over global electronic networks.  This situation changed dramatically in the 1990s with a cluster of innovations that included the Internet, the World Wide Web, search engines, availability of personal computers, and social networking.  As more people participated in interactive communication and the many challenges it raised in regard to such communication rights as free of speech, privacy, and freedom of information, they began to develop a growing consciousness of the importance of such rights to their ability to communicate.

A result of this growing communicative consciousness is a renewed research interest in and political advocacy for a right to communicate (see references).  From the 1990s onwards, NGOs and activists{{Who|date=December 2012}} became increasingly active in a variety of communication issues, from community media, to language rights, to copyright, to Internet provision and free and open source software. These coalesced in a number of umbrella groups tackling inter-related issues from which the pluralistic notion of communication rights began to take shape, this time from the ground up.

==Four pillars==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each Pillar [of Communication Rights] relates to a different domain of social existence, experience and practice, in which communication is a core activity and performs key functions. The {{sic|rational}} for the four [pillars is,] that each involves a ''relatively autonomous sphere of social action'', yet ''depends on the others'' for achieving its ultimate goal - they are necessary interlocking blocks in the struggle to achieve communication rights. Action can be coherently pursued under, each, often in collaboration with other social actors concerned with the area more generally; while bridges can and must be built to the other areas if the goal is to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Ó Siochrú | 2005 | p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Communication knowledge===
"The terms and means by which knowledge generated by society is communicated, or blocked, for use by different groups."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

===Civil rights in communication===
"The exercise of civil rights relating to the processes of communication in society."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

===Cultural rights in communication===
"The communication of diverse cultures, cultural forms and identities at the individual and social levels."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

==Right to communicate vs. communication rights==
A ‘right to communicate’ and ‘communication rights’ are closely related, but not identical, in their history and usage. In the Cold War tensions of the 1970s and 1980s, the former became associated with the [[New World Information and Communication Order]] (NWICO) debate, thus, efforts within UNESCO to formulate such a right were abandoned.  The latter emphasizes the fact that an array of international rights underpinning communication already exists, but many are too often ignored and require active mobilisation and assertion.  While some, especially within the [[mass media]] sector, still see the right to communicate as a "code word" for state [[censorship]],the technological innovations in interactive electronic, global communication of recent decades are seen by others as challenging the traditional mass media structures and formulations of communication rights values arising from them, thereby renewing the need to re-consider the need for a right to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;These issues are explored more fully in Raboy's and Shtern's  ''Media Divides: Communication rights and the right to communicate in Canada'' (2010) and Dakroury, Eid, &amp; Kamalipour (Eds.), ''The right to communicate: Historical hopes, global debates, and future premises.'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''covariance group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformations]] between [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] (see for example Ryckman (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Ryckman 2005, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;). A frame of reference provides a set of coordinates for an observer moving with that frame to make measurements and define physical quantities. The [[covariance principle]] states the [[laws of physics]] should transform from one frame to another covariantly, that is, according to a [[Group representation|representation]] of the covariance group.

[[Special relativity]] considers observers in [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames]], and the covariance group consists of [[Rotation group SO(3)|rotations]], [[Lorentz transformation|velocity boosts]], and the [[Parity (physics)|parity transformation]]. It is denoted as [[Generalized orthogonal group|O(1,3)]] and is often referred to as [[Lorentz group]].

For example, the [[Maxwell equation#Covariant formulation of Maxwell.27s equations|Maxwell equation]] with sources,

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=4\pi j^\nu\,,&lt;/math&gt;

transforms as a [[four-vector]], that is, under the [[Representations of the Lorentz group#Common reps|(1/2,1/2)]] representation of the O(1,3) group.

The [[Dirac equation#Covariant form and relativistic invariance|Dirac equation]],

:&lt;math&gt;(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

transforms as a [[bispinor]], that is, under the (1/2,0)&amp;oplus;(0,1/2) representation of the O(1,3) group.

The covariance principle, unlike the [[Principle of relativity|relativity principle]], does not imply that the equations are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under transformations from the covariance group. In practice the equations for [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]] and [[strong interaction|strong]] interactions ''are'' invariant, while the [[weak interaction]] is not invariant under the parity transformation. For example, the Maxwell equation ''is'' invariant, while the corresponding equation for the [[Standard model (basic details)#The Gauge Field Lagrangian|weak field]] explicitly contains [[Standard model (basic details)#The charged and neutral current couplings|left currents]] and thus is not invariant under the parity transformation.

In [[general relativity]] the covariance group consists of all arbitrary ([[invertible]] and [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]) coordinate transformations.

{{History of Spain}}
In the [[Iberian peninsula]], the '''crown rabbi''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''{{lang|es|rabino mayor}}''' or [[Old Portuguese]]: '''{{lang|pt|arrabi mor}}''' (''chief rabbi'') ) was a secular, administrative post occupied by a member of the Jewish community for the benefit of the governing state, and existed in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] as far back as the 13th century, and is referred to as '''crown rabbi''' by historians in English, as well as by '''court rabbi''' and other terms.

== Terminology ==

In Spanish this position was known as ''[[:es:rabino mayor|rabino mayor]]'' or {{lang|es|rab de la corte}}, which can be translated literally as "chief rabbi" or "court rabbi", respectively, and which is referred to in some English sources as "crown rabbi"&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray-2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EB-Crescas" /&gt; and in others as "court rabbi".&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JE-1906-Senior" /&gt;  In Sicily (part of Aragon) the position was known locally as the ''[[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayyan]] kalali''&lt;ref name="Stow-2009" /&gt; and in Portuguese  as ''arrabi-mor''.&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oap-1903" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SingerAdler1907" /&gt;  The derivation of arrabi mor is through a very unusual, three-language merger of parts in [[Judaeo-Portuguese]], from Hebrew ''rabi'' (noun, "rabbi") preceded by [[Arabic definite article]] ''ar'' ("the", from [[Sun and moon letters|''al'' + initial ''r-'' consonsant]]), and Portuguese ''mor'' (''adj.'', "chief", in [[Portuguese_grammar#Adjectives|normal postposition]]).&lt;ref name="Wexler-2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wexler |first=Paul  |title=Jewish and Non-Jewish Creators of "Jewish" Languages: With Special Attention to Judaized Arabic, Chinese, German, Greek, Persian, Portuguese, Slavic (modern Hebrew/Yiddish), Spanish, and Karaite, and Semitic Hebrew/Ladino ; a Collection of Reprinted Articles from Across Four Decades with a Reassessment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ic5Kth7aiusC&amp;pg=PA513 |year=2006 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |location=Wiesbaden |isbn=978-3-447-05404-1 |page=513 |chapter=IX.

== History ==

The concept of an official rabbi performing administrative duties and acting as an intermediary existed as far back as the 13th century in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and elsewhere in the Iberian peninsula. 

The crown rabbi was one of the chief ways for the kingdoms in the peninsula to exert power over their Jewish communities. Those officials fulfilling this position often acquired significant secular power over their communities, and sometimes over provinces or even kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Ray-2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack Wertheimer |date=2004-03-20 |title=Jewish Religious Leadership: Image and Reality, Vol. 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUlAQAAIAAJ |volume=I |page=307-332 |chapter=Royal Authority and the Jewish Community: The Crown Rabbi in Medieval Spain and Portugal |last=Ray |first=Jonathan |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary |isbn=978-0873340977 |doi= |oclc= |access-date=2014-03-19 |quote=One of the most significant ways in which royal power came to influence the Jewish community was through the development of the post of Crown Rabbi, a product of the general expansion of royal administrations, which took place throughout the Iberian kingdoms in the second half of the thirteenth century.  Buttressed by the royal court, these Jewish magistrates quickly became the preeminent fiscal and judicial authorities with the local Jewish community ([[aljama]]) and in some instances, over the Jewries of entire provinces and kingdoms.  The nature and development of the rabbinate is one of the most important and controversial issues in medieval Jewish history, and a comprehensive study of the topic remains a desideratum. ... The common designation of "rabbi" used to describe both traditional Jewish legists and Jewish officials appointed by the crown has led some scholars to confuse the two. This confusion stems, in large part, from the relatively fluid and imprecise manner with which medieval Christian documents employ various renderings of the Hebrew term ''rav'' (lit. "teacher"), such as ''rabi'', ''arrabi'', ''rab'' and ''rap''. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castile and Aragon===

In Castile, the Court Rabbinate extended as an institution from 1255 until [[Alhambra Decree|Expulsion]] in 1492.  They were often laymen, not rabbis, and had near dictatorial authority of their flock.  They presided in appeals cases and international synods, and might also be a court physician, as well as tax collector over both the Jewish as well as the Christian community.  The last one to hold the office of crown rabbi of Castile was [[Abraham Seneor]] who became a ''[[converso]]'' rather than be expelled.&lt;ref name="Stow-2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stow|first=Kenneth|title=Alienated Minority: The Jews of Medieval Latin Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfLmJK-h3UIC&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-674-04405-0|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1386 in the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] for example, King [[John I of Aragon|John I]] in the context of a time of political reform, issued edicts defining the functions and duties of the {{lang|es|Rab Mayor}} as intermediary between the power of the kingdom and that of the ''[[aljama]]'', or Jewish community.  There were various requirements as to the good character and faith of the person holding this charge, as well as a requirement that he live among the entourage of the Court, and thus away from his community, and in constant contact with the Christian majority population. His powers and authorities over the {{lang|es|aljama}} of Castile, economic, judicial, and otherwise, were specified.&lt;ref name="Alvarez-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=209673 |journal=Edad Media: revista de historia (Middle Ages: History Magazine |language=Spanish |title=El cargo de Rab Mayor de la Corte según un documento de Juan II fechado en 1450 (The post of ''Rab Mayor'' in the Court according to a document of John II issued in 1450) |last1=Crespo Álvarez |first1=Macarena |date=2001 |website= |publisher=Á |volume= |number=4 |issn=1138-9621 |issue= |pages=157-198 |doi= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===the ''arrabi'' in Portugal===

In Portugal, the ''arrabi'' was a Jewish official who acted as a private municipal judge in a locality, chosen from among the community.&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854" /&gt;  

The term ''arrabi'' is attested from the late 12th century in Latin and Portuguese under [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], and is mentioned in a judicial sense in municipal legislation documents.  Sometimes it appears as ''Rabi''.  Documents from [[Lisbon]], [[Leiria]] and elsewhere suggest that there was one ''arrabi'' per community, who was an outpost of royal authority, parallel to and separate from the traditional rabbi who tended to their flock's religious and spiritual needs.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=Jonathan |title=The Sephardic Frontier: The Reconquista and the Jewish Community in Medieval Iberia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSXsSxs6n_8C&amp;pg=PA124 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |year=2006 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=0-8014-4401-2 |chapter=5. Jewish Communal Organization and Authority |pages=124–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presiding above the ''arrabis'' was a high functionary of the crown known as the ''arrabi mor'' (or arrabi-môr; ''chief rabbi'') and reporting to the King.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;  Besides supervising the administration of justice, he also was in charge of fiscal administration&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herculano |first=Alexandre |title=História da origem e estabelecimento da Inquisição em Portugal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xshGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |volume=Tomo I. |year=1854 |publisher=Imprensa Nacional |location=Lisbon |page=86 |language=Portuguese |trans-title=History of the Origin and Establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal |accessdate=5 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over the ''ouvidores'' (auditors) of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="oap-1903"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cardozo de Bethencourt |editor=J Leite de Vasconcellos |journal=O Archeólogo português |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXQNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |accessdate=5 June 2015 |volume=8 |date=March 1903 |publisher=Museu Ethnográphico Português |language=Portuguese, French |page=37 |title=Inscriptions Hébraïques du Portugal |trans-title=Hebrew Inscriptions of Portugal |number=2 |quote=Dans la grande division administrative du Judaisme Portugais, vers 1402, Faro fut le siege de l'un des sept auditeurs, ''ouvidores'', relevant de l{{'}}''arrabi-mor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The position of ''arrabi mor'' emerged in Portugal as a result of efforts begun in the 12th century to centralize the legal and fiscal system in the country.  By the late 13th century this effort extended to all of Portuguese Jewry, as manifested by the creation of a network of Jewish officials in each locality.  The head of this network was the ''arrabi mor'' (chief rabbi) who acted as the royal tax collector similar to the position of the ''almoxarife mayor''&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt; (chief financial administrator&lt;ref name="Roth2014"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medieval Jewish Civilization: An Encyclopedia |editor-last1=Roth |editor-first1=Norman |editor-link1= |title=Abravanel Family |last1=Roth |first1=Norman  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvhRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |orig-year=2003 |location=New York |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=978-1-136-77154-5 |oclc=827973299 |pages=6 |access-date=2015-06-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Castile.  Under him were seven officials also called ''arrabis'' or ''ouvidores'' (auditors) who were responsible for taxes in their region (''arrabiado''); the local ''arrabis'' were assigned to individual communities after the model in Castile and Aragon.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;

The high post tended to be filled by wealthy Jews, and the post was handed down and controlled by family dynasties.  The first ''arrabi mor'' mentioned was Don Judah in the 13th century under [[Denis of Portugal|King Dinis]], followed by his son Guedelha. The main duties were judicial, and fiscal.  Judicially, the decisions of the ''arrabi mor'' concerning matters in the Jewish community were final, per a decree by [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] in 1266, and he was responsible only for the highest issues, as the simpler suits and appeals were judged by the local ''arrabis''.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;

A powerful ''arrabi-mor'' could sometimes influence the laws of the kingdom in favor of the ''aljama''.&lt;ref name="SingerAdler1907"&gt;{{citation |last1=Singer |first1=Isidore |authorlink1=Isidore Singer |last2=Adler |first2=Cyrus |authorlink2=Cyrus Adler |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTsyAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=5 June 2015 |year=1907 |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company |location=New York |page=193 |chapter=Moses Navarro |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a man was Moses Navarro under King [[John I of Portugal]].  Following the carnage and forced conversions in the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacre of 1391|1391 massacre]] of Jews in Seville and its aftermath in other kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, the devastation threatened to spill across the border into Portugal, but Moses Navarro exercised his power and influence with the monarch and his knowledge of edicts from the [[Catholic Church|Vatican]] by Popes [[Boniface IX]] and [[Clement VI]] friendly to Jews to prevent any harm from coming to Portuguese Jewry.&lt;ref name="Kayserling1867"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kayserling |first=Meyer |authorlink=Meyer Kayserling |title=Geschichte der Juden in Portugal |trans-title=History of the Jews in Portugal |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7S0rYUA2kIwC |accessdate=5 June 2015 |year=1867 |publisher=Oskar Leiner |location=Leipzig |language=German |quote=That the fanaticism of this period did not claim victims in Portugal as well, was primarily due to the measures taken by then chief rabbi D. Moses Navarro.  Full of apprehension, the clergy in an excess of zeal could become carried away by such labors of love here as well.  In Coimbra at the end of 1391, the chief rabbi (who was also the king's personal physician) acting on behalf of all of Portuguese Jewry, presented his Lord and King a [[papal bull]] of [[Pope Boniface IX]] dated July 2, 1389, which in turn was based on an earlier edict of July 5, 1347 by a predecessor, namely the Jewish-friendly [[Pope Clement VI]]. In this bull, which was especially translated into Portuguese, it was strictly forbidden for a Christian to force a Jew to be baptised, or to strike him, rob him, or slay him; or to interrupt the [[Jewish festivals]] and ceremonies, or to disturb their cemeteries, dig up Jewish corpses, or by means of force to induce Jews to perform a job or a service which they were not legally obliged to perform in earlier times.  According to a decree issued in Coimbra on July 17, 1392, [[John I of Portugal|King John]] not only publicized the bull in all cities of the kingdom, but also promulgated a law to the same effect. &amp;nbsp; {{gray|Dass der Fanatismus um diese Zeit nicht auch in Portugal seine Opfer forderte, war vornehmlich den Vorkehrungen des damaligen Oberrabiners D. Moses Navarro zu danken.  Voller Besorgniß, die Geistlichkeit könnte in ihrem übernatürlichen Eifer sich auch hier zu solchen Liebesdiensten hinreißen lassen, überreichte der Oberrabbiner, der auch zugleich des Königs Leibarzt war, seinem Herrn und Könige gegen Ende des Jahres 1391 in Coimbra im Namen der ganzen portugiesischen Judenheit eine Bulle des Papstes Bonifacius IX vom 2. Juli 1389, der ein Früherer Erlaß eines Vorgängers desselben, des judenfreundlichen Papstes Clemens VI, vom 5. Juli 1347 zu Grunde lag. In dieser, eigens ins Portugiesische übersetzten Bulle wurde aufs Strengste verboten, daß ein Christ einen Juden zur Taufe zwinge, ihn Schlage, beraube oder tödte, die Fest- und Feierlichkeiten der Juden störe, ihre Begräbnißplätze verletze, die jüdischen Leichen ausgrabe und die Juden zu einem Dienste oder einer Arbeit mit Gewalt verhalte, zu denen sie in früheren Zeiten gezetzlich nicht verpflichtet waren.

Juli 1392 getroffenen Verfügung, nicht allein in allen Städten des Reiches publiciren, er erliess auch gleichzeitig ein dem Inhalte derselben analoges Gesetz.}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  King John upon hearing of the edicts, immediately promulgated a law on July 17, 1392 prohibiting any persecution, which was obeyed gladly by his subjects due to the extent of his popularity in the land.

In [[mathematics]], a [[category (category theory)|category]] is '''distributive''' if it has finite [[product (category theory)|product]]s and finite [[coproduct (category theory)|coproduct]]s such that for every choice of objects &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical map

: &lt;math&gt;[\mathit{id}_A \times\iota_1, \mathit{id}_A \times\iota_2] : A\times B + A\times C\to A\times(B+C)&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[isomorphism]], and for all objects &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical map &lt;math&gt;0 \to A\times 0&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism (where 0 denotes the [[initial object]]). Equivalently. if for every object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the [[endofunctor]] &lt;math&gt;A\times -&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;B\mapsto A\times B&lt;/math&gt; preserves coproducts up to isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Paul|title=Practical Foundations of Mathematics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and aforementioned canonical maps are equal for each choice of objects. 

In particular, if the functor &lt;math&gt;A\times -&lt;/math&gt; has a right [[adjoint functors|adjoint]] (i.e., if the category is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]), it necessarily preserves all colimits, and thus any cartesian closed category with finite coproducts (i.e., any [[bicartesian closed category]]) is distributive.

== Example ==

The [[category of sets]] is distributive. Let {{var|A}}, {{var|B}}, and {{var|C}} be sets. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A\times (B\amalg C) 
  &amp;= \{(a,d)|a\in A\text{ and }d\in B\amalg C\} \\
  &amp;\cong \{(a,d)|a\in A\text{ and }d\in B\}\amalg \{(a,d)|a\in A\text{ and }d\in C\} \\
  &amp;= (A\times B)\amalg (A\times C)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\amalg&lt;/math&gt; denotes the coproduct in '''Set''', namely the [[disjoint union]], and &lt;math&gt;\cong&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[bijection]].  In the case where {{var|A}}, {{var|B}}, and {{var|C}} are [[finite sets]], this result reflects the [[distributive property]]: the above sets each have cardinality &lt;math&gt;|A|\cdot (|B|+|C|)=|A|\cdot|B|+|A|\cdot |C|&lt;/math&gt;.

The category '''[[category of groups|Grp]]''' is not distributive, even though it has both products and coproducts.

An even simpler category that has both products and coproducts but is not distributive is the category of [[pointed set]]s.&lt;ref name="LawvereSchanuel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. W.

The '''Eocyte hypothesis''' is a [[biological classification]] that indicates [[eukaryote]]s emerged within the [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[Crenarchaeota]] (formerly known as eocytes), a phylum within the [[archaea]]. This hypothesis was originally proposed by [[James A. Lake]] and colleagues in 1984 based on the discovery that the shapes of [[ribosome]]s in the Crenarchaeota and eukaryotes are more similar to each other than to either [[bacteria]] or the second major kingdom of archaea, the [[Euryarchaeota]].&lt;ref name=Archibald&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John M. |last1=Archibald |title=The eocyte hypothesis and the origin of eukaryotic cells  |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=51 |pages=20049–20050 |date=23 December 2008 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/51/20049.full |accessdate=5 October 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811118106|pmid=19091952 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10520049A |pmc=2629348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James A. |last1= Lake |first2=Eric |last2=Henderson |first3=Melanie |last3=Oakes |first4=Michael W. |last4=Clark |title=Eocytes: A new ribosome structure indicates a kingdom with a close relationship to eukaryotes |journal=PNAS |volume=81 |pages=3786–3790 |date=June 1984 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/81/12/3786.short |accessdate=5 October 2012 |issue=12 |doi=10.1073/pnas.81.12.3786 |pmid=6587394 |pmc=345305|bibcode=1984PNAS...81.3786L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eocyte hypothesis.png|thumb|left|Schematic representation]]
The eocyte hypothesis gained considerable attention after its introduction due to the interest in determining the origin of the eukaryotic cell. This hypothesis has primarily been in contrast with the [[three-domain system]] introduced by [[Carl Woese]] in 1977. Additional evidence supporting the eocyte hypothesis was published in the 1980s, but despite fairly unequivocal evidence, support waned in favor of the three-domain system.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James A. |last1=Lake |title=Origin of the eukaryotic nucleus determined by rate-invariant analysis of rRNA sequences |journal=Nature |volume=331 |pages=184–186 |year=1988 |doi=10.1038/331184a0 |issue=6152 |pmid=3340165|bibcode=1988Natur.331..184L }}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 October 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archibald/&gt;

With advancements in [[genomics]], the eocyte hypothesis experienced a revival beginning in the mid-2000s. As more archaeal [[genomes]] were sequenced, numerous genes coding for eukaryotic traits have been discovered in various archaean phyla, seemingly providing support for the eocyte hypothesis. [[Proteomics]] based research has also found supporting data with the use of elongation factor 1-α ([[eEF-1]]), a common housekeeping protein, to compare structural homology between eukaryotic and archaean lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roger |first1=A |last2=Sandblom |first2=O |last3=Doolittle |first3=W.F. |last4=Philippe |first4=H |title=An evaluation of elongation factor 1 alpha as a phylogenetic marker for eukaryotes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=218–233 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026104|pmid=10028289 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other proteins have been sequenced through proteomics with homologous structures in [[heat shock proteins]] found in both eukaryotes and archaea. The structure of these heat shock proteins were identified though [[X-ray crystallography]] to find the three dimensional structure of the proteins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rivera |first1=Maria |last2=Lake |first2=James |title=Evidence That Eukaryotes and Eocyte Prokaryotes are Immediate Relatives |journal=Science |date=July 3, 1992 |volume=257 |issue=5066 |pages=74–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins however have differing purposes as the eukaryote heat shock protein is a part of the T-complex while the archaeal heat shock protein is a molecular chaperone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This creates an issue with the sequence homology that has been seen between [[Hsp70|70 kilodalton heat shock proteins]] in eukaryotes and gram negative bacteria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=R.S. |last2=Singh |first2=B. |title=Phylogenetic analysis of 70 kD heat shock protein sequences suggests a chimeric origin for the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Current Biology |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=1104–1114 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00249-9|year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a Crenarchaeal origin of eukaryotes, some studies have suggested that eukaryotes may also have originated in the [[Thaumarchaeota]].&lt;ref name=Archibald/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=S. |last1=Kelly |first2=B. |last2=Wickstead |first3=K. |last3=Gull |title=Archaeal phylogenomics provides evidence in support of a methanogenic origin of the Archaea and a thaumarchaeal origin for the eukaryotes |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=278 |issue=1708 |pages=1009–1018 |year=2011 |url=http://www.stevekelly.eu/pdf/Kelly_2010.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2012 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1427 |pmid=20880885 |pmc=3049024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anthony M. |last1=Poole |first2=Nadja |last2=Neumann |title=Reconciling an archaeal origin of eukaryotes with engulfment: a biologically plausible update of the Eocyte hypothesis |journal=Research in Microbiology |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=71–76 |year=2011 |url=http://norlx51.nordita.org/~brandenb/astrobiology/docs/Poole+Neumann2011.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2010.10.002|pmid=21034814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lionel |last1=Guy |first2=Thijs J.

The eocyte tree root may be located in the [[RNA World]], that is the root organism may have been a [[Ribocyte]] (aka Ribocell). For cellular DNA and DNA handling an "out of virus" scenario has been proposed, i. e. string genetic information in DNA may have been an invention performed by viruses later handed over to Ribocytes twice, once transforming them into bacteria and once transforming them into archaea.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Although archaeal viruses aren't as studied as bacterial phages, it is thought that dsDNA viruses lead to the incorporation of the viral genome into archaeal genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zilig |first1=W |title=Viruses, plasmids, and other genetic elements of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic Archaea |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |volume=18 |issue=2–3 |pages=225–236 |doi=10.1016/0168-6445(96)00014-9|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transduction of genetic material through a viral vector lead to an increase in complexity in the pre-eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=P |first1=Forterre |title=The Common Ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya Was Not as Archaeon |journal=Archaea |volume=2013 |pages=1–18 |date=2013 |doi=10.1155/2013/372396|pmid=24348094 |pmc=3855935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these findings do not change the eocyte tree as given here in principle, but zoom into a higher resolution of it.

==Arguments Against==
Due to the similarities found between eukaryotes and both archaea and bacteria, it is thought that a major source of the genetic variation is through horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leonard |first1=C.J. |last2=Aravind |first2=L |last3=Koonin |first3=E.V. |title=Novel Families of Putative Protein Kinases in Bacteria and Archaea: Evolution of the "Eukaryotic" Protein Kinase Superfamily |journal=Genome Research |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=1038–1047 |doi=10.1101/gr.8.10.1038|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[horizontal gene transfer]] is the reason for why archaeal sequences are found in bacteria and bacterial sequences are found in archaea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This could be the reasoning for why elongation factors found in archaea and eukaryotes are so similar, the data currently out is obscured as horizontal gene transfer, vertical gene transfer, or endosymbiosis could be behind the gene sequence similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Eocyte Hypothesis also has troubles due to the endosymbiotic theory and how the archaea were able to phagocytize the bacteria for the formation of membrane bound organelles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davidov |first1=Y |last2=Jurkevitch |first2=E |title=Predation between prokaryotes and the origin of eukaryotes |journal=BioEssays |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=748–757 |doi=10.1002/bies.200900018|pmid=19492355 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that these ancestral prokaryotes began to have ectosymbiotic relationships with other prokaryotes and slowly engulfed these symbiotes through cell membrane protrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baum |first1=David |title=An inside-out origin for the eukaryotic cell |journal=BMC Biology |date=28 October 2014 |volume=12 |pages=776 |doi=10.1186/s12915-014-0076-2 |pmid=25350791 |pmc=4210606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there has been data that attempts to confirm the relationship between eukaryotes and Chrenarcheota through the analysis of elongation factors, more recent experimentation with elongation factors provides data that disproves the eocyte hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hasegawa |first1=Masami |last2=Iwabe |first2=Naoyuko |last3=Mukohata |first3=Yasuo |last4=Miyata |first4=Takashi |title=Close evolutionary relatedness of archaebacteria, Methanococcus and Halobacterium, to eukaryotes demonstrated by composite phylogenetic trees of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G: Eocyte tree is unlikely |journal=The Japanese Journal of Genetics |date=11 April 1990 |volume=65 |pages=109–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasegawa et al. uses these elongation factors to help solidy that eukaryotes and archaebacteria are more closely related than archaebacteria and eubacteria that is explained in this 2 tree system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

A competing hypothesis is that prokaryotes evolved towards thriving in higher temperatures to evade viruses through the thermoreductive hypothesis, however this does not account for eukaryotes arise and only takes into consideration the prokaryotic origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forterre |first1=P |title=Thermoreduction, a hypothesis for the origin of prokaryotes |journal=PubMed |date=1995 |pages=415–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; However decrease in complexity from a more complex origin is the basis of reductive evolution where a commensal relationship occurs, while this reduction explained in the thermoreduction hypothesis uses a parasitic relationship with viruses to explain the movement of complex pre-eukaryotes to a more harsh environment; that being ocean floor hydrothermal vents.

Eroseanna “Sis” Robinson was an American social worker, track star, activist and member of the [[Peacemakers]] who organized for [[desegregation]] and against the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Riegle, Rosalie. Crossing the Line. Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2013, p.32; “Trio Ends Hunger Strike in Eatery Bias Case.” Jet Magazine, 12 Oct, 1961; “Tax Protest Turns to Jail Hunger Strike.” The Chicago Tribune, Jan. 29 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she was an advocate of [[nonviolent resistance]] strategies. Robinson went on hunger strike or risked violence and arrest multiple times, but nonetheless won various victories for equality. Born in 1924, Robinson died at age in 52 in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;“Eroseanna Robinson.” The War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee Website, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her activism, Robinson was a successful track runner. These two interests collided when she was chosen to represent the [[United States]] in a track meet against [[Russia]] and refused to participate because she felt she was being used as a “political pawn” by appearing alongside white athletes, giving the international community the false impression that white and black people were treated equally inside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edmund. Cold War and the Income Tax: A Protest. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1963, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

=== Integration of Skateland ===
In 1952, Eroseanna Robinson worked at a community center in [[Cleveland]] when she decided that she would help to desegregate a public skating facility called Skateland. In trying to accomplish this goal, she pursued a non-violent plan. In her first attempt to desegregate Skateland, she brought children—two black children and one white child—from the community center at which she worked to skate. White teenagers harassed the children. Over the next few days, Robinson returned with friends who supported her cause but was continually tripped and physically assaulted by white customers at Skateland. At one point, Robinson required urgent medical attention after she was shoved, causing her to break an arm. Skateland’s management and security teams did not intervene on Robinson’s behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Wolcott, Victoria W., Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters: The Struggle Over Segregated Recreation in America. Philadelphia, 2012, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War Tax Resistance ===
In early 1960, Robinson held another nonviolent protest by refusing to pay federal taxes as a way of showing her lack of support for the United States military. Her refusal to pay taxes caused her to be sentenced to a year of imprisonment, but she used the process as an opportunity to engage in nonviolent protest. When she was sentenced, Robinson has to be carried into the courtroom on a stretcher because she refused to walk. Once she was in prison, she held a three-month fast. She was force fed through a tube and then released nine months before her sentence was complete.&lt;ref&gt;Updegrove, R.L. "Refusing to Be the Other: Barbara Deming's Experiments with Nonviolence." Diss. Northern Arizona U, 2014, Print. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restaurant Integration ===
In 1961, Eroseanna Robinson travelled along [[Route 40 (MTA Maryland)|Route 40]] in Maryland with [[Wally Nelson|Wally]] and [[Juanita Morrow Nelson|Juanita Nelson]]. The three decided to stop for dinner in [[Elkton, Maryland]], but a diner refused to serve them. The trio refused to leave until police came and arrested them, putting them in county jail. In jail, they refused to appear in court or eat. Their story was picked up by local newspapers which dubbed them the “Elkton Three.” Since the trio refused to cooperate with the court proceedings, they were given $50 fines and released. Their case sparked a local movement for desegregation that ended up gaining then Maryland Governor [[J. Millard Tawes|Millar Tawes]]’ attention and led to eventual desegregation of restaurants along Route 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 204-210.”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Although not widely known amongst other African American civil rights activists, Robinson was instrumental in integrating several public spaces across the country in the early days of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She is perhaps most remembered for her methods of nonviolent resistance, which were deployed in sit-ins and other pro-integration demonstrations throughout the latter part of the Civil Rights Movement.

Her work to integrate restaurants along Maryland’s Route 40 had international ramifications, as foreign diplomats would often travel the road in trips from [[Washington, D.C.]]. to [[New York City]]. In 1958, Kenyan politician [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah|Komla Gbedema]] was denied service at a restaurant on Route 40, which embarrassed the [[Eisenhower]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 204.”&lt;/ref&gt; With the slogan “49 Miles of Highway and No Place to Stop and Eat,” Robinson, the Nelsons, and others were able to integrate these Maryland restaurants, which at the time hurt the United State’s international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 207-208.”&lt;/ref&gt; During several of Robinson’s [[hunger strike]]s, she also garnered headlines in African American publications, who lauded her relentless commitment to achieve racial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, John W., III. "Wally and Juanita Nelson and the Struggle for Peace, Equality, and Social Justice: 1935-1975." Diss. Morgan State U, 2008. ProQuest Dissertation Publishing. Web. 9 Apr. 2017., p. 207-208.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson stands as an icon of the war tax resistance movement. The [[National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee]], a grassroots movement with the aim of educating American taxpayers of their rights to resist making tax contributions to war efforts, touts Robinson as a foundational figure in their movement.

Social work, as a profession, has a history of leadership within social justice movements that dates back to the work of activists like Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Tricia B. Bent-Goodley; A Call for Social Work Activism. Soc Work 2015; 60 (2): 101-103. doi: 10.1093/sw/swv005, pg. 101.”&lt;/ref&gt; Today, social workers carry on this legacy of activism through grassroots movements such as RISE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diaz|first1=Fernanda|title=The New Generation of Activists: How Social Workers from RISE are Restoring Social Justice to their Profession|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fernanda-diaz/the-new-generation-of-act_b_781496.html|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=[[HuffPost]]|publisher=Oath Inc.|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Food waste.png|thumb|Food waste recycling]]

'''Food waste recycling''' is a process to convert [[food waste]] into useful materials and products for achieving sustainability of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts-1.eee.hku.hk/ccst9015sp12/greentech2/recycling-definition-and-overview/ Recycling: Definition and Overview]. ''Think Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Food waste]] is defined as all inedible and edible parts of food that creates preceding and succeeding food processing, production and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpower.org.hk/html/eng/2013_6.shtml Hong Kong's “Zero Food Waste"]. ''Green Power'', Jun 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Green house gas|Greenhouse gases]], especially [[methane]] can be reduced by food waste recycling. Food waste recycling can also alleviate the saturation of [[landfill]] sites in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.epa.gov/region9/waste/features/foodtoenergy/food-waste.html Turning Food Waste into Energy at the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD)]. ''US Environmental Protection Agency''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Current situation of food waste in Hong Kong===
The amount of food waste accounts for 38% of the [[municipal solid waste]] in [[Hong Kong]]. According to the statistics published by the [[Environmental Protection Department]], Hong Kong generates approximately 3,648 tonnes of food waste each day. About one-third of the food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors while the remaining part is from [[households]]. The situation of food waste disposal in [[Hong Kong]] has become more serious in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-rubbish/hong-kong-drowning-in-waste-as-china-rubbish-ban-takes-toll-idUKKBN1FK0J9?il=0https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-rubbish/hong-kong-drowning-in-waste-as-china-rubbish-ban-takes-toll-idUKKBN1FK0J9?il=0|title=Hong Kong drowning in waste as China rubbish ban takes toll|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of food waste from the commercial and industry sectors increased from 400 tonnes in 2002 to 1033 tonnes in 2014.&lt;ref name="epd"&gt;[http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/waste/prob_solutions/owt_food.html Food Waste Management in HK]. '' Environmental Protection Department''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three steps of food waste recycling in Hong Kong===
Food waste recycling typically involves a three-step strategy that includes [[Separation process|separation]], [[Waste collection|collection]] and [[recycling]]. These three steps are interdependent and equally important in efficiently generating useful resources from food waste recycling.

====Separation====
The collected food waste is separated into two categories: pre-consumer food waste and post-consumer food waste. Pre-consumer food waste includes animal food waste, vegetable food waste, and waste from industrially-processed food. Post-consumer food waste refers to leftover food, such as from an unfinished restaurant order. Source separation also involves removing any food packaging and utensils.&lt;ref name="enb"&gt;[http://www.enb.gov.hk/en/files/FoodWastePolicyEng.pdf A Food Waste &amp; Yard Waste Plan For Hong Kong 2014-2022]. '' Environment Bureau '', February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collection====
Food waste vehicles, managed by the government, collect and deliver food waste to governmental recycling facilities. These recycling facilities, known as Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTFs), will be spread across [[Districts of Hong Kong|Hong Kong's districts]]. The government plans to construct 5 to 6 OWTF networks, with a goal of recycling 1300 to 1500 tonnes of food waste between 2014 and 2024. The first facility is planned to be built in [[Siu Ho Wan]] to serve [[Lantau Island]] and districts nearby. The second and third are projected to be built in [[Sha Ling]] and [[Shek Kong]] so as to serve the [[New Territories]] and [[West Kowloon]].

The [[Environmental Protection Department]] also plans to construct two Organic Resources Recovery Centres (ORRCs) to collect the food waste and turn it into compost for recovery. These two centres will collectively be able to treat 500 tonnes of organic waste and divert 200 to 300 tonnes of waste from the landfills daily.&lt;ref name="ORRC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Organic Resources Recovery Centre (ORRC) |url=https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/waste/prob_solutions/WFdev_OWTF.html |website=Environmental Protection Department |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Centre will also be located in [[Siu Ho Wan]]. The construction works commenced in December 2014 and it is expected to be commissioned in early 2018.&lt;ref name="ORRC" /&gt;

====Recycling====
Two technologies are used to turn food waste into biogas and useful products. The first technology is a low-carbon method that processes 100 to 300 of tonnes food waste per day.&lt;ref name="enb" /&gt; By applying this technology, it produces a source of the renewable energy [[biogas]]. It is estimated that the first Centre will be able to provide 14 million kWh of electricity to Hong Kong's power grid every year, which can power 3,000 households.&lt;ref name="ORRC" /&gt; The second technology converts food waste into [[succinic acid]] by using [[enzyme]]s and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, K., Lin, S., &amp; Chan, C. (2013) [https://www.cityu.edu.hk/see/news/TurningFoodWasteIntoTreasure.pdf Turning Food Waste into Treasure]. '' Housing Dynamics ''.&lt;/ref&gt; The residues can be processed to be [[animal feed]], [[fertilizer]]s and environmental-friendly cleansing products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodwaste.foe.org.hk/html/eng/c_convert.php What is the use of food waste?]. ''Friends of the Earth'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling Program==

===The Hong Kong Government===

====Food Waste Recycling Partnership Scheme====
Food waste recycling partnership scheme is introduced by the [[Environmental Protection Department]] in 2009. The scheme was designed to promote a good practice on food waste management and enhance people’s experiences of separating and recycling food waste sources. The scheme collaborated with commercial and industrial sectors. Some members from the Hong Kong Government and that of the commercial and industrial sectors formed a working group for planning and managing the operation of the project. There are about 20 to 30 public and private organizations that participate in the scheme every year. In the project, all the participants will have a chance to practice separation process of food waste sources. The collection process of separated food waste will be carried out by the [[Environmental Protection Department]] and the [[Kowloon Bay Pilot Composting Plant]] will be responsible to the recycling part. The scheme also consists of discussion sessions for the participating parties to share their experience of recycling food waste. All participants will receive a commendation certificate at the end of the project.&lt;ref name="epd" /&gt;

====Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates====
From November 2012 to July 2014, The [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]] implemented a trial scheme, named as [[Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates]], with an aim to promote waste recycling in housing estates. The scheme involved 14 estates with about 3200 households. There were two modes adopted in the scheme. One is to convert food waste to fish grain by transporting them to a Central Food Waste Recycling Plant. The other one is to convert food waste into compost for farm by using [[micro-organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201412/17/P201412170528.htm LCQ16: Food waste recycling trial scheme in public housing estates]. ''Hong Kong Information Services Department'', 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food Waste Recycling Scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island====
On 31 March 2012, The Environmental Protection Department introduced a recycling scheme on [[Cheung Chau]] and [[Lamma Island]]. The purpose of the scheme is to promote and encourage food waste recycling on both islands. Food waste collected from shops and restaurants would be transported to the food waste treatment facilities on the islands. The food waste would be converted to organic compost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201305/08/P201305080291.htm LCQ9: Reduction and treatment of food waste]. ''Hong Kong Information Services Department'', 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organization===

====Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre====
[[Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre]] (HKOWRC) was established in 2011 as the first [[organic waste management]] consulting firm in Hong Kong. It combines local and foreign technologies to provide one-stop organic recycling services to customers. The assistance in collection of food waste solves problems of companies in immature recycling. Through commitment to different types of people, HKOWRC can promote and provide waste management training for particular customers.&lt;ref name="hkowrc"&gt;[http://www.hkowrc.com/eng-service.html Our Services]. ''Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Daily Food Waste Recycling Service=====
The objectives of the collection and recycling routine are to educate the general public in cherishing food as well as making good use of resources. The service encourages two-way cooperation for food waste recycling. HKOWRC aims to provide 24-hour recycling services particularly to [[Breeders|livestock breeders]], [[farmers]], [[Catering|catering industry]], [[schools]] and large-scale [[housing estates]]. For most of the cases, the recycled food waste is to be used by the service targets again for other purposes, therefore avoiding wastage of resources. For [[Breeders|livestock breeders]] and [[farmers]], the recycled food waste is converted to [[animal feeds]] and [[fertilizers]] that contain richer nutritional values than the conventional ones. It possibly gives higher yield. For [[Catering|catering industry]], the recycled food waste is converted to crops which are grown from organic compost from HKOWRC for latest organic food at a special prize. For [[schools]] and [[housing estates]], it aims to raise the awareness of food [[waste reduction]] when the recycling service reveals the huge amount of food wastes accumulated.&lt;ref name="hkowrc" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1750">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''front-to-back ratio''' (''also known as front-to-rear ratio'') can mean:
#The ratio of power gain between the front and rear of a [[directional antenna]]. 
#Ratio of signal strength transmitted in a forward direction to that transmitted in a backward direction. For receiving antennas, the ratio of received-signal strength when the antenna is rotated 180°.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Shack 1974-75 unabridged Dictionary of Electronics edited by Rudolf F. Graf, cat. no. 68-1030&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio compares the [[antenna gain]] in a specified direction, ''i.e.'', [[azimuth]], usually that of maximum gain, to the gain in a direction 180° from the specified azimuth. A front-to-back ratio is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]].  

In [[Fixed wireless|point-to-point]] microwave antennas, a "high performance" antenna usually has a higher front to back ratio than other antennas.  For example, an unshrouded 38 GHz microwave dish may have a front to back ratio of 64 dB, while the same size reflector equipped with a shroud would have a front to back ratio of 70 dB.  Other factors affecting the front to back ratio of a parabolic microwave antenna include the material of the dish and the precision with which the reflector itself was formed.

In other [[electrical engineering]] the '''front to back ratio''' is a [[ratio]] of [[parameter]]s used to characterize [[rectifier]]s or other devices, in which [[electric current]], [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] strength, [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], or other parameters, in one direction is compared with that in the opposite direction.

The [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222648006_A_clustering_algorithm_based_on_graph_connectivity  '''HCS (Highly Connected Subgraphs) clustering algorithm''']&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.1016/S0020-0190(00)00142-3| title=A clustering algorithm based on graph connectivity | year=2000 | last1=Hartuv | first1=E. | last2=Shamir | first2=R. | journal=Information Processing Letters| volume=76 | issue=4-6 | pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the '''HCS algorithm''' , and other names such as '''Highly Connected Clusters/Components/Kernels''') is an algorithm based on graph connectivity for [[Cluster analysis]], by first representing the similarity data in a [[similarity graph]], and afterwards finding all the highly connected subgraphs as clusters. The algorithm does not make any prior assumptions on the number of the clusters. This algorithm was published by Erez Hartuv and [[Ron Shamir]] in 1998.

The HCS algorithm gives clustering solution, which is inherently meaningful in the application domain, since each solution cluster must have diameter 2 while a union of two solution clusters will have diameter 3.

== Similarity Modeling and Preprocessing ==

The goal of cluster analysis is to group elements into disjoint subsets, or clusters, based on similarity between elements, so that elements in the same cluster are highly similar to each other (homogeneity), while elements from different clusters have low similarity to each other (separation). Similarity graph is one of the models to represent the similarity between elements, and in turn facilitate generating of clusters. To construct a similarity graph from similarity data, represent elements as vertices, and elicit edges between vertices when the similarity value between them is above some threshold.

== Algorithm ==

In the similarity graph, the more edges exist for a given number of vertices, the more similar such a set of vertices are between each other. In other words, if we try to disconnect a similarity graph by removing edges, the more edges we need to remove before the graph becomes disconnected, the more similar the vertices in this graph. [[Minimum cut]] is a minimum set of edges without which the graph will become disconnected.

{{See also|Connectivity (graph_theory)}}

HCS clustering algorithm finds all the subgraphs with n vertices such that the minimum cut of those subgraphs contain more than n/2 edges, and identifies them as clusters. Such a subgraph is called a [[Highly Connected Subgraph]] (HCS). Single vertices are not considered clusters and are grouped into a singletons set S.

{{See also|Minimum cut}}

Given a similarity graph G(V,E), HCS clustering algorithm will check if it is already highly connected, if yes, returns G, otherwise uses the minimum cut of G to partition G into two subgraphs H and H', and recursively run HCS clustering algorithm on H and H'.

== Example ==

The following animation shows how the HCS clustering algorithm partitions a similarity graph into three clusters.

[[File:HCS Algorithm.gif]]

== Pseudocode ==

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
1  function HCS(G(V,E))   
2    if G is highly connected
3      then return (G)
4    else
5     (H1,H2,C) ← MINIMUMCUT(G)
6      HCS(H1)
7      HCS(H2)
8    end if
9  end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The step of finding the minimum cut on graph G is a subroutine that can be implemented using different algorithms for this problem. See below for an example algorithm for finding minimum cut using randomization.

== Complexity ==

The running time of the HCS clustering algorithm is bounded by N x f(n,m). f(n,m) is the time complexity of computing a minimum cut in a graph with n vertices and m edges, and N is the number of clusters found. In many applications N &lt; &lt; n.

For fast algorithms for finding a minimum cut in an unweighted graph: {{See also|Karger's algorithm}}

== Proof of correctness ==

The clusters produced by the HCS clustering algorithm possess several properties, which can demonstrate the homogeneity and the separation of the solution.

'''Theorem 1''' The diameter of every highly connect graph is at most two.

''Proof:'' We know the edges of minimum cut must be greater or equal than the minimum degree of the graph. If the graph G is highly connected, then the edges of the minimum cut must be greater than the number of vertices divided by 2. So the degree of vertices in the highly connected graph G must be greater than half the vertices. Therefore, for any two vertices in this graph G, there must be at least one common neighbor, as the distance between them is two.

{{See also|Distance (graph theory)}}

'''Theorem 2''' (a) The number of edges in a highly connected subgraph is quadratic. (b) The number of edges removed by each iteration of the HCS algorithm is at most linear.

''Proof:'' (For a) From Theorem 1 we know every vertex must have more than half of the total vertices as neighbors. Therefore, the total number of edges in a highly connect subgraph must be at least (n/2) x n x 1/2, where we sum all the degrees of each vertex and divide by 2.

(For b) Each iteration HCS algorithm will separate a graph containing n vertices into two subgraphs, so the number of edges between those two components is at most n/2.

Theorem 1 and 2a provide a strong indication to the homogeneity, as the only better possibility in terms of the diameter is that every two vertices of a cluster are connected by an edge, which is both too stringent and also a [[Clique problem|NP-hard problem]].

Theorem 2b also indicates separation since the number of edges removed by each iteration of the HCS algorithm is at most linear in the size of the underlying subgraph, contrast to the quadratic number of edges within final clusters.

== Variations ==

'''Singletons adoption''': Elements left as singletons by the initial clustering process can be "adopted" by clusters based on similarity to the cluster. If the maximum number of neighbors to a specific cluster is large enough, then it can be added to that cluster.

'''Removing Low Degree Vertices''': When the input graph has vertices with low degrees, it is not worthy to run the algorithm since it is computationally expensive and not informative. Alternatively, a refinement of the algorithm can first remove all vertices with a degree lower than certain threshold.

'''Harlan Lane''' (born 19 August 1936) is an American psychologist. Lane is the Matthews Distinguished University Professor of [[Psychology]] at [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]], and founder of the Center for Research in Hearing, Speech, and Language {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. His research is focused on speech, [[Deaf culture]], and [[sign language]]. 

Lane was born in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Harlan, Ben Bahan, and Bob Hoffmeister. 1996. ''A Journey into the Deaf-World''. San Diego, C.A.: DawnSignPress, 1996. {{ISBN|0915035634}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining in New York City for college, he obtained both a B.S. and an M.S. in Psychology from Columbia University in 1958. He subsequently received a PhD. in Psychology from Harvard (1960) and a ''Doc. des Lettres'' from the [[Sorbonne]] (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harlan Lane, Psychologist and Linguist|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/438/|website=MacArthur Fellows Program|publisher=MacArthur Foundation|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Lane received a [[MacArthur Foundation Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="northeastern"&gt;Lane, Harlan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">'''Homology''' in [[psychology]], as [[Homology (biology)|in biology]], refers to a relationship between characteristics that reflects the characteristics' origins in either evolution or development. Homologous behaviors can theoretically be of at least two different varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=David S.|title=Importing the homology concept from biology into developmental psychology|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|year=2013|volume=55|issue=1|pages=13–21|doi=10.1002/dev.21015|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21015/full|accessdate=11 July 2013|pmid=22711075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with [[Homology (biology)|homologous anatomical characteristics]], behaviors present in different species can be considered homologous if they are likely present in those species because the behaviors were present in a common ancestor of the two species. Alternatively, in much the same way as reproductive structures (e.g., the penis and the clitoris) are considered homologous because they share a common origin in embryonic tissues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=G. P.|title=The biological homology concept|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1989|volume=20|pages=51–69|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.20.110189.000411}}&lt;/ref&gt; behaviors—or the [[neural substrate]]s associated with those behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Michael L.|author2=Penner-Wilger, M.|title=Neural reuse in the evolution and development of the brain: Evidence for developmental homology?|journal=Developmental Psychobiology |year=2013|volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=42–51|doi=10.1002/dev.21055|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21055/full|accessdate=11 July 2013|pmid=22711453}}&lt;/ref&gt;—can also be considered homologous if they share common origins in development.

Behavioral homologies have been considered since at least 1958, when [[Konrad Lorenz]] studied the evolution of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |authorlink=Konrad Lorenz |title=The Evolution of Behavior |journal=Scientific American |year=1958 |volume=199 |issue=6 |pages=67–78 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1258-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the question of behavioral homologies has been addressed by [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] such as [[Marc Ereshefsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ereshefsky|first=Marc|title=Psychological categories as homologies: Lessons from ethology |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |year=2007|volume=22 |pages=659–674 |doi=10.1007/s10539-007-9091-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=Marc |title=Homology thinking |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=March 2012 |doi=10.1007/s10539-012-9313-7 |volume=27 |pages=381–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychologists such as Drew Rendall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rendall |first=Drew |author2=Di Fiore |title=Homoplasy, homology, and the perceived special status of behavior in evolution |journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2007 |volume=52 |pages=504–521|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.11.014 |pmid=17383711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscientist]]s such as Georg Striedter and Glenn Northcutt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Striedter|first=Georg |author2=Northcutt |title=Biological hierarchies and the concept of homology|journal=Brain, Behavior and Evolution |year=1991 |volume=38 |pages=177–189 |doi=10.1159/000114387}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is debatable whether the concept of homology is useful in [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blumberg|first=Mark S.|title=Homology, correspondence, and continuity across development: The case of sleep |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |year=2013|volume=55 |issue=1|pages=92–100 |doi=10.1002/dev.21024 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21024/full |pmid=22711221 |pmc=3459138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop: Homology in Developmental Psychology|url=http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/homology/|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore|first1=David S. |title=Importing the homology concept from biology into developmental psychology |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |date=January 2013|volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |doi=10.1002/dev.21015|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21015/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman [[primates]], argue that patterns of behaviour in [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rajecki, D.

This agreement of unusual characteristics is found at several levels, including fine motor movement, gross motor movement, and behavior at the group level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[op-ed]] published in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' he wrote that after his arrival in Iraq in 2006 he found:&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2008-12-04/&gt;

{{quote|The Army was still conducting interrogations according to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay model]]: Interrogators were nominally using the methods outlined in the [[U.S. Army Interrogation Field Manual|U.S. Army Field Manual]], the interrogators' bible, but they were pushing in every way possible to bend the rules -- and often break them.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2008-12-04/&gt;}}

So, eventually they acquiesced on eighty of the ninety-three redactions.}}

Alexander is an outspoken opponent of [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtobreakaterrorist.blogspot.com/ Terrorist Breaker Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; He refutes the [[effectiveness of torture]], citing its negative long-term effects such as recruiting for Al-Qaeda. He also argues that torture is contrary to the American principles of freedom, liberty, and justice, and that should they resort to torture, American interrogators become the enemy they serve to defeat. Similar arguments have been made by other former interrogators from the [[U.S. military]], [[FBI]], and the [[CIA]], including Colonel [[Steven Kleinman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Background.view&amp;backgroundid=272 Abuse Has No Place in Interrogation Policy, Nieman Watchdog Group Commentary, July 29th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with human rights lawyer [[Scott Horton (lawyer)|Scott Horton]] for [[Harper's Magazine]], Alexander said

{{quote|The American public has a right to know that they do not have to choose between torture and terror. There is a better way to conduct interrogations that works more efficiently, keeps Americans safe, and doesn't sacrifice our integrity. Our greatest victory to date in this war, the death of [[Abu Musab Al Zarqawi]] (which saved thousands of lives and helped pave the way to the [[Sunni Awakening]]), was achieved using interrogation methods that had nothing to do with torture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14060">'''Informatization''' or '''informatisation''' refers to the extent by which a geographical area, an economy or a society is becoming information-based, i.e. the increase in size of its information labor force. Usage of the term was inspired by [[Marc Porat]]’s categories of ages of human civilization: the Agricultural Age, the Industrial Age and the Information Age (1978). Informatization is to the Information Age what industrialization was to the Industrial Age. It has been stated that:

:The Agricultural Age has brought about the agriculturization of the planet. The Industrial Age has caused among other things the industrialization of agriculture. The Information Age has resulted to the informatization of the agricultural industry (Flor, 1993).

The term has mostly been used within the context of national development. [[Everett Rogers]] ([[#Rogers2000|2000]]) defines informatization as the process through which new communication technologies are used as a means for furthering development as a nation becomes more and more an [[information society]]. However, some observers, such as Alexander Flor ([[#Flor1986|1986]]) have cautioned about the negative impact of informatization on traditional societies.

Recently, the [[technological determinism]] dimension has been highlighted in informatization. [[Randy Kluver]] of Texas A&amp;M University defines informatization as the process primarily by which information technologies, such as the World Wide Web and other communication technologies, have transformed economic and social relations to such an extent that cultural and economic barriers are minimized. Kluver expands the concept to encompass the civic and cultural arenas. He believes that it is a process whereby information and communication technologies shape cultural and civic discourse.

[[G. Wang]] describes the same phenomenon (1994) which she calls "informatization" as a "process" of change that features (a) the use of informatization and IT (information technologies) to such an extent that they become the dominant forces in commanding economic, political, social and cultural development; and (b) unprecedented growth in the speed, quantity, and popularity of information production and distribution."

==Origin of the term==
The term informatisation was coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in their publication ''L'Informatisation de la société: Rapport à M. le Président de la République''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=L'informatisation de la société|journal=La Documentation française|date=1978|pages=901|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/154000252/index.shtml|accessdate=23 February 2016|ref=nora-minc|isbn=2020049740}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated in English in 1980 as ''The Computerization of Society: A report to the President of France''.&lt;ref name="nora-minc-en"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=The computerization of society : a report to the President of France0-262-64020-1|date=1981|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262640201|pages=208|edition=2. pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]) However, in an article published in 1987 Minc preferred to use informatisation and not [[Digital Revolution|computerization]].

After the 1978 publication the concept was adopted in French, German and English subject literatures and was broadened to include more aspects than only computers and [[telecommunication]]s ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]).

==Social impact of informatization==
Informatization has many far-reaching consequences in society. Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) observes that these include repercussions in economics, politics and other aspects of modern living. In the economic sphere, for example, information is viewed as a focal resource for development, replacing the centrality of labor and capital during the industrial age. In the political arena, there are increased opportunities for participative democracy with the advent of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) that provide easy access to information on varied social and political issues.

==Informatization in economic systems==
[[Industrialization]] propelled transformation of the economic system from agricultural age to modernized economies, and so informatization ushered the industrial age into an information-rich economy. Unlike the agricultural and industrial ages where economics refers to optimization of scarce resources, the information age deals with maximization of abundant resources. Alexander Flor ([[#Flor2008|2008]]) wrote that informatization gives rise to information-based economies and societies wherein information naturally becomes a dominant commodity or resource. The accumulation and efficient use of knowledge has played a central role in the transformation of the economy ([[#Linden2004|Linden 2004]]).

==Globalization and informatization==
Over the years, [[globalization]] and informatization have "redefined industries, politics, cultures, and perhaps the underlying rules of social order" ([[#Friedman|Friedman 1999]]). Although they explain different phenomena, their social, political, economic, and cultural functions remarkably overlaps. "Although globalization ultimately refers to the integration of economic institutions, much of this integration occurs through the channels of technology. Although international trade is not a new phenomenon, the advent of communications technologies has accelerated the pace and scope of trade" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::a) Globalization and Informatization will have great impact on cultural and social consequences of society.

::b) "Globalization and informatization are likely to diminish the concept of the national as a political institution" ([[#Poster|Poster 1999]]). Friedman ([[#Friedman|1999]]) argues that as nation states decline in importance, [[multi-national corporation]]s, [[nongovernmental organizations]], and "superempowered individuals" such as [[George Soros]] gain influence and importance. As these non-political organizations and institutions gain importance, there are inevitable challenges to political, economic, and cultural processes.

::c) On the other hand, globalization and informatization allow for efficient flow of information.  Individuals and societies are, therefore, greatly empowered to engage in international arena for economic, political, and cultural resources.

::d) "There is proliferation of information about lifestyles, religions, and cultural issues.  The telecommunications and computer networks also allow for unprecedented global activism.  This democratization of information increases the potential for international harmony, although it by no means guarantees it" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::e) These twin forces greatly affects "centuries of tradition, local autonomy, and cultural integrity."

::f) "Finally, one of the potentially most devastating impact of the forces of globalization and informatization is that there is created an insidious conflict between the new global economic order and the local, or even tribal, interests" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

==Measurement of informatization==
Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) proposed to measure the informatization in a country using a composite measure made up of the following extraneous variables: Education, R&amp;D Expenditure, Agricultural Sector and [[Intellectual Property]]. Kim also relates increasing democracy as evidence of social informatization.  It supposedly take into consideration the three approaches to conceptualizing informatization namely the economic, technological, and stock. Each can be measured with economic data (e.g. GDP), ICT data (e.g. number of computers per population), and amount of information (e.g. number of published technological journals) respectively.

Such composite measure is similar to the [[World Bank]]'s Knowledge Assessment Methodology (KAM) Variables ([[#Worldbank1|2008]]) which are clustered into: overall performance of the economy, economic incentive and institutional regime, innovation system, education and human resources, and information and communication technology.

==The Problem of Measuring Informatization==
The measurement for the level of informatization is an ongoing area of development. Among the issues are the ambiguity of the definition of “information” and whether this entity can be quantifiable in contrast to the tangible products of industrialization.

Taylor and Zang ([[#TaylorAndZang2007|2007]]) explored the issues behind the limitations of current theoretical models in terms of quantifying the positive impacts of ICT projects, and provided critiques of the information indicators used to gauge and justify informatization projects.

International organizations such as the United Nations, through its World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU); and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also recognize this challenge and have initiated efforts to improve the methodologies for measuring an “information society”.

==National laws on informatization==
Informatization is recognized by states as important to national development. Some states have created laws implementing or regulating informatization.

In [[Russia]] the State [[Duma]] enacted the ''Federal Law on Information, Informatization, and the Protection of Information'' on January 25, 1995. It was signed into law by President Boris Yeltsin on February 20, 1995.

[[Azerbaijan]] had a ''Law on Information, Informatization and Protection of Information'' in 1998.

An '''interpretation''' is an assignment of meaning to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a [[formal language]]. Many formal languages used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical computer science]] are defined in solely [[syntax|syntactic]] terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].

The most commonly studied formal logics are [[propositional logic]], [[predicate logic]] and their [[modal logic|modal]] analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that provides the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]] of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate ''T'' (for "tall") and assign it the extension {''a''} (for "Abraham Lincoln"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant ''T'', and does not make a claim about whether ''T'' is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'.  Though ''we'' may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.

An interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the [[truth value]]s of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]], the interpretation is called a [[model (model theory)|model]] of that sentence or theory.

== Formal languages ==
{{main|Formal language}}

A formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of ''sentences'' (variously  called ''words'' or ''[[well formed formula|formulas]]'') built from a fixed set of ''letters'' or ''symbols''. The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the ''[[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]'' over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called ''[[Well-formed_formula|well-formed formulæ]]'' (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (''P'' or ''Q'') is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.

=== Example ===
A formal language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined with the
alphabet &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \{ \triangle, \square \}&lt;/math&gt;, and with a word being in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; if it begins with &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and is composed solely of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

A possible interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; could assign the decimal digit '1' to &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and '0' to &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\triangle \square \triangle&lt;/math&gt; would denote 101 under this interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Logical constants ===
In the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols ([[logical constant]]s) and the non-logical symbols.  The idea behind this terminology is that ''logical'' symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while ''non-logical'' symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.

Logical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ ("all") and ∃ ("some"), symbols for [[logical connective]]s ∧ ("and"), ∨ ("or"), ¬ ("not"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.

== General properties of truth-functional interpretations ==
Many of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called ''truth functional'';{{dubious|reason=The article 'Truth-functional' gives a more restricted definition: the truth-value of a compound sentence should be a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences.|date=September 2015}} they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be ''[[satisfiable|satisfied]]'' by that assignment.

No sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation,{{dubious|reason=Except for paraconsistent logic.|date=September 2015}} but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations.  A sentence is ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is ''inconsistent''. A sentence φ is said to be ''logically valid'' if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a ''[[logical consequence]]'' of ψ).

=== Logical connectives ===
Some of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are [[logical connective|truth-functional connectives]] that represent truth functions&amp;nbsp;— functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).

The truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be [[logical constant]]s, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.

This is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:
*¬Φ is True [[iff]] Φ is False.
*(Φ ∧ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True and Ψ is True.
*(Φ ∨ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ → Ψ) is True iff ¬Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ ↔ Ψ) is True iff (Φ → Ψ) is True and (Ψ → Φ) is True.

So under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;"
|+ Logical connectives
!  Interpretation !! Φ !! Ψ !! ¬Φ !! (Φ ∧ Ψ) !! (Φ ∨ Ψ) !! (Φ → Ψ) !! (Φ ↔ Ψ)
|-
|#1|| T || T || F || T || T || T || T
|-
|#2|| T || F || F || F || T || F || F
|-
|#3|| F || T || T || F || T || T || F
|-
|#4|| F || F || T || F || F || T || T
|}

Now it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula ''F'': (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of ''F'' is True under that interpretation, ''F'' is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make ''F'' True again, since one of ''F''s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for ''F'' are the only possible logical interpretations, and since ''F'' comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.

== Interpretation of a theory ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

An ''interpretation of a theory'' is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a [[many-to-one]] correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a ''full interpretation'', otherwise it is called a ''partial interpretation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Haskell Curry]] |title=Foundations of Mathematical Logic |publisher=Mcgraw Hill |date=1963}} Here: p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations for propositional logic ==
The formal language for [[propositional logic]] consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives.  The only [[non-logical symbol]]s in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.

The standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the [[truth value]]s true and false. This function is known as a ''truth assignment'' or ''valuation'' function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign [[truthbearer]]s instead.

For a language with ''n'' distinct propositional variables there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable ''a'', for example, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=2 possible interpretations: 1) ''a'' is assigned '''T''', or 2) ''a'' is assigned '''F'''. For the pair ''a'', ''b'' there are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned '''T''', 2) both are assigned '''F''', 3) ''a'' is assigned '''T''' and ''b'' is assigned '''F''', or 4) ''a'' is assigned '''F''' and ''b'' is assigned '''T'''.

Given any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.

== First-order logic ==
Unlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]].  The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol.  In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number [[arity]] is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.

For example, in the language of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)

Again, we might define a first-order language '''L''', as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.

=== Formal languages for first-order logic ===
Given a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols.  The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol "=" for equality (see the section "[[#Interpreting equality|Interpreting equality"]] below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.

=== Interpretations of a first-order language ===
To ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.
* A [[domain of discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called the "universe of disourse"&lt;/ref&gt; ''D'', usually required to be non-empty (see below).
* For every constant symbol, an element of ''D'' as its interpretation.
* For every ''n''-ary function symbol, an ''n''-ary function from ''D'' to ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a function ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'').
* For every ''n''-ary predicate symbol, an ''n''-ary relation on ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a subset of ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'').
An object carrying this information is known as a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ({{not a typo|of}} signature σ), or σ-structure, or ''L''-structure, or as a "model".

The information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its [[free variable]]s, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the [[T-schema]], which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, {{nowrap|φ &amp; ψ}} is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.

This leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} and {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}}. The domain of discourse forms the [[range (mathematics)|range]] for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(''x''), where ''x'' is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is satisfied if there is at least one element ''d'' of the domain such that φ(''d'') is satisfied.

Strictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(''d'') mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because ''d'' is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.

Some authors also admit [[propositional variable]]s in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values ''true'' and ''false.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Because the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property&lt;ref&gt;The extension of a property (also called an attribute) is a set of individuals, so a property is a unary relation. E.g. The properties "yellow" and "prime" are unary relations.&lt;/ref&gt;(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are [[Extensional definition|extensional]]&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Extension (predicate logic)]]&lt;/ref&gt; not [[Intensional definition|intensional]].

=== Example of a first-order interpretation ===
An example of interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of the language '''L''' described above is as follows.
* Domain: A chess set
* Individual constants: a: The white King b: The black Queen c: The white King's pawn
* F(x): x is a piece
* G(x): x is a pawn
* H(x): x is black
* I(x): x is white
* J(x, y): x can capture y

In the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of L:
* the following are true sentences: F(a), G(c), H(b), I(a) J(b, c),
* the following are false sentences: J(a, c), G(a).

=== Non-empty domain requirement === &lt;!--Please preserve this section heading; it is being used in another article --&gt;
As stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as
::&lt;math&gt;(\phi \lor \exists x \psi) \leftrightarrow \exists x (\phi \lor \psi)&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''x'' is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence
:&lt;math&gt;[\forall y (y = y) \lor \exists x ( x = x)] \equiv \exists x [ \forall y ( y = y) \lor x = x]&lt;/math&gt;
fails in any structure with an empty domain.  Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hailperin | first1=Theodore | title=Quantification theory and empty individual-domains |mr=0057820 | year=1953 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=18 | pages=197–200 | doi=10.2307/2267402 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2267402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Quine | first1=W. V. | title=Quantification and the empty domain |mr=0064715 | year=1954 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=19 | pages=177–179 | doi=10.2307/2268615 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2268615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.

=== Interpreting equality ===
The equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.

The first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if ''a'' = ''b'' and ''R''(''a'') holds then ''R''(''b'') holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for [[set theory]] or the signature for [[second-order arithmetic]] in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.

The second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a ''normal model'', so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called ''first order logic with equality'', but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.

There are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an [[equivalence relation]] and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an [[elementary substructure|elementarily equivalent]] interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.

=== Many-sorted first-order logic ===
A generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one ''sort'' of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.

One example of many-sorted logic is for planar [[Euclidean geometry]]. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation ''E'' which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the [[Euclidean plane]], the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation ''E''(''p'',''l'') holds if and only if point ''p'' is on line ''l''.

== Higher-order predicate logics ==
A formal language for [[higher-order logic|higher-order predicate logic]] looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc.  All of these types of variables can be quantified.

There are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. ''Full semantics'' require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. ''Henkin semantics'', which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain ''D'', a collection of subsets of ''D'', a collection of functions from ''D'' to ''D'', etc.  The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.

== Non-classical interpretations ==
The interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of [[non-classical logic]] (such as [[intuitionistic logic]]), and in the study of modal logic.

Interpretations used to study non-classical logic include [[topological model]]s, [[Boolean-valued model]]s, and [[Kripke model]]s.  [[Modal logic]] is also studied using Kripke models.

== Intended interpretations ==
Many formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.

The intended interpretation is called the ''standard model'' (a term introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Anthonie Meijers|title=Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51667-1|series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science|volume=9|author=Roland Müller|chapter=The Notion of a Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Peano arithmetic]], it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are [[isomorphic]] to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the [[Peano axioms]]. There are also [[Peano axioms#Nonstandard models|non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms]], which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.

While the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal [[deductive system|syntactical rules]], it naturally affects the choice of the [[formal grammar|formation]] and [[transformation rules]] of the syntactical system. For example, [[primitive notion|primitive signs]] must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; [[sentential formula]]s are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] [[declarative sentence]]s; [[axiom|primitive sentences]] need to come out as [[Truth|true]] [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in the interpretation; [[rules of inference]] must be such that, if the sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; is directly [[formal proof|derivable]] from a sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i \to \mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a true sentence, with {{imp}} meaning [[material conditional|implication]], as usual. These requirements ensure that all [[formal proof|provable]] sentences also come out to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Carnap]] |title=Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications |publisher=Dover publications| location=New York |date=1958 |isbn=9780486604534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of [[non-standard model]]s is an example). When we speak about 'models' in [[empirical science]]s, we mean, if we want [[reality]] to be a model of our science, to speak about an ''intended model''. A model in the empirical sciences is an ''intended factually-true descriptive interpretation'' (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same [[domain of discourse]] as the intended one, but other [[value assignment|assignments]] for [[non-logical constant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hans Freudenthal |title=The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences (Colloquium proceedings)|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-94-010-3669-6 |date=Jan 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|reason=Every chapter is written by a different author.|date=September 2015}}

=== Example ===

Given a simple formal system (we shall call this one &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols &lt;math&gt;\{ \blacksquare, \bigstar, \blacklozenge \}&lt;/math&gt; and whose formation rule for formulas is:
: 'Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; which is at least 6 symbols long, and which is not infinitely long, is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;. Nothing else is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;.'

The single [[axiom schema]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; is:

: " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ast \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ast&lt;/math&gt; " (where " &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; " is a [[metasyntactic variable]] standing for a finite string of " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; "s )

A formal proof can be constructed as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

In this example the theorem produced " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; " can be interpreted as meaning "One plus three equals four." A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as "Four minus three equals one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Geoffrey Hunter]] |title=Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic| publisher=University of California Press |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

== Other concepts of interpretation ==
There are other uses of the term "interpretation" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.

In model theory, a structure ''A'' is said to interpret a structure ''B'' if there is a definable subset ''D'' of ''A'', and definable relations and functions on ''D'', such that ''B'' is isomorphic to the structure with domain ''D'' and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain ''D'' that is used, but rather ''D'' modulo an equivalence relation definable in ''A''.  For additional information, see [[Interpretation (model theory)]].

A theory ''T'' is said to interpret another theory ''S'' if there is a finite [[extension by definition]]s ''T''′ of ''T'' such that ''S'' is contained in ''T''′.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8966">The '''Levering Act''' was a law enacted by the U.S. state of [[California]] in 1950. It required state employees to subscribe to a [[loyalty oath]] that specifically disavowed radical beliefs. It was aimed in particular at employees of the [[University of California]]. Several teachers lost their positions when they refused to sign loyalty oaths.

Beginning with the onset of the [[Cold War]] in the years following World War II, government officials at all levels of government in the United States feared [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] infiltration that might influence public opinion and frustrate the efforts of the United States to counter Soviet influence. Several laws passed and programs established during the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] administration enhanced the federal government's authority to investigate those suspected of disloyalty and, in particular, to prevent their employment by the federal government. Individual states enacted similar anti-subversion statutes.

In the late 1940s, California state employees were already required to take a general oath indicating support for the Constitutions of California and the U.S., though the requirement did not extend to employees of the quasi-independent University of California. That would require legislation to enhance the state's authority over employees of the state university. Senator [[Jack B. Tenney]], chairman of the legislature's [[Committee on Un-American Activities]], submitted several loyalty oath bills along with a dozen other anti-subversive proposals.&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; In response, [[Robert Gordon Sproul|Robert Sproul]], president of the University of California, decided on his own initiative to forestall legislative action by requiring university employees to take such an oath. It read:&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web | last =Greenberg| first =Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Loyalty Oath at the University of California: A Report on Events, 1949-1958 | work =Free Speech Movement Archive  | publisher =| date =| url =http://www.fsm-a.org/stacks/AP_files/APLoyaltyOath.html | accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fight/&gt;
{{quote|I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of my office according to the best of my ability; that I do not believe in, and I am not a member of, nor do I support any party or organization that believes in, advocates, or teaches the overthrow of the United States Government, by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional means, that I am not a member of the Communist Party or under any oath or a party to any agreement or under any commitment that is in conflict with my obligations under this oath.}}
The California Constitution specified that no oath other than the basic statement of loyalty to the state and federal constitutions could be required of state employees. The Levering Act, named for [[Harold K. Levering]], the Republican legislator who drafted it and managed its passage in the course of 1949-50, was designed to remedy that by classifying public employees as civil defense workers and using that as a rationale for requiring the new oath. The Levering Act required all employees of the state of California to take the new anti-radical loyalty oath.&lt;ref name=Cal&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =1950s: The Teachers Union that Came in From the Cold War | work =  | publisher = California Federation of Teachers | date =| url =http://www.cft.org/index.php/component/content/article/42-uncategorized/426-1950s-the-teachers-union-that-came-in-from-the-cold-war.html | accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; 

The California State Federation of Teachers said in 1950:&lt;ref name=Cal/&gt;
{{quote|The Levering Oath is in contradiction to the Federal Constitution since it imposes on public workers a political test for employment, deprives them of equal protection under the law as guaranteed in the 14th Amendment, and exposes them through its ambiguity to self-incrimination and perjury.}}

Republican Governor [[Earl Warren]] initially opposed the legislation.&lt;ref name=fight&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Sedgwick W.|title=Fight on California Oath Continues|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1950/6/20/fight-on-california-oath-continues-pon/|accessdate=March 31, 2013|newspaper=Harvard Crimson|date=June 20, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University's Regents fired 31 tenured professors who refused to sign the oath on grounds of academic freedom. Warren decided to support the oath during his 1950 campaign for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Cruickshank | first =Robert | title =Loyalty Oaths are SO 1950s | publisher =Calitics | date =February 29, 2008 | url =http://www.calitics.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=5219 | accessdate =March 30, 2013 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130417082742/http://www.calitics.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=5219 | archivedate =April 17, 2013 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 1952, the California Supreme Court reinstated university teachers who had been fired by the university before the Act's passage for refusing to sign the oath required by the University Regents. The court found that the Regents had exceeded their authority in imposing the oath as a condition of employment. The 18 teachers whose dismissals were at issue needed to take the oath required by the Levering Act in order to be reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calif. Courts Junk Teacher Loyalty Oath|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1952/10/18/calif-courts-junk-teacher-loyalty-oath/|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=Harvard Crimson|date=October 18, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was brought by [[Stanley Alexander Weigel|Stanley Weigel]], a Republican, later member of the national committee of the [[ACLU]] and Kennedy appointment to the federal bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang|title=Judge Stanley Weigel, 93, Dies; Acted to Improve Prisons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/04/us/judge-stanley-weigel-93-dies-acted-to-improve-prisons.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1953, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear an appeal by one of the dismissed teachers, Professor Leonard T. Pockman of San Francisco State College. The order the court issue said that the case involved no substantial federal question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Loyalty Ruling Barred|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/05/26/84604807.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 26, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967, the California Supreme Court ruled in a 6-1 decision that the Levering Act was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=California Loyalty Oath Rules Unconstitutional|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/12/22/88498863.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 22, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suits on the part of individuals went on for years. Albert E. Monroe won some of the benefits he lost upon his 1950 dismissal in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professor Ordered Rehired in 1950 Loyalty Oath Case|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/01/02/90707514.pdf|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 2, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such oaths have occasionally been a point of controversy. In 2008, a [[Quaker]] teacher was fired by California State University East Bay because she edited her loyalty oath by writing "non-violently" in front of "support and defend [the U.S. and state Constitutions] against all enemies, foreign and domestic." The office of the California Attorney General said that "as a general matter, oaths may be modified to conform with individual values", suggesting that the teacher's modification was acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Asimov| first =Nanette| title =Quaker teacher fired for changing loyalty oath | work =SFGate| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle| date =February 29, 2008| url =http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Quaker-teacher-fired-for-changing-loyalty-oath-3226110.php| format =| doi =| accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Mark Felt Sr.''' (August 17, 1913&amp;nbsp;– December 18, 2008) was a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) [[special agent]] and [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Associate Director]], the Bureau's second-highest-ranking post, from May 1972 until his retirement from the FBI in June 1973. During his time as Associate Director, Felt served as an anonymous informant, nicknamed '''"[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]"''', to reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]''. He provided them with critical information about the [[Watergate scandal]], which ultimately led to the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1974. 

Though Felt's identity as Deep Throat was strongly suspected by some in [[Washington, D.C.]], including Nixon himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tapes: Nixon suspected Felt |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/06/02/felt.nixon/index.html |publisher=CNN.com |date= June 3, 2005 |authors=Robert Yoon and Stephen Bach}}&lt;/ref&gt; it generally remained a secret for 30 years. In 2005, Felt finally acknowledged that he was Deep Throat, after being persuaded by his daughter to reveal his identity.&lt;ref name="i'm the guy" /&gt;

Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau's headquarters. In 1980, he was convicted of having violated the civil rights of people thought to be associated with members of the [[Weather Underground]], by ordering FBI agents to [[black bag operation|break into their homes]] and search the premises as part of an attempt to prevent bombings. He was ordered to pay a fine, but was [[Pardon#United States|pardoned]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]] during his appeal.

Felt published two memoirs: ''[[The FBI Pyramid]]'' in 1979 (updated in 2006), and ''A G-Man's Life'', written with John O'Connor, in 2006. In 2012, the FBI released Felt's personnel file, covering the period from 1941 to 1978. It also released files pertaining to an extortion threat made against Felt in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/15/politics/watergate-anniversary-felt/index.html |title=40 years later, remembering Watergate scandal's 'Deep Throat' |publisher=CNN |date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born on August 17, 1913, in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]],&lt;ref name="FeltBirth"/&gt; Felt was the son of Rose R. Dygert and Mark Earl Felt, a carpenter and building contractor.&lt;ref name="FeltContractorDad"/&gt; His paternal grandfather was a [[Free Will Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref name=wasgs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/felt.html|title=Ancestry of Mark Felt|website=www.wargs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents were born in [[Canada]] and [[Scotland]]. Through his maternal grandfather, Felt was descended from [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general [[Nicholas Herkimer]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=wasgs/&gt;

After graduating from [[Twin Falls High School]] in 1931, Felt attended the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]].&lt;ref name=gom35sr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1935/45 |publisher=''Gem of the Mountains,'' University of Idaho yearbook |title=Seniors |year=1935 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member and president of the Gamma Gamma chapter of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]].&lt;ref name=gom35btp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1935/267 |publisher=''Gem of the Mountains,'' University of Idaho yearbook |title=Beta Theta Pi |year=1935 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1935.&lt;ref name=gom35sr/&gt;

Felt then went to Washington, D.C., to work in the office of [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] U.S. Senator [[James P. Pope]]. In 1938, Felt married Audrey Robinson of [[Gooding, Idaho]], whom he had known when they were students at the University of Idaho.&lt;ref name=gom37sr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1937/204 |publisher=''Gem of the Mountains,'' University of Idaho yearbook |title=Seniors |year=1937 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had come to Washington to work at the [[Internal Revenue Service|Bureau of Internal Revenue]]. Their wedding was officiated by the chaplain of the [[United States House of Representatives]], the Rev. Sheara Montgomery.&lt;ref name="FeltMarriage" /&gt; Audrey died in 1984; she and Felt had two children, Joan and Mark.

Felt stayed on with Pope's successor in the Senate, [[David Worth Clark]] (D-Idaho).&lt;ref name="SenPopeAndClarke" /&gt; He attended the [[George Washington University Law School]] at night, earning his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] in 1940, and was admitted to the [[District of Columbia Bar]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="TheoharrisGeneralBio" /&gt;

Upon graduation, Felt took a position at the [[Federal Trade Commission]] but did not enjoy his work. His workload was very light, and he was assigned to investigate whether a toilet paper brand, called "Red Cross", was misleading consumers into thinking it was endorsed by the [[American Red Cross]]. Felt wrote in his memoir:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My research, which required days of travel and hundreds of interviews, produced two definite conclusions:

1. Most people ''did'' use toilet tissue.

2. Most people ''did not'' appreciate being asked about it.

That was when I started looking for other employment.&lt;ref name="RedCrossToiletPaper" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He applied for a job with the FBI in November 1941 and was accepted. His first day at the Bureau was January 26, 1942.

==Early FBI years==
FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] often moved Bureau agents around so they would have wide experience in the field. This was typical of other agencies and corporations of the time. Felt observed that Hoover "wanted every agent to get into any field office at any time. Since he [Hoover] had never been transferred and did not have a family, he had no idea of the financial and personal hardship involved."&lt;ref name="HooverNoFamily" /&gt;

After completing 16 weeks of training at the [[FBI Academy]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]], and [[FBI Headquarters]] in Washington, Felt was assigned to [[Texas]], spending three months each in the field offices in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. He returned to FBI Headquarters, where he was assigned to the Espionage Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division, tracking down spies and saboteurs during [[World War II]]. He worked on the Major Case Desk. His most notable work was on the "Peasant" case. Helmut Goldschmidt, operating under the codename "Peasant", was a German agent in custody in England. Under Felt's direction, his German masters were informed that "Peasant" had made his way to the United States, and thus were fed [[military deception|disinformation]] on Allied plans.&lt;ref name="Peasant" /&gt;

The Espionage Section was abolished in May 1945 after [[V-E Day]]. After the war, Felt was assigned to the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] field office. After two years of general work, he spent two years as a firearms instructor and was promoted from agent to supervisor. Upon passage of the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] and the creation of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], the Seattle office became responsible for completing background checks of workers at the [[Hanford Site|Hanford plutonium plant]] near [[Richland, Washington]]. Felt oversaw those investigations.&lt;ref name="Espionage" /&gt; In 1954, Felt returned briefly to Washington as an inspector's aide. Two months later, he was sent to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] as Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge of the field office. When he was transferred to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] fifteen months later, he held the same rank there.&lt;ref name="TransferNewOrleansLosAngeles"/&gt;

==Investigates organized crime==
In 1956, Felt was transferred to [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] and promoted to Special Agent-in-Charge. The Salt Lake City office included [[Nevada]] within its purview, and Felt oversaw some of the Bureau's earliest investigations into [[organized crime]], assessing the mob's operations in the [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] [[casino]]s.&lt;ref name="TransferNewOrleansLosAngeles"/&gt; (It was Hoover's, and therefore the Bureau's, official position at the time that there was no such thing as the Mob.&lt;ref&gt;''J. Edgar Hoover: The Man And The Secrets'', by [[Curt Gentry]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;) In February 1958, Felt was assigned to [[Kansas City, Missouri]] (which he dubbed "the Siberia of field offices" in his memoir),&lt;ref name="TransferNewOrleansLosAngeles"/&gt; where he directed further investigations of organized crime. By this time, Hoover had come to believe in organized crime, in the wake of the famous [[Apalachin, New York]], [[Apalachin Meeting|conclave of underworld bosses]] in November 1957.&lt;ref name="MobKansas" /&gt;

==Middle career==
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the [[FBI]], photographed in 1961. Hoover appointed Felt the third-ranking official in the Bureau in 1971.]]
Felt returned to Washington, D.C., in September 1962. As assistant to the bureau's assistant director in charge of the Training Division, Felt helped oversee the FBI Academy.&lt;ref name="FeltReturnToDC" /&gt; In November 1964, he was promoted to an Assistant Director of the Bureau, as Chief Inspector of the Bureau and Head of the Inspection Division.&lt;ref name="FeltToInspectionDivision" /&gt; This division oversaw compliance with Bureau regulations and conducted internal investigations.

On July 1, 1971, Felt was promoted by Hoover to Deputy Associate Director, assisting Associate Director [[Clyde Tolson]].&lt;ref name="FeltMadeAsstDirector" /&gt; Hoover's right-hand man for decades, Tolson was in failing health and unable to carry out his duties. Richard Gid Powers wrote that Hoover installed Felt to rein in [[William C. Sullivan]]'s domestic spying operations, as Sullivan had been engaged in secret unofficial work for the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Broken: The Troubled Past and Uncertain Future of the FBI|first=Richard Gid|last=Powers|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2004|ISBN=9780684833712|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Felt quoted Hoover as having said, "I need someone who can control Sullivan. I think you know he has been getting out of hand."&lt;ref name="FeltMemoirControlSullivan" /&gt; In his book, ''The Bureau'', Ronald Kessler said that Felt "managed to please Hoover by being tactful with him and tough on agents."&lt;ref name="KesslerOnFeltTactfulness" /&gt; [[Curt Gentry]] described Felt as "the director's latest fair-haired boy", who had "no inherent power" in his new post, the real number three being [[John P. Mohr]].&lt;ref name="GentryOnFelt" /&gt;

===Weather Underground investigations===
Among the criminal groups that the FBI investigated in the early 1970s was the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. Their case was dismissed by the court because it concluded that the FBI had conducted illegal activities, including unauthorized [[wiretap]]s, break-ins, and mail interceptions. The lead federal prosecutor on the case, William C. Ibershof, claims that Mark Felt and Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] initiated these illegal activities that tainted the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The New York Times| date=October 9, 2008| author=William C. Ibershof| title=Letter to the Editor: Prosecuting Weathermen| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/opinion/l10ayers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Hoover's death==
[[File:Patrickgrey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[L. Patrick Gray]], acting director of the FBI from May 1972 to April 1973]]
Hoover died in his sleep and was found on the morning of May 2, 1972. Tolson was nominally in charge until the next day, when Nixon appointed [[L. Patrick Gray|L. Patrick Gray III]] as Acting FBI Director. Tolson submitted his resignation, which Gray accepted. Felt succeeded to Tolson's post as Associate Director, the number-two job in the Bureau.&lt;ref name="TolsonResignation" /&gt; Felt served as an honorary pallbearer at Hoover's funeral.&lt;ref name="HooverPallbearer" /&gt;
On the day of Hoover's death, Hoover's secretary for five decades, [[Helen Gandy]], began destroying his files. She turned over twelve boxes of the "Official/Confidential" files to Felt on May 4, 1972. This consisted of 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information about individuals whom Hoover had investigated. He used his information as power over them. Felt stored the files in his office.

The existence of such files had long been rumored. Gray told the press that afternoon that "there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity."&lt;ref name="GandyHooversFiles" /&gt; Felt earlier that day had told Gray, "Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn't have any secret files", and later accompanied Gray to Hoover's office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray "looked casually at an open file drawer and approved her work", though Gray would later deny he looked at anything. Gandy retained Hoover's "Personal File" and destroyed it.&lt;ref name="GandyHooversFiles" /&gt;

When Felt was called to testify in 1975 by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] about the destruction of Hoover's papers, he said, "There's no serious problems if we lose some papers. I don't see anything wrong and I still don't."&lt;ref name="FeltBeforeUSHouseOfRepsOnFileDest" /&gt; At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval. In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission. Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter were included in the committee's final report.&lt;ref name="FeltBeforeUSHouseOfRepsOnFileDest" /&gt;

In his memoir, Felt expressed mixed feelings about Gray. He was the first person appointed as head of the FBI who had no experience in the agency, but he had experience in the Navy. While noting Gray did work hard, Felt was critical of how often he was away from FBI headquarters. Gray lived in [[Stonington, Connecticut]], and commuted to Washington. He also visited all of the Bureau's field offices except Honolulu. His frequent absences led to the nickname "Three-Day Gray".&lt;ref name="ThreeDayGrayNickname" /&gt; These absences, combined with Gray's hospitalization and recuperation from November 20, 1972, to January 2, 1973,&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt; meant that Felt was effectively in charge for much of his final year at the Bureau. Bob Woodward wrote "Gray got to be director of the FBI and Felt did the work."&lt;ref name="WoodwardonGray" /&gt; Felt wrote in his memoir:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The record amply demonstrates that President Nixon made Pat Gray the Acting Director of the FBI because he wanted a politician in J. Edgar Hoover's position who would convert the Bureau into an adjunct of the White House machine.&lt;ref name="FeltMemoirOnGray" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gray's defenders would later argue that Gray had practiced a management style that was different from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director; some believed that Gray's visits helped raise the morale of the field agents. Gray's leadership style seemed to continue what he had learned in the [[US Navy]], in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction from the work of the FBI and showed a lack of leadership. He believed that he was not the only career manager at the FBI who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.&lt;ref name="FeltMemoirOnGray" /&gt;

==Watergate==
{{watergate|Intelligence}}{{See also|Watergate scandal}}[[File:Watergate complex.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Watergate complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Felt saw all the FBI's files on its investigation of the break-in there in 1972.]]

As Associate Director, Felt saw everything compiled on [[Watergate]] before it was given to Gray. The Agent in Charge, [[Charles Nuzum]], sent his findings to Investigative Division Head [[Robert Gebhardt (FBI agent)|Robert Gebhardt]], who passed the information on to Felt. From the day of the break-in, June 17, 1972, until the FBI investigation was mostly completed in June 1973, Felt was the key control point for FBI information. He had been among the first to learn of the investigation, being informed the morning of June 17.&lt;ref name="FeltLearnsAboutWatergate" /&gt; [[Ronald Kessler]], who spoke to former Bureau agents, reported that throughout the investigation, they "were amazed to see material in Woodward and Bernstein's stories lifted almost verbatim from their reports of interviews a few days or weeks earlier".&lt;ref name="KesslerAmazed" /&gt;

=== "Deep Throat" informant ===
{{Main|Deep Throat (Watergate)}}

[[Bob Woodward]] first describes his source, nicknamed "Deep Throat", in ''[[All the President's Men]]'', as a "source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP (the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]], Nixon's 1972 campaign organization), as well as at the White House."&lt;ref name="BernsteinSourceInExecutive" /&gt; In the book,  Deep Throat is described as an "incurable gossip" who was "in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch", a man "whose fight had been worn out in too many battles".&lt;ref name="BernsteinOnFelt" /&gt; Woodward had known the source before Watergate and had discussed politics and government with him.

In 2005, Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970. Woodward was working as an aide to Admiral [[Thomas Hinman Moorer]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and was delivering papers to the White House Situation Room. In his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward described Felt as a "tall man with perfectly combed gray hair&amp;nbsp;... distinguished looking" with a "studied air of confidence, even what might be called a command presence".&lt;ref name="HowWoodwardMetFelt" /&gt; They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times. When Woodward started working at the ''Washington Post'', he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the paper. Felt's information, taken on a promise that Woodward would never reveal its origin, was a source for a few stories, notably for an article on May 18, 1972, about [[Arthur Bremer]], who shot [[George C. Wallace|George Wallace]].

When the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on Felt. The senior manager advised Woodward on June 19 that [[E. Howard Hunt]], who had ties to Nixon, was involved; the telephone number of his White House office had been listed in the address book of one of the burglars. Initially, Woodward's source was known at the ''Post'' as "My Friend". ''Post'' editor [[Howard Simons]] tagged him as "Deep Throat", after the widely known porno film [[Deep Throat (film)|''Deep Throat'']]. According to Woodward, Simons thought of the term because Felt had been providing information on a [[deep background]] basis.

When Felt revealed his role in 2005, it was noted that "My Friend" has the same initial letters as "Mark Felt". Woodward's notes from interviewing Felt were marked "M.F.", which Woodward says was "not very good tradecraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8486700/ns/dateline_nbc-the_secret_man/t/story-behind-deep-throat/|title=The Story behind 'Deep Throat'|first=Tom|last=Brokaw|date=July 6, 2005|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code for contacting Woodward===
Woodward explained that when he wanted to meet Deep Throat, he would move a flowerpot with a red flag on his apartment balcony; he lived at number 617, Webster House, 1718 P Street, Northwest. On occasions when Deep Throat wanted a meeting, he would circle the page number on page twenty of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]'' (delivered to his building) and draw clock hands to signal the hour.&lt;ref name="DeepThroatSignal" /&gt; [[Adrian Havill]] questioned these claims in his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein. He said Woodward's balcony faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Woodward said that the courtyard had been bricked in since he lived there. Havill also said ''The Times'' was not delivered in copies marked by apartment, but Woodward and a former neighbor disputed this claim.&lt;ref name="HavillOnSignalStory" /&gt;

Woodward said:
{{quote|How [Felt] could have made a daily observation of my balcony is still a mystery to me. At the time, the back of my building was not enclosed so anyone could have driven in the back alley to observe my balcony. In addition, my balcony and the back of the apartment complex faced onto a courtyard or back area that was shared with a number of other apartment or office buildings in the area. My balcony could have been seen from dozens of apartments or offices.

There were several embassies in the area. The Iraqi embassy was down the street, and I thought it possible that the FBI had surveillance or listening posts nearby. Could Felt have had the counterintelligence agents regularly report on the status of my flag and flowerpot? That seems unlikely, but not impossible.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSurveillanceSpeculation" /&gt;}}

===Haldeman informs Nixon about Felt's leaks===
Days after the break-in, Nixon and [[White House chief of staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]] talked about putting pressure on the FBI to slow down the investigation. The District of Columbia police had called in the FBI because they found the burglars had [[wiretapping]] equipment. Wiretapping is a crime investigated by the FBI. Haldeman told President Nixon on June 23, 1972, that Felt would "want to cooperate because he's ambitious."&lt;ref name="HadlemanOnFeltCooperation" /&gt; These tapes were not declassified and revealed for some time.

Haldeman later initially suspected lower-level FBI agents, including [[Angelo Lano]], of speaking to the ''Post''.&lt;ref name="the two lives"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 25, 2007

| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/19/AR2005061900699_pf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in a taped conversation on October 19, 1972, Haldeman told the president that sources had said that Felt was speaking to the press.

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can't say anything about this because it will screw up our source and there's a real concern. [[John N. Mitchell|Mitchell]] is the only one who knows about this and he feels strongly that we better not do anything because&amp;nbsp;... if we move on him, he'll go out and unload everything. He knows everything that's to be known in the FBI. He has access to absolutely everything.&lt;ref name="HaldemanOnFeltUnloading" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haldeman also said that he had spoken to White House counsel [[John W. Dean]] about punishing Felt, but Dean said Felt had committed no crime and could not be prosecuted.

When Acting FBI Director Gray returned from his sick leave in January 1973, he confronted Felt about being the source for Woodward and Bernstein. Gray said he had defended Felt to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Richard G. Kleindienst]]: "You know, Mark, Dick Kleindienst told me I ought to get rid of you. He says White House staff members are concerned that you are the FBI source of leaks to Woodward and Bernstein".&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt; Felt replied, "Pat, I haven't leaked anything to anybody."&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt; Gray told Felt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told Kleindienst that you've worked with me in a very competent manner and I'm convinced that you are completely loyal. I told him I was not going to move you out. Kleindienst told me, "Pat, I love you for that."&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nixon passes over Felt again===
[[File:Nixon-depart.png|thumb|left|President [[Richard Nixon]] departing the [[White House]] on August 9, 1974, shortly before his resignation took effect. Felt's leaks to Woodward spurred the investigations that led to his resignation.]]

On February 17, 1973, Nixon nominated Gray as Hoover's permanent replacement as Director.&lt;ref name="GrayNominated" /&gt; Until then, Gray had been in limbo as Acting Director. In another taped conversation on February 28, Nixon spoke to Dean about Felt's acting as an informant, and mentioned that he had never met him. Gray was forced to resign on April 27, after it was revealed that he had destroyed a file that had been in the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt.&lt;ref name="GrayResigns" /&gt; Gray recommended Felt as his successor.

The day Gray resigned, Kleindienst spoke to Nixon, urging him to appoint Felt as head of the FBI. Nixon instead appointed [[William Ruckelshaus]] as Acting Director. Stanley Kutler reported that Nixon said, "I don't want him. I can't have him. I just talked to Bill Ruckelshaus and Bill is a Mr. Clean and I want a fellow in there that is not part of the old guard and that is not part of that infighting in there."&lt;ref name="MrClean" /&gt; On another White House tape, from May 11, 1973, Nixon and White House Chief of Staff, [[Alexander M. Haig]], spoke of Felt leaking material to ''The New York Times''. Nixon said, "he's a bad guy, you see." He said that William Sullivan had told him of Felt's ambition to be Director of the Bureau.&lt;ref name="FeltNixonsBadGuy" /&gt;

==Clashes with William Ruckelshaus and resignation==
Felt called his relationship with Ruckelshaus "stormy."&lt;ref name="FeltOnRuckelshausRelStormy" /&gt; In his memoir, Felt describes Ruckelshaus as a "security guard sent to see that the FBI did nothing which would displease Mr. Nixon."&lt;ref name="FeltOnRuckelshausAsSecurityGuard" /&gt;

In mid-1973, ''The New York Times'' published a series of articles about wiretaps that had been ordered by J. Edgar Hoover during his tenure at the FBI. Ruckelshaus believed that the information must have come from someone at the FBI.

In June 1973, Ruckelshaus received a call from someone claiming to be a ''New York Times'' reporter, telling him that Felt was the source of this information.&lt;ref name="princeton alumni news"&gt;{{cite web |title=Q&amp;A: William Ruckelshaus '55 on the Watergate Scandal |url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/qa-william-ruckelshaus-55-watergate-scandal |publisher=''Princeton Alumni Weekly'' |first=Bernstein |last=Mark F. |date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, Ruckelshaus met privately with Felt and accused him of leaking information to ''The New York Times'', a charge that Felt adamantly denied.&lt;ref name="the two lives" /&gt; Ruckelshaus told Felt to "sleep on it" and let him know the next day what he wanted to do. Felt resigned from the Bureau the next day, June 22, 1973, ending his thirty-one year career.

In a 2013 interview, Ruckelshaus noted the possibility that the original caller was a hoax. He said that he considered Felt's resignation "an admission of guilt" anyway.&lt;ref name="princeton alumni news" /&gt;

Ruckelshaus, who had served only as Acting Director, was replaced several weeks later by [[Clarence M. Kelley]], who had been nominated by Nixon as FBI Director and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

==Trial and conviction==
In the early 1970s, Felt had supervised Operation [[COINTELPRO]], initiated by Hoover in the 1950s. This period of FBI history has generated great controversy for its abuses of private citizens' rights. The FBI was spying on, infiltrating, and disrupting the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Anti-War Movement]], [[Black Panthers]], and other [[New Left]] groups. By 1972 Felt was heading the investigation into the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]], which had planted bombs at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], [[the Pentagon]], and the [[Harry S Truman Building|State Department building]]. Felt, along with [[Edward S. Miller]], authorized FBI agents to break into homes secretly in 1972 and 1973, without a [[search warrant]], on nine separate occasions. These kinds of FBI operations were known as "[[black bag jobs]]." The break-ins occurred at five addresses in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], at the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weather Underground members. They did not contribute to the capture of any fugitives. The use of "black bag jobs" by the FBI was declared unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the ''[[Lawrence (Pun) Plamondon|Plamondon]]'' case, 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

The [[Church Committee]] of Congress revealed the FBI's illegal activities, and many agents were investigated. In 1976, Felt publicly stated he had ordered break-ins, and recommended against punishment of individual agents who had carried out orders. Felt also stated that Patrick Gray had also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program ''[[Face the Nation]]'' he would probably be a "scapegoat" for the Bureau's work.&lt;ref name="Scapegoat" /&gt; "I think this is justified and I'd do it again tomorrow," he said on the program. While admitting the break-ins were "extralegal", he justified them as protecting the "greater good." Felt said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Griffin B. Bell]], the Attorney General in the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration, directed investigation of these cases. On April 10, 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, Miller, and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants.

The indictment charged violations of Title 18, Section 241 of the [[United States Code]] and stated Felt and the others:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman fugitives, in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.&lt;ref name="FeltIndictmentText" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Felt told his biographer Ronald Kessler: I was shocked that I was indicted. You would be too, if you did what you thought was in the best interests of the country and someone on technical grounds indicted you.&lt;ref name="FeltIndictmentShock"/&gt;

Felt, Gray, and Miller were arraigned in Washington, DC on April 20. Seven hundred current and former FBI agents were outside the courthouse applauding the "Washington Three", as Felt referred to himself and his colleagues in his memoir.&lt;ref name="ArraignmentFBIAgentApplause" /&gt; Gray's case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence, on December 11, 1980.

Felt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government, willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants—a violation of {{usc|18|2236}}. The government rejected the offer in 1979. After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] on September 18, 1980.&lt;ref name="EightPostponements"/&gt; On October 29, former President [[Richard M. Nixon]] appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense. He testified that in authorizing the Bureau to conduct break-ins to gather foreign intelligence information "he was acting on precedents established by a number of Presidential directives dating to 1939." It was Nixon's first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt's defense fund, since Felt's legal expenses were running over $600,000 by then. Also testifying were former Attorneys General Mitchell, Kleindienst, [[Herbert Brownell Jr.]], [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], and [[Ramsey Clark]], all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and understood not to be illegal. Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial. (The Bureau used a national security justification for the searches because it alleged the Weather Underground was in the employ of [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="NixonTestimony"/&gt;)

The jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6, 1980. Although the charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Felt was fined $5,000 and Miller was fined $3,500.&lt;ref name="FeltIndictmentShock"/&gt; Writing an OpEd piece in ''The New York Times'' a week after the conviction, attorney [[Roy Cohn]] claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the [[Carter administration]] and it was an unfair prosecution. Cohn wrote the break-ins were the "final dirty trick" of the Nixon administration, and there had been no "personal motive" to their actions.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' praised the convictions, saying "the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution."&lt;ref name="NYTEditorialOnConvictions"/&gt;

Felt and Miller appealed their verdicts.&lt;ref name="PardonReaction"/&gt;

==Pardon==
[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|right|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and Miller.]]In a phone call on January 30, 1981, [[Edwin Meese]] encouraged President [[Ronald Reagan]] to issue a pardon. After further encouragement from Felt's former colleagues, President Reagan pardoned Felt and Miller. The pardon was signed on March 26, but was not announced to the public until April 15, 1981.

In the pardon, Reagan wrote:

{{quote|During their long careers, Mark Felt and Edward Miller served the Federal Bureau of Investigation and our nation with great distinction. To punish them further—after 3 years of criminal prosecution proceedings—would not serve the ends of justice.

Their convictions in the U.S. District Court, on appeal at the time I signed the pardons, grew out of their good-faith belief that their actions were necessary to preserve the security interests of our country. The record demonstrates that they acted not with criminal intent, but in the belief that they had grants of authority reaching to the highest levels of government.&lt;ref name="ReaganStatement" /&gt;}}

Nixon sent Felt and Miller bottles of [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] with the note "Justice ultimately prevails."&lt;ref name="NixonChampagneCongrats" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' disapproved in an editorial, saying that the United States "deserved better than a gratuitous revision of the record by the President."&lt;ref name="NYTDisapprovesPardon" /&gt; Felt and Miller said they would seek repayment of their legal fees from the government.

The prosecutor at the trial, [[John W. Nields Jr.]], said, "I would warrant that whoever is responsible for the pardons did not read the record of the trial and did not know the facts of the case." Nields also complained that the White House did not consult with the prosecutors in the case, which was contrary to the usual practice when a pardon was under consideration.&lt;ref name="PardonReaction" /&gt;

Felt said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel very excited and just so pleased that I can hardly contain myself. I am most grateful to the President. I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to thank him. It's just like having a heavy burden lifted off your back. This case has been dragging on for five years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a press conference the day of the announcement, Miller said, "I certainly owe the Gipper one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|work=Time|title=Watergate Ghosts Rise Again|volume=117|issue=2|year=1981|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter Attorney General [[Griffin Bell]] said he did not object to the pardons, as the convictions had upheld constitutional principles.

Despite their pardons, Felt and Miller won permission from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] to appeal their convictions so as to remove it from their record and to prevent it from being used in civil suits by victims of the break-ins they had ordered.&lt;ref name="FeltMillerAppeal" /&gt; Ultimately, the court restored Felt's law license in 1982, based on Reagan's pardon. In June 1982, Felt and Miller testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee's security and terrorism subcommittee. They said that the restrictions placed on the FBI by Attorney General [[Edward H. Levi]] were threatening the country's safety.&lt;ref name="FeltMillerDenouncePrivacyAndFOIAActcs" /&gt;

==Family life==
His daughter Joan graduated from high school in Kansas City during his assignment there and attended the [[University of Kansas]] for two years before transferring to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in California to study drama.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/FAMILY-MAN-For-former-G-man-Mark-Felt-life-is-2518170.php |title=Family Man |last=Ryan |first=Joan |date=May 28, 2006 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |access-date=May 28, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was an undergraduate, Felt finally settled in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], when he took his post at the FBI Academy.&lt;ref name="Deep Throat's Daughter"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/11/AR2005061100724.html |title=Deep Throat's Daughter, The Kindred Free Spirit |last=Duke |first=Lynne |date=June 12, 2005 |work=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=May 28, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Watergate scandal, Felt had become estranged from Joan. They had been close during her childhood, but after she graduated from Stanford, she had gone to Chile under a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholarship]] to continue her studies. While there, she became friends with [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Andrés Pascal Allende]], nephew of future president [[Salvador Allende]]. When she returned home, her political views had shifted to the extreme left, putting her in conflict with her conservative father.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

She earned her [[master's degree]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at Stanford,&lt;ref name="Deep Throat's Daughter"/&gt; and then joined a [[hippie]] community in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Felt and his wife went to visit her once and were appalled at her [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] lifestyle and use of drugs; he was reminded of members of the militant Weather Underground that the FBI had been prosecuting. Joan's friends were equally shocked that her father was an FBI agent. Following their visit, Joan cut off most contact with her parents. As a result, and combined with the fact that she did not follow the news, she was unaware of her father's legal problems that arose from the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

Over the years, the stress of following her husband's career as well as from the separation from her daughter, combined with Felt's prosecution had taken their toll on Audrey. During Felt's time in Seattle in 1954, Audrey suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. She developed a dependency on alcohol and had been taking [[antidepressant]]s for years. She had also been hospitalized several times for various ailments. When Felt was put on trial in 1980, she attended the first day, but did not return because she was unable to bear it. In 1984, she committed suicide using Felt's [[revolver]].&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt; Felt and his son Mark Jr., an officer in the [[United States Air Force]], decided to keep this a secret and told Joan that her mother had died of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/21/AR2006042101858.html |title=Deep Throat's Other Secret |last=Duke |first=Lynne |date=April 22, 2006 |work=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=May 28, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan did not learn the truth about her mother until 2001.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Joan had become an adherent of [[Adi Da]], who had founded a [[new religious movement]] in San Francisco called Adidam, and she was living in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]]. She had borne three sons{{spaced ndash}}Ludi (later Will), Rob, and Nick, the latter two from another Adidam devotee whom she never married{{spaced ndash}}but her parents had only met Ludi during their visit in 1974. After Audrey's death, Felt began making yearly visits to see Joan and his grandsons, and they also came to visit him and his new girlfriend, who lived in the same apartment complex.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

In 1990, Felt permanently moved to Santa Rosa, leaving behind his entire life in Alexandria. He bought a house where he lived with Joan, and took care of the boys while she worked, teaching at [[Sonoma State University]] and [[Santa Rosa Junior College]].&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt; He suffered a stroke before 1999, as reported by Kessler in his book ''The Bureau.'' According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home and took Felt to lunch.&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2016|ISBN=9781250111265|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. "Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area," Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. "He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine."&lt;ref name="Kessler"/&gt;

==Memoir==
Felt published his memoir ''[[The FBI Pyramid|The FBI Pyramid: From the Inside]]'' in 1979. It was co-written with Hoover biographer [[Ralph de Toledano]], though the latter's name appears only in the copyright notice. Toledano in 2005 wrote that the volume was "largely written by me since his original manuscript read like ''[[The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table]]''." Toledano said: Felt swore to me that he was not Deep Throat, and that he had never leaked information to the Woodward-Bernstein team or anyone else. The book was published and bombed.&lt;ref name="Toledano" /&gt;

In his memoir, Felt strongly defended Hoover and his tenure as Director; he condemned the criticisms of the Bureau made in the 1970s by the [[Church Committee]] and civil libertarians. He also denounced the treatment of Bureau agents as criminals and said the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and [[Privacy Act of 1974]] served only to interfere with government work and helped criminals. (He opens the book with the sentence, "[[The Bill of Rights is not a suicide pact]]", Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]]'s comment in his dissent to ''[[Terminiello v. City of Chicago]]'', 337 U.S. 1 (1949)).&lt;ref name="FeltContractorDad"/&gt;

''[[Library Journal]]'' wrote in its review that "at one time Felt was assumed to be Watergate's 'Deep Throat'; in this interesting but hardly sensational memoir, he makes it clear that that honor, if honor it be, lies elsewhere."&lt;ref name="LibraryJournalReview" /&gt;  ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' was highly critical of the book, saying Felt "seeks to perpetuate a view of Hoover and the FBI that is no longer seriously peddled even on the backs of cereal boxes". It said the book contained "a disturbing number of factual errors".&lt;ref name="NYTBR" /&gt; [[Curt Gentry]] said that Felt was "the keeper of the Hoover flame."&lt;ref name="KeeperHooverFlame" /&gt;

Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent "credence" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat in 2005. "There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt&amp;nbsp;... On May 3, 2002, PAGE SIX reported that Ronald Kessler, author of ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt."&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep Throat speculation==
{{For|a detailed overview of speculation prior to May 31, 2005|Deep Throat (Watergate)}}
The identity of Deep Throat was debated for more than three decades, and Felt was frequently mentioned as a possibility. An October 1990 ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine article about "Washington secrets" listed the 15 most prominent Deep Throat candidates, including Felt.

Jack Limpert published evidence as early as 1974 that Felt was the informant.&lt;ref name="Limpert" /&gt; On June 25 of that year, a few weeks after ''All the President's Men'' was published, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' ran an editorial, "If You Drink Scotch, Smoke, Read, Maybe You're Deep Throat." It began "W. Mark Felt says he isn't now, nor has he ever been Deep Throat." The ''Journal'' quoted Felt saying the character was a "composite" and "I'm just not that kind of person."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; In 1975, [[George V. Higgins]] wrote: "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[grand jury]] investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify. The prosecutor, [[John Stanley Pottinger|J. Stanley Pottinger]], [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights]], discovered that Felt was "Deep Throat", but the secrecy of the proceedings protected the information from being public.&lt;ref name="GrandJury" /&gt;

In 1992, James Mann, who had been a reporter at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1972 and worked with Woodward, wrote a piece for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', saying the source had to have been within the FBI. He noted Felt as a possibility, but said he could not confirm this.&lt;ref name="MannAtlanticMonthly" /&gt;

[[Alexander P. Butterfield]], the White House aide best known for revealing Nixon's taping system, told the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' in 1995, "I think it was a guy named Mark Felt."&lt;ref name="Butterfield" /&gt; In July 1999, Felt was identified as Deep Throat by the ''Hartford Courant'', citing Chase Culeman-Beckman, a nineteen-year-old from [[Port Chester, New York]]. Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Nora Ephron]], had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father. Felt said to the ''Courant'', "No, it's not me. I would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?" Bernstein said his son didn't know. "Bob and I have been wise enough never to tell our wives, and we've certainly never told our children."&lt;ref name="Campmate" /&gt; (Bernstein reiterated on June 2, 2005, on the ''Today Show'' that his wife had never known.)

[[Leonard Garment]], President Nixon's former law partner who became White House counsel after John W. Dean's resignation, ruled Felt out as Deep Throat in his 2000 book ''In Search of Deep Throat''. Garment wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Felt theory was a strong one&amp;nbsp;... Felt had a personal motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover&amp;nbsp;... Felt thought he was a leading candidate to succeed Hoover&amp;nbsp;... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in ''All the President's Men'' simply did not sound to me like a career FBI man.&lt;ref name="GarmentFeltTheoryStrong"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Garment said the information leaked to Woodward was inside White House information to which Felt would not have had access. "Felt did not fit."&lt;ref name="GarmentNotFelt"/&gt; (Once the secret was revealed, it was noted Felt did have access to such information because the Bureau's agents were interviewing high-ranking White House officials.)

In 2002, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' profiled Felt. Noting his denial in ''The FBI Pyramid'', the paper wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Curiously, his son—American Airlines pilot Mark Felt—now says that shouldn't be read as a definitive denial, and that he plans to answer the question once-and-for-all in a second memoir. The excerpt of the working draft obtained by the ''Chronicle'' has Felt still denying he's Throat but providing a rationale for why Throat did the right thing.&lt;ref name="SFChronicleFeltsSon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2005, reports surfaced that Woodward had prepared Deep Throat's [[obituary]] because he was near death. Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] was battling cancer at the time (he would die in September 2005), and there was speculation that Rehnquist might have been Deep Throat. Rehnquist was [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], from 1969 to 1971,&lt;ref name="cornell-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/rehnquist.bio.html |title=LII: US Supreme Court: Justice Rehnquist |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then served on the Supreme Court until his death in 2005.

==Deep Throat revealed==
''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine revealed that Felt was Deep Throat on May 31, 2005, when it published an article (eventually appearing in the July issue of the magazine) on its website by [[John D. O'Connor]], an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt said, "I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat." After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the editor of the ''Washington Post'' during Watergate, confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat. According to the ''Vanity Fair'' article, Felt was persuaded to come out by his family. They hoped to capitalize on the book deals and other lucrative opportunities which Felt would be offered in order to help pay for his grandchildren's education.&lt;ref name="i'm the guy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507 |title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat |work=Vanity Fair |date=July 2005 |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was unaware that he was Deep Throat for many years. They realized the truth after his retirement, when they became aware of his close friendship with Bob Woodward.

Nixon's Chief Counsel [[Charles Colson]], who served [[prison]] time for his actions in the Nixon White House, said Felt had violated "his oath to keep this nation's secrets".&lt;ref name="CharlesColston"/&gt; A ''Los Angeles Times'' editorial argued that this argument was specious, "as if there's no difference between nuclear strategy and rounding up [[hush money]] to silence your hired burglars."&lt;ref name="LATimesEditorial"/&gt; [[Ralph de Toledano]], who co-wrote Felt's 1979 memoir, said Mark Felt Jr. had approached him in 2004 to buy Toledano's half of the copyright. Toledano agreed to sell but was never paid. He attempted to rescind the deal, threatening legal action. A few days before the ''Vanity Fair'' article was released, Toledano finally received a check.

He later said: "I had been gloriously and illegally deceived, and Deep Throat was, in characteristic style, back in business—which given his history of betrayal, was par for the course."&lt;ref name="Toledano"/&gt;

After the revelation, publishers were interested in signing Felt to a book deal. Weeks later, PublicAffairs Books announced that it signed a deal with Felt. Its [[CEO]] was a ''Washington Post'' reporter and editor during the Watergate era. The new book was to include material from Felt's 1979 [[memoir]], plus an update. The new volume was scheduled for publication in early 2006. Felt sold the movie rights to his story to [[Universal Pictures]] for development by [[Tom Hanks]]'s production company, [[Playtone]]. The book and movie deals were valued at US $1 million.&lt;ref name="DealWithHanks"/&gt;  A film based on those rights, ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'', in which Felt is portrayed by [[Liam Neeson]], was released in 2017.

In mid-2005, Woodward published an account of his contacts with Felt, ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}).

==Appraisal of Watergate role==
Public response to Felt and his actions has varied widely since these revelations. In the immediate aftermath, Felt's family called him an "American hero", suggesting that he leaked information for moral or patriotic reasons. [[G. Gordon Liddy]], who was convicted of burglary in the Watergate scandal, said Felt should have gone to the grand jury rather than leak.&lt;ref name="GGordonLiddy"/&gt;

Speculation about Felt's motives for leaking has varied widely. Some suggested that it was revenge for Nixon's choosing Gray over Felt to replace Hoover as FBI Director. Others suggest Felt acted out of institutional loyalty to the FBI.

Political scientist [[George Friedman]] argued: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Washington Post'' created a morality play about an out-of-control government brought to heel by two young, enterprising journalists and a courageous newspaper. That simply wasn't what happened. Instead, it was about the FBI using ''The Washington Post'' to leak information to destroy the president, and ''The Washington Post'' willingly serving as the conduit for that information while withholding an essential dimension of the story by concealing Deep Throat's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/the_deeper_truth_about_deep_throat/ |title=The deeper truth about Deep Throat |publisher=MercatorNet |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 2012 book ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', [[Max Holland]] argued that Felt leaked the information in an attempt to become head of the FBI. Holland said that Felt wanted to create the perception that Gray "could not control the FBI". This could result in Nixon's firing Gray, leaving Felt as the obvious choice to run the agency. Holland said this plan (if it was one) backfired as Nixon and his team found out that Felt was the leaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What made Deep Throat leak? |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2012/02/21/what-made-deep-throat-leak/ |first=Jack |last=Shafer |publisher=Reuters Blogs |date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Felt died at home, in his sleep, on December 18, 2008.&lt;ref name="wp12182008"&gt;{{cite news|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/19/AR2008121900056.html|title=Lawman's Unwavering Compass Led Him to White House Showdown|author=Sullivan, Patricia|date=December 20, 2008|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 95 years old and his death was attributed to [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-felt19-2008dec19-story.html|author=Neuman, Johanna |title=W.

'''Medusa complex''' is a psychological [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] revolving around the petrification or freezing of human emotion, and drawing on the classical myth of the [[Medusa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Concise-Corsini-Encyclopedia-Psychology-Behavioral/dp/0471220361/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529846981&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780471220367|title=The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|date=2004-04-19|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471220367|editor-last=Craighead|editor-first=W. Edward|edition= 3rd|location=New York Chichester|language=English|editor-last2=Nemeroff|editor-first2=Charles B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term Medusa Complex was coined in 1948 by [[Gaston Bachelard]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Gleyzon, ''Shakespeare's Spiral'' (2010) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; to cover the feeling of petrification induced by the threat of the parental [[gaze]].&lt;ref&gt;J-P Sartre, ''Saint Genet'' (2012) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; A mute, paralysed fury responds to the danger of the obliteration of an individual consciousness by an external Other (and perhaps by the corresponding internalised desire to obliterate the subjectivity of others in turn).&lt;ref&gt;A. Passo, ''Novel Configurations'' (1994) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
Later writers have developed Bachelard's idea in various ways.
* [[Attachment theory]] uses the Medusa Complex to refer to a self-destructive early state of inwardly directed aggression produced by a disruption of the mother/child mutual gaze.&lt;ref&gt;W. Craighead ed. ''The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioural Science'' (2014) p. 1044&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marion Woodman]] saw the Medusa Complex as a dissociated state produced by paralysis of the [[fight-or-flight response]] in a state of petrified fear.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bennett ed., ''Montreal 2010'' (2012) p. 1593&lt;/ref&gt;  She also saw it as the possible by-product of a conflict between an idealised, [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfect]] state and the actual reality of one's feelings and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://truebeautyalways.com/2013/03/03/waltzing-with-medusa/ Waltzing with Medusa]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marjorie Garber]] saw the Medusa Complex pervading [[Macbeth]] in the form of [[Medusa's Head|gender trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamas, ''We Three'' (2007) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Francois-Xavier Gleyzon]] used the Medusa Complex in reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare’s]] ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Shakespeares-Spiral-Tracing-Renaissance-Painting-ebook/dp/B009W3W2JI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529847384&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780761848936|title=Shakespeare's Spiral: Tracing the Snail in King Lear and Renaissance Painting|last=results|first=search|date=2010-03-19|publisher=UPA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6269">'''Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal''' (born March 18, 1943)&lt;ref name="White"&gt;[[Evelyn C. White]], ''Alice Walker: A Life'' (2004), p. 135-137.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American attorney known primarily for his work as a community organizer and lawyer in the 1960s–1970s [[Civil Rights Movement]], and for being the husband of author [[Alice Walker]] for ten years, and part of the first legally married interracial couple in the history of Mississippi.

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in [[Brooklyn, New York City]], Leventhal attended a yeshiva elementary school,&lt;ref name="White"/&gt; and Brooklyn Technical H.S. When he was nine years old, his parents divorced, and he and his siblings were split up, with the father taking Leventhal's older brother to live with him. Leventhal recalled that he rarely saw his father after that, and that on one occasion, when Leventhal was a teen-ager, he took a younger sibling to see their father who "slammed the door in our face".&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;  In Leventhal's formative years he was greatly influenced by Judaism's emphasis on community service and recalls in particular being "outraged and disgusted by the way white people treated [[Jackie Robinson]]".&lt;ref name="White"/&gt; He resolved to fight injustice, and in pursuit of this, after receiving his undergraduate degree from New York University's [[Washington Square College]] in 1964, he received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[New York University School of Law]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Red Book"&gt;State of New York, ''The New York Red Book'', p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career and marriage==
As a young lawyer, Leventhal worked in Mississippi for the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]], and from this work he formed the first interracial law partnership in the history of the state, with [[Reuben V. Anderson]], [[Fred L. Banks Jr.]], and John A. Nichols. Anderson and Banks would go on to become the first two African American justices of the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;[http://courts.ms.gov/news/2001/9.28.01banks.htm Supreme Court Justice Fred L. Banks Jr. announces he is stepping down] (September 28, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through his work, Leventhal met [[Alice Walker]], who came to trust and admire him due to his willingness to endanger his own social status and well-being by standing up to bigotry. On March 17, 1967, Leventhal and Walker married in [[New York (state)|New York]], in a [[civil ceremony]] performed by Family Court Judge [[Justine W. Polier]].&lt;ref name="Byrd1"&gt;Rudolph P. Byrd, ''The World Has Changed: Conversations with Alice Walker'' (2011), p. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was at that time illegal in Walker's home state of Georgia.&lt;ref name="Byrd1" /&gt; When the couple returned to Mississippi in July 1967, they became "the first legally married interracial couple in the state".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth H. Oakes, ''American Writers'' (2004), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker and Leventhal had one child, [[Rebecca Walker]], and divorced in 1976.&lt;ref name="Byrd2"&gt;Rudolph P. Byrd, ''The World Has Changed: Conversations with Alice Walker'' (2011), p. xlvi-xlvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Law School, during spring, summer and winter recesses, Leventhal worked as a student volunteer at LDF's offices in Jackson, Mississippi under the supervision of [[Marian Wright Edelman]]. This included serving as LDF's liaison to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the June, 1966 Meredith March Against Fear, from Memphis, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Aram Goudsouzian, "Down To The Crossroads," (2014), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1969 through 1974 Leventhal served as LDF's lead counsel in Mississippi.  He represented plaintiffs in approximately 75 lawsuits filed throughout the state to eliminate segregation and discrimination in public schools and to eliminate discrimination in employment, public accommodations, housing and in the provision of municipal services (e.g., street paving, street lighting and fire protection). After Leventhal moved back to New York in 1974, he was, until 1978, an LDF staff attorney litigating cases brought in Mississippi and throughout the United States. Leventhal’s ten-year career at the LDF was highlighted by three landmark cases:
*''[[Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education]]'', 396 U.S. 19 (1969), through which the Supreme Court of the United States brought to an end the era of "all deliberate speed" and ordered school districts to desegregate "at once".
*''[[Norwood v. Harrison]]'', 413 U.S. 455 (1973), through which the Supreme Court of the United States held unconstitutional state textbook assistance to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race.
*''[[Hawkins v. Town of Shaw]]'', 437 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971), aff'd on rehearing en banc, 461 F. 2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1972), through which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], upheld lawsuits challenging racial discrimination in the provision of municipal services.

Leventhal also testified before the United States Senate's Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity (Chair: Hon. [[Walter Mondale]]) in 1970, on the progress of school desegregation in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, Part 3B, Desegregation Under Law, July 8, 1970, pp. 1495-1534.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later public service career==
Leventhal returned to live in New York in 1974, and eventually remarried.&lt;ref name="Byrd2"/&gt; Between 1979 and 1984, Leventhal served first as the Assistant Attorney General of New York, in charge of the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau &lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt; and then as the Deputy First Assistant Attorney General of New York and Chief of the Litigation Bureau.  Leventhal has argued two cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], ''[[Norwood v. Harrison]]'', 413 U.S. 455 (1973) (argued in 1972) and ''[[Blum v. Stenson]]'', 465 U.S. 886 (1984) (argued in 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/advocates/melvyn_r_leventhal|title=Oyez page on Melvyn R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">A '''morphogram''' is the representation of a [[morpheme]] by a [[grapheme]] based solely on its meaning. [[Kanji]] and [[hanja]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} are two writing systems that make use of '''morphograms''', where Chinese characters were borrowed to represent native morphemes because of their meanings. Thus, a single character can represent a variety of morphemes which originally all had the same meaning. An example of this in Japanese would be the grapheme 東 [east], which can be read as ''higashi'' or ''azuma'', in addition to its [[logographic]] representation of the morpheme ''tō''. Additionally, in Japanese, the logographic (Chinese-derived) reading is called the ''on'', and the morphographic reading (native Japanese) is called the ''kun''.

A '''motion chart''' is a dynamic [[bubble chart]] which allows efficient and interactive exploration and visualization of longitudinal multivariate [[Data]].&lt;ref name="Al-Aziz10"&gt;Al-Aziz, J, Christou, N, Dinov, ID. (2010). SOCR Motion Charts: An Efficient, Open-Source, Interactive and Dynamic Applet for Visualizing Longitudinal Multivariate Data, [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/ JSE], [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/contents_2010.htm 18(3)], 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Motion Charts provide mechanisms for mapping ordinal, nominal and quantitative variables onto time, 2D coordinate axes, size, colors, glyphs and appearance characteristics, which facilitate the interactive display of multidimensional and temporal data.

== Overview ==
In general, [[chart]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]] and [[plot (graphics)|plot]]s provide the means for summarizing quantitative and qualitative [[data]] using diverse graphical representations. The main limitations of such static types of data exploratory and visualization are the low number of variables that can be shown simultaneously on the chart. Many classical data visualization techniques have limitations in terms of the volume, properties or complexity of the dataset. For instance, [[Scatter plot]]s require bivariate data. Many datasets include multiple measurements like time, space, demographic, phenotypic and functional recording. For instance, the annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124060939/http://fhfa.gov/Default.aspx?Page=87 US Housing Price Index] dataset includes dozens of variable including location (State and US region), year, unemployment rate, state population, percent subprime loans, etc.

Motion charts provide a dynamic data visualization paradigm that facilitates the representation and understanding of large and multivariate data. Using the familiar 2D [[Bubble chart]]s, motion Charts enable the display of large multivariate data with thousands of data points and allow for interactive visualization of the data using additional dimensions like time, the size of the blobs, and color) to show different characteristics of the data. 

The central object of a motion chart is a blob (or bubble), which is a solid object [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a disc. Blobs have 3 important characteristics – size, position and appearance. Using variable mapping, motion charts allow control over the appearance of the blobs at different time points. This mechanism enhances the dynamic appearance of the data in the motion chart and facilitates the visual inspection of associations, patterns and trends in multivariate datasets.

== Examples of motion charts==
There are several web-based motion charts graphical data visualization tools including [[Many-Eyes]], [[Gapminder]], [[Google Motion Charts]], nanobi analytics, [http://www.amcharts.com/inspiration/motion-chart/ motion-chart by amCharts]&lt;ref&gt;Grossenbacher A. (2008). The globalisation of statistical content Statistical Journal of the IAOS: Journal of the International Association for Official Statistics 25:133-144.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SOCR Motion Charts]].&lt;ref name="Al-Aziz10"/&gt; These graphical resources allow users to interactively explore relationships and trends of data with temporal characteristics.

Typically, the behavior of a nonlinear system is described in mathematics by a '''nonlinear system of equations''', which is a set of simultaneous [[equation]]s in which the unknowns (or the unknown functions in the case of [[differential equation]]s) appear as variables of a [[polynomial]] of degree higher than one or in the argument of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which is not a polynomial of degree one.
In other words, in a nonlinear system of equations, the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as a [[linear combination]] of the unknown [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that appear in them. Systems can be defined as nonlinear, regardless of whether known linear functions appear in the equations. In particular, a differential equation is ''linear'' if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives, even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it.

As nonlinear dynamical equations are difficult to solve, nonlinear systems are commonly approximated by linear equations ([[linearization]]). This works well up to some accuracy and some range for the input values, but some interesting phenomena such as [[soliton]]s, [[chaos theory|chaos]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Earth--Atmospheric--and-Planetary-Sciences/12-006JFall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm Nonlinear Dynamics I: Chaos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212045134/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Earth--Atmospheric--and-Planetary-Sciences/12-006JFall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm |date=2008-02-12}} at [http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/index.htm MIT's OpenCourseWare]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] are hidden by linearization. It follows that some aspects of the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear system can appear to be counterintuitive, unpredictable or even chaotic. Although such chaotic behavior may resemble [[randomness|random]] behavior, it is in fact not random. For example, some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic, where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout. This nonlinearity is one of the reasons why accurate long-term forecasts are impossible with current technology.

Some authors use the term '''nonlinear science''' for the study of nonlinear systems. This is disputed by others:

{{quote|Using a term like nonlinear science is like referring to the bulk of zoology as the study of [[negation|non]]-elephant animals.|[[Stanislaw Ulam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David K.|title=Nonlinear physics: Fresh breather|journal=Nature|date=25 November 2004|volume=432|issue=7016|pages=455–456|doi=10.1038/432455a|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1134179|language=en|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2004Natur.432..455C}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==
In [[mathematics]], a [[linear map]] (or ''linear function'') &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is one which satisfies both of the following properties:
*Additivity or [[superposition principle]]: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y);&lt;/math&gt;
*Homogeneity: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Additivity implies homogeneity for any [[rational number|rational]] ''α'', and, for [[continuous function]]s, for any [[real number|real]] ''α''. For a [[complex number|complex]] ''α'', homogeneity does not follow from additivity. For example, an [[antilinear map]] is additive but not homogeneous. The conditions of additivity and homogeneity are often combined in the superposition principle
:&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)&lt;/math&gt;

An equation written as
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = C&lt;/math&gt;

is called '''linear''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear map (as defined above) and '''nonlinear''' otherwise. The equation is called ''homogeneous'' if &lt;math&gt;C = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition &lt;math&gt;f(x) = C&lt;/math&gt; is very general in that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be any sensible mathematical object (number, vector, function, etc.), and the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; can literally be any [[map (mathematics)|mapping]], including integration or differentiation with associated constraints (such as [[boundary values]]). If &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; contains [[derivative|differentiation]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the result will be a [[differential equation]].

==Nonlinear algebraic equations==
{{Main|Algebraic equation|System of polynomial equations}}
Nonlinear [[algebraic equation]]s, which are also called ''[[polynomial equation]]s'', are defined by equating [[polynomial]]s to zero. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + x - 1 = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For a single polynomial equation, [[root-finding algorithm]]s can be used to find solutions to the equation (i.e., sets of values for the variables that satisfy the equation). However, systems of algebraic equations are more complicated; their study is one motivation for the field of [[algebraic geometry]], a difficult branch of modern mathematics. It is even difficult to decide whether a given algebraic system has complex solutions (see [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]). Nevertheless, in the case of the systems with a finite number of complex solutions, these [[systems of polynomial equations]] are now well understood and efficient methods exist for solving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lazard |first1= D. |title= Thirty years of Polynomial System Solving, and now? |doi= 10.1016/j.jsc.2008.03.004 |journal= Journal of Symbolic Computation |volume= 44 |issue= 3 |pages= 222–231 |year= 2009 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonlinear recurrence relations==
A nonlinear [[recurrence relation]] defines successive terms of a [[sequence]] as a nonlinear function of preceding terms. Examples of nonlinear recurrence relations are the [[logistic map]] and the relations that define the various [[Hofstadter sequence]]s. Nonlinear discrete models that represent a wide class of nonlinear recurrence relationships include the NARMAX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs) model and the related [[nonlinear system identification]] and analysis procedures.&lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. "Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains". Wiley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches can be used to study a wide class of complex nonlinear behaviors in the time, frequency, and spatio-temporal domains.

==Nonlinear differential equations==
A [[simultaneous equations|system]] of [[differential equation]]s is said to be nonlinear if it is not a [[linear system]]. Problems involving nonlinear differential equations are extremely diverse, and methods of solution or analysis are problem dependent. Examples of nonlinear differential equations are the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in fluid dynamics and the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]]s in biology.

One of the greatest difficulties of nonlinear problems is that it is not generally possible to combine known solutions into new solutions. In linear problems, for example, a family of [[linearly independent]] solutions can be used to construct general solutions through the [[superposition principle]]. A good example of this is one-dimensional heat transport with [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]], the solution of which can be written as a time-dependent linear combination of sinusoids of differing frequencies; this makes solutions very flexible. It is often possible to find several very specific solutions to nonlinear equations, however the lack of a [[superposition principle]] prevents the construction of new solutions.

===Ordinary differential equations===
First order [[ordinary differential equation]]s are often exactly solvable by [[separation of variables]], especially for autonomous equations. For example, the nonlinear equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d u}{d x} = -u^2&lt;/math&gt;

has &lt;math&gt;u=\frac{1}{x+C}&lt;/math&gt; as a general solution (and also ''u'' = 0 as a particular solution, corresponding to the limit of the general solution when ''C'' tends to infinity). The equation is nonlinear because it may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{d x} + u^2=0&lt;/math&gt;

and the left-hand side of the equation is not a linear function of ''u'' and its derivatives. Note that if the ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term were replaced with ''u'', the problem would be linear (the [[exponential decay]] problem).

Second and higher order ordinary differential equations (more generally, systems of nonlinear equations) rarely yield [[closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions, though implicit solutions and solutions involving [[nonelementary integral]]s are encountered.

Common methods for the qualitative analysis of nonlinear ordinary differential equations include:

*Examination of any [[conserved quantities]], especially in [[Hamiltonian system]]s
*Examination of dissipative quantities (see [[Lyapunov function]]) analogous to conserved quantities
*Linearization via [[Taylor expansion]]
*Change of variables into something easier to study
*[[Bifurcation theory]]
*[[Perturbation theory|Perturbation]] methods (can be applied to algebraic equations too)

===Partial differential equations===
{{See also|List of nonlinear partial differential equations}}
The most common basic approach to studying nonlinear [[partial differential equation]]s is to change the variables (or otherwise transform the problem) so that the resulting problem is simpler (possibly even linear). Sometimes, the equation may be transformed into one or more [[ordinary differential equation]]s, as seen in [[separation of variables]], which is always useful whether or not the resulting ordinary differential equation(s) is solvable.

Another common (though less mathematic) tactic, often seen in fluid and heat mechanics, is to use [[scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] to simplify a general, natural equation in a certain specific [[boundary value problem]]. For example, the (very) nonlinear [[Navier-Stokes equations]] can be simplified into one linear partial differential equation in the case of transient, laminar, one dimensional flow in a circular pipe; the scale analysis provides conditions under which the flow is laminar and one dimensional and also yields the simplified equation.

Other methods include examining the [[method of characteristics|characteristics]] and using the methods outlined above for ordinary differential equations.

===Pendula===
{{Main|Pendulum (mathematics)}}

[[File:PendulumLayout.svg|thumb|Illustration of a pendulum|right|200px]]
[[File:PendulumLinearizations.png|thumb|Linearizations of a pendulum|right|200px]]

A classic, extensively studied nonlinear problem is the dynamics of a [[pendulum (mathematics)|pendulum]] under the influence of [[gravity]]. Using [[Lagrangian mechanics]], it may be shown&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/dynamics.html David Tong: Lectures on Classical Dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; that the motion of a pendulum can be described by the [[dimensionless]] nonlinear equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + \sin(\theta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where gravity points "downwards" and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum forms with its rest position, as shown in the figure at right. One approach to "solving" this equation is to use &lt;math&gt;d\theta/dt&lt;/math&gt; as an [[integrating factor]], which would eventually yield
:&lt;math&gt;\int{\frac{d \theta}{\sqrt{C_0 + 2 \cos(\theta)}}} = t + C_1&lt;/math&gt;

which is an implicit solution involving an [[elliptic integral]]. This "solution" generally does not have many uses because most of the nature of the solution is hidden in the [[nonelementary integral]] (nonelementary unless &lt;math&gt;C_0 = 2&lt;/math&gt;).

Another way to approach the problem is to linearize any nonlinearities (the sine function term in this case) at the various points of interest through [[Taylor expansion]]s. For example, the linearization at &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, called the small angle approximation, is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\theta \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;. This is a [[simple harmonic oscillator]] corresponding to oscillations of the pendulum near the bottom of its path. Another linearization would be at &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the pendulum being straight up:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + \pi - \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) \approx \pi - \theta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\theta \approx \pi&lt;/math&gt;. The solution to this problem involves [[hyperbolic sinusoid]]s, and note that unlike the small angle approximation, this approximation is unstable, meaning that &lt;math&gt;|\theta|&lt;/math&gt; will usually grow without limit, though bounded solutions are possible. This corresponds to the difficulty of balancing a pendulum upright, it is literally an unstable state.

One more interesting linearization is possible around &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, around which &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to a free fall problem. A very useful qualitative picture of the pendulum's dynamics may be obtained by piecing together such linearizations, as seen in the figure at right. Other techniques may be used to find (exact) [[phase portrait]]s and approximate periods.

==Types of nonlinear dynamic behaviors==
*[[Amplitude death]] – any oscillations present in the system cease due to some kind of interaction with other system or feedback by the same system
*[[Chaos theory|Chaos]] – values of a system cannot be predicted indefinitely far into the future, and fluctuations are [[aperiodic]]
*[[Multistability]] – the presence of two or more stable states
*[[Soliton]]s – self-reinforcing solitary waves

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9104">'''''Homo novus''''' (or: ''novus homo'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for "new man"; plural '''''homines novi''''') was the term in [[ancient Rome]] for a man who was the first in his family to serve in the [[Roman Senate]] or, more specifically, to be elected as [[Roman consul|consul]]. When a man entered public life on an unprecedented scale for a high communal office, then the term used was '''''novus civis''''' (plural: '''''novi cives''''') or "new citizen".&lt;ref&gt;Becker, M.B., "The Republican City State in Florence: An Inquiry into it origin and survival (1280-1434)", ''Speculum'', '''35''' (1960), pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the [[Roman Republic#Patrician Era (509–367 BC)|Early Republic]], tradition held that both Senate membership and the consulship were restricted to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. When [[plebeian]]s gained the right to this office during the [[Conflict of the Orders]], all newly elected plebeians were naturally ''novi homines''. With time, ''novi homines'' became progressively rarer as some plebeian families became as entrenched in the Senate as their patrician colleagues. By the time of the [[First Punic War]], it was already a sensation that ''novi homines'' were elected in two consecutive years ([[Gaius Fundanius Fundulus]] in 243&amp;nbsp;BC and [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] in 242&amp;nbsp;BC). In 63&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Cicero]] became the first ''novus homo'' in more than thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De lege agraria'', describes the interval as ''perlongo intervallo'' and his consulship "almost the first in living memory".&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133–49 BC)|Late Republic]], the distinction between the orders became less important. The consuls came from a new elite, the ''[[nobiles]]'' ([[nobility|noblemen]]), an artificial [[aristocracy]] of all who could demonstrate direct descent in the male line from a consul.&lt;ref&gt;First demonstrated in Matthias Gelzer, ''Die nobilität der römischen Republik'' 1912, correcting [[Theodor Mommsen]]'s earlier proposition that all families possessing the ''[[ius imaginum]]'', that is, descended from [[Aedile|curule magistrates]], were designated ''nobili''. D. R. Shackleton Bailey, "Nobiles and Novi Reconsidered" ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''107'''.2 (Summer 1986), pp. 255-260, assesses and rejects some apparent exceptions to Gelzer's rule.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of ''novi homines''==
* [[Lucius Volumnius Flamma Violens]] (elected 307 BC and 296 BC)
* [[Gaius Duilius]] (elected 260 BC)
* [[Gaius Fundanius Fundulus]] (elected 243 BC)
* [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] (elected 241 BC)
* [[Gaius Flaminius]] (elected 223 BC and 217 BC)
* [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato (the Censor/Elder)]] (elected 195 BC)
* [[Lucius Licinius Lucullus (consul 151 BC)|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] (elected 151 BC)
* [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]] (elected 146 BC)
* [[Gaius Marius]] (elected 107 BC, 104–100 BC, 86 BC)
* [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]] (elected 105 BC)
* [[Titus Didius]] (elected 98 BC)
* [[Gaius Coelius Caldus]] (elected 94 BC)
* [[Pompeius Strabo|Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo]] (elected 89 BC)
* [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (elected 63 BC)
* [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC)|Marcus Vinicius]] (appointed suffect consul 19 BC)
* [[Gaius Pomponius Graecinus]] (appointed AD 16)
* [[Tacitus|Gaius Cornelius Tacitus]] (appointed AD 97)

==''Topos'' of the "New Man"==
The literary theme of ''Homo novus'', or "how the lowly born but inherently worthy man may properly rise to eminence in the world" was the ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s influential Epistle XLIV.&lt;ref&gt;The sources that follow are drawn from R. W. Truman, "Lázaro de Tormes and the "Homo Novus" Tradition" ''The Modern Language Review'' '''64'''.1 (January 1969), pp. 62-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the endpoint of [[Late Antiquity]], it was likewise a subject in [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' (iii, vi). In the [[Middle Ages]] [[Dante]]'s ''Convivio'' (book IV) and [[Petrarch]]'s ''De remediis utriusque fortunae'' (I.16; II.5) take up the subject, and [[Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale|Wife of Bath's Tale]].

In its Christian renderings, the theme suggested a tension in the ''scala naturae'' or [[great chain of being]], one that was produced through the agency of Man's [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantinos Patrides|C.A. Patrides]], "The Scale of nature and Renaissance treatises on nobility" ''Studia Neophilologica'' '''36''' (1964) pp 63-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme came naturally to [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] who were often ''homines novi''&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Vogt, "Gleanings for the history of a sentiment: Generositas Virtus non Sanguis" ''[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]'' '''24''' (1925):102-24."&lt;/ref&gt;  rising by their own wits in a network of [[noble court]]s that depended on the highly literate new men to run increasingly complicated chancelries and create the cultural propaganda that was a contemporary vehicle for noble fame, and that consequently offered a kind of intellectual ''[[cursus honorum]]''. In the fifteenth century [[Buonaccorso da Montemagno]]'s ''Dialogus de vera nobilitate'' treated of the "true nobility" inherent in the worthy individual; [[Poggio Bracciolini]] also wrote at length ''De nobilitate'', stressing the [[Renaissance]] view of human responsibility and effectiveness that are at the heart of Humanism: ''sicut virtutis ita et nobilitatis sibi quisque existit auctor et opifex''.&lt;ref&gt;"Thus of the road to manly excellence and nobility the author and workmaster".&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefer summaries of the theme were to be found in [[Francesco Patrizi]], ''De institutionae republicae'' (VI.1), and in [[Rodrigo Sánchez de Arévalo]]'s encyclopedic ''Speculum vitae humanae''. In the sixteenth century these and new texts came to be widely printed and distributed. Sánchez de Arévalo's ''Speculum'' was first printed at Rome, 1468, and there are more than twenty [[Incunabulum|fifteenth-century printings]]; German, French and Spanish translations were printed. The characters of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s [[The Book of the Courtier]] (1528) discuss the requirement that a ''cortegiano'' be noble (I.XIV-XVI). This was translated into French, Spanish, English, Latin and other languages.&lt;ref&gt;See: P. Burke. ''The Fortunes of the Courtier: The European Reception of Castiglione's Cortegiano''. (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerónimo Osório da Fonseca]]'s ''De nobilitate'' (Lisbon 1542, and seven reprintings in the sixteenth century), stressing ''propria strennuitas'' ("one's own determined striving") received an English translation in 1576.

The Roman figure most often cited as an ''[[exemplum]]'' is [[Gaius Marius]], whose speech of self-justification was familiar to readers from the set-piece in [[Sallust]]'s ''[[Bellum Iugurthinum]]'', 85; the most familiar format in the Renaissance treatises is a [[dialogue]] that contrasts the two sources of nobility, with the evidence weighted in favour of the "new man".

'''''PGA Tour Golf Team Challenge''''' is a [[trackball]]-based [[golf]] [[arcade game]] series manufactured by [[Global VR]] of [[San Jose, California]].

Based on the PC version of [[EA Sports]]' ''[[PGA Tour (video game series)|PGA Tour]]'' game, the game is run from a computer within the cabinet which has an [[Intel]] [[Pentium 4]] processor and [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce]] video card.

The current - and final - edition of the PGA series is titled PGA Tour Golf ‘Team Challenge’. A player can select from a number of real PGA pro golfers &amp; PGA tour courses in either 9 or 18 holes, against up to 3 other players or in team play of up to 4 players per team.  The game has 3 main modes of play;

‘Play Golf’ mode (does not require a players’ card or online capabilities) has 13 eighteen-hole courses but if the machine is online/tournament enabled, there’s a 14th ‘bonus’ course which changes every month. There are training courses and a driving range here as well as a front 9 ‘course’ and back 9 ‘course’ made up of various Fantasy course holes.

‘World Tour’ mode provides access to all 24 courses each with two hidden/secret skill-shots which unlock customizable items for your created golfer. This mode keeps track of your personal best course scores and once all 24 courses are complete, a ranking will be assigned using your combined average score - Rookie, Amateur, Scratch, Club Pro, Pro, Champion &amp;  Legend. You can continue to improve upon your scores to gain a higher ranking.

‘Tournaments’ run weekly featuring one of the 24 courses within the game. Weather conditions and pin placements change with each day of the tournament. Tournament Leaderboards are displayed during the machine’s ‘attract mode’ screens.

Online play (Tournaments and World Tour) requires the Global VR 2nd generation "Smart Card" reader (recognizable by two LED lights on the front) and accompanying Players’ Card Format for saving created golfers as well as World Tour stats &amp; unlockable items. The original magnetic stripe card reader from the first three editions of PGA Tour Golf (lacks LED lights on the front) is not compatible with ‘Challenge’ and ‘Team Challenge’ editions.

Since the game has the PC version of Tiger Woods Golf embedded within, pros who were unlicensed for the coin-op version can be substituted in place of an existing golfer with simple modifications within the game’s files (Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Adam Scott and Jesper Parnevik for example).

==Hardware &amp; Upgrades==
The series originally launched with a Beige ‘DFI’ computer within. As the series continued, Global VR provided operators with new software on compact discs (to be installed on the computer’s hard drive) featuring the latest edition of PGA Tour Golf. The hardware demands for each new edition increased and Global VR provided a computer upgrade option; the superior black ‘Everlast’ computer.   Many operators passed on spending on hardware upgrades so subsequent editions of the series may have seen noticeable lag in gameplay as a result.&lt;ref name="PGAs Arcade Upgrade"/&gt;

Juran]] suggested the principle and named it after Italian [[economist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]], who noted the 80/20 connection while at the [[University of Lausanne]] in 1896, as published in his first work, ''Cours d'économie politique''. Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.

It is an axiom of business management that "80% of sales come from 20% of clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229294|title=The 80/20 Rule of Sales: How to Find Your Best Customers|last=Marshall|first=Perry|date=2013-10-09|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Koch]] authored the book, ''The 80/20 Principle,'' which illustrated some practical applications of the Pareto principle in business management and life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 80/20 Principle : the Secret of Achieving More with Less|last1=Koch|first1=Richard|date=1998|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780385491747|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly followed by a [[power law]] distribution (also known as a [[Pareto distribution]]) for a particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown empirically to exhibit such a distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cond-mat/pdf/0412/0412004v3.pdf|title=Power laws, Pareto Distributions, and Zipf's law|last=Newman|first=MEJ|page=11|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to [[Pareto efficiency]]. Pareto developed both concepts in the context of the [[distribution of income]] and wealth among the population.

== In economics ==

The original observation was in connection with population and wealth. Pareto noticed that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=''Translation of'' Manuale di economia politica ("Manual of political economy") |first1=Vilfredo|last1=Pareto|first2=Alfred N.|last2=Page|publisher=A.M. Kelley|year=1971|isbn=978-0-678-00881-2|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied.

A chart that gave the inequality a very visible and comprehensible form, the so-called "champagne glass" effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Xabier|last=Gorostiaga|title=World has become a 'champagne glass' globalization will fill it fuller for a wealthy few|journal=National Catholic Reporter|date=January 27, 1995|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; was contained in the 1992 United Nations Development Program Report, which showed that distribution of global income is very uneven, with the richest 20% of the world's population controlling 82.7% of the world's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=United Nations Development Program|title=1992 Human Development Report|year=1992|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pareto principle also could be seen as applying to taxation. In the US, the top 20% of earners have paid roughly 80-90% of Federal income taxes in 2000 and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Dubay (May 4, 2009) [https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/the-rich-pay-more-taxes-top-20-percent-pay-record-share-income-taxes The Rich Pay More Taxes: Top 20 Percent Pay Record Share of Income Taxes], Heritage.org, accessed 12 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Sanders (April 6, 2018) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-20-of-americans-will-pay-87-of-income-tax-1523007001 Top 20% of Americans Will Pay 87% of Income Tax], Wall Street Journal, accessed 12 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== In software ==
In [[computer science]] the Pareto principle can be applied to [[optimization (computer science)|optimization]] efforts.&lt;ref name=optimization&gt;{{citation|first1=M.|last1=Gen|first2=R.|last2=Cheng|title=Genetic Algorithms and Engineering Optimization|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|year=2002|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Microsoft]] noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.crn.com/news/security/18821726/microsofts-ceo-80-20-rule-applies-to-bugs-not-just-features.htm|title=Microsoft's CEO: 80–20 Rule Applies To Bugs, Not Just Features|first=Paula|last=Rooney|date=October 3, 2002|publisher=ChannelWeb|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lowell Arthur]] expressed that "20 percent of the code has 80 percent of the errors. Find them, fix them!"&lt;ref&gt;Pressman, Roger S. (2010). Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach (7th ed.). Boston, Mass: McGraw-Hill, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-07-337597-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also discovered that in general the 80% of a certain piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time. This factor is usually a part of [[COCOMO]] estimating for software coding.

== In sports ==
It has been inferred the Pareto principle applies to athletic training, where roughly 20% of the exercises and habits have 80% of the impact and the trainee should not focus so much on a varied training.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://speedendurance.com/2008/11/20/training-and-the-80-20-rule-of-paretos-principle/ |title=Training and the 80-20 rule of Pareto’s Principle }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily mean that having a healthy diet or going to the gym are not important, but they are not as significant as the key activities. It is also important to note this 80/20 rule has yet to be scientifically tested in controlled studies with regards to athletic training.

In [[baseball]], the Pareto principle has been perceived in [[Wins Above Replacement]] (an attempt to combine multiple statistics to determine a player's overall importance to a team). "15% of the all the players last year produced 85% of the total wins with the other 85% of the players creating 15% of the wins. The Pareto Principle holds up pretty soundly when it is applied to baseball..."&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Zimmerman (Jun 4, 2010). [https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2010/6/4/1501048/applying-the-parento-principle-80 Applying the Pareto Principle (80-20 Rule) to Baseball], BeyondTheBoxScore.com, accessed 12 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately a brief look at this article's methods shows that the choice of alternate and probably better indicators of performance yields drastically different results that fail to support the Pareto Principle for this context.  Thus this probably entails an example of [[Cherry_picking|cherry-picking]].

== Occupational health and safety ==
[[Occupational health and safety]] professionals use the Pareto principle to underline the importance of hazard prioritization. Assuming 20% of the hazards account for 80% of the injuries, and by categorizing hazards, safety professionals can target those 20% of the hazards that cause 80% of the injuries or accidents. Alternatively, if hazards are addressed in random order, a safety professional is more likely to fix one of the 80% of hazards that account only for some fraction of the remaining 20% of injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodcock |first=Kathryn |title=Safety Evaluation Techniques |year=2010 |publisher= Ryerson University |location= Toronto, ON |pages=86 |url= http://www.ryerson.ca/woodcock/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from ensuring efficient accident prevention practices, the Pareto principle also ensures hazards are addressed in an economical order as the technique ensures the resources used are best used to prevent the most accidents.&lt;ref name=USCG001&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Risk-based Decision-Making |url= http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg5211/docs/RBDM_Files/PDF/RBDM_Guidelines/Volume%202/Volume%202-Chapter%206.pdf |work=USCG Safety Program |publisher= United States Coast Guard |accessdate= 14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==
In engineering control theory, such as for electromechanical energy converters, the 80/20 principle applies to optimization efforts.&lt;ref name=optimization/&gt;

The law of the few can be also seen in betting, where it is said that with 20% effort you can match the accuracy of 80% of the bettors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Pareto Principle of Prediction|url=https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/betting-strategy/the-pareto-principle-of-prediction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the systems science discipline, [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] created an [[Agent-based social simulation|agent-based simulation]] model called [[Sugarscape]], from a [[Decentralised system|decentralized modeling]] approach, based on individual behavior rules defined for each agent in the economy.  Wealth distribution and Pareto's 80/20 principle became emergent in their results, which suggests the principle is a collective consequence of these individual rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Epstein|first=Joshua|title=Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom-Up|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xXvelSs2caQC|page=208|year=1996|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=0-262-55025-3|last2=Axtell|first2=Robert}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pareto principle has many applications in quality control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QtVmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=The+Pareto+principle+has+many+applications+in+quality+control&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qFmwW19c5q&amp;sig=4f0n7ESBCiqhG5xY7ri0NXX5fD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFo4_YpN7YAhULNbwKHeEQA044ChDoAQg0MAI#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Pareto%20principle%20has%20many%20applications%20in%20quality%20control&amp;f=false|title=The Pareto Principle for Business Management: Expand your business with the 80/20 rule|last=50MINUTES.COM|date=2015-08-17|publisher=50 Minutes|isbn=9782806265869|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It is the basis for the [[Pareto chart]], one of the key tools used in [[total quality management|total quality control]] and [[Six Sigma]] techniques. The Pareto principle serves as a baseline for [[time management#abc analysis|ABC-analysis]] and XYZ-analysis, widely used in [[logistics]] and procurement for the purpose of optimizing stock of goods, as well as costs of keeping and replenishing that stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rushton|Oxley|Croucher|2000}}, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In health care in the United States, in one instance 20% of patients have been found to use 80% of health care resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_weinberg27_07-27-09_HQF0P1E_v15.3f89889.html Myrl Weinberg: In health-care reform, the 20-80 solution | Contributors | projo.com | The Providence Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802002952/http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_weinberg27_07-27-09_HQF0P1E_v15.3f89889.html|date=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://archive.li/oK3Fp&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases of [[Super-spreader|super-spreading]] conform to the 20/80 rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galvani|first1=Alison P.|last2=May|first2=Robert M.|year=|title=Epidemiology: Dimensions of superspreading|url=|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=|pages=293–295|doi=10.1038/438293a|pmid=16292292}}&lt;/ref&gt; where approximately 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmissions, although super-spreading can still be said to occur when super-spreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd-Smith|first1=JO|last2=Schreiber|first2=SJ|last3=Kopp|first3=PE|last4=Getz|first4=WM|year=2005|title=Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence|url=|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=|pages=355–359|doi=10.1038/nature04153|pmid=16292310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[epidemic]]s with super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few [[contact tracing|secondary contacts]].

The [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study|Dunedin Study]] has found 80% of crimes are committed by 20% of criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nicola|first=Davis|title='High social cost' adults can be predicted from as young as three, says study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/12/high-social-cost-adults-can-be-identified-from-as-young-as-three-says-study|year=2016|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic has been used to support both [[stop-and-frisk]] policies and [[broken windows]] policing, as catching those criminals committing minor crimes will supposedly net many criminals wanted for (or who would normally commit) larger ones.  Once again, however, data from the same Dunedin study provide other results that nowhere near approximate the 80-20 principle; choose a different indicator and the 80% may become 36%.  Thus support for the applicability of the Pareto Principle again seems to require [[Cherry_picking|cherry-picking]].

== Mathematical notes ==
The idea has a rule of thumb application in many places, but it is commonly misused. For example, it is a misuse to state a solution to a problem "fits the 80/20 rule" just because it fits 80% of the cases; it must also be that the solution requires only 20% of the resources that would be needed to solve all cases. Additionally, it is a misuse of the 80/20 rule to interpret  a small number of categories or observations.

This is a special case of the wider phenomenon of [[Pareto distribution]]s. If the [[Pareto index]]&amp;nbsp;'''α''', which is one of the parameters characterizing a Pareto distribution, is chosen as '''α'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;5&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.16, then one has 80% of effects coming from 20% of causes.

It follows that one also has 80% of that top 80% of effects coming from 20% of that top 20% of causes, and so on. Eighty percent of 80% is 64%; 20% of 20% is 4%, so this implies a "64/4" law; and similarly implies a "51.2/0.8" law. Similarly for the bottom 80% of causes and bottom 20% of effects, the bottom 80% of the bottom 80% only cause 20% of the remaining 20%. This is broadly in line with the world population/wealth table above, where the bottom 60% of the people own 5.5% of the wealth, approximating to a 64/4 connection.

The 64/4 correlation also implies a 32% 'fair' area between the 4% and 64%, where the lower 80% of the top 20% (16%) and upper 20% of the bottom 80% (also 16%) relates to the corresponding lower top and upper bottom of effects (32%). This is also broadly in line with the world population table above, where the second 20% control 12% of the wealth, and the bottom of the top 20% (presumably) control 16% of the wealth.

The term 80/20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work.  In individual cases, the distribution could just as well be, say, nearer to 80/20 or 70/30.  There is no need for the two numbers to add up to the number 100, as they are measures of different things, (e.g., 'number of customers' vs 'amount spent').  However, each case in which they do not add up to 100%, is equivalent to one in which they do. For example, as noted above, the "64/4 law" (in which the two numbers do not add up to 100%) is equivalent to the "80/20 law" (in which they do add up to 100%).  Thus, specifying two percentages independently does not lead to a broader class of distributions than what one gets by specifying the larger one and letting the smaller one be its complement relative to 100%.  Thus, there is only one degree of freedom in the choice of that parameter.

Adding up to 100 leads to a nice symmetry. For example, if 80% of effects come from the top 20% of sources, then the remaining 20% of effects come from the lower 80% of sources. This is called the "joint ratio", and can be used to measure the degree of imbalance: a joint ratio of 96:4 is very imbalanced, 80:20 is significantly imbalanced ([[Gini index]]: 76%), 70:30 is moderately imbalanced (Gini index: 28%), and 55:45 is just slightly imbalanced (Gini index 14%).

The Pareto principle is an illustration of a "[[power law]]" relationship, which also occurs in phenomena such as [[brush fire]]s and earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bak|first=Per|title=How Nature Works: the science of self-organized criticality|page=89|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-94791-4|authorlink=Per Bak}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because it is self-similar over a wide range of magnitudes, it produces outcomes completely different from [[Normal distribution|Normal or Gaussian distribution]] phenomena. This fact explains the frequent breakdowns of sophisticated financial instruments, which are modeled on the assumption that a Gaussian relationship is appropriate to, for example, stock price movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Taleb|first=Nassim|title=[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]|pages=229–252, 274–285|year=2007|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|authorlink=Nassim Taleb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equality measures ==

=== Gini coefficient and Hoover index ===

Using the "''A''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''B''" notation (for example, 0.8:0.2) and with&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, [[Income inequality metrics|inequality measures]] like the [[Gini index]] (G) ''and'' the [[Hoover index]] (H) can be computed. In this case both are the same.

: &lt;math&gt;H=G=|2A-1|=|1-2B| \, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A:B = \left( \frac{1+H} 2 \right): \left( \frac{1-H} 2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Theil index ===
The [[Theil index]] is an entropy measure used to quantify inequalities. The measure is 0 for 50:50 distributions and reaches 1 at a Pareto distribution of 82:18. Higher inequalities yield Theil indices above 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poorcity.richcity.org/calculator/?quantiles=82.4,17.6|17.6,82.4 On Line Calculator: Inequality&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{history of war}}
'''Peacekeeping''' refers to activities intended to create conditions that favour lasting peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/|title=United Nations Peacekeeping|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.

Within the [[United Nations]] (UN) group of nation-state governments and organisations, there is a general understanding that at the international level, peacekeepers monitor and observe [[Peacebuilding|peace processes]] in post-conflict areas, and may assist ex-combatants in implementing [[peace agreement]] commitments that they have undertaken. Such assistance may come in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the [[rule of law]], and economic and social development. Accordingly, the [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeepers]] (often referred to as '''Blue Berets '''or '''Blue Helmets''' because of their light blue [[beret]]s or helmets) can include soldiers, [[United Nations Police|police]] officers, and civilian personnel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Peacekeeping |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/about/dpko/ |title=Department of Peacekeeping Operations(DPKO) |publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Peacekeeping |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/about/dfs/ |title=Department of Field Support(DFS) |publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations is not the only organisation to implement peacekeeping missions. Non-UN peacekeeping forces include the [[Kosovo Force|NATO mission in Kosovo]] (with United Nations authorisation) and the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] on the [[Sinai Peninsula]] or the ones organised by the [[European Union]] (like [[EUFOR RCA]], with UN authorisation) and the [[African Union]] (like the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]]). The [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]] is one NGO widely considered to have expertise in general peacemaking by non-governmental volunteers or activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Jobs Donate Offices |url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/ |title=Nonviolent Peaceforce |publisher=Nonviolent Peaceforce |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and types of peacekeeping operations==

=== United Nations peacekeeping missions ===

====Chapter VI and Chapter VII mission types====
There are a range of various types of operations encompassed in peacekeeping. In Page Fortna's book ''Does Peacekeeping Work?'', for instance, she distinguishes four different types of peacekeeping operations.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?: Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, these types of missions and how they are conducted are heavily influenced by the mandate in which they are authorized. Three of Fortna's four types are consent-based missions, i.e. so-called "[[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VI]]" missions, with the fourth being a "[[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]]" Mission. 
Chapter VI missions are consent based, therefore they require the consent of the belligerent factions involved in order to operate. Should they lose that consent, Peacekeepers would be compelled to withdraw. Chapter VII missions, by contrast, do not require consent, though they may have it. If consent is lost at any point, Chapter VII missions would not be required to withdraw.
# ''Observation Missions'' which consist of small contingents of military or civilian observers tasked with monitoring cease-fires, troop withdrawals, or other conditions outlined in a ceasefire agreement. They are typically unarmed and are primarily tasked with observing and reporting on what is taking place. Thus, they do not possess the capability or mandate to intervene should either side renege on the agreement. Examples of observation missions include [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission II|UNAVEM II]] in [[Angola]] in 1991 and [[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]] in the [[Western Sahara]].
# ''Interpositional Missions'', also known as traditional peacekeeping, are larger contingents of lightly armed troops meant to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions in the aftermath of a conflict. Thus, they serve as a buffer zone between the two sides and can monitor and report on the compliance of either side with regard to parameters established in a given ceasefire agreement. Examples include [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III|UNAVEM III]] in Angola in 1994, and [[MINUGUA]] in [[Guatemala]] in 1996.
# ''Multidimensional missions'' are carried out by military and [[United Nations Police|police]] personnel in which they attempt to implement robust and comprehensive settlements. Not only do they act as observers, or in an interpositional role, but they also participate in more multidimensional tasks—such as electoral supervision, police and security forces reform, institution building, economic development and more. Examples include [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group|UNTAG]] in [[Namibia]], [[ONUCA and ONUSAL|ONUSAL]] in [[El Salvador]], and [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|ONUMOZ]] in [[Mozambique]].
# ''Peace enforcement Missions'' are Chapter VII missions and unlike the previous Chapter VI missions, they do not require the consent of the belligerent parties. These are multidimensional operations comprising both civilian and military personnel. The military force is substantial in size and fairly well-equipped by UN Peacekeeping standards. They are mandated to use force for purposes beyond just self-defence. Examples include [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] and [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]] in [[West Africa]] and [[Sierra Leone]] in 1999, as well as the [[NATO]] operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]—[[Implementation Force|IFOR]] and [[SFOR]].&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7"/&gt;

==== UN missions during and after the Cold War ====

During the [[Cold War]], peacekeeping was primarily interpositional in nature—thus being referred to as traditional peacekeeping. UN Peacekeepers were deployed in the aftermath of interstate conflict in order to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions and ensure compliance with the terms of an established peace agreement. Missions were consent-based, and more often than not observers were unarmed—such was the case with [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation|UNTSO]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[UN mediation of Kashmir|UNCIP]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Others were armed—such as [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF-I]], established during the [[Suez Crisis]]. They were largely successful in this role.

In the [[Post–Cold War era|post-Cold War]] era, the United Nations has taken on a more nuanced, multidimensional approach to Peacekeeping. In 1992, in the aftermath of the Cold War, then [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] put together a report detailing his ambitious concepts for the United Nations and Peacekeeping at large. The report, titled ''[[An Agenda for Peace]]'', described a multi-faceted and interconnected set of measures he hoped would lead to effective use of the UN in its role in post-Cold War international politics. This included the use of preventative diplomacy, peace-enforcement, peace-making, peace-keeping and post-conflict reconstruction.

==== Broader aims of UN missions ====

In ''The UN Record on Peacekeeping Operations'', [[Michael W. Doyle|Michael Doyle]] and Nicolas Sambanis summarise Boutros Boutros’ report as preventative diplomacy, confidence-building measures such as fact-finding missions, observer mandates, and the potential deployment of UN mandated forces as a preventative measure in order to diminish the potential for violence or the danger of violence occurring and thus increasing the prospect for lasting peace. Their definitions are as follows:
# ''Peace-enforcement'', meant to act with or without the consent of the belligerents in order to ensure any treaty or cease-fire mandated by the United Nations Security Council is maintained. This is done primarily under the auspices of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and the forces are generally heavily armed as opposed to the unarmed, or lightly-armed personnel frequently deployed as observers.
# ''Peace-making'', meant to compel belligerents to seek a peaceful settlement for their differences via mediation and other forms of negotiation provided by the UN under the auspices of Chapter VI of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].
# ''Peace-keeping'', deployment of a lightly-armed United Nations presence in the field with the consent of the belligerents involved in order to build confidence and monitor any agreements between concerned parties. Additionally, diplomats would continue to work toward comprehensive and lasting peace, or for the implementation of an agreed upon peace.
# ''Post-Conflict Reconstruction,'' intended to develop economic and social cooperation meant to mend relations between the belligerents. Social, political, and economic infrastructure would ideally prevent potential violence and conflict in the future and help to contribute to a lasting and robust peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|date=2007|title=The UN Record On Peacekeeping Operations|url=|journal=International Journal|volume=63|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-United Nations peacekeeping ===
{{See also|NATO peacekeeping}}
[[File:En-MFO1.JPG|thumb|right|Canadian [[UH-1N Twin Huey|CH135 Twin Hueys]] assigned to the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] non-UN peacekeeping force, at [[El Gorah]], [[Sinai]], [[Egypt]], 1989.]]
 
Not all international peacekeeping forces have been directly controlled by the United Nations. In 1981, an agreement between Israel and Egypt formed the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] which continues to monitor the [[Sinai Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="10TAGpgA-1"&gt;10 Tactical Air Group: ''Canadian Contingent Multinational Force and Observers Handbook'' (unclassified), page A-1. DND, Ottawa, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) is working on building an African Peace and Security Architecture that fulfils the mandate to enforce peace and security on the continent. In cases of [[genocide]] or other serious human-rights violations, an AU-mission could be launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned, as long as it is approved by the AU General Assembly. The establishment of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) which includes the African Standby Force (ASF) is planned earliest for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/african-peace-and-security-architecture-already-proving-useful-even-though-it-still-work |title=The African Peace and Security Architecture is already proving useful even though it is still work in progress |publisher=dandc.eu |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping (UCP) are civilian personnel that carry out non-violent, non-interventionist and impartial set of tactics in order to protect civilians in conflict zones from violence in addition to supporting additional efforts to build a lasting peace. While the term UCP is not entirely ubiquitous among non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in the field: many utilize similar techniques and desire shared outcomes for peace; such as accompaniment, presence, rumour control, community security meetings, the securing of safe passage, and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rachel|first=Julian|last2=Schweitzer|first2=Christine|date=2015|title=The Origins And Development of Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping|url=|journal=Peace Review|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
{{Main|History of United Nations peacekeeping}}

===Creation and early years===

United Nations Peacekeeping started in 1948 when the [[United Nations Security Council]] authorised the deployment of UN unarmed military observers to the Middle East in order to monitor the armistice agreement that was signed between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the wake of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]]. This operation was called the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) and is still in operation today.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/history.shtml|title=History of Peacekeeping|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passage of resolution 73 (1949) by the Security Council in August 1949, UNTSO was given the task of fulfilling four Armistice Agreements between the state of Israel and the Arab states which had participated in the war. Thus, UNTSO's operations were spread through five states in the region—Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/untso/background.shtml|title=UNTSO Background|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War peacekeeping===
In the wake of independence in India and Pakistan in August 1947 and the subsequent bloodshed that followed the Security Council adopted resolution 39 (1948) in January 1948 in order to create the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), with the purpose of mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and the fighting related to it. This operation was non-interventionist in nature and was additionally tasked with supervision of a ceasefire signed by Pakistan and India in the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]]. With the passage of the [[Karachi Agreement|Karachi agreement]] in July 1949, UNCIP would supervise a ceasefire line that would be mutually overseen by UN unarmed military observers and local commanders from each side in the dispute. UNCIP's mission in the region continues to this day, now under the operational title of the [[UN mediation of Kashmir|United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmogip/background.shtml|title=UNMOGIP Background|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, sixty-nine peacekeeping operations have been authorised and have deployed to various countries all over the world.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The great majority of these operations have begun in the post-Cold War world. Between 1988 and 1998 thirty-five UN operations had been established and deployed. This signified a substantial increase when compared with the periods between 1948 and 1978; which saw the creation and deployment of only thirteen UN Peacekeeping operations and zero between 1978 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed intervention first came in the form of UN involvement in the wake of the Suez Crisis in 1956. [[United Nations Emergency Force]] (UNEF-1), which existed from November 1956 to June 1967 was essentially the first ever United Nations peacekeeping force. It was given the mandate of ensuring the cessation of hostilities between [[Egypt]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Israel]] in addition to overseeing the withdrawal of French, Israeli and British troops from Egyptian territory. Upon completion of said withdrawal, UNEF would serve as a buffer force between Egyptian and Israeli forces in order to supervise conditions of the ceasefire and contribute to a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1mandate.html|title=UNEF Mandate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC), was deployed in 1960. This operation involved upwards of 20,000 military personnel at its peak, and resulted in the death of 250 UN personnel, including then Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld|Dag Hammarskjold]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/early.shtml|title=The Early Years of UN Peacekeeping|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONUC was meant to ensure the withdrawal of [[Belgium|Belgian]] forces in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], who had reinserted themselves after Congolese independence in the wake of a revolt carried out by the [[Force Publique]] (FP), in order to protect Belgian citizens and economic interests. ONUC was also tasked with establishing and maintaining law and order (helping to end the FP revolt and ethnic violence) as well as provide technical assistance and training to Congolese security forces. An additional function was added to ONUC's mission, in which the force was tasked with maintaining the territorial integrity and political independence of the Congo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/onuc.htm|title=ONUC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—resulting from the secession of the mineral-rich provinces of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and [[South Kasai]]. The UN forces there, somewhat controversially, more or less became an arm of the Congolese government at the time and helped to forcefully end the secession of both provinces.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the UN created multiple short-term missions all over the world including the Mission of the Representative of the Secretary-General in the Dominican Republic (DOMREP), the UN Security Force in West New Guinea (UNSF), the [[United Nations Yemen Observation Mission|UN Yemen Observation Mission]] (UNYOM), in conjunction with more long-term operations such as the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] (UNFICYP), the UN Emergency Force II (UNEF II), the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UN Interim Force]] in [[Lebanon]] (UNIFIL).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:UNpeacekeeping.svg|thumb|right|[[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions as of 2012]]

===Since 1991===
[[File:Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-un-holds-head.jpg|thumb|[[Norway|Norwegian]] Peacekeeper during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], 1992 - 1993, photo by [[Mikhail Evstafiev]].]]Experiences of peacekeeping during the [[Yugoslav Wars]], especially failures such as the [[Srebrenica Massacre]], led, in part, to the [[United Nations Peacebuilding Commission]], which works to implement stable peace through some of the same civic functions that peacekeepers also work on, such as elections. The Commission currently works with six countries, all in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/beyond-peace-deals-united-nations-experiment-peacebuilding |title=Beyond Peace Deals: The United Nations Experiment in "Peacebuilding"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[U.N. Security Council]] unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women's participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas.&lt;ref name="AWID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |title=UN Security Council Takes a Historic Stand Supporting Abortion Access for Women Raped in War / Library / Homepage |publisher=AWID |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101025/http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), a UN women's rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women's Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women's rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13885&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR -|website=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that [[non-state actor]]s, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

One of the findings of Page Fortna about where peacekeepers go is that “peacekeeping is a matter of supply and demand” From the supply side, she observes that there is unlikely a Peacekeeping mission in civil wars on countries close to one of the members of the Security Council. From the demand side, there is diverse evidence that peacekeeping missions are deployed in the countries who need it the most, this is where the risk of a recurring war is high.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7" /&gt;

== Composition of peacekeeping forces ==

===Nations that participate in peacekeeping missions===
[[File:Irish troops UNMIL.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Irish [[UNMIL]] troops on patrol in Liberia, July 2006.]]
The [[United Nations Charter]] stipulates that to assist in maintaining peace and security around the world, all member states of the UN should make available to the Security Council necessary armed forces and facilities. Since 1948, about 130 nations have contributed military and civilian police personnel to peace operations. While detailed records of all personnel who have served in peacekeeping missions since 1948 are not available, it is estimated that up to one million soldiers, police officers and civilians have served under the UN flag in the last 56 years. As of March 2008, 113 countries were contributing a total 88,862 military observers, police, and troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/contributors/2008/mar08_1.pdf|title=Contributors to United Nations peacekeeping operations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large number of contributors, the greatest burden continues to be borne by a core group of developing countries. The ten largest troop (including police and military experts) contributing countries to UN peacekeeping operations as of May, 2017 were [[Ethiopia]] (8229), [[India]] (7665), [[Pakistan]] (7135), [[Bangladesh]] (6958), [[Rwanda]] (6256), [[Nepal]] (5158), [[Burkina Faso]] (2969), [[Senegal]] (2847), [[Ghana]] (2751), [[Indonesia]] (2719).&lt;ref name="unpko-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml|title=Troop and police contributors|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2008, in addition to military and police personnel, 5,187 international civilian personnel, 2,031 UN Volunteers, and 12,036 local civilian personnel worked in UN peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/bnote.htm|title=Background Note - United Nations Peacekeeping Operations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 30 June 2014, 3,243 people from over 100 countries have been killed while serving on peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/fatalities/documents/stats_2.pdf|title=United Nations peacekeeping - Fatalities By Year up to 30 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those came from [[India]] (157), [[Nigeria]] (142), [[Pakistan]] (136), [[Ghana]] (132), [[Canada]] (121), [[France]] (110) and the [[United Kingdom]] (103). Thirty percent of the fatalities in the first 55 years of UN peacekeeping occurred between 1993 and 1995.

[[Developing nations]] tend to participate in peacekeeping more than developed countries.  This may be due in part because forces from smaller countries avoid evoking thoughts of imperialism. The rate of reimbursement by the UN for troop contributing countries per peacekeeper per month include: $1,028 for pay and allowances; $303 supplementary pay for specialists; $68 for personal clothing, gear and equipment; and $5 for personal weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/faq/q10.htm|title=United Nations Peacekeepers - How are peacekeepers compensated?|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a significant source of revenue for a developing country. By providing important training and equipment for the soldiers as well as salaries, UN peacekeeping missions allow them to maintain larger armies than they otherwise could. About 4.5% of the troops and civilian police deployed in UN peacekeeping missions come from the [[European Union]] and less than one percent from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/overview.shtml |title=Peacekeeping Fact Sheet |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's participation in peacekeeping===
Security Council Resolution 1325 was the first major step taken by the UN to include women as active and equal actors in “the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security”.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women (2013). "Landmark Resolution on Women Peace and Security", United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/wps/#resolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Security Council (October 31, 2000) "Resolution 1325", S/RES/1325, United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of this resolution is that UNSCR 1325 proposes the implementing gender mainstreaming, however the progress that has been accomplished in this area has focused on women, rather than on assessing the impacts of planned action on both men and women. In 2010, a comprehensive 10-year impact study was conducted to assess the success of this resolution and found that there was limited success with the implementation, particularly in the increasing women's participation in peace negotiations and peace agreements, and sexual and gender-based violence has continued to be prevalent, despite efforts to reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field Support (2010). "Ten-year Impact Study on Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security in Peacekeeping", United Nations, p. 9-10. https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/documents/10year_impact_study_1325.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghana IntPeaceCorps 2016-05-29 B002a.jpg|thumb|Ghanaian women serve in UN Peacekeeping]]
In 2013 the [[U.N. Security Council]] unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women's participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas.&lt;ref name="AWID"/&gt; Also in 2013, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), a UN women's rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women's Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women's rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction &lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt; The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that non-state actors, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

As of July 2016, women serve in every UN peacekeeping mission either as troops, police, or civilian staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/gender.shtml|title=Gender statistics. United Nations Peacekeeping|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, women made up 1% of deployed uniformed personnel. In 2014, out of approximately 125,000 peacekeepers, women constitute 3% of military personnel and 10% of police personnel in UN Peacekeeping missions, as well as 29% of international and 17% of national staff in peacekeeping and special political missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/women/womeninpk.shtml|title=Women in Peacekeeping.

== Theoretical basis for why peacekeeping missions should keep and preserve peace ==
While much has been written about Peacekeeping and what Peacekeepers do, very little empirical research has taken place in order to identify the manner in which Peacekeepers can have an impact in a post-conflict environment. [[Columbia University]] Professor, Virginia Page Fortna attempts to lay out four causal mechanisms through which peacekeepers have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices After Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortna's four mechanisms are as follows:
# Change the incentives of recent belligerents, making peace more desirable or war more costly.
# Reduce the uncertainty and fear that drives security dilemma spirals.
# Prevent or control accidents or the actions of rogue groups that might otherwise escalate back to war.
# Prevent political abuse by one side (generally the government) that might cause actors losing the peace to take up arms anew.
Fortna argues that peacekeepers have a positive impact on the peace process, despite often being sent to places where peace is most difficult to achieve. Peacekeeping is often looked at by detractors as ineffective, or unnecessary. Peace prevails when belligerents already have a vested interest in sustaining peace and therefore it could be argued that Peacekeepers play only a minor role in creating a strong foundation for enduring peace. Yet these causal reasons illustrate the important roles that Peacekeepers play in ensuring that peace lasts, especially when contrasted against situations in which belligerents are left to their own devices. These causal reasons thus illustrate the need for Peacekeeping and lay a foundation for the manner in which Peacekeeping operations can have a substantive impact on the post-conflict environment.

In order to change the incentives for war and make peace more appealing the UN can provide a military force by way of an enforcement mandate which provides deterrence to would-be spoilers. They can monitor the situation making the potential for surprise attack by one of the belligerents less likely to occur or by making it more difficult to carry out such an attack. A lightly-armed observer mission can also serve as an early-warning force or “tripwire” for the aforementioned enforcement mission. Aid and recognition provided to the belligerents by the international community should be made conditional and based on compliance with objectives laid out in the negotiating process. And lastly, peace dividends should be provided in the forms of jobs, public works and other benefits.

To reduce uncertainty and fear the UN Peacekeeping force can monitor the aforementioned compliance, facilitate communication between belligerents in order to ease security dilemma concerns thus reassuring belligerents that the other side will not renege, and allow for belligerents to signal their legitimate intentions for peace to the other side. That is to say, provide a meaningful pathway for communication between both sides to make their intentions known and credible.

Prevention and control of potential accidents that may derail the peace process can be achieved by the peacekeeping force by deterring rogue groups. Belligerent forces are often undisciplined without a strong central source of [[command and control]], therefore while a peace is being negotiated there is potential for a rogue group on one side to renege and spoil the peace process. UN forces can serve to prevent this. Additionally, the UN force can serve as a moderator and make communication easy between both parties and bring in political moderates from either side. By providing law and order UN peacekeeping forces can temporarily replace a state's security forces and prevent a bias overreaction to an alleged violation by one side which could in turn result in escalation and a renewal in the violence.

Prevention of political abuse can be achieved through the reformation of institutions associated with the government. Training and monitoring the security forces (e.g. army or police) help to make them an unbiased protector of the people rather than a weapon of suppression for the ruling government. Hopefully this training can bring trust by the people for the security establishment. UN forces can also run and monitor elections in order to ensure a fair process. In other cases, the UN may provide a neutral interim government to administer the country during a transitional period wherein the associated government institutions are being retrained, reformed or better developed. Lastly, military groups such as armed rebels can be encouraged to put down their weapons and transformed into political organisations using appropriate non-violent means to mete out their grievances and compete in the election cycle. This is especially important as many of these groups serve as the chief opposition to a given government, but lack the means or know-how to operate effectively as political organisations.

Different peacekeeping missions take place as a result of different causal mechanisms. More military deterrence and enforcement are meant for those missions operating under the auspices of Chapter VII, while Chapter VI missions are meant to serve more as monitoring forces and interpositional operations are meant to target and prevent potential political abuse—these are primarily multidimensional missions and are heavily involved in the post-conflict political situation.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?: Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness of peacekeeping missions ==

According to a 2014 survey of the academic literature, "there is considerable evidence that [United Nations peacekeeping operations] are effective in maintaining peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoeffler|first=Anke|date=2014-03-11|title=Can international interventions secure the peace?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2233865914525380|journal=[[International Area Studies Review]]|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=75–94|doi=10.1177/2233865914525380}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fortna, there is strong evidence that the presence of peacekeepers significantly reduces the risk of renewed warfare; more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer battlefield deaths; and more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2015/09/24/enough-with-the-pessimism-about-peacekeeping/|title=Enough with the Pessimism about Peacekeeping|date=2015-09-24|website=Political Violence at a Glance|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by political scientists at [[Uppsala University]] and [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] estimates that an ambitious UN peacekeeping policy with a doubled peacekeeping operation and strong mandates would "reduce the global incidence of armed conflict by two thirds relative to a no-PKO scenario."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hegre|first=Håvard|last2=Hultman|first2=Lisa|last3=Nygård|first3=Håvard Mokleiv|date=2018-11-28|title=Evaluating the Conflict-Reducing Effect of UN Peacekeeping Operations|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700203|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/700203|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fordham University political scientist Anjali Dayal, "Scholars have found that peacekeeping keeps wars from bleeding across borders. Having more peacekeepers on the ground also seems to correspond with fewer civilians targeted with violence. And peace operations at times have successfully served as transitional authorities, handing power back to local authorities, although this is decreasingly true."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/01/is-u-n-peacekeeping-under-fire-heres-what-you-need-to-know/|title=Is U.N. peacekeeping under fire? Here’s what you need to know.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that the promise to deploy peacekeepers can help international organizations bring combatants to the negotiation table and increase the likelihood that they will agree to a cease-fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which international organizations can settle civil wars?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=DOI 10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By controlling for specific factors that affect where peacekeepers are deployed and what the potential chances for peace are, Page Fortna's statistical research shows that there is a statistically significant impact on lasting peace when peacekeepers are deployed. Despite the fact that peacekeepers are sent to locations where peace is least likely to succeed, Fortna finds that conservative estimates suggest that the presence of UN peacekeepers diminishes the risk for renewed violence by at least 55%-60%; with less conservatives estimates upwards of 75%-85%.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 116"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, her analysis concludes that there is little difference in the effectiveness between Chapter VI consent-based missions and Chapter VII enforcement missions. Indeed, enforcement missions only remain effective if the UN peacekeeping force can prove and sustain their credibility in the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=109, 116, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stresses the importance of a UN mission maintaining the consent of the peacekept. Ultimately, Fortna finds that peacekeeping is an effective tool for ensuring a lasting peace; especially compared to situations in which belligerents' are left to their own devices. Utilising the previously mentioned causal mechanisms for peacekeeping, a UN peacekeeping force can have a substantial and substantive impact on sustaining a lasting peace. Having a relative consensus of the positive impact of peacekeeping for ensuring a lasting peace, Fortna and Howard suggest that  the literature is moving towards the study of  i) the effectiveness of the types of peace-keepers, ii) the transitional administrations, iii) the links between peacekeeping and democratisation, and iv) the perspectives of the “peacekept".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|title=Pitfalls and Prospects in the Peacekeeping Literature*|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|last2=Howard|first2=Lise Morjé|date=2008-05-20|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle and Sambanis' analysis finds that lasting peace is more likely after non-ethnic wars in countries with a relatively high level of development in addition to whether or not UN peacekeeping forces and financial assistance are available. They conclude that in the short run lasting peace is more dependent on a robust UN deployment coupled with low levels of hostility between belligerents. They note that increased economic capacity can provide an incentive not to renew hostilities. In the long run, however, economic capacity matters far more whereas the degree of hostility between belligerents is less important. As successful as UN deployments can be, they have inadequately spurred independent economic development within the countries where they have intervened. Thus, the UN plays a strong, but indirect role and success in lasting peace is predicated on the development of institutions that support peace, rather than serving as a deterrent for renewed war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making War and Building Peace : United Nations Peace Operations|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly analyses show varying success rates for peacekeeping missions, with estimate ranging from 31 percent to 85 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Autesserre|first1=Severine|title=Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors that Impact Lasting Peace ===
There are many factors that can have a negative impact on lasting peace such as hidden information about the relative strength possessed by the belligerents; a rebel group's involvement in illicit financing through means such as through the export of diamonds and other minerals; participation in the trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings; whether or not military victory was achieved by one side; the length of the war as well as how costly it was; commitment problems and security dilemma spirals experienced by both sides; whether a cease-fire or treaty signed by the belligerents; lack of transparency in the motives and actions carried out by belligerents in the immediate aftermath of the conflict; extremist spoilers; participants in the conflict that may benefit from its continuation; indivisibility and more.

Perhaps one of the most statistically significant contributors to a lasting peace is whether or not military victory was achieved by one side. According to Fortna's research, civil wars in which one side wins, resulting in a cease-fire or truce, have an approximately 85%-90% lower chance of renewed war. Moreover, peace treaties further reduce the risk by 60%-70%.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 116"/&gt;

If a group is funded by drugs, diamonds or other illicit trade then there is a substantial increase in the chance of renewed violence—100%-250%-- which is to say that in such circumstances war is two to three-and-a-half times more likely to begin again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choice after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Fortna finds that wars which involve many factions are less likely to resume,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Doyle and Sambanis find the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making War and Building Peace : United Nations Peace Operations|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costly wars and wars fought along identity lines both provide varied chances of the renewal of violence. While longer wars and peace established by treaty (especially those attained by military victory) can reduce the chances of another war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?

== Impacts of peacekeeping on participating forces ==

===Military normalisation===
Some commentators have highlighted the potential to leverage peacekeeping operations as a mechanism for advancing military normalisation. Michael Edward Walsh and Jeremy Taylor have argued that [[Japan]]'s peacekeeping operations in [[South Sudan]] provide those promoting Japan's military normalisation with "a unique opportunity to further erode the country’s pacifist constitution."&lt;ref name="nbr.org"&gt;Jeremy Taylor and Michael Edward Walsh (7 January 2014), ''[http://www.nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/psa/taylor-walsh_commentary_010714.pdf UN Operations in Africa Provide a Mechanism for Japan’s Military Normalization Agenda]'', retrieved 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "Unable to accept the full weight of modern peacekeeping operations without fundamental political, legal, and social changes," they conclude that "Japan’s peacekeepers remain ill-prepared to tackle many serious contingencies requiring use of deadly force."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edward Walsh and Jeremy Taylor (23 December 2013), ''[http://africanarguments.org/2013/12/23/time-to-reconsider-the-japanese-peacekeeping-mission-in-south-sudan-by-michael-edward-walsh-jeremy-taylor/ Time to Reconsider the Japanese Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan]'', retrieved 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, they suggest that Japan's continued participation in UN peacekeeping operations might force policy changes that ultimately push the country toward "a tipping point from which the normalisation of Japan’s military (will be) the only outcome."&lt;ref name="nbr.org"/&gt;

===Political impact on sending countries===
[[Diana Muir|Diana Muir Appelbaum]], has expressed concern that the creation of a military in [[Fiji]] for the purpose of serving in international peacekeeping missions, has produced a military powerful enough to stage four coups d’état (1987, 1999–2000, 2006, and 2009) and to rule Fiji as a military dictatorship for over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Diana Muir (27 August 2012), ''[http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/4867/features/how-the-sinai-peacekeeping-force-staged-a-military-coup-in-fiji/ How the Sinai Peacekeeping Force Staged a Military Coup in Fiji]'', retrieved 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2018 study published in the Journal of Peace Research, found that countries where militaries are highly dependent on the funds they receive from UN peacekeeping were less likely to experience coups d’états than comparable countries less dependent on such funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|date=2018|title=Backdoor peacekeeping: Does participation in UN peacekeeping reduce coups at home?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343317747668|journal=Journal of Peace Research|doi=10.1177/0022343317747668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts on individual peacekeepers ===
[[File:UNAMIR Blue Berets memorial Kigali (4).jpg|thumb|Memorial in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]] to ten Belgian peacekeepers of [[UNAMIR]] who were massacred by Hutu paramilitaries in 1994]]
Studies of peacekeeping soldiers show both positive and negative effects. A study of 951 US Army soldiers assigned to Bosnia revealed that 77% reported some positive consequences, 63% reported a negative consequence, and 47% reported both.&lt;ref&gt;Newby, John H., et al. "Positive and negative consequences of a military deployment." ''Military Medicine'' (2005) 170#10 pp: 815-819&lt;/ref&gt;  The peacekeepers are exposed to danger caused by the warring parties and often in an unfamiliar climate. This gives rise to different mental health problems, suicide, and substance abuse as shown by the percentage of former peacekeepers with those problems. Having a parent in a mission abroad for an extended period is also stressful to the peacekeepers' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fernandes Souza | first1 = Wanderson | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder in peacekeepers: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 199 | issue = 5| pages = 309–312 | doi=10.1097/nmd.0b013e3182175180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint raises the problem that the peacekeeping may soften the troops and erode their combat ability, as the mission profile of a peacekeeping contingent is totally different from the profile of a unit fighting an all-out war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926001502/http://www.usafa.af.mil/jscope/ISME2007/Papers/Prof%20Paulin%20Kaurin%20War%20Stories.doc Kaurin, P.

==Criticism==

===Peacekeeping, human trafficking, and forced prostitution===
{{Main|Peacekeeping child sexual abuse scandal}}
Since the 1990s, UN Peacekeepers have been the subject of numerous accusations of abuse ranging from [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], to [[pedophilia]] and [[human trafficking]]. Complaints have arisen from [[Cambodia]], [[East Timor]] and [[West Africa]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] prostitution associated with trafficked women skyrocketed and often operated just beyond the gates of U.N. compounds. David Lamb, a regional human rights officer in Bosnia from 2000 to 2001 claimed “The sex slave trade in Bosnia largely exists because of the U.N. peacekeeping operation. Without the peacekeeping presence, there would have been little or no forced prostitution in Bosnia.” In addition, hearing held by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2002 found that members of SFOR were frequenting Bosnian brothels and engaging in sex with trafficked women and underage girls.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allred|first=KJ|date=2006|title=Peacekeepers And Prostitutes: How Deployed Forces Fuel the Demand for Trafficked Women and New Hope for Stopping It|url=|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|volume=33|issue=1|page=7|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in [[Cambodia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and [[Kosovo]] after UN and, in the case of the latter two, NATO peacekeeping forces moved in. In the 1996 UN study called "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children", former first lady of Mozambique [[Graça Machel]] documented: "In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in [[child prostitution]]".&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf|title=The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gita Sahgal]] spoke out in 2004 with regard to the fact that prostitution and [[sex abuse]] crops up wherever [[humanitarian intervention]] efforts are set up. She observed that the "issue with the UN is that [[peacekeeping operation]]s unfortunately seem to be doing the same thing that other militaries do. Even the guardians have to be guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1126/p06s02-wogi.html Sex charges haunt UN forces; In places like Congo and Kosovo, peacekeepers have been accused of abusing the people they're protecting," ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 26 November 2004, accessed 16 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein]], then Permanent Representative of [[Jordan]] to the United Nations, in 2006 resulted in a comprehensive report which detailed some of this abuse in detail— particularly that which occurred in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Sexual exploitation frequently came in the form of prostitution, wherein some money (an average of $1-$3 per encounter) was exchanged for sex. In other instances food, or jobs were utilized to ply women for sex. Other young women reported of “rape disguised as prostitution”, whereabouts Peacekeepers would rape them and were then given some money or food in order to make the act seem consensual.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hussein, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid. (2005) "A Comprehensive Strategy to Eliminate Future Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations." Report to the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Between May and September 2004, there were seventy-two allegations of sexual exploitation—68 against military and 4 against civilian personnel. By the end of 2004 there would be a total of 105 allegations. The majority of these allegations were in regards to sex with person under the age of 18 years (45 percent) and sex with adult prostitutes (31 percent). Rape and sexual assault made up approximately 13 and 5 percent respectively, with the remaining 6 percent of allegations relating to other forms of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hussein, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid.

[[Uruguay]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;an President [[Jose Mujica]] apologized to Haitian President [[Michel Martelly]] over the alleged rape of an 18-year-old Haitian man by Uruguayan UN peacekeeping troops. Martelly said "a collective rape carried out against a young Haitian" would not go unpunished. Four soldiers suspected of being involved in the rape have been detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/07/us-haiti-uruguay-un-idUSTRE78603I20110907|title=Uruguay apologises over alleged rape by U.N. peacekeepers|work=Reuters|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=236953|title=Uruguay to apologise over alleged rape by UN peacekeepers|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 the United Nations [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO) confined an entire contingent of 734 Moroccans in the [[Ivory Coast]] in the wake of allegations that some had sexually abused underage girls. In the following years, there were 80 investigations carried out by the UN [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services|Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simic|first=Olivera|date=2012|title=UN Peacekeeping Operations: The Emerging Problem Of Sexual Exploitation|url=|journal=Regulation of Sexual Conduct in UN Peacekeeping Operations|pages=13–38|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, allegations were levelled on personnel from [[France]], [[Gabon]], and [[Burundi]] operating in the [[Central African Republic]].

[[Tanzania]] and the UN opened a joint inquiry into the alleged abuse, which involved Tanzanian troops. There have been 18 reports of sexual abuse, eight of which involved minors. Sixteen Tanzanian soldiers, a [[Malawi]]an and a South African are implicated in the accusations. The UN reported in March 2016 that there was a large increase in allegations; which involved troops from twenty one countries.

[[Cholera]] is a waterborne disease that causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and it can kill in a matter of hours if patients do not receive rehydration intervention. As of July 2012, Haiti's cholera epidemic was the worst in the world:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/haiti_cholera.htm Haiti Cholera: One Year Later, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] 25 October 2011, accessed 30 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; about 7,500 had died and about 585,000 Haitians (about 1 in every 20 Haitians) had become ill with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspp.gouv.ht/site/downloads/Rapport%20journalier%20MSPP%20du%2022%20juillet%202012.pdf|title=Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population Cholera Report of July 22, 2012, 22 July 2011, accessed 30 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN-appointed Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti, the conditions at the Peacekeeping base were unsafe, and allowed contamination of Haiti's river systems in at least two ways: "The construction of the water pipes in the main toilet/showering area [was] haphazard, with significant potential for cross-contamination...especially from pipes that run over an open drainage ditch that runs throughout the camp and flows directly into the Meye Tributary System".&lt;ref name="UNCholeraReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf|title=Final Report of the Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti, pages 21-22, July 2011, accessed 30 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Independent Panel reported that on a regular basis black water waste from the Mirebalais base and two other bases was deposited in an open, unfenced septic pit that was susceptible to flooding and would overflow into the Meye Tributary during rainfall.&lt;ref name="UNCholeraReport" /&gt;

In November 2011, over 5,000 victims of the cholera epidemic filed a claim with the UN's internal claims mechanism seeking redress in the form of clean water and sanitation infrastructure necessary to control the epidemic, compensation for individual losses, and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15648110|title=Haiti cholera demand against UN|date=9 November 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, 104 Members of the [[U.S. Congress|United States Congress]] signed a letter affirming that the "actions of the UN" had brought cholera to Haiti and that the UN should "confront and ultimately eliminate cholera".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18928405|title=Haiti cholera 'UN responsibility'|first=Mark|last=Doyle|date=20 July 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the UN rejected the claim and the victims' lawyers have pledged to sue the UN in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/cholera-litigation/ |title=Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti: Cholera Litigation |publisher=Ijdh.org |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural Concerns Related to Contemporary Peacekeeping ===
There is a notable intermingling of varied cultures when it comes to peacekeeping. From the vast number of troops, police and personnel that are brought together from various contributing countries to the oftentimes challenging ethnic regions which peacekeeping forces are often deployed. Because of these varied cultures, complicated cultural interactions take place which not only affect mission effectiveness, but can also lead to friction with the population the peacekeepers are meant to be assisting.

In most cases prior to 1988, specific countries often provided peacekeepers. At that point, only twenty six countries had sent personnel to participate in peacekeeping deployments. Today, that number has risen to more than eighty.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|pages=146–147|doi=10.1080/13533310008413823|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an extremely heterogeneous group. Thus, UN Peacekeeping deployments must not only contend with language complications, but also myriad cultural and social differences that can create operational difficulties that are hard to overcome. These difference can create problems with regard to interactions (whether personal or between institutions/units), misunderstandings, inadvertent offensive behaviour and prejudices that may be associated with a particular contingent from a given country.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

In terms of operations, effectiveness can be hindered by the varying tactics, techniques and procedures employed by the military or police personnel that are a part of a given deployment. Because UN forces are cobbled together from so many different sources, there is a discrepancy in capabilities, training, equipment, standards and procedures. Moreover, substantial differences exist in the form of command and control between contributing members personnel. In addition, some nations may not wish to be subordinated to another, complicating [[unity of command]]. This can lead to deep-seated divisions between contingents  within the UN force that results in a lack of mutual support between units in the field. This can be demonstrated in the experiences of UN peacekeeping forces deployed to [[East Timor]], where the [[Australia]]ns engaged in a robust operation that maximised force protection in contrast to a pro-active heart and minds approach utilised by Great Britain's [[Gurkha|Ghurka]] personnel.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Maintaining the consent of the peacekept is an important facet of modern peacekeeping. Notably in Bosnia, [[Somalia]] and Rwanda, fundamental principles of retaining that consent was ignored on the grounds of a humanitarian intervention—reflecting the nature of an Article VII intervention. Yet in order to stress and maintain the legitimacy of an intervention it is important that the UN's forces continue to enjoy the consent of the population and government of the country to which they were deployed. This means making the peacekept feel a part of the process in addition to important cultural knowledge of the area in which peacekeepers are operating, in order to reduce friction and provide for a successful operation.

There has been little study on the interaction of cultures that exist within a peacekeeping force and the population within which they operate. However, in 1976 Galtun and Hveem studied [[Norway|Norwegian]] personnel who participated in UNEF-1 (in Gaza) and ONUC (Congo). They posited that knowledge of the culture and an understanding of the inhabitants in a given country were not only necessary, but crucial for the success of the mission. They found that personnel from the Norwegian contingent wanted greater insight into the conflict and the culture in which they operated. They also wanted more robust training with regard to working with people from other countries. Yet the study revealed the troops received very little from briefings and that the majority of the information regarding the conflict was gained through the news, reading books or speaking with other UN personnel—rather than any established UN training program.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|pages=150–151|doi=10.1080/13533310008413823|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a study conducted on the relations between members of UNIFIL and local population in Lebanon, carried out by Heiberg and Holst, all but confirmed the findings. In their example, they found that the countries that were able to integrate more fully with the population and show a depth of knowledge about the local culture were more successful, while those that were ambitious, but less integrated into the local scene found themselves far removed from the individuals with which they were supposed to be engaged with, and their success, or lack thereof, illustrated this.&lt;blockquote&gt;Only the Italian contingent of some 2,200 people operated as part of the local environment and became an active element in restoring normal living conditions. Its soldiers were provided with the training required to acquaint them with the cultural, political and social situation of the people among whom they worked. Operating in a sector that contained approximately 600,000 inhabitants, mostly Shi'ites, the Italians carefully nurtured contact with the ordinary citizens and the political leaders in their area... While the Americans thought they were becoming involved in Lebanese politics, they entered into Lebanese culture and history with little or no understanding of the way things worked-- or didn't work... Most Americans did not understand the subtleties of short-term alliances, the length of memories and blood feuds, the strength of ''aln'' [kin] in Arab culture nor the nuances of religious differences.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This illustrates the importance of understanding the significance that culture plays in the conduct of successful peacekeeping operations. However, despite the existence of a UN training manual that attempts to advise peacekeepers on necessary techniques, there is no unifying doctrine, or standardised procedure among peacekeeping contingents, which will ultimately hinder the potential for success.

=== Limitations on Contemporary Intervention and Conflict Resolution ===
Throughout the duration of the Cold War external intervention and mediation in civil conflicts took on a state-centric mechanism in which sovereignty was inviolable. Rarely did the international community intervene in internal conflicts involving a state's government and domestic belligerents that opposed it. Since the end of the Cold War, however, that has changed. Today, mediation by international actors in civil conflict rest on a standardised resolution mechanism that accords broadly equal standing to all factions within a conflict, and attempts to reach a settlement accepted by all.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|date=1998|title=Rwanda: The Perils of Peace|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|publisher=|volume=35|issue=2|pages=193–210|doi=10.1177/0022343398035002003|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Cold War presented an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the [[United States]] and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put a premium on [[Human rights|basic human rights]] and [[democratization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty was not to be violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as [[Third World|third world]] governments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Now, however, with legitimacy being extended to non-state actors, as well as the opportunity for a minority to secede from a given state and form a new country there has been a dramatic shift in the international status quo. Moreover, the international community's model for conflict resolution is heavily influenced by academic thought developed in western countries. This model encourages intervening in civil wars in order to stop political violence and come to a negotiated settlement which often involves democratising efforts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Critics such as Christopher Clapham and [[David Shearer]], argue that this intervention can provide mechanisms for continued conflict to the detriment of the civilian population. Clapham's argument is principally in relation to the situation in [[Rwanda]] leading up to the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; whereas Shearer focuses on the negative aspects of intervention, primarily regarding [[Sierra Leone]], which prevents total victory by one side and results in the creation of asymmetries between belligerents which opens the door for continued bloodshed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shearer|first=David|date=1997|title=Exploring the Limits of Consent: Conflict Resolution in Sierra Leone|url=|journal=Millennium- Journal of International Studies|volume=26|issue=3|pages=845–860|doi=10.1177/03058298970260030601|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rwanda, third-party attempts at a negotiated settlement between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] afforded an opportunity for Hutu extremists to prepare for the killing of Hutu moderates and the genocide of the Tutsi. The international community, led by regional states from the [[Organisation of African Unity]], sought to negotiate a settlement and find a solution for the ongoing ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi via the Arusha Peace Process. This process lasted just over a year, included substantial international involvement, and incorporated many regional actors such as [[Tanzania]] (host of the process), [[Burundi]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zaire]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) was a major beneficiary of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha accords]] and was able to redress many of its grievances, many of the gains that it made could have been achieved through military action. Arusha, according to Clapham, affected the relative power of the participants in the two following ways: a ceasefire which froze the distribution of territorial control at a particular point and secondly the importance it ascribed to the participants of the negotiations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Meaning that it froze the conflict and prevented continued territorial gains being made by the RPF, in addition to designating the degree of importance with regard to the factions within the negotiations. A faction's importance was weighted not on their relative popularity or military strength, but on artificial weight assigned by the mediators. Thus, the entire process served to undermine the RPF's position while stalling their hitherto successful military campaign, while allowing Hutu extremists to prepare for a genocide.

Shearer argues that modern strategies that rely solely on consent-based negotiations are severely limited and that victory by military means should not be ignored. He states that a shift in battlefield fortunes can often bring one belligerent to the negotiation table and will likewise moderate their demands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Consent is of great importance when it comes to negotiation and mediation. The current international system and the conflict resolution model which the international community has utilised most since the end of the Cold War puts a premium on consent. But Shearer asks that if a belligerent uses negotiations and cease-fires as a method of delay in order to allow them to reposition military forces and continue fighting, then should consent-based strategies still be pursued, regardless of the potential for lengthening a conflict and the associated human cost?&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the empirical analysis cited by Shearer, past civil wars with negotiated settlements have had little success. He cites a study from John Stedman that notes between 1900 and 1980 85% of civil wars were solved by one side winning outright (this excludes colonial wars). 15% percent ended as a result of negotiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, Roy Licklider's study supports these conclusions by noting the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"From 1945 to 1989, 58 out of a total of 93 civil conflicts, as he categorised them, were settled in some form, while the remainder continued. However, only 14 (or 24 percent) of those settled were solved by negotiation. The others (76 percent) ended with military victories. Additionally, fighting resumed in seven of the 14 conflict which were initially ended by negotiation. The overall success rate of negotiated settlements, therefore, was around 12 percent out of the internal wars that ended."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Sierra Leone the [[Revolutionary United Front]], led by [[Foday Sankoh]], fought an ongoing and bloody civil war with the government from 1991 to 1996. The conflict attracted little international attention, but managed to devastate the country and destroy its economy. Neither belligerent was willing to concede or compromise on their demands, despite multiple attempts at a negotiated settlement. It was not until the intervention of the [[Private military company|private military corporation]] [[Executive Outcomes]] and a reversal in the RUF's battlefield fortunes that Sankoh would come to the table.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the aftermath the RUF was a depleted threat, civilians were able to return from refugee camps and begin rebuilding their lives. But the peace was fragile and negotiations were ongoing. The RUF was reluctant to put down their arms, concerned over potential retribution at the hands of army units and civilian militias alike. There was a planned deployment of UN peacekeepers meant to ease these concerns and help with the transition to peace, but things began to unravel. International contributors began to shy away from further peacekeeping initiatives; such as an expensive and open-ended mission in a strategically unimportant country. As a result, the UN's intervention force was slow to come to fruition and then came to a halt completely when Sankoh argued the size of the contingent of 740 UN peacekeepers was too large.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The UN refused to engage without total consent from both parties, thus preventing the deployment of a peacekeeping force. This consent-based approach, Shearer argues, illustrates the limits the UN can play in the volatile and fragile state of affairs that exist during and after civil wars. "In Sierra Leone, it meant that an important component needed to shore up the peace-building process was absent. It also meant that Sankoh was dictating terms."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This consent-based approach effectively allowed the leadership of a brutal rebel group to hinder the potential for peace.

The situation was exacerbated by the fact that the newly elected [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|President]] of Sierra Leone terminated the Executive Outcomes contract undermining his [[hard power]] advantage. Things were further inflamed when disaffected officers of the [[Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces|army]] overthrew the government in 1997.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The war quickly renewed. A small UN force of monitors was deployed to observe the security situation. [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNOMSIL]], as it was called, was deployed between July 1998 and October 1999, but was forced to withdraw from the country when the RUF took the country's [[Freetown|capitol]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]] was eventually formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, it was meant to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community to cut and run, as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War|campaign]] was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL's mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF's military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the [[Abuja Agreement (disambiguation)|Abuja agreements]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unamsil/|title=UNAMSIL: United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN's mission can be deemed a success, the way in which the situation developed illustrates Shearer's point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents' interest may not necessarily lead to success. As we see, fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. It was not until the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF's capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, did the RUF finally come to the negotiating table and allow for the establishment of peace.

Some authors question the idea of international interventions at all. In a 2005 working paper for the Center for Global Development, [[Jeremy Weinstein]] of [[Stanford University]] provides a theory of “autonomous recovery,” in which states can achieve sustainable peace without international intervention. Using case studies of [[Uganda]], [[Eritrea]], and [[Somalia]], Weinstein demonstrates how states can develop effective institutions out of warfare. This method has cost and benefits that must be weighed against the potential outcome of international intervention. External intervention can stop mass atrocities, but also stop institutional change. Autonomous recovery elevates the strongest leader, but also rewards the strongest fighters who may be less inclined to share power. Furthermore, intervention depends on external influence while autonomous recovery is based on internal factors. The conclusions of his argument could suggest intervention is not ideal policy, but Weinstein argues the international community's “[[responsibility to protect]]” doctrine has moral importance for intervention and the conditions for “autonomous recovery” are very rare. Weinstein argues the fundamental challenge is how to incentivise good governance and assistance to rebel groups without disrupting the connection of citizens to rulers in terms of revenue collection that enables accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Jeremy M. 2005.

=== Mission Creep ===
Although acknowledging a number of practical and moral reasons for peacekeeping operations, James Fearon and David Laitin assert that they have a tendency under some circumstances to become tangled with [[state-building]] efforts.  In weak states facing successful guerrilla campaigns, peacekeepers face pressures to build state institutional and administrative capacity in order to achieve lasting peace.  These pressures can lead to mission creep beyond the original purview of the peacekeeping operation; without engaging in state-building, the peacekeepers risk allowing the peacekept country to revert to violence following their exit.  Thus, Fearon and Laitin advocate for the greater integration of state-building in peacekeeping efforts through a new framework of "neotrusteeship," which would see foreign powers exercising a great deal of control over a weak state's domestic affairs in order to ensure the prevention of future violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James D|last2=Laitin|first2=David D|date=2004|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=|journal=International Security|volume=28|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of Engagement with the Populace===
A growing critique of peacekeeping is the lack of engagement between the peacekeeping officials and the local populace. As [[Séverine Autesserre]] outlines in a 2015 Foreign Policy article,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/06/trouble-in-peaceland-united-nations-congo-development/|title=Trouble in Peaceland|last=Autesserre|first=Severine|date=|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this creates an environment where the peacekeeping officials develop plans to ‘keep’ the peace, but they are disconnected from reality, having the opposite effect on the ground. Additionally, it creates a reinforcement mechanism for the peacekeeping officials, because the officials on the ground report that their plan was successfully implemented, but, in reality, it had adverse effects. If the situation on the ground turns into another outbreak of violence, the local populace will be blamed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

This criticism is similar to the critic levelled at development in developing countries by authors such as James C. Scott,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed|last=Scott|first=James C.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Ferguson, and L. Lohman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson1 LLohmann2|first=James1 L2|date=1994|title="The anti-politics machine: ’development’ and bureaucratic power in Lesotho."|url=|journal=the Ecologist|volume=24|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although peacekeeping and development are two different things, the logic behind the criticism is the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This is not out of maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Proposed reform==

===Brahimi analysis===
In response to criticism, particularly of the cases of sexual abuse by peacekeepers, the UN has taken steps toward reforming its operations. The [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping|Brahimi Report]] was the first of many steps to recap former peacekeeping missions, isolate flaws, and take steps to patch these mistakes to ensure the efficiency of future peacekeeping missions. The UN has vowed to continue to put these practices into effect when performing peacekeeping operations in the future. The technocratic aspects of the reform process have been continued and revitalised by the DPKO in its "Peace Operations 2010" reform agenda. This included an increase in personnel, the harmonisation of the conditions of service of field and headquarters staff, the development of guidelines and standard operating procedures, and improving the partnership arrangement between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[African Union]], and [[European Union]]. A 2008 capstone doctrine entitled "United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbpu.unlb.org/pbps/Library/Capstone_Doctrine_ENG.pdf|title=Peacekeeping Resource Hub|website=pbpu.unlb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates and builds on the Brahimi analysis.

One of the main issues that the Brahimi report identifies is the lack of coordination and planning of the Peacekeeping Operations. Also, the difference between the objectives of the Peacekeeping Operations and the resources destined to fund the missions. Therefore, the report asks the Security Council to make clear the goals and the resources to accomplish them.  According to Fearon and Laitin, the Brahimi Report provides a political instrument for the secretary-general to negotiate with the Security Council the goals, the troops, and the resources need it to the operations. This instrument tries to avoid the cases of underfunding presented in Missions such as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fearon | first1 = James D | last2 = Laitin | first2 = David D | year = 2004 | title = Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 5–43 | doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Gray analyses the issues of implementing the recommendations of the Brahimi Report. She explains the difficulty in implementing these recommendations. In particular, in reducing the gap between the mandates of Security Council and the actual resources devoted to implementing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Christine | year = 2001 | title = Peacekeeping After the ''Brahimi Report'': Is There a Crisis of Credibility for the UN?. | url = | journal = J Conflict Security Law | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 267–288 | doi=10.1093/jcsl/6.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rodomontade''' ''\rod-uh-muhn-TADE; roh-duh-muhn-TAHD\'' is a [[mass noun]] meaning boastful talk or behavior.  The term is a reference to [[Rodomonte]], a character in Italian Renaissance epic poems ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' and its sequel ''[[Orlando furioso]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-rod1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Rodomontade|website=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use==
*A 17th-century example of the term exists in ''Don Tomazo'' by [[Thomas Dangerfield]], albeit with a slight alteration of spelling. As the titular protagonist heads towards Cairo with a number of stolen treasures, he is informed by an acquaintance that:
::''. . . he could, in that heathenish city, command a thousand pound – which was at that time no rodomontado, in regard the jewels were worth above four times the value.'' &lt;ref&gt;Don Tomazo, ''An Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Fiction'', ed. Paul Salzman (Aylesbury: Oxford University Press, 1991), p381.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The German composer [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] composed a [[Suite (music)|Suite]] in h minor for violin solo, strings and continuo (TWV 55: h4), which ends with a piece named "Rodomontade".&lt;ref&gt;Booklet to the CD: Georg Philipp Telemann, ''Overtures-Sonatas-Concertos (Concertos and Chambermusic Vol. 2)'', Musica Alta Ripa, MDG 309 1250-2, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A 19th-century example of the use of the term can be found in ''The Adventures of [[Benjamin Bonneville|Captain Bonneville]]'' by [[Washington Irving]].  Irving used it to describe the behavior of "free trappers", [[Trapping|fur trappers]] who worked [[Freelancer|freelance]] and adopted the manner, habits, and dress of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]].  When free trappers visited Bonneville's camp, he welcomed them and ordered [[grog]] for everyone:
::''They [the free trappers] pronounced the captain the finest fellow in the world, and his men all ''bon garçons'', jovial lads, and swore they would pass the day with them.  They did so, and a day it was, of boast, and swagger, and ''rodomontade''.''

*Another 19th-century example can be found in Thomas Carlyle's 1829 essay ''Signs of the Times'':
::''We have more Mathematics than ever; but less Mathesis. Archimedes and Plato could not have read the Mécanique Céleste; but neither would the whole French Institute see aught in that saying, "God geometrises!" but a sentimental rodomontade.''

* Rex Stout uses it in the second Nero Wolfe novel, "The League of Frightened Men" (1935), when Wolfe says, "If Mr. Chapin had ... restrained his impulse to rodomontade ..."
*The word, with its alternative spelling (rhodomontade) is quoted in [[John Lukacs]]' book ''Five Days in London May 1940''.  While describing the tempestuous days of Churchill's first weeks in office, Lukacs quotes [[Alexander Cadogan]], a bureaucrat with the Foreign Office, counselling Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] who was complaining that he could no longer work with Churchill. Cadogan said:
::''Nonsense: his rhodomontades probably bore you as much as they do me, but don't do anything silly under the stress of that.''

*[[Hannah Arendt]] describes [[Adolf Eichmann|Adolf Eichmann's]] boasting as "sheer rodomontade" in ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'':
::"Bragging was the vice that was Eichmann's undoing.  It was sheer rodomontade when he told his men during the last days of the war: 'I will jump into my grave laughing, because of the fact that I have the death of five million Jews...on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction.' ... [For Eichmann to] claim the death of five million Jews, the approximate total of losses suffered from the combined efforts of all Nazi offices and authorities, was preposterous...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arendt |first=Hannah |authorlink=Hannah Arendt |title=[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]] |year=1963 |publisher=Viking Press |location=New York |pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The term was used in [[Desert Island Discs]] by the singer [[Morrissey]] when describing his own music.

*[[Anthony Parsons|Sir Anthony Parsons]] as [[Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations|UK Ambassador]] to the [[United Nations]] used the word during a speech on 22 May 1982 during a debate of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. He was describing the speeches of several other members including the [[USSR]], [[Cuba]] and [[Panama]] during that days debate on the [[Falklands War]]. He started the speech by saying:
::"Obviously we expected other delegations to give bent to atrociously offensive, confused and ill-directed rodomontades against my country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=22 May 1982 |title=May 22, 1982 ABC News Weekend Report Falkland Islands War|type=Television production |language=English |year=1982 |time=9:35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[William F. Buckley]] used the word in a May 29, 1995, column in the ''[[National Review]]'' entitled "What does [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] have in mind? – Pres. Clinton's attack on conservative radio broadcasts"; Buckley, asking rhetorically whom Clinton was attacking, cited one theory:
::''The best those commentators could do who appeared on the [[The MacNeil/Lehrer Report|MacNeil – Lehrer program]] was to quote an imprudent remark by [[G. Gordon Liddy|Gordon Liddy]], but what he said &amp;ndash; that if any official came to his house to requisition his pistol, he'd better shoot straight &amp;ndash; was more ''rodomontade'' than a call to arms or hatred.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n10_v47/ai_16936619 What does Clinton have in mind?], a 1995 ''[[National Review]]'' column using the term, via FindArticles.com&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] uses the word to describe a letter written by the eponymous hero of 'The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.'.
* The term was used by W. Somerset Maugham in 'Of Human Bondage' in Athelny's conversation, over tea, with his daughter's suitor.
::'He (Athelny) addressed himself directly to his guest with a torrent of rhodomontade'. 
::
::Jane Austen in Northanger Abbey: 'mislead by the rodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit... (chapter 30)

* [[Vladimir Nabokov]] criticized [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] for his "gothic rodomontade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/the-translation-wars|title=The Translation Wars|first=David|last=Remnick|date=31 October 2005|publisher=|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Churchill: '..., but also revealed a plain soldier's distaste for the publicity rodomontade which always attended Churchill, and maybe a touch of perverse jealousy too' (chapter 3, 1899–1935).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25476">'''Secondary consciousness''' is an individual's accessibility to their history and plans. The ability allows its possessors to go beyond the limits of the remembered present of [[primary consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;Edelman, G. M. (2003). Naturalizing consciousness: a theoretical framework. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 5520–5524.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary consciousness can be defined as simple awareness that includes [[perception]] and [[emotion]]. As such, it is ascribed to most animals. By contrast, secondary consciousness depends on and includes such features as self-reflective awareness, abstract thinking, volition and [[metacognition]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (1992). Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind. Basic Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined by [[Gerald Edelman]].

==Brief history and overview==
[[Image:RobertFuddBewusstsein17Jh.png|thumb|Representation of consciousness from the seventeenth century.]]

Since [[Descartes]]'s proposal of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], it became a general consensus that the mind had become a matter of [[philosophy]] and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness-  that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness.  Such notable neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness are [[Antonio Damasio]] and [[Gerald Edelman]].  Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation play a critical role in high level cognition,&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (1999). The Feeling of What Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making ofConsciousness. Harcourt Brace, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (2003). Feelings of emotion and the self. In J. LeDoux, J. Debiec &amp; H. Moss (Eds.), Self: from Soul to Brain (Vol. 1001, pp. 253-261). New York: New York Acad Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers D J, Facing up to the problem of consciousness, J Cons Stud, 2 (1995) 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers D J, The conscious mind: In search of a fundamental theory (Oxford University Press, New York) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms [[primary consciousness]] and secondary consciousness.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;  Despite being an often criticized theory, Edelman’s theory of consciousness is regarded as the most neurobiologically sound and accurate description of consciousness to date.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The author puts forward the belief that consciousness is a particular kind of brain process; linked and integrated, yet complex and differentiated.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M.,  Tononi, G. (2000). A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution towards secondary consciousness==
Edelman argues that the [[evolutionary]] emergence of consciousness depended on the [[natural selection]] of neural systems that gave rise to consciousness, but not on selection for consciousness itself. He is noted for his theory of neuronal group selection, also known as [[Neural Darwinism]], which displays the belief that consciousness is the product of natural selection. He believes consciousness is not something separate from the real world, thus the attempt to eliminate [[Descartes]]’ "[[Mind-body dualism|dualism]]" as a possible consideration. He also rejects theories based on the notion that the brain is a computer or an instructional system. Instead, he suggests that the brain is a selectional system, one in which large numbers of variant circuits are generated [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]]. He claims the potential connectivity in the neural net "far exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe" &lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;Edelman, G. M. (2004). Wider than the sky: a revolutionary view of consciousness. Penguin Press Science, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic core hypothesis and re-entry===
'''Dynamic core hypothesis '''

Edelman elaborates on the dynamic core hypothesis (DCH), which describes the thalamocortical region- the region believed to be the integration center of consciousness. The DCH reflects the use and disuse of interconnected neuronal networks during stimulation of this region. It has been shown through computer models that neuronal groups existing in the [[cerebral cortex]] and [[thalamus]] interact in the form of synchronous [[oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner, A. G. (2007). Metastability, criticality and phase transitions in brain and its models. Biosystems, 90(2), 496–508&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between distinct neuronal groups forms the "dynamic core" and may help explain the nature of conscious experience.

''' Re-entry'''
{{Main|Reentry (neural circuitry)}}

Edelman integrates the DCH hypothesis into Neural Darwinism, in which [[metastable]] interactions in the thalamocortical region cause a process of selectionism through [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|re-entry]], a host of internal [[feedback]] loops. "Re-entry", as Edelman states, "provides the critical means by which the activities of distributed multiple brain areas are linked, bound, and then dynamically altered in time during perceptual categorization. Both diversity and re-entry are necessary to account for the fundamental properties of conscious experience." These re-entrant signals are reinforced by areas Edelman calls "degenerate". Degeneracy doesn't imply deterioration, but instead redundancy as many areas in the brain handle the same or similar tasks. With this brain structure emerging in early humans, selection could favor certain brains and pass their patterns down the generations. Habits once erratic and highly individual ultimately became the social norm.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky"/&gt;

=== Exhibiting secondary consciousness in the animal kingdom===
While animals with [[primary consciousness]] have long-term memory, they lack explicit narrative, and, at best, can only deal with the immediate scene in the remembered present. While they still have an advantage over animals lacking such ability, [[evolution]] has brought forth a growing complexity in consciousness, particularly in [[mammals]]. Animals with this complexity are said to have secondary consciousness.
Secondary consciousness is seen in animals with [[semantic capabilities]], such as the four [[great apes]]. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex [[language]] made up of [[syntax]] and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of [[reptiles]] into mammals and then into [[birds]], the [[embryological]] development of large numbers of new reciprocal connections allowed rich re-entrant activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt; The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further re-entrant circuits appeared that linked semantic and linguistic performance to categorical and conceptual [[memory]] systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.&lt;ref name="Sky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (200). Second Nature:Brain Science and Human Knowledge. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-recognition'''

For the advocates of the idea of a secondary consciousness, self-recognition serves as a critical component and a key defining measure.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} What is most interesting then, is the evolutionary appeal that arises with the concept of self-recognition. In non-human species and in children, the "[[mirror test]]" has been used as an indicator of [[self-awareness]]. In these experiments, subjects are placed in front of a mirror and provided with a mark that cannot be seen directly but is visible in the mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Bischof-Köhler, D. (1991). The development of empathy in infants. In M.E. Lamb &amp; H. Keller (eds.), Infant Development. Perspectives from German speaking countries (245-273).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magpie"&gt;Prior, H., Schwarz, A., &amp; Gunturkun, O. (2008). Mirror-induced behavior in the magpie (Pica pica): Evidence of self-recognition. Plos Biology, 6(8), 1642-1650.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous findings in the past 30 years which display fairly clear evidence of possessors of self-recognition including the following animals:
* [[Chimpanzee]]s, [[orangutan]]s, pygmy chimpanzees, and [[gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gallup GG Jr (1970) Chimpanzees: self-recognition. ''Science'' 167: 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walraven V, van Elsacker L, Verheyen R (1995) Reactions of a group of pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus) to their mirror images: evidence of self-recognition. Primates 36: 145–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson FGP, Cohn RH (1994) Self-recognition and self-awareness in lowland gorillas. In: Parker ST, Mitchell RW, editors. Self-awareness in animals and humans: developmental perspectives. New York (New York): Cambridge University Press. pp. 273–290.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dolphins]] and [[elephants]]. Findings suggestive of self-recognition in mammals other than apes have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss D, Marino L (2001) Mirror self-recognition in the bottlenose dolphin: a case of cognitive convergence. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 98: 5937–5942.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plotnik JM, de Waal FBM, Reiss D (2006) Self-recognition in an Asian elephant. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103: 17053–17057.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Magpies]].&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt;
It should be mentioned that even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli DJ, Rulf AB, Landau KR, Bierschwale DT (1993) Self-recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): distribution, ontogeny, and patterns of emergence. J Comp Psychol 107: 347–372.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Monkeys]], non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of the mirror and social displays were observed. However, hints at mirror-induced self-directed behavior have been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt CW (1998) Responses of gibbons (Hylobates lar) to their mirror images. Am J Primatol 45: 307–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Self-recognition study in the magpie'''

It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition but absent from animals without a [[neocortex]]. However, in a recent study, an investigation of self-recognition in [[corvids]] was carried out, and significant result quantified the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less [[magpies]] are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt;

''' Research on animal consciousness'''

Many researchers of consciousness have looked upon such types of research in animals as significant and interesting approaches. Ursula Voss of the Universität Bonn believes that the theory of protoconsciousness may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in this bird species, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep. She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as if we continue to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), we would be able to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today’s world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Lucid vs. non lucid dreaming as a model==
In the last couple of decades, dream research has begun to focus on the field of consciousness. Through [[lucid dreaming]], [[NREM sleep]], [[REM sleep]], and waking states, many dream researchers are attempting to scientifically explore consciousness. When exploring consciousness through the concept of dreams, many researchers believe the general characteristics that constitute primary and secondary consciousness remain intact:
"Primary consciousness is a state in which you have no future or past, a state of just being…. no executive ego control in your dreams, no planning, things just happen to you, you just are in a dream. Yet, everything feels real…Secondary is based on language, has to do with self-reflection, it has to do with forming abstractions, and that is dependent of language. Only animals with language have secondary consciousness".{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Circuitry/anatomy ===
There have been studies used to determine what parts of the brain are associated with [[lucid dreaming]], [[NREM sleep]], [[REM sleep]] and waking states. The goal of these studies is often to seek [[physiological]] correlates of dreaming and apply them in the hopes of understanding relations to consciousness.

''' Prefrontal cortex'''

Some notable, albeit criticized findings include the functions of the [[prefrontal cortex]] that are most relevant to the self-conscious awareness that is lost in sleep, commonly termed as ‘executive’ functions. These include self-observation, planning, prioritizing and decision-making abilities, which are, in turn, based upon more basic [[cognitive]] abilities such as attention, working memory, [[Time|temporal]] memory and behavioral inhibition &lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, E. (2001) The Executive Brain: Frontal Lobes and the Civilized Mind, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;12 Fuster, J.M. (1997) The Prefrontal Cortex: Anatomy, Physiology, and Neuropsychology of the Frontal.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental data which display differences between the self-awareness experienced in waking and its diminution in dreaming can be explained by deactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during REM sleep. It has been proposed that deactivation results from a direct inhibition of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons by [[acetylcholine]], the release of which is enhanced during REM sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Muzur, A.

Experiments and studies have been taken out to test neural correlations of lucid dreams with consciousness in dream research. Although there are many difficulties in conducting lucid dreaming research (e.g. number of lucid subjects, ‘type’ of lucidity achieved, etc.), there have been studies with significant results.

In one study, researchers sought physiological correlates of lucid dreaming. They showed that the unusual combination of hallucinatory dream activity and wake-like reflective awareness and agentive control experienced in lucid dreams is paralleled by significant changes in [[electrophysiology]]. Participants were recorded using 19-channel [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG), and 3 achieved lucidity in the experiment. Differences between REM sleep and lucid dreaming were most prominent in the 40-Hz [[frequency]] band. The increase in 40-Hz power was especially strong at frontolateral and frontal sites.  Their findings include the indication that 40-Hz activity holds a functional role in the modulation of conscious awareness across different conscious states. Furthermore, they termed lucid dreaming as a [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] state, or that lucidity occurs in a state with features of both REM sleep and waking. In order to move from non-lucid REM sleep dreaming to lucid REM sleep dreaming, there must be a shift in brain activity in the direction of waking.&lt;ref name="Voss"&gt;Voss, U., Holzmann, R., Tuin, I., &amp; Hobson, J. A. (2009). Lucid Dreaming: A State of Consciousness with Features of Both Waking and Non-Lucid Dreaming. Sleep, 32(9), 1191-1200.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other well-known contributing scholars involved with lucid dream research and consciousness, yet primarily based in fields such as psychology and philosophy include:
*[[Stephen LaBerge]]- most known for his lucid dreaming education and facilitation. His technique of signaling to a collaborator monitoring his [[EEG]] with agreed-upon eye movements during REM sleep became the first published, scientifically-verified signal from a dreamer's mind to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Laberge, S. (1980). Lucid dreaming: An exploratory study of consciousness during sleep. (Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, 1980), (University Microfilms No. 80-24, 691)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaBerge, S. (1991). Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. New York: Ballantine Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Metzinger]]- known for his correlate of neuroscience and philosophy in understanding consciousness. He is praised for his ability to probe and link fundamental issues between these fields.&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (1995) Conscious Experience. Imprint Academic, Thorverton und mentis, Paderborn, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (2000) Neural Correlates of Consciousness – Empirical and Conceptual Questions. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paul Tholey]]- most known for his research on rare, non-ordinary ego experiences and OBEs that arise with lucid dreaming. He has also studied the cognitive abilities of dream characters in lucid dreams through various experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Tholey, P. (1989). CONSCIOUSNESS AND ABILITIES OF DREAM CHARACTERS OBSERVED DURING LUCID DREAMING. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 68(2), 567-578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tholey, P. (1989). Overview of the Development of Lucid Dream Research in Germany. Lucidity Letter, 8(2), 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protoconsciousness===
The theory of protoconsciousness, developed by [[Allan Hobson]], a creator of the [[Activation-synthesis hypothesis]], has been developed through dream research and involves the idea of a secondary consciousness. Hobson suggests that brain states underlying waking and dreaming cooperate and that their functional interplay is crucial to the optimal functioning of both. Ultimately, he proposes the idea that [[REM sleep]] provides opportunities to the brain to prepare itself for its main integrative functions, including secondary consciousness, which would explain the developmental and [[evolutionary]] considerations to be taken with birds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} This functional interplay which occurs during REM sleep constitutes a ‘proto-conscious’ state which preludes consciousness and can develop and maintain higher order consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, J. A. (2009). REM sleep and dreaming: towards a theory of protoconsciousness. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 10(11), 803-U862. {{doi|10.1038/nrn2716}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIM model===
As the [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] has evolved, it has metamorphosed into the three-dimensional framework known as the AIM model. The AIM model describes a method of mapping conscious states onto an underlying [[physiological]] state space. The AIM model relates not just to wake/sleep states of consciousness, but to all states of [[consciousness]]. By choosing activation, input source, and mode of [[neuromodulation]] as the three dimensions, the proposers believe to have selected "how much information is being processed by the brain (A), what information is being processed (I), and how it is being processed (M).&lt;ref name="AIM"&gt;Hobson, J. A., Pace-Schott, E. F., &amp; Stickgold, R. (2000). Dreaming and the brain: Toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 23(6), 793-+.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobson, Schott, and Stickgold propose three aspects of the AIM model:

*Conscious states are in large part determined by three interdependent processes, the level of brain [[activation]] ("A"), the origin of inputs ("I") to the activated areas, and the relative levels of activation of aminergic ([[noradrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]]) and [[cholinergic]] [[neuromodulators]] ("M").&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt;
*The AIM Model proposes that all of the universes’ possible brain-mind states can be exemplified with a three-dimensional state space, with axes A, I, and M (activation, input, and mode), and that the state of the brain-mind at any given instant of time can be described as a point in this space. Since the AIM model represents brain-mind state as a sequence of points, Hobson adds that time is a fourth dimension of the model.&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt;
*The AIM model proposes that all three parameters defining the state space are continuous variables, and any point in the state space can in theory be occupied.&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt;

===Criticism of lucid dreaming model===
Secondary consciousness, as it remains a controversial topic, has received often contrasting findings and beliefs regarding [[lucid dreaming]] as a model, which entails the true difficulty in understanding consciousness.

The most common of recent criticisms include:
* The analyzed circuitry involved in lucid dreaming, [[REM sleep]], [[NREM sleep]], and waking states used to determine reflective ability. If, as many scholars have come to suggest, typical non-lucid REM dreaming reflects [[primary consciousness]], the belief that typical non-lucid dreaming is accompanied by de-activation of the DL-PFC becomes significant. Although the [[Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex]] (DL-PFC) is believed to be the site of "executive [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] control", it has never been tested.
* The idea of "executive [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] control" and its articulation. Kuiken has stated that typical non-lucid REM dreaming may involve another form of self-regulative activity that is not related to activation of the DL-PFC. There is evidence that the subtle self-regulation characteristic of [[musical improvisation]] is similar in pattern to the activations and de-activations (including de-activation of the DL-PFC) that characterize REM sleep. It is probable that the loss of one conscious form of self-regulation during non-lucid dreaming creates the possibility for the adoption of an unconscious, but "fluid" form of self-regulation that resembles that of musical improvisation. It is possible, he believes, that non-lucid dreaming entails self-regulated but fluid openness to ‘what comes,’ rather than the direct self-monitoring and inhibition that enable ‘rational’ planning and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Kuiken, D. (2010). Primary and Secondary Consciousness During Dreaming. International Journal of Dream Research, 3(1), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a recent study, it has been proven that unconscious task-relevant signals can actively trigger and initiate an inhibition to respond, thereby breaking the alleged close correlation between consciousness and inhibitory control.&lt;ref&gt;van Gaal S., Ridderinkhof K.R., van den Wildenberg W.P.M., Lamme V.A.F.(2009). Dissociating Consciousness From Inhibitory Control: Evidence for Unconsciously Triggered Response Inhibition in the Stop-Signal Task. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 35 (4), 1129-1139.&lt;/ref&gt; This proves that self-regulative activities (a characteristic of secondary consciousness for many scholars) can occur independently of consciousness of consciousness.
* Using lucid dreaming as a model of secondary consciousness. Some scholars believe lucid dreaming does not constitute a single type of reflectiveness. It is already argued that there may be different kinds of reflectiveness that might define secondary consciousness, so the difficulty in using lucid dreaming as a model is greatly increased. For example, there may be a realization in a dream that will often go without gaining control. There are different amounts of ‘executive functions’ taken between lucid dreams, thus displaying how there are many different types of reflectiveness involved in ‘lucid’ dreaming.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

'''Self-image''' is the mental picture, generally of a kind that is quite resistant to change, that depicts not only details that are potentially available to objective investigation by others (height, weight, hair color, etc.), but also items that have been learned by that person about themself, either from personal experiences or by [[Internalization#Psychology and sociology|internalizing]] the judgments of others.

Self-image may consist of four types:
# Self-image resulting from how an individual sees oneself.
# Self-image resulting from how others see the individual.
# Self-image resulting from how the individual perceives others see them.
# Self-image resulting from how the individual perceives the individual sees oneself.

These four types may or may not be an accurate representation of the person. All, some or none of them may be true.

A more technical term for self-image that is commonly used by social and cognitive psychologists is '''[[self-schema]]'''. Like any [[schema (psychology)|schema]], self-schemas store information and influence the way we think and remember. For example, research indicates that information which refers to the self is preferentially encoded and recalled in memory tests, a phenomenon known as "[[self-referential encoding]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T.B., Kuiper, N.A., Kirker, W.S. (1977) Self-Reference and the Encoding of Personal Information, ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''35'', 677-688.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-schemas are also considered the traits people use to define themselves, they draw information about the self into a coherent scheme.&lt;ref name=Schacter&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|title=Psychology 2nd Ed.|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L.|title=Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|pages=494|edition=2|author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M. Wegner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poor self-image==

Poor self-image may be the result of accumulated criticisms that the person collected as a child which have led to damaging their own view of themselves. Children in particular are vulnerable to accepting negative judgments from authority figures because they have yet to develop competency in evaluating such reports. Also, adolescents are highly targeted to suffer from poor body image issues. Individuals that already exhibit a low-sense of self-worth may be vulnerable to develop social disorders.

Negative self-images can arise from a variety of factors. A prominent factor, however, is personality type. [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionists]], high achievers, and those with "[[Type A personality|type A]]" personalities seem to be prone to having negative self-images.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Ronald B., Lawrence B. Rosenfeld, and Russell F. Proctor, II. Interplay: The Process of Interpersonal Communication, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because such people constantly set the standard for success high above a reasonable, attainable level. Thus, they are constantly disappointed in this "failure."

Another factor that contributes to a negative self-image is the beauty values of the society in which a person lives. In the American society, a popular beauty ideal is thinness. Oftentimes, girls feel that they do not measure up to society's "thin" standards, which leads to them having a negative self-image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/factors-may-contribute-eating-disorders]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
When people are in the position of evaluating others, self-image maintenance processes can lead to a more negative evaluation depending on the self-image of the evaluator. That is to say [[prejudice|stereotyping and prejudice]] may be the way individuals maintain their self-image. When individuals evaluate a member of a stereotyped group, they are less likely to evaluate that person negatively if their self-images had been bolstered through a self-affirmation procedure, and they are more likely to evaluate that person stereotypically if their self-images have been threatened by negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, S., &amp; Spencer, S.J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 73(1), 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may restore their self-esteem by derogating the member of a stereotyped group.&lt;ref&gt;Florack, A., Scarabis, M., &amp; Gosejohann, S. (2005). The Effects of Self-Image Threat on the Judgment of Out-Group Targets. Swiss Journal of Psychology 64(2), 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fein and Spencer (1997) conducted a study on Self-image Maintenance and Discriminatory Behavior. This study showed evidence that increased prejudice can result from a person's need to redeem a threatened positive perception of the self. The aim of the study was to test whether a particular threat to the self would instigate increased stereotyping and lead to actual discriminatory behavior or tendencies towards a member of a "''negatively''" stereotyped group. 
The study began when Fein and Spencer gave participants an ostensible test of intelligence. Some of them received negative feedback, and others, positive and supportive feedback. In the second half of the experiment, the participants were asked to evaluate another person who either belonged to a ''negatively stereotyped group'', or one who did not. 
The results of the experiment proved that the participants who had previously received unfavorable comments on their test, evaluated the target of the ''negatively stereotyped group'' in a more antagonistic or opposing way, than the participants who were given excellent reports on their intelligence test. They concluded that the negative feedback on the test threatened the participants' self-image and they evaluated the target in a more negative manner, all in efforts to restore their own self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, S. &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 73, 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

A present study extends the studies of Fein and Spencer in which the principal behavior examined was avoidance behavior.  In the study, Macrae et al. (2004) found that participants that had a salient negative stereotype of "skinheads" attached, physically placed themselves further from a skinhead target compared to those in which the stereotype was not as apparent.  Therefore, greater salience of a negative stereotype led participants to show more stereotype-consistent behavior towards the target.&lt;ref&gt;Macrae (1994).  Self-image Maintenance and Discriminatory Behavior. ''Revue internationale de psychologie sociale'', 153-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residual==
'''Residual self-image''' is the concept that individuals tend to think of [[Self (psychology)|themselves]] as projecting a certain [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]],&lt;ref&gt;''Literature and Psychology'' No. 4, Vol. 49; Pg. 43; ISSN 0024-4759.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Lankton, Carol H. Lankton,  ''Enchantment and Intervention in Family Therapy'' (1986), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; or certain position of social entitlement, or lack thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Kum-Kum Bhavnani, [[Ann Phoenix]], ''Shifting Identities, Shifting Racisms: A Feminism &amp; Psychology Reader (1994), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used at least as early as 1968,&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association: Volume 16'', Issues 3-4 (1968), p. 594. (stating "Women remain 'depriving competitors,' and the residual self image is 'I don't have the equipment to attract men.'")&lt;/ref&gt; but was popularized in fiction by the [[The Matrix (series)|''Matrix'' series]], where persons who existed in a digitally created world would subconsciously maintain the physical appearance that they had become accustomed to projecting.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Lawrence, ''Like a Splinter in Your Mind: The Philosophy Behind the Matrix'' (2004), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victimisation==
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a self-image of [[victimisation]]. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, [[locus of control|loss of control]], [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of self-guilt, [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's disparity==
Self-image disparity was found to be positively related to chronological age (CA) and intelligence, two factors thought to increase concomitantly with maturity: Capacity for guilt and ability for cognitive differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, P., &amp; Zigler, E. (1967). Self-image Disparity: A Developmental Approach. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 5(2), 186-195.&lt;/ref&gt; However, males had larger self-image disparities than females, Caucasians had larger disparities and higher ideal self images than African Americans, and socioeconomic status (SES) affected self-images differentially for the 2nd and 5th graders.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D.A., &amp; Zigler, E.F. (1980). Children's self-image disparity: Effects of age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 39(4), 689-700.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengtheners===
A child's self-awareness of who they are differentiates into three categories around the age of five: their social self, academic persona, and physical attributes. Several ways to strengthen a child's self-image include communication, reassurance, support of hobbies, and finding good role models.&lt;ref&gt;Bourland, Julia. Parenting13. 4 (May 1999): 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolved awareness in mirror==
When does a child become aware that the image in a mirror is their own? Research was done on 88 children between 3 and 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam, B. (1972). Mirror self-image reactions before age two. Developmental Psychobiology. 5(4), 297-305.&lt;/ref&gt; Their behaviors were observed before a mirror. The results indicated that children's awareness of self-image followed three major age-related sequences:  
* From about 6 through 12 months of age, the first prolonged and repeated reaction of an infant to their mirror image is that of a sociable “playmate”. 
* In the second year of life, wariness and withdrawal appeared; self-admiring and embarrassed behavior accompanied those avoidance behaviors starting at 14 months, and was shown by 75% of the subjects after 20 months of age. 
* During the last part of the second year of life, from 20 to 24 months of age, 65% of the subjects demonstrated recognition of their mirror images.

==Physical activity==
Regular practice of endurance exercise was related to a more favourable self-image. There was a strong association between participation in sports and the type of personality that tends to be resistant to drug and alcohol addiction. Physical exercise was further significantly related to scores for physical and psychological well-being. Adolescents who engaged regularly in physical activity were characterised by lower anxiety-depression scores, and displayed much less social behavioural inhibition than their less active counterparts.

It is likely that discussion of recreational or exercise involvement may provide a useful point of entry for facilitating dialogue among adolescents about concerns relating to body image and self-esteem. In terms of psychotherapeutic applications, physical activity has many additional rewards for adolescents. It is probable that by promoting physical fitness, increased physical performance, lessening body mass and promoting a more favourable body shape and structure, exercise will provide more positive social feedback and recognition from peer groups, and this will subsequently lead to improvement in an individual's self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkcaldy, B.D., Shephard, R.J., Siefen, R.G. (2002) The relationship between physical activity and self-image and problem behaviour among adolescents. Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology. 37(11), 544-550.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automatic activation of stereotypes and threat==
Does self-image threatening feedback make perceivers more likely to activate stereotypes when confronted by members of a minority group? Participants in Study 1 saw an Asian American or European American woman for several minutes, and participants in Studies 2 and 3 were exposed to drawings of an African American or European American male face for fractions of a second. These experiments found no evidence of automatic stereotype activation when perceivers were cognitively busy and when they had not received negative feedback. When perceivers had received negative feedback, however, evidence of stereotype activation emerged even when perceivers were cognitively busy.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, S.J., Fein, S., Wolfe, C.T., Fong, C., Duinn, M.A. (1998) Automatic Activation of Stereotypes: The Role of Self-Image Threat. Personality and social psychology bulletin. 24(11), 1139-1152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's sexual behavior==
A magazine survey that included items about body image, self-image, and sexual behaviors was completed by 3,627 women. The study found that overall self-image and body image are significant predictors of sexual activity. Women more satisfied with body image reported more sexual activity, orgasm, and initiating sex, greater comfort undressing in front of their partner, having sex with the lights on, trying new sexual behaviors (e.g. anal sex), and pleasing their partner sexually than those dissatisfied. Positive body image was inversely related to self-consciousness and importance of physical attractiveness, and positively related to relationships with others and overall satisfaction. Body image was predictive only of one's comfort undressing in front of partner and having sex with lights on. Overall satisfaction was predictive of frequency of sex, orgasm, and initiating sex, trying new sexual behaviors, and confidence in giving partner sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Ackard, D.M., Kearney-Cooke, A., Peterson, C.B. (2000) Effect of body image and self-image on women's sexual behaviors. International Journal of Eating Disorders. 28(4), 422-429.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men's sexual behavior==

One hundred and ten heterosexual individuals (67 men; 43 women) responded to questions related to penis size and satisfaction. Men showed significant dissatisfaction with penile size, despite perceiving themselves to be of average size. Importantly, there were significant relationships between penile dissatisfaction and comfort with others seeing their penis, and with likelihood of seeking medical advice with regard to penile and/or sexual function. Given the negative consequences of low body satisfaction and the importance of early intervention in sexually related illnesses (e.g., testicular cancer), it is imperative that attention be paid to male body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Lucy, Tracey McLellan, and Audrey McKinlay. 2014. "(Perceived) Size Really Does Matter: Male Dissatisfaction With Penis Size." Psychology Of Men &amp; Masculinity 15, no. 2: 225-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social cleansing''' ({{lang-es|limpieza social}}) is class-based killing that consists of elimination of members of society considered "undesirable," including but not limited to the homeless, criminals, [[street children]], the elderly, sex workers, and sexual minorities{{clarify|date=May 2015}}.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="san 110"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is caused by a combination of economic and social factors, but killings are notably present in regions with high levels of poverty and disparities of wealth.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fed 12"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Perpetrators are usually of the same community as the victims and are often motivated by the idea that the victims are a drain on the resources of society.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts by national and local governments to stop these killings have been largely ineffective, and the government and police forces are often involved in the killings, especially in South America.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ab 187"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mig 1155"/&gt;

==Causes==

===Africa===
In African countries, social cleansing almost always takes the form of [[witch hunting]],{{fact|date=April 2016}} which is most common in areas with poor economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="fed 12"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Several social and economic theories exist as to why such circumstances have arisen and led to accusations of witchcraft, including warfare, natural disasters, unequal patterns of development, and larger forces of [[globalization]]. Most scholars agree that the cause of social cleansing efforts is a result of "interaction of economic conditions and cultural factors."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1169.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these theories must be linked to larger societal trends, including the devaluation and social marginalization of women as well as the placement of blame on individuals for their own economic misfortunes in lieu of recognition of global and local economic forces at play.&lt;ref name="fed14"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zachrisson 2007, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several scholars have emphasized the outside groups and circumstances related to these killings to dispute the idea that they are simply a cultural norm.&lt;ref name="fed11"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, income disparities have led to social tensions and a climate of "mutual suspicion".&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy and powerful are perceived as having obtained their wealth through "evil arts", while the economically disadvantaged are accused of responsibility for misfortunes of the community.&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"/&gt; There is also evidence that the causes of social cleansing are linked to globalization and [[economic liberalization]], "to the extent that it has stripped entire populations of their means of subsistence, torn communities apart, deepened economic inequalities and forced people to compete for diminishing resources."{{fact|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name="fed11" /&gt; Many African communities have been destabilized as communal lands have been privatized, local currency has been devalued, and public services have been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Federici 2010, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes these larger economic trends have been linked to more specific events. For example, in Southern Zimbabwe, violent wars led certain areas to be neglected in development efforts, leading to a lack of resources and increasing disparities of wealth in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Zachrisson 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, scholars have found positive correlations between extreme rainfall (both floods and droughts) and large negative income shocks and famine. These periods have been statistically linked to increases in murder of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural====
Several cultural explanations for social cleansing in Africa are related to religion.{{fact|date=April 2016}} One  that has been offered by scholars is the presence of [[Pentecostalists]], whose focus on the occult has been spread by the media and increased social anxiety. Pentecostalists have been recorded as preaching connections between illness and the devil, which has combined potently with existing indigenous beliefs, most notably in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="fed 12" /&gt; In Tanzania, a positive correlation exists between witch killing and areas where populations practice traditional religions, where belief in witchcraft is strong.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p.1154.&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars have suggested that the presence of these beliefs is important because it demonstrates that perpetrators generally do believe that their victims are practicing witchcraft, they also recognize that populations of traditional religious beliefs are often also of low socio-economic status, which supports their assertion that poverty is still the primary factor in motivating killings.&lt;ref&gt;Federici 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
The most widespread myth about social cleansing in Latin America is that these killings are all related to drug use.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phenomenon is larger than the drug problem and is related to state ideology, a culture of violence, and inequitable wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Colombia specifically, economic factors account for many of the reasons behind these killings, but such factors are additionally "aggravated by external political and economic pressures from the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic====
Latin America has an extremely large number of individuals living below the poverty line, and these individuals are largely blamed for their impoverished state.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, pp.387-388&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these individuals are in critical poverty, meaning that they do not even have the ability to secure food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This critical poverty is connected to inflation rates that has led the cost of living to increase and the minimum salary to be hardly adequate for survival.&lt;ref name="ord28"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, the gap between the rich and poor has widened, and funds for welfare programs and social services has decreased while funding for security forces to protect "the haves from the have-nots" have tripled in Colombia specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp.27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culture of violence====
{{main|Crime and violence in Latin America}}

Latin America's history has long been plagued by political violence, which over time has morphed into class-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Despite mostly formally democratic governments, the "legacy of authoritarianism" lingers, and the presence of "armed actors" is prevalent as a result of a long history of violence between military, [[paramilitary]], and guerilla groups.&lt;ref&gt;Koonings 2001, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this culture of violence has had various effects on the underclass in countries in Latin America. The military and especially the police have been known to use violence to harm citizens rather than protect them.&lt;ref name="koon 404"&gt;Koonings 2001, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Private "vigilante" security forces have likewise used violence against the poor with the idea of promoting law and order, especially in Colombia, Guatemala, and Peru.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; Though many guerilla groups are much less violent than when they originally emerged, they are a presence and an additional source of violence, especially in Colombia.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; Tension between political groups has led these guerilla groups, the government, and vigilante actors to suspect peasants of working with their enemy and to intimidate them into leaving land in the countryside for the city.&lt;ref name="ord28" /&gt; Other poor rural residents have been forced to leave due to general violence or lack of public services.&lt;ref name="ord28" /&gt; Violence at the local level is also extremely common by organized criminals such as street gangs, drug bosses, vigilante justice groups, and local civil patrols.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; When poor residents are forced to move to the city, they often must turn to prostitution, crime, or begging in inner-city ghettos, which puts them in an extremely vulnerable position in the presence of these violent groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp.28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Men in particular become even more entrenched in the culture of violence as many join gangs to escape "social exclusion and economic disadvantage" and establish a sense of identity and masculinity.&lt;ref name="wild 741"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.741.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, violence exists at a level even smaller than the community—the home. Children are often victims of "physical, mental, and sexual abuse by adults member of their own families."&lt;ref name="ord 22"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Guatemala specifically, social cleansing occurs with the "backdrop of genocide," and homicide rates are still extremely high after "three decades of armed conflict" during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="san 108"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence experienced across the region has led to an erosion of social capital, which was described by Colombians as including "'social mistrust,' 'lack of unity,' 'fear' and 'lack of social institutions.'" &lt;ref name="mc971"&gt;McIlwaine and Moser 2001, p.971.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social cleansing in Spain ==
Spain, during times before colonization, demonstrates societal patterns that shaped life in Spain in terms of prejudice and discrimination. The discriminatory practice of Spanish legislation led to a certain caste system, pertaining to those with or without honor. Moreover one's reputation and the way one was treated was based on aspects such as honor, legitimacy, and the limpieza de sangre, a prejudicial marker that indicates one’s purity of blood, relating to their family timeline and deciding how society was to treat them.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faces of Honor: Sex, Shame, and Violence in Colonial Latin America|last=Johnson|first=Lyman L.|last2=Lipsett-Rivera|first2=Sonya|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8263-1942-6|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Historic meanings of honor included those cultural specific ways that Spaniards had always rationalized discrimination due to defects in birth (illegitimate, nonnoble), religion (non-Catholic), and race (nonwhite).” &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This discriminatory institution based on these concepts of honor, limpieza, and legitimacy, is expressed through the legislation of Spanish government at the time. An example of this is was in 1414 when Pope Benedict XIII approved the constitution of Spanish College’s San Bartolomé, which linked these concepts through the school's acceptances.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Those excepted into the school had to prove they had pure blood, rather than Jewish, Moorish, or heretical heritage.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Social Cleansing in Colonial Latin America ==
The concept of "limpieza de sangre," or purity of blood, was used in societies of Spain and Portugal, originating from Iberian culture, where reputation was inherited by one's ancestors.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faces of Honor: Sex, Shame, and Violence in Colonial Latin America|last=Johnson|first=Lyman L.|last2=Lipsett-Rivera|first2=Sonya|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8263-1942-6|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had there been someone found to be a race such as Jewish, a converted Jewish, or Muslim in their family timeline, it was said to be a stain on their ancestry.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Consequently, one's own ancestry determined their reputation and social standing, impacting other aspects such as access to education, career, and marriage for further generations. This became known as the culture of honor, which resided in such reputational ancestry that came to define how individuals were respected.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Limpieza de sangre affected life for every individual in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, including the degree to exclusion and racial discrimination. When Europe came to colonize the "New World" these ethics of honor and limpieza de sangre implied that those with blood lacking purity to European standards was inferior. The Europeans were at the "apex" of social structure and everyone who was not identical in blood was inferior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; As colonists, the presumed inferiors were the colonized and thus, due to this culture of honor, they became victims of this discrimination. While over time assimilation and miscegenation and admixture complicated this concept of social cleansing, the ideals of "purity of blood" prevailed, and elite was considered to be of European and Christian origins.

The conquest of indigenous people in Latin America strengthened these ideals. The vulnerability of one's identity in colonial America gave way to ones defense of honor, except for the elites and those in power, typically the colonists. As the degree of honor perceived by individuals was reputational, people felt the need to be confirmed by society or from those in good social standing through submission into the given standards that one's place holds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The pursuit of this honor leads to many disputes, as well as the fear of being rejected by society and losing one's place.

Despite these long-lived standards, during post colonialism, the ideals of Latin America changed with independence and the growth of democratic values. With this, the culture of honor and respect in those with pure bloodlines changed.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; People began to socially include those who were previously seen as inferior.

==Social cleansing in Brazil==

===Victims and Methods===
The most common murder victim in [[Brazil]] is a young, black male living in a [[favela]], or a Brazilian slum.&lt;ref name="wild 730"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.730.&lt;/ref&gt; These young men typically are, or are assumed to be, gang members and criminals.&lt;ref name="wild 723"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.723.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence and murder are most common in areas that are economically disadvantaged and socially marginalized.&lt;ref name="wild 726"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.726.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often targets by association, though the effects of social cleansing and violence against women are largely absent in existing research.&lt;ref name="wild 733"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.733&lt;/ref&gt; Killings are often in public places, with victims being beaten or shot in the street.&lt;ref name="wild 739"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.739.&lt;/ref&gt; Police groups sometimes simply enter the community in a large armoured vehicle called a ""caveirão"" and start shooting.&lt;ref name="wild 743"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.743.&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle contributes to the "anonymity and impunity for the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="wild 743"/&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Social cleansing in Brazil is the result of a "murky symbiosis [that] has developed between the official security forces and paramilitary and vigilante-type actors" that carry out "law enforcement against the 'marginal classes.'"&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; State actors often act against the poor "as a form or result of exclusion and oppression."&lt;ref name="wild 725"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.725.&lt;/ref&gt; Gangs serve as a scapegoat for the levels of violence and lack of security in many communities.&lt;ref name="wild 726"/&gt; Private groups and some gangs perpetrate killings in attempts to take policing into their own hands.&lt;ref name="wild 732"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.732.&lt;/ref&gt; While some killings are a result of groups attempting to punish criminals for misdemeanors, others are a result of perceived threats of poor citizens, such as members of workers' movements.&lt;ref name="wild 733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koon 2001"&gt;Koonings 2001, p.405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cleansing in Colombia==

In the 1980s, "social cleansing" groups started to be created. Their main mission was "to make justice" by killing all non-appropriate people in social terms, like prostitutes, street-living people, transvestites, and drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence in Colombia: Building Sustainable Peace and Social Capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZfIGhYF-BAC&amp;pg=RA1-PR2|date=January 2000|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0-8213-4383-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Victims and Methods===
Victims of social cleansing in [[Colombia]] are members of society who are considered "undesirable" and "disposable."&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; They are economically disadvantaged, usually live on the streets, and are considered to be a burden on society, "the cause of the country's problems, rather than a consequence of them."&lt;ref name="ord19"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Street children====
One of these groups is street children, who are without homes due to abuse, forced displacement, or the death of their parents.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt; Death rates for street children have been as high as six to eight children per day.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are often shot in their sleep or stabbed to death on the streets or in the police station. A 1993 case in which a 9-year-old girl was strangled to death in Bogota brought attention to this problem and led to nominal reforms.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Police targets street children specifically under the assumption that they are drug users and criminals. This is to some extent true, as many use drugs to relieve pain and avoid hunger and must shoplift to survive.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ord388"&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite living in conditions of extreme vulnerability to "aggression and danger," the National Police poses the greatest threat to street children's survival, as they drive them off the streets and target them in social cleansing.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ord388" /&gt;

====Poor criminals, drug users, and drug dealers====
Poor criminals, drug users, and drug dealers are also common targets. From 1988 to 1993, these individuals collectively comprised 56% of social cleansing victims.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 390"&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are often victims of physical and sexual abuse by the police and vigilante groups known as "comas".&lt;ref name="ord23"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One common method of killing these individuals in the city of Bogota is the Choachí run, in which victims are taken to the top of a mountain in the town of Choachí, executed, and thrown off the mountain. In some cases, they are released to attempt escape, but die by falling down the mountain or being shot at as they run.&lt;ref name="ord23" /&gt; A similar method is known as "the ride," in which victims are forced into a vehicle, killed, and left in a desolate area.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt; Death squads have employed other means for killing suspected criminals, such as murdering them and then cutting off their hands and putting them in small boxes in public spaces to intimidate other criminals.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; Another group has been known to shoot victims and then cast their bodies into the municipal stadium.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt;

====Sex workers and sexual minorities====
Sex workers and sexual minorities are treated quite similarly in regards to social cleansing, as both are hard to identify and victims of heavy discrimination despite the fact that both homosexuality and prostitution are legal.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many female sex workers are forced into the line of work due to poverty and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ord23" /&gt; Both male and female sex workers are often harassed by the police, and males specifically are demanded to pay a "tax" where "failure to pay results in beatings or imprisonment."&lt;ref name="ord 26"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In an upside-down system, encounters with dishonest police are preferable to honest police, as the dishonest will accept bribes, while the honest are more likely to kill.&lt;ref name="ord 26" /&gt; Sexual minorities are particularly difficult to identify, because not only do some male sex workers participate in gay sex out of economic necessity, but victims are only considered homosexual if they were dressed as females at the time of death.&lt;ref name="ord 26" /&gt;

====Beggars and Recyclers====
Another group includes those individuals in the most extreme form of poverty. These individuals subsist by asking for money and/or collecting garbage.&lt;ref name="ord 24"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The police have been known to kill these victims in especially cruel ways, such as pouring gasoline on them and setting them on fire.&lt;ref name="ord 24" /&gt; It is also notable that at least 14 destitute individuals have been killed by security guards at one Colombian university for the use of their bodies as cadavers in the medical school.&lt;ref name="ord 24" /&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===

====National Police====
The National Police has played a large role in carrying out class-based killings in Colombia. The police created the term "disposable" (Spanish: ''desechable'') to define economically disadvantaged people who are considered to have no value to society.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether directly or through "paramilitary clients," the National Police was responsible for 74% of deaths related to social cleansing in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations include "security, aesthetics, economic well-being, morals, and religion."&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; In regards to safety and economic well-being, rationales include the idea that the poor are or look like criminals and decrease public safety and drive customers away from businesses.&lt;ref name="ord 31"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral arguments include protection from homosexuals and prostitutes.&lt;ref name="ord 31" /&gt;

====Death Squads and Paramilitary Groups====
The distinction between death squads and paramilitary groups and the National Police is not always clear. Not only are policemen often members of these groups, but these groups typically enjoy the protection of the police.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other members include businessmen, industrialists, guerillas, and soldiers.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; Death squads emerged in the late 1970s, one of the first being the Black Hand, a group that murdered suspected criminals.&lt;ref name="ord 18" /&gt; Their reasoning behind these killings is the flawed legal system, which convicts less than 3% of criminals. Death squads and other groups believe it necessary to step in where the legal system has failed by eliminating these suspected criminals.&lt;ref name="ord 31" /&gt;  As of 1995, there were no less than 40 of these squads operating in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Factors===

====National government====
The role of the national government in Colombia has largely been complicit cooperation with the National Police. By failing to deal with crime and then also effectively granting impunity to police and military groups, the state has allowed safety issues to be addressed with violence and  has perpetuated a "cycle of crime, lack of public safety, violent response, and impunity" due to "terrifying inefficiency and unwillingness to hold people accountable for their acts".&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the government at least tries to protect street children through programs to put them in state-run homes, these programs often do not align with their actual needs and have largely failed.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt; There have been limited attempts to protect those in poverty in the legal system, and one case of harassment against the poor resulted in a judge calling for their equal treatment and compensation from the offending policemen. However, the decision was not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cleansing in Guatemala==

===Victims and Methods===
Social cleansing and gang killings make up a large portion of the homicides in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="san 112"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Since gangs typically make no effort to cover up crimes and leave bodies at the place of death, "signs of torture," as well as location of the body, "serve as indicators of the existence of social cleansing," according to Elizabeth Sanford.&lt;ref name="san 111"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by the Human Rights Ombudsman, "the increase in the number of women killed whose bodies bore marks of torture and other sadistic abuse accounted for 40 percent of the total increase in female murders in 2005."&lt;ref name="san 118"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; Though female victims account for 10% of all homicides, over 18% of cadavers with signs of torture indicating social cleansing were female.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt;  Furthermore, 2% of female victims of homicide are prostitutes, a common victim group of social cleansing efforts.&lt;ref name="san 118"/&gt; Furthermore, young and destitute male gang members, especially those blamed for homicide of females, have been common victims of social cleansing.&lt;ref name="san 118"/&gt;
The most common form of killing, indicated by the 305 cadavers found in 2005, is strangulation.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; Other common methods included victims being beaten, shot in the head, bound by their hands and feet, and in the case of female victims, sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; Victims are abducted, taken to a different location, are tortured and killed, and finally have their body dumped in a different location.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Perpetrators include the Guatemalan government as well as private groups either directly or indirectly complicit with the state.&lt;ref name="san 110"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Social cleansing efforts are targeted against gangs and other perceived and actual criminals, who are blamed for the high rates of homicide.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; The perpetrators intend to both exterminate victims and intimidate other members of the target group.&lt;ref name="san 110"/&gt; Intimidation is carried out both through torture tactics used as well as propaganda including flyers and stickers that support social cleansing as a "method of social control."&lt;ref name="san 112"/&gt; Because perpetrators are directly or indirectly tied to the state, they naturally have impunity.&lt;ref name="san 110"/&gt;

===The origins of social cleansing in Guatemala===

The use of "social cleansing" efforts to eliminate criminals and other persons deemed to be socially dangerous has its origins during the period of military dictatorship and [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war]] (1954-1996). During the 1960s and 70s, many state-operated paramilitary front organizations (so-called "death squads") emerged with the express purpose of exterminating suspected communists and other enemies of the state. These groups included the [[Mano Blanca|MANO]], NOA, CADEG, 'Ojo por Ojo' and others. While nominally employed against political targets, the use of "death squads" came to be seen by the Guatemalan police forces (specifically the National Police) as a crime fighting tool, particularly after the election of Col. Arana Osorio in 1970 and the subsequent "state of siege". One early example of the use of "death squads" against non-political targets was a phantom organization called the 'Avenging Vulture', which specifically targeted criminals.

==Social cleansing in Tanzania==

===Victims and Methods===
The most common victims of social cleansing efforts in [[Tanzania]] are elderly women, the majority of whom are of low socioeconomic status, but several groups of people who are considered burdens to the community, such as children, the sick, infants, and the handicapped, are also victims.&lt;ref name="mig 115356"&gt;Miguel 2005, pp. 1153-1156.&lt;/ref&gt; These people are usually accused of witchcraft following deaths or other misfortunes in society and tend to flee, choosing homelessness over death. Those who do not flee successfully are killed violently in their homes.&lt;ref name="mig 115356" /&gt; Sometimes those considered burdens are simply reduced to zero consumption and are starved to death. This occurs particularly among infants, who have no ability to flee or attempt to provide for themselves.&lt;ref name="mig 115356" /&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Victims are typically killed by members of their own families, who blame them for economic suffering and household misfortune. Accusations and subsequent killings are often incited by death or illness in the family or the family's livestock. However, general misfortune in the form of "failed crops, lost jobs, and bad dreams also arouse suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1156&lt;/ref&gt; While often accusations are raised to the effect of creating a scapegoat, not all forms of social cleansing are connected to witch hunting. The extreme scarcity theory suggests that some families to drive out or starve unproductive family members to provide more nutrients for other members.&lt;ref name="mig1156-1158"&gt;Miguel 2005, pp. 1156-1558.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these perpetrators are young, unemployed men who see the elderly as a burden on their potential for success.&lt;ref name="fed 10"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another key perpetrator of social cleansing in Tanzania are the [[Sungusungu]], councils of male elders that operate under the premise of promoting village security.&lt;ref name="mig1156-1158" /&gt;  These groups formed under the premise that the government was not able to prevent crimes such as theft, and they serve as a form of vigilante justice.&lt;ref name="ab 187"&gt;Abrahams 1987, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other actors===
Although the Tanzanian government has made public witchcraft accusations illegal, the efforts to stop them have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="mig 1155"&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1155.&lt;/ref&gt; Conviction levels are extremely low, as "only seven of 1,622 individuals arrested in connection with witch killings during the 1970s and 1980s were convicted, and since then the conviction rate as apparently fallen even lower," according to  Edward Miguel.&lt;ref name="mig 1155" /&gt;  The perception of the government and police force as unable to control crime has led groups such as Sungusungu to take matters into their own hands, though studies suggest that the police may sometimes be involved in witch killings.&lt;ref name="ab 187" /&gt;

The '''substitution principle''' in sustainability is the maxim that processes, services and products should, wherever possible, be replaced with alternatives which have a lower impact on the environment. An example of a strong, hazard-based interpretation of the principle in application to chemicals is: "that hazardous chemicals should be systematically substituted by less hazardous alternatives or preferably alternatives for which no hazards can be identified".&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace, (2003, 2005). Safer Chemicals Within Reach: Using the Substitution Principle to drive Green Chemistry. London. p.7 [http://www.cleanproduction.org/library/SafeChem.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle has historically been promoted by environmental groups. The concept is becoming increasingly mainstream, being a key concept in [[green chemistry]] and a central element of EU [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] regulation.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission website on REACH. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the principle claim it is very difficult to implement in reality, especially in terms of [[legislation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Nonetheless, the concept is an important one and a key driver behind identifying Substances of Very High Concern in REACH and the development of hazardous substance lists such as the [http://www.sinlist.org/ SIN List] and the [http://www.etuc.org/a/6023 ETUC Trade Union Priority List]. EU-funded projects such as SubsPort are under development to aid the identification and development of safer substitutes for hazardous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Lissner L, Romano D. Substitution for Hazardous Chemicals on an International Level-The Approach of the European Project "SUBSPORT". New Solut. 2011 Jan 1;21(3):477-97. PubMed {{PMID|22001043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable regional development''' is the application of [[sustainable development]] at a [[regional]], rather than local, national or global level.  It differs to [[regional development]] per se, as the latter is a term used more generally to describe economic development that emphasises the alleviation of regional disparities.  While regional development has an economic and equity emphasis, sustainable regional development seeks to incorporate ecological concerns.

Sustainable regional development has particular currency in Australia, where the [[Institute for Sustainable Regional Development]] has been established (1997) for the purpose of developing integrated, multi- and inter-disciplinary strategies for environmental and socio-economic change in regional Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Sustainable Regional Development: [http://www.isrd.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/view.do?page=1191 About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3612">The '''T-schema''' ("truth [[schema (logic)|schema]]"; not to be confused with '[[Semantic theory of truth#Convention T|Convention T]]') is used to give an [[Recursive definition|inductive definition]] of truth which lies at the heart of any realisation of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]]. Some authors refer to it as the "Equivalence Schema", a synonym introduced by [[Michael Dummett]].&lt;ref name="Künne2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Künne|title=Conceptions of truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uakr0t90ylEC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-928019-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T-schema is often expressed in [[natural language]], but it can be formalized in [[Predicate logic|many-sorted predicate logic]] or [[modal logic]]; such a formalisation is called a "'''T-theory'''."  T-theories form the basis of much fundamental work in [[philosophical logic]], where they are applied in several important controversies in [[analytic philosophy]].

As expressed in semi-natural language (where 'S' is the name of the sentence abbreviated to S):
'S' is true [[if and only if]] S

Example: 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white.

== The inductive definition ==
By using the schema one can give an inductive definition for the truth of compound sentences.  Atomic sentences are assigned [[truth value]]s [[disquotational principle|disquotationally]]. For example, the sentence "'Snow is white' is true" becomes materially equivalent with the sentence "snow is white", i.e. 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white. The truth of more complex sentences is defined in terms of the components of the sentence:
* A sentence of the form "A and B" is true if and only if A is true and B is true
* A sentence of the form "A or B" is true if and only if A is true or B is true
* A sentence of the form "if A then B" is true if and only if A is false or B is true; see [[material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]]. 
* A sentence of the form "not A" is true if and only if A is false
* A sentence of the form "for all x, A(''x'')" is true if and only if, for every possible value of ''x'', A(''x'') is true. 
* A sentence of the form "for some x, A(''x'')" is true if and only if, for some possible value of ''x'', A(''x'') is true.

== Natural languages ==
[[Joseph Heath]] points out&lt;ref name="Heath2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Heath|title=Communicative action and rational choice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3i-QXQQOfZQC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08291-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "The analysis of the [[truth predicate]] provided by Tarski's Schema T is not capable of handling all occurrences of the truth predicate in natural language. In particular, Schema T treats only “freestanding” uses of the predicate—cases when it is applied to complete sentences." He gives as "obvious problem" the sentence:
* Everything that Bill believes is true.
Heath argues that analyzing this sentence using T-schema generates the [[sentence fragment]]—“everything that Bill believes”—on the righthand side of the [[biconditional|Logical biconditional]].

'''''The Politics of Nonviolent Action''''' is a three-volume political science book by [[Gene Sharp]], originally published in the United States in 1973. Sharp is one of the most influential theoreticians of [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]], and his publications have been influential in struggles around the world. This book contains his foundational analyses of the nature of political power, and of the methods and dynamics of nonviolent action. It represents a "thorough revision and rewriting"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|vi}} of the author's 1968 doctoral thesis at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp (1968), "The politics of nonviolent action: a study in the control of political power." Doctoral dissertation at [[University of Oxford]]. {{OCLC|46341106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been reviewed in professional journals&lt;ref

==Topics covered==
{{Gene Sharp}}
The three volumes or "parts" of ''The Politics of Nonviolent Action'' contain a total of 14 chapters, as well as a preface by the author, and an introduction by [[Thomas C. Schelling]]. Each part begins with an introduction by the author.&lt;ref name=tocexplain&gt;Other book information: the same detailed table of contents is published in each volume. Bibliographic notes are placed at the end of each chapter. All three volumes are served by a single 53-page index at the end of volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume or "part" addresses the theory of power that implicitly or explicitly underlies [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]]; Volume 2 offers a detailed analysis of the ''methods'' of nonviolent action; and the Volume 3 analyzes the ''dynamics'' of nonviolent action.

===Part One: Power and Struggle===
Chapter 1, ''The Nature and Control of Political Power'', explains that, 
although rarely articulated, there are "basically... two views of the nature of power."&lt;ref name=v1ref&gt;Vol. 1 of ''Politics of Nonviolent Action'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} The "monolith theory"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|9}} views people as dependent upon the good will of their governments, whereas [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]] is grounded in the converse "pluralistic-dependency theory"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|9}} that views government as "dependent on the people's good will, decisions and support,"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|8}} a view that Sharp argues is "sounder and more accurate."&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|8}} Sharp argues that "political power is not intrinsic to the power-holder,"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|11}} but flows from outside sources that include perceptions of authority, available human resources; skills and knowledge; material resources; and intangible psychological and ideological factors. These sources all depend upon obedience, which arises for "various and multiple"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|19}} reasons that include habit, fear of sanctions, perceived moral obligation, psychological identification with the ruler, zones of indifference, and absence of self-confidence among subjects. Obedience is essentially voluntary, and consent can be withdrawn.

Next, ''Nonviolent Action: An Active Technique of Struggle'' (chapter 2) explains that nonviolent action may be used for a diverse mixture of motives that are religious, ethical, moral, or based on expediency.&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|67}} "Passivity, submission, cowardice [have] nothing to do with the nonviolent technique,"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|65}} which is correctly understood as "''one'' type of ''active'' response."&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;ref name=emph&gt;Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonviolence has suffered scholarly neglect.&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|71–4}} Nonviolence may involve both ''acts of omission'' and ''acts of commission'',&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|68}} does not rely solely on persuading the opponent,&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|70}} and "does not depend on the assumption that man is inherently 'good'."&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|70}} These and other characteristics of nonviolence are explained and illustrates through examples from ancient Rome, colonial United States, Tsarist Russia, Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Latin America, India, Czeschoslavakia, and the Southern United States.

===Part Two: The Methods of Nonviolent Action===

Volume 2 (chapters 3 to 8) contains a detailed listing and description of specific methods of nonviolent action, such as [[boycott]]s, [[Strike action|strikes]], and [[sit-in]]s. Such a listing, Sharp says, "may assist actionists in the selection of methods most appropriate for use in a particular situation... [or] give researchers and persons evaluating the political potentialities of the nonviolent technique a greater grasp of its armory of methods of struggle."&lt;ref name=v2ref&gt;Vol. 2 of ''Politics of Nonviolent Action'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} Nearly 200 methods are listed in the table of contents, and Sharp groups them into three broad categories, ''protest and persuasion'' (ch. 3), ''noncooperation'' (chs. 4-7), and ''intervention'' (ch. 8), in terms of how they relate to the dynamics of nonviolent action (Vol. 3). These categories "ought not to be regarded as rigid, but simply as generally valid."&lt;ref name=v2ref/&gt;{{rp|114}} The methods are summarized in the adjacent table.

===Part Three: The Dynamics of Nonviolent Action===
The third volume focuses on the dynamics of nonviolent action, which always "involves continuous change in the various influences and forces which operate in that process and are constantly influencing each other. No discussion in static terms... can be valid."&lt;ref name=v3ref&gt;Vol. 3 of Politics of Nonviolent Action (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|450}} It opens with Chapter 9, ''Laying the Groundwork for Nonviolent Action'', with subsections addressing such issues as casting off fear, the social sources of power changes, leadership needs, openness and secrecy, investigation, negotiations, generating "cause-consciousness."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|473}} It also describes key elements of nonviolent strategy and tactics, pertaining to issues such as initiative, timing, numbers and strength, psychological elements, application of an [[Indirect approach]], the choice of weapons (as described in Vol. 2), and the issuance of an [[ultimatum]].

Chapter 10 describes how the onset of nonviolent action is likely to bring various types of oppression, and reviews examples and approaches for withstanding increasing repression, which is imperative, because "without willingness to face repression... the nonviolent action movement cannot hope to succeed."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|547}} Chapter 11 describes methods for maintaining the nonviolent group's solidarity, such as "Maintaining rapport"&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|575}} through regular mass meetings. Chapter 11 also extensively analyzes the threats against and needs for ongoing adherence to nonviolent discipline, "in order to bring into operation the changes that will alter relationships and achieve [the] objectives,"&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|573}} even as "the opponent... tries to provoke them to commit violence - with which he could deal more effectively."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|573}}

Chapter 12 covers "political ''[[jujutsu|jiu-jitsu]]''... one of the special processes by which nonviolent action deals with violent repression."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|657}} More specifically:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By combining nonviolent discipline with solidarity and persistence in struggle, the nonviolent actionists cause the violence of the opponent's repression to be exposed in the worst possible light. This, in turn, may lead to shifts in opinion and then to shifts in power relationships favorable to the nonviolent group. These shifts result from withdrawal of support for the opponent and the grant of support to the nonviolent actionists.&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|657}} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This chapter provides numerous historical examples of such political ''jiu-jitsu'', and analyzes such factors as the impact of third party opinion and international indignation, arousing dissent and opposition in the opponent's own camp, and increasing support and participation from the grievance group.

''Three Ways Success May Be Achieved'' (Chapter 13) describes and analyzes ''conversion'', ''accommodation'', and ''nonviolent coercion''. These represent "three broad processes, or mechanisms, by which the complicated forces utilized and produced by nonviolent action influence the opponent and his capacity for action and thereby perhaps bring success to the cause of the grievance group":&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|705–6}} 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ''conversion'' the opponent has been inwardly changed so that he wants to make the changes desired by the nonviolent actionists. In ''accommodation'', the opponent does not agree with the changes... and he could continue the struggle... but... has concluded that it is best to grant some or all of the demands.... In ''nonviolent coercion'' the opponent has not changed his mind on the issues and wants to ''continue'' the struggle, but is ''unable'' to do so; the sources of his power and means of control have been taken away from him without the use of violence . This may have been done by the nonviolent group or by the opposition and noncooperation among his own group (as, [[mutiny]] of his troops), or some combination of these.&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|706}}  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Finally, ''The Redistribution of Power'' (Chapter 14) describes how using the nonviolent technique is likely to affect the nonviolent group, and the distribution of power between the contenders and in the larger society or system. Such effects may include the ending of submissiveness, increases in hope, effects on [[aggression]], [[masculinity]], [[crime]] and [[violence]], increased group unity, and the decentralization of power. "Nonviolent action appears by its very nature to contribute to the diffusion of effective power throughout the society"&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|802}} due in part to the enhanced self-reliance of those using the technique.

and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=websites/&gt;

In ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'', [[Kenneth E. Boulding|Kenneth Boulding]] described the book as "monumental,"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}} writing that "there are some works which bear the unmistakable stamp of the classic.... and this work is a good candidate."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}} Sharp, he said, "has been called the "[[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] of nonviolence" and the "[[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] of nonviolent warfare" [and] the comparisons are by no means unjust."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}} The book "reveals a large but previously mostly unnoticed segment of human action relationship which would very properly be described as 'nonviolent warfare.'"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140–1}} Boulding asserted several parallels with a seminal work in his own field, economics, explaining that
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
this volume... reminds one of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adam Smith]]'s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''. There is a single theme of immense importance to society played in innumerable variations throughout the whole work. There is a wealth of historical illustration and detail. There is a distinct view of society as a whole seen perhaps from a somewhat unfamiliar angle. And there is a wholly honorable passion for human betterment through intellectual clarification.&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boulding stated that if a key word for economics is "exchange," then the key word for nonviolent action is "[[Civil disobedience|disobedience]]" - "One might almost call Gene Sharp's book, therefore... the discovery of disobedience, especially of large-scale disobedience.... nonviolent action is concerned with the institutionalization of a threat-defiance system."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|141}} A key to this process, Boulding argues, is the "dynamics of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]... [the] public denial of the legitimacy of some command,"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|141}} which Sharp "hints at many times," although Sharp "never quite works [it] out in detail."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|141}}
Boulding described Part II as "in some ways... the meatiest and richest part of the work,"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}} although he noted that Sharp's examples are drawn from "quite restricted range"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}} of human history:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There must be many examples from Chinese history; Latin America is hardly mentioned; and the European middle ages, with its extraordinary phenomenon of the "[[Peace and Truce of God|Truce of God]]," receives hardly a mention. Nevertheless, Sharp's examples are broad and wide and illustrate the universality and significance of this phenomenon, which, simply because it has not had a name, has been grossly neglected by conventional historians.&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boulding also reported some ways that Sharp's theoretical analysis seemed to be deficient, "even in terms of what might be called 'classical' or [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhian]] theories of nonviolence."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}} The book's analysis
&lt;blockquote&gt;
neglects the importance of "[[Satyagraha]]" or "Truth-grasping," that is, the appeal of nonviolent action to some objective truth, even an objective moral truth, as the basic source of its legitimacy. In this sense nonviolent action is closer to the spirit of science than it is to the spirit of war, in that it is concerned... that truth should prevail no matter who wins. Sharp, perhaps in too great a reaction to the accusations of sentimental [[pacifism]] sometimes brought against nonviolence, has stressed the conflictual aspects of it perhaps to the exclusion of its integrative aspects."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142–3}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[International Organization]]'', Bleicher's 21-page review stated that "What Professor Sharp... has demonstrated is that our understanding of the dependency of governments upon the
continuing [[consent of the governed]] can be translated into the development of nonviolent action as a strategy of change that is effective outside of established institutional arrangements and yet operates without the use of force."&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}} He wrote that Sharp 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
has exposed the inadequacy of assuming the monolithic character of the nation state in [[international relations]] theory. Recognition of nonviolent action as a tool in the hands of governments and citizens to influence the policies of other nations and of international organizations calls for a fundamental re-evaluation of the critical parameters in the study and conduct of international relations.&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bleicher stated that the "full utilization of this new understanding requires an expansion of the horizons of scholars and policy makers in the international arena, the collection and application of new data in the evaluation of international relations, and the development of new theoretical constructs."&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}} He warned that if we do not develop a better understanding of phenomenon related to nonviolence, we face the danger that we will be progressively less able to... design policies and institutions that can cope with the future."&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}}

In ''[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]'', [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl J. Friedrich]] wrote that Sharp considers his view of power as "much more original than it is,"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}} and that the reviewer [Friedrich] found it "exasperating to try and follow arguments with the drift of which he definitely sympathized, except for their alleged novelty."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|467}} In particular, Sharp does not
&lt;blockquote&gt;
relate [his view of power] to such classics as [[Charles Merriam]]'s magisterial treatment of power, or even [[Bertrand Russell]]'s journalistic book on the subject. He seems unaware of the reviewer's [Friedrich's] analysis of many years ago, in which the distinction between two views of power, and the dependence of power on the cooperation of those over whom it is wielded, was analytically developed, and its root in the classics was shown.&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Friedrich also stated that a "fundamental weakness"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}} of Sharp's argument was his understanding of violence "as physical violence,"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}} since "some of the most vicious forms of coercion are psychic."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465–6}} Furthermore "According to Sharp, violence by definition excludes demolition and destruction of things, such as machinery, buildings and the like. Hence, according to him, much sabotage is not violent; clearly at this point Sharp deviates markedly from popular usage."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466}} Due to the "illusory"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466}} nature of the distinction based on physical violence alone, Sharp is often "confused,"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466}} although "many thoughtful arguments are offered."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466–7}} Friedrich concluded that "the topic of how to avoid violence in political conflicts is an important one, the treatment given here is learned, but not very clear, and the results not conclusive," but that the book was a "timely one" that he hoped it will "lead to further more searching studies."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|467}}

In ''The Western Political Quarterly'', [[Harold L. Nieburg|H. L. Nieburg]] wrote that he "would like to see the work cut down to 125 pages and published in paperback as a token of new life for insurgency politics. But, this... should not deter one from the duty to welcome a monumental, competent, and sometimes exciting, work of scholarship."&lt;ref name=nieburg74/&gt;{{rp|338}}

In ''[[NASW Press Journals#Social Work|Social Work]]'', Harry Specht stated that "Sharp has performed a useful service for students of [[community organizing]] by producing an encyclopedic description of nonviolent action," and that "by shear weight of detail, the reader comes to recognize that nonviolent action has been far more pervasive than many assume."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}} Specht stated that the books flaws included "repetition and excessive detail,"&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}} and that the book "seems to imply that nonviolent action is usually undertaken by the oppressed against the state and that it is usually in the cause of positive social change. But... for example, I have just read of two massive nonviolent demonstrations in Boston, one for and the other against integration of the public schools."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}} Specht described an "absence of a clear theoretical framework.... it does not illuminate such central questions as... Why is nonviolent action used in some cases and not in others? Why does it work in some cases and not in others?"&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249–50}} The book is also "rich with writings on social movements and thin on theorists such as [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Amitai Etzioni]], [[Jerome Skolnick]], and [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] - who have dealt with conflict and violence."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}}  Still, "Sharp's work is an impressive accomplishment that will be welcomed as an important addition to the literature of community organizing."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|250}}

The original condensation was prepared by Jaime Gonzalez Bernal in Spanish in Mexico and published as La Lucha Politica Nonviolenta.... in March 1988... The English language text here is primarily Mr. Glozalez Bernal's condensation returned to English. It has been evaluated and edited with the important assistance of Caridad Inda. She has made major contributions to this text from 1987 to this edition in 2013. I have made limited recent changes and additions to both the English and the Spanish texts.... After re-reading both the English and the Spanish texts, I was amazed at the quality of the condensation made by Mr. Gonzalez Bernal. This concentrated version... provides the essence of the nonviolent technique. I decided that this English text must be published" (pp. xi-xiii).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22124">A '''thermodynamic potential''' (in fact, rather energy&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.4"&gt;ISO/IEC 80000-5, Quantities an units, Part 5 - Thermodynamics, item 5-20.4 Helmholtz energy, Helmholtz function&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.5"&gt;ISO/IEC 80000-5, Quantities an units, Part 5 - Thermodynamics, item 5-20.5, Gibbs energy, Gibbs function&lt;/ref&gt; than potential) is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity used to represent the [[thermodynamic state]] of a [[physical system|system]]. The concept of thermodynamic potentials was introduced by [[Pierre Duhem]] in 1886. [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] in his papers used the term ''fundamental [[function (mathematics)|functions]]''. One main thermodynamic potential that has a physical interpretation is the [[internal energy]] {{mvar|U}}. It is the energy of configuration of a given system of [[conservative force]]s (that is why it is called potential) and only has meaning with respect to a defined set of references (or data). Expressions for all other thermodynamic energy potentials are derivable via [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]]s from an expression for {{mvar|U}}. In [[thermodynamics]], external forces, such as [[gravity]], are typically disregarded when formulating expressions for potentials. For example, while all the [[working fluid]] in a [[steam engine]] may have higher energy due to gravity while sitting on top of [[Mount Everest]] than it would at the bottom of the [[Mariana Trench]], the [[gravitational potential energy]] term in the formula for the internal energy would usually be ignored because ''changes'' in gravitational potential within the engine during operation would be negligible. In a large system under even homogeneous external force, like the earth atmosphere under gravity, the intensive parameters (&lt;math&gt;p, T, \rho&lt;/math&gt;) should be studied locally having even in equilibrium different values in different places far from each other (see thermodynamic models of [[troposphere]]].

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=Potentials}}

== Description and interpretation ==
Five common thermodynamic potentials are:&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1353"&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1353&lt;/ref&gt;
{{table of thermodynamic potentials}}
where {{mvar|T}} = [[temperature]], {{mvar|S}} = [[entropy]], {{mvar|p}} = [[pressure]], {{mvar|V}} = [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]]. The Helmholtz free energy is in ISO/IEC standard called Helmholtz energy&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.4"/&gt; or Helmholtz function. It is often denoted by the symbol {{mvar|F}}, but the use of {{mvar|A}} is preferred by [[IUPAC]],&lt;ref&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1376&lt;/ref&gt; [[ISO]] and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 80000-5:2007, item 5-20.4&lt;/ref&gt; {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of particles of type {{mvar|i}} in the system and {{mvar|&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[chemical potential]] for an {{mvar|i}}-type particle. For the sake of completeness, the set of all {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also included as natural variables, although they are sometimes ignored.

These five common potentials are all energy potentials, but there are also [[free entropy|entropy potentials]]. The [[thermodynamic square]] can be used as a tool to recall and derive some of the potentials.

Just as in [[mechanics]], where [[potential energy]] is defined as capacity to do work, similarly different potentials have different meanings:
* [[Internal energy]] ({{mvar|U}}) is the capacity to do work plus the capacity to release heat.
* [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.5"/&gt; ({{mvar|G}}) is the capacity to do non-mechanical work.
* [[Enthalpy]] ({{mvar|H}}) is the capacity to do non-mechanical work plus the capacity to release heat.
* [[Helmholtz free energy|Helmholtz energy]]&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.4"/&gt; ({{mvar|F}}) is the capacity to do mechanical plus non-mechanical work.
From these meanings (which actually apply in specific conditions, e.g. constant pressure, temperature, etc), we can say that {{math|Δ''U''}} is the energy added to the system, {{math|Δ''F''}} is the total work done on it, {{math|Δ''G''}} is the non-mechanical work done on it, and {{math|Δ''H''}} is the sum of non-mechanical work done on the system and the heat given to it.
Thermodynamic potentials are very useful when calculating the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium results of a chemical reaction]], or when measuring the properties of materials in a chemical reaction. The chemical reactions usually take place under some constraints such as constant pressure and temperature, or constant entropy and volume, and when this is true, there is a corresponding thermodynamic potential that comes into play. Just as in mechanics, the system will tend towards lower values of potential and at equilibrium, under these constraints, the potential will take on an unchanging minimum value. The thermodynamic potentials can also be used to estimate the total amount of energy available from a thermodynamic system under the appropriate constraint.

In particular: (see [[principle of minimum energy]] for a derivation)&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

* When the entropy {{mvar|S}} and "external parameters" (e.g. volume) of a [[closed system]] are held constant, the internal energy {{mvar|U}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium. This follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics and is called the principle of minimum energy. The following three statements are directly derivable from this principle.
* When the temperature {{mvar|T}} and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the Helmholtz free energy {{mvar|F}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.
* When the pressure {{mvar|p}} and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the enthalpy {{mvar|H}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.
* When the temperature {{mvar|T}}, pressure {{mvar|p}} and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the Gibbs free energy {{mvar|G}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.

== Natural variables ==
The variables that are held constant in this process are termed the '''natural variables''' of that potential.&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1352"&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1352&lt;/ref&gt; The natural variables are important not only for the above-mentioned reason, but also because if a thermodynamic potential can be determined as a function of its natural variables, all of the thermodynamic properties of the system can be found by taking partial derivatives of that potential with respect to its natural variables and this is true for no other combination of variables. On the converse, if a thermodynamic potential is not given as a function of its natural variables, it will not, in general, yield all of the thermodynamic properties of the system.

Notice that the set of natural variables for the above four potentials are formed from every combination of the {{mvar|T}}-{{mvar|S}} and {{mvar|P}}-{{mvar|V}} variables, excluding any pairs of [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variables]]. There is no reason to ignore the {{math|''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} − {{math|''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} conjugate pairs, and in fact we may define four additional potentials for each species.&lt;ref&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1355&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[IUPAC]] notation in which the brackets contain the natural variables (other than the main four), we have:

{| class="wikitable" style="background: white"
|- 
|'''Formula'''
|'''Natural variables'''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;U[\mu_j]=U-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~S,V,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;F[\mu_j]=U-TS-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~T,V,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;H[\mu_j]=U+pV-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~S,p,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;G[\mu_j]=U+pV-TS-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~T,p,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|}

If there is only one species, then we are done.  But, if there are, say, two species, then there will be additional potentials such as &lt;math&gt;U[\mu_1,\mu_2] = U-\mu_1 N_1-\mu_2 N_2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. If there are {{mvar|D}} dimensions to the thermodynamic space, then there are {{math|[[power of two|2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;]]}} unique thermodynamic potentials. For the most simple case, a single phase ideal gas, there will be three dimensions, yielding eight thermodynamic potentials.

== The fundamental equations ==
{{main|Fundamental thermodynamic relation}}
The definitions of the thermodynamic potentials may be differentiated and, along with the first and second laws of thermodynamics, a set of differential equations known as the ''fundamental equations'' follow.&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1354"&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1354&lt;/ref&gt; (Actually they are all expressions of the same fundamental thermodynamic relation, but are expressed in different variables.) By the [[first law of thermodynamics]], any differential change in the internal energy {{mvar|U}} of a system can be written as the sum of heat flowing into the system and work done by the system on the environment, along with any change due to the addition of new particles to the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W+\sum_i \mu_i\,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δQ''}} is the [[infinitesimal]] heat flow into the system, and {{math|''δW''}} is the infinitesimal work done by the system, {{mvar|&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[chemical potential]] of particle type {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of type {{mvar|i}} particles. (Note that neither {{math|''δQ''}} nor {{math|''δW''}} are [[exact differential]]s. Small changes in these variables are, therefore, represented with {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/VAR&gt;}} rather than {{math|d}}.)

By the [[second law of thermodynamics]], we can express the internal energy change in terms of state functions and their differentials. In case of reversible changes we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = p\,\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;

where
: {{mvar|T}} is [[temperature]],
: {{mvar|S}} is [[entropy]],
: {{mvar|p}} is [[pressure]],
and {{mvar|V}} is [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], and the equality holds for reversible processes.

This leads to the standard differential form of the internal energy in case of a quasistatic reversible change:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S - p\mathrm{d}V+\sum_i \mu_i\,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|S}} and {{mvar|V}} are thermodynamic functions of state, the above relation holds also for arbitrary non-reversible changes. If the system has more external variables than just the volume that can change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation generalizes to:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T \, dS - \sum_i X_i \, dx_{i} + \sum_j \mu_j \, dN_j&lt;/math&gt;

Here the {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the [[generalized forces]] corresponding to the external variables {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Applying [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transforms]] repeatedly, the following differential relations hold for the four potentials:

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"  style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em"
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||                ||&lt;math&gt;T\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;p\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}F&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;S\,\mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;p\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}H&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||                ||&lt;math&gt;T\,\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;V\mathrm{d}p&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;S\,\mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;V\mathrm{d}p&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that the infinitesimals on the right-hand side of each of the above equations are of the natural variables of the potential on the left-hand side.
Similar equations can be developed for all of the other thermodynamic potentials of the system. There will be one fundamental equation for each thermodynamic potential, resulting in a total of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;}} fundamental equations.

The differences between the four thermodynamic potentials can be summarized as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(pV) = \mathrm{d}H - \mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{d}G - \mathrm{d}F &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(TS) = \mathrm{d}U - \mathrm{d}F = \mathrm{d}H - \mathrm{d}G &lt;/math&gt;

== The equations of state ==
We can use the above equations to derive some differential definitions of some thermodynamic parameters. If we define {{math|&amp;Phi;}} to stand for any of the thermodynamic potentials, then the above equations are of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Phi=\sum_i x_i\,\mathrm{d}y_i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are conjugate pairs, and the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the natural variables of the potential {{math|&amp;Phi;}}. From the [[chain rule]] it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;x_j=\left(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y_j}\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ≠ ''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the set of all natural variables of {{math|&amp;Phi;}} except {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} . This yields expressions for various thermodynamic parameters in terms of the derivatives of the potentials with respect to their natural variables. These equations are known as [[equation of state|''equations of state'']] since they specify parameters of the [[thermodynamic state]].&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; If we restrict ourselves to the potentials {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|F}}, {{mvar|H}} and {{mvar|G}}, then we have:

:&lt;math&gt;
+T=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
-p=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
+V=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial p}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
-S=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
~\mu_j=
\left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial N_j}\right)_{X,Y,\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where, in the last equation, {{mvar|ϕ}} is any of the thermodynamic potentials {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|F}}, {{mvar|H}}, {{mvar|G}} and &lt;math&gt;{X,Y,\{N_{j\ne i}\}}&lt;/math&gt; are the set of natural variables for that potential, excluding {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} . If we use all potentials, then we will have more equations of state such as

:&lt;math&gt;
-N_j=\left(\frac{\partial U[\mu_j]}{\partial \mu_j}\right)_{S,V,\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and so on. In all, there will be {{mvar|D}}&amp;nbsp;equations for each potential, resulting in a total of {{math|''D'' 2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;}} equations of state. If the {{mvar|D}}&amp;nbsp;equations of state for a particular potential are known, then the fundamental equation for that potential can be determined. This means that all thermodynamic information about the system will be known, and that the fundamental equations for any other potential can be found, along with the corresponding equations of state.

== The Maxwell relations ==
{{Main|Maxwell relations}}

Again, define {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be conjugate pairs, and the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be the natural variables of some potential {{math|&amp;Phi;}}.  We may take the "cross differentials" of the state equations,  which obey the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y_j}
\left(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y_k}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne k}\}}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}
=
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y_k}
\left(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y_j}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne k}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

From these we get the [[Maxwell relations]].&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1353"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; There will be {{sfrac|(''D'' − 1)|2}} of them for each potential giving a total of {{sfrac|''D''(''D'' − 1)|2}} equations in all. If we restrict ourselves the {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|F}}, {{mvar|H}}, {{mvar|G}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial V}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial S}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial p}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}} =
+\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}} =
+\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial p}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equations of state involving the chemical potential we get equations such as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial N_j}\right)_{V,S,\{N_{i\ne j}\}} =
\left(\frac{\partial \mu_j}{\partial S}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and using the other potentials we can get equations such as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial N_j}{\partial V}\right)_{S,\mu_j,\{N_{i\ne j}\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \mu_j}\right)_{S,V\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial N_j}{\partial N_k}\right)_{S,V,\mu_j,\{N_{i\ne j,k}\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial \mu_k}{\partial \mu_j}\right)_{S,V\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Euler integrals ==
Again, define {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be conjugate pairs, and the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be the natural variables of the internal energy.
Since all of the natural variables of the internal energy {{mvar|U}} are [[extensive quantity|extensive quantities]]

:&lt;math&gt;U(\{\alpha y_i\})=\alpha U(\{y_i\})&lt;/math&gt;

it follows from [[Homogeneous function|Euler's homogeneous function theorem]] that the internal energy can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;U(\{y_i\})=\sum_j y_j\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial y_j}\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}&lt;/math&gt;

From the equations of state, we then have:

:&lt;math&gt;U=TS-pV+\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the expressions for the other main potentials we have:

:&lt;math&gt;F=  -pV+\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H=TS   +\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G=      \sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

As in the above sections, this process can be carried out on all of the other thermodynamic potentials. Note that the Euler integrals are sometimes also referred to as fundamental equations.

== The Gibbs–Duhem relation ==
Deriving the [[Gibbs–Duhem equation]] from basic thermodynamic state equations is straightforward.&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1354"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran &amp; Shapiro, p. 538&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Equating any thermodynamic potential definition with its Euler integral expression yields:

:&lt;math&gt;U=TS-PV+\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating, and using the second law:

:&lt;math&gt;dU=TdS-PdV+\sum_i\mu_i\,dN_i&lt;/math&gt;

yields:

:&lt;math&gt;0=SdT-VdP+\sum_i N_i d\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the Gibbs–Duhem relation. The Gibbs–Duhem is a relationship among the intensive parameters of the system. It follows that for a simple system with {{mvar|I}} components, there will be {{math|''I'' + 1}} independent parameters, or degrees of freedom. For example, a simple system with a single component will have two degrees of freedom, and may be specified by only two parameters, such as pressure and volume for example. The law is named after [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Pierre Duhem]].

== Chemical reactions ==
Changes in these quantities are useful for assessing the degree to which a chemical reaction will proceed. The relevant quantity depends on the reaction conditions, as shown in the following table. {{math|Δ}} denotes the change in the potential and at equilibrium the change will be zero.

{| class="wikitable"
! !! Constant {{mvar|V}} !! Constant {{mvar|p}}
|-
! Constant {{mvar|S}}
| {{math|Δ''U''}} || {{math|Δ''H''}}
|-
! Constant {{mvar|T}}
| {{math|Δ''F''}} || {{math|Δ''G''}}
|}

Most commonly one considers reactions at constant {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|T}}, so the Gibbs free energy is the most useful potential in studies of chemical reactions.

The developers and users of these models, the decision makers using information obtained from the results of these models, and the individuals affected by decisions based on such models are all rightly concerned with whether a model and its results are "correct".&lt;ref name ="Sargent"&gt;Sargent, Robert G. [http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc11papers/016.pdf "VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF SIMULATION MODELS"]. Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern is addressed through verification and validation of the simulation model.

Simulation models are approximate imitations of real-world systems and they never exactly imitate the real-world system.  Due to that, a model should be verified and validated to the degree needed for the models intended purpose or application.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

The verification and validation of simulation model starts after functional specifications have been documented and initial model development has been completed.&lt;ref name ="Carson" &gt;Carson, John, [http://informs-sim.org/wsc02papers/008.pdf "MODEL VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION"]. Proceedings of the 2002 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; Verification and validation is an iterative process that takes place throughout the development of a model.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;

== Verification ==
In the context of computer simulation, '''verification''' of a model is the process of confirming that it is correctly implemented with respect to the conceptual model (it matches specifications and assumptions deemed acceptable for the given purpose of application).&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
During verification the model is tested to find and fix errors in the implementation of the model.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
Various processes and techniques are used to assure the model matches specifications and assumptions with respect to the model concept. 
The objective of model verification is to ensure that the implementation of the model is correct.

There are many techniques that can be utilized to verify a model.
Including, but not limited to, have the model checked by an expert, making logic flow diagrams that include each logically possible action, examining the model output for reasonableness under a variety of settings of the input parameters, and using an interactive debugger.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;
Many software engineering techniques used for [[software verification]] are applicable to simulation model verification.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

== Validation ==
Validation checks the accuracy of the model's representation of the real system.  Model validation is defined to mean "substantiation that a computerized model within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; A model should be built for a specific purpose or set of objectives and its validity determined for that purpose.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

There are many approaches that can be used to validate a computer model.  The approaches range from subjective reviews to objective statistical tests.  One approach that is commonly used is to have the model builders determine validity of the model through a series of tests.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

Naylor and Finger [1967] formulated a three-step approach to model validation that has been widely followed:&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

Step 1. Build a model that has high face validity.

Step 2. Validate model assumptions.

Step 3. Compare the model input-output transformations to corresponding input-output transformations for the real system.&lt;ref&gt;NAYLOR, T. H., AND J. M. FINGER [1967], [http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/14/2/B-92 "Verification of Computer Simulation Models"], Management Science, Vol. 2, pp. B92– B101., cited in Banks, Jerry; Carson, John S.; Nelson, Barry L.; Nicol, David M. ''Discrete-Event System Simulation'' Fifth Edition, Upper Saddle River, Pearson Education, Inc. 2010 p. 396. {{ISBN|0136062121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face validity ===
A model that has '''face validity''' appears to be a reasonable imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Face validity is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Sensitivity to model inputs can also be used to judge face validity.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.

=== Validation of model assumptions ===
Assumptions made about a model generally fall into two categories: structural assumptions about how system works and data assumptions.

==== Structural assumptions ====
Assumptions made about how the system operates and how it is physically arranged are structural assumptions.  For example, the number of servers in a fast food drive through lane and if there is more than one how are they utilized?  Do the servers work in parallel where a customer completes a transaction by visiting a single server or does one server take orders and handle payment while the other prepares and serves the order.  Many structural problems in the model come from poor or incorrect assumptions.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  If possible the workings of the actual system should be closely observed to understand how it operates.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  The systems structure and operation should also be verified with users of the actual system.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;

==== Data assumptions ====
There must be a sufficient amount of appropriate data available to build a conceptual model and validate a model.  Lack of appropriate data is often the reason attempts to validate a model fail.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;  Data should be verified to come from a reliable source.  A typical error is assuming an inappropriate statistical distribution for the data.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;  The assumed statistical model should be tested using goodness of fit tests and other techniques.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; Examples of goodness of fit tests are the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[chi-square test]].  Any outliers in the data should be checked.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

=== Validating input-output transformations ===
The model is viewed as an input-output transformation for these tests.  The validation test consists of comparing outputs from the system under consideration to model outputs for the same set of input conditions.  Data recorded while observing the system must be available in order to perform this test.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The model output that is of primary interest should be used as the measure of performance.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if system under consideration is a fast food drive through where input to model is customer arrival time and the output measure of performance is average customer time in line, then the actual arrival time and time spent in line for customers at the drive through would be recorded.  The model would be run with the actual arrival times and the model average time in line would be compared with the actual average time spent in line using one or more tests.

==== Hypothesis testing ====
[[Statistical hypothesis testing]] using the [[Student's t-test|t-test]] can be used as a basis to accept the model as valid or reject it as invalid.

The hypothesis to be tested is
:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance = the system measure of performance
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance ≠ the system measure of performance.

The test is conducted for a given sample size and level of significance or α.  To perform the test a number ''n'' statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and an average or expected value, E(Y), for the variable of interest is produced.  Then the test statistic, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is computed for the given α, ''n'', E(Y) and the observed value for the system  μ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;t_0 = {(E(Y)-u_0)}/{(S/\sqrt{n})}&lt;/math&gt; and the critical value for α and n-1 the degrees of freedom

: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated.

If 
: &lt;math&gt; \left\vert t_0 \right\vert &gt; t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the model needs adjustment.

There are two types of error that can occur using hypothesis testing, rejecting a valid model called type I error or "model builders risk" and accepting an invalid model called Type II error, β, or "model user's risk".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The level of significance or α is equal the probability of type I error.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; If α is small then rejecting the null hypothesis is a strong conclusion.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if α = 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected there is only a 0.05 probability of rejecting a model that is valid.  Decreasing the probability of a type II error is very important.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The probability of correctly detecting an invalid model is 1 - β.  The probability of a type II error is dependent of the sample size and the actual difference between the sample value and the observed value.  Increasing the sample size decreases the risk of a type II error.

===== Model accuracy as a range =====
A statistical technique where the amount of model accuracy is specified as a range has recently been developed.  The technique uses hypothesis testing to accept a model if the difference between a model's variable of interest and a system's variable of interest is within a specified range of accuracy.&lt;ref name="Sargent2"&gt;Sargent, R. G. 2010. "A New Statistical Procedure for Validation of Simulation and Stochastic Models." Technical Report SYR-EECS-2010-06, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement is that both the system data and model data be approximately [[Normal distribution|Normally]] [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|Independent and Identically Distributed (NIID)]].  The [[Student's t-test|t-test]] statistic is used in this technique.  If the mean of the model is μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and the mean of system is μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; then the difference between the model and the system is D = μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.  The hypothesis to be tested is if D is within the acceptable range of accuracy. Let L = the lower limit for accuracy and U = upper limit for accuracy.  Then

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; L ≤ D ≤ U
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; D &lt; L or D &gt; U

is to be tested.

The operating characteristic (OC) curve is the probability that the null hypothesis is accepted when it is true.  The OC curve characterizes the probabilities of both type I and II errors.  Risk curves for model builder's risk and model user's can be developed from the OC curves.  Comparing curves with fixed sample size tradeoffs between model builder's risk and model user's risk can be seen easily in the risk curves.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt; If model builder's risk, model user's risk, and the upper and lower limits for the range of accuracy are all specified then the sample size needed can be calculated.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt;

==== Confidence intervals ====
Confidence intervals can be used to evaluate if a model is "close enough"&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; to a system for some variable of interest.  The difference between the known model value, μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the system value, μ, is checked to see if it is less than a value small enough that the model is valid with respect that variable of interest.  The value is denoted by the symbol ε.  To perform the test a number, ''n'', statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and a mean or expected value, E(Y) or μ for simulation output variable of interest Y, with a standard deviation ''S'' is produced.  A confidence level is selected, 100(1-α).  An interval, [a,b], is constructed by

: &lt;math&gt;a = E(Y) - t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n} \qquad and \qquad b = E(Y) + t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;,
where 
: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is the critical value from the t-distribution for the given level of significance and n-1 degrees of freedom.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε then the model needs to be calibrated since in both cases the difference is larger than acceptable.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε then the model is acceptable as in both cases the error is close enough.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε or [[vice versa]] then additional runs of the model are needed to shrink the interval.

==== Graphical comparisons ====
If statistical assumptions cannot be satisfied or there is insufficient data for the system a graphical comparisons of model outputs to system outputs can be used to make a subjective decisions, however other objective tests are preferable.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2881">[[Image:Fair Trade Products.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fair Trade goods sold in an Italian Worldshop]]'''Worldshops''', '''world shops''' or '''Fair Trade Shops''' are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] products. Worldshops also typically organize various  educational Fair Trade activities and play an active role in [[trade justice]] and other North-South political campaigns.

Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks.

Although the movement emerged in [[Europe]] and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]].

== History ==
[[Image:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|Oxfam shop on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].]]
The start of the movement is usually attributed to the first worldshop in Europe, which was founded by [[Oxfam]] in 1959. The Oxfam shop sold Chinese bric-a-brac that had been sourced from Chinese [[refugees]] that had escaped the [[Chinese civil war|Communist revolution]] to [[Hong Kong]]. However, some sources credit the first fair trade shop that had been opened in the US in 1958, selling [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] needlework.

The shops were not called worldshops at that time, however. [[Alternative trading organisation]]s imported various [[third world]] goods, such as [[sugarcane|cane]] [[sugar]] starting in the 1960s, and still continuing today. These goods were sold in "third world shops" or "developing country shops" (the actual name differing from country to country). The most active organisations were operating in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The term "worldshop" came into existence in the 1990s. In 1994, worldshops organised themselves under the auspices of NEWS, the [[Network of European Worldshops]], who now falls under the [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. The [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fairtrade]] label, which is used on fair trade products, has its roots in the 1980s worldshop movement.

== Aims ==
Worldshops' aim is to make [[trade]] as direct and [[fair trade|fair]] with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees subsistence and positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain.
