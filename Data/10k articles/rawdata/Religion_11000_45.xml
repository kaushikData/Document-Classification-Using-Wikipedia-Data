The '''1920 Revolution Brigades''' ([[Arabic]] كتائب ثورة العشرين ''Kitā'ib Thawrat al-ʿIshrīn'') is a [[Sunni]] militia group in [[Iraq]], which includes former members of the disbanded Iraqi army. The group has used [[improvised explosive device]]s, and armed attacks against U.S. occupation forces. The group comprises the military wing of the [[Islamic Resistance Movement (Iraq)|Islamic Resistance Movement]]. The group is named in reference to the 1920 [[Iraqi revolt against the British]].

As of 2014, the group was actively involved in the [[General Military Council for Iraqi Revolutionaries|MCIR]] insurgent network, particularly in Fallujah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aymennjawad.org/15037/the-1920s-revolution-brigades] The 1920s Revolution Brigades&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegiances==
A US military spokesman states that the "concerned local nationals" group is now aligned with U.S. forces,&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. rebrands Iraq ex-insurgents |newspaper=Washington Post |date=25 August 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/25/AR2007082500638.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102230336/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/25/AR2007082500638.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2012 |postscript=|accessdate=29 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Brigades denied this in a posting on its web site: "We say to … the occupation and to your followers and agents that you made a very big lie" in linking the group with the Diyala anti-al Qaida campaign.&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/17302.html |title=Offensives elsewhere, but Baghdad remains deadliest for U.S. troops |accessdate=26 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001937/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/17302.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group maintains that the "[[Hamas of Iraq|Iraqi Hamas]]" organization, which consisted of members who left the Brigades before the Diyala operation, were the ones involved in the operation.&lt;ref name="UrukNet"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://uruknet.info/?p=m35715&amp;s1=h1|title= Iraqi Resistance Report for events of Sunday, 26 August 2007|accessdate=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrigadeMemo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.islammemo.cc/article1.aspx?id=49719|title= 1920 Revolution Bridage memo denying involvement in Diyala Operations|accessdate=29 August 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070828232342/http://www.islammemo.cc/article1.aspx?id=49719|archivedate=28 August 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi Prime MinisterNuri al-Maliki]] has feared such US-armed '[[Awakening movements in Iraq|concerned local citizens]]' are an armed Sunni opposition in the making, and has argued that such groups should be under the command of the Iraqi Army or police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iMzKGlyT_ahqRjtyXrAUrKIQLncA |title=US buys 'concerned citizens' in Iraq, but at what price? |accessdate=4 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907015324/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iMzKGlyT_ahqRjtyXrAUrKIQLncA |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The 1920 Revolution Brigades describes its aim as to establish a liberated and independent Iraqi state on an Islamic basis. It has been active in the area west of Baghdad, in the regions of [[Abu Ghraib]], [[Khan Dari]] and [[Fallujah]] and in the governorates of [[Nineva Governorate|Ninwi]], [[Diyala Governorate|Diyali]] and [[Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar]].&lt;ref name="AsiaTimes"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Raman |first=B |title=Kidnappings keep Iraq pot boiling |newspaper=Asia Times |date=21 January 2005 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GA21Ak03.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100805173306/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GA21Ak03.html |archivedate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the group (Literally "Brigades of the Revolution of the Twenty") refers to the 1920 revolution against British colonial rule in Iraq, drawing an implicit parallel between the nationalist resistance against that occupation with the guerrillas fighting coalition forces today. They are the military wing of the [[Islamic Resistance Movement (Iraq)|Islamic Resistance Movement]]. The logo of the group is a map of Iraq, with a [[Quran]] on top of it, and the verse "Fight them, God shall torture them by your hands". In the middle there is a mirrored symbol of an [[AK-47]], with an [[Iraqi flag]] attached to it. Between the gun and the flag, a small print says "Islamic Resistance movement", and below, a larger print reads "Brigades of the 20th Revolution."

==History==
[[File:Former Emblems of 1920 Revolution Brigade.svg|thumb|Former emblems of the 1920 Revolution Brigade, showing the growing Islamic influences over time.]]
The Brigade first emerged in a 16 July statement in which it claimed that U.S. forces were sustaining higher casualties than were being reported.&lt;ref name="AsiaTimes"/&gt; Since then, it resurfaced periodically, including in graffiti in such insurgent strongholds as [[Fallujah]]. This group appears to concentrate on guerilla activity, rather than terrorism, and is sensitive to the opinions of the established [[Sunni Muslim]] clergy in Iraq (in contrast to groups such as [[Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad]]). High-profile operations include the kidnapping of American citizen [[Dean Sadek]] in November 2004 (he appeared in two hostage videos but was never found) and the bombing of the [[al-Arabiya]] television network headquarters in Baghdad in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,138359,00.html |publisher=Fox News |title=Arab TV Airs Tape of U.S. Hostage |date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIPT"&gt;{{cite web |title=1920 Revolution Brigades |work=MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base |publisher=Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism |date=1 March 2007 |url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4438 |accessdate=24 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218053401/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4438 |archivedate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also shot down several American helicopters in the Fallujah region.&lt;ref name="AsiaTimes"/&gt;

Little is known about the group's leadership. On 2 January 2005, the [[Ministry of Defence (Iraq)]] reported that [[Iraqi security forces]] arrested [[Hatim al-Zawba'i]], whom they identified as a commander of the 1920 Revolution Brigades. In a statement issued on 13 February 2006, the group vowed to "carry on [[jihad]] until the liberation and victory or [until they are] martyred.&lt;ref name="MIPT"/&gt;

==Organization split==
On March 2007 some of its members broke off from the 1920 Revolution Brigades to form [[Hamas of Iraq]].

In a statement issued on 18 March 2007, the 1920 Revolution Brigades stated that it had dissolved into two new brigades, ''Islamic Conquest'' and ''Islamic Jihad''. Islamic Conquest became [[Hamas of Iraq]] and is the name chosen for its military wing. Islamic Jihad took over the name [[Twentieth Revolution Brigades]], promising to uphold its jihadi inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://siteinstitute.org/bin/articles.cgi?ID=publications271907&amp;Category=publications&amp;Subcategory=0|title= SITE Institute:Twentieth Revolution Brigades and Hamas of Iraq Individually Claim Downing American Helicopters in Baghdad|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061304/http://siteinstitute.org/bin/articles.cgi?ID=publications271907&amp;Category=publications&amp;Subcategory=0 |archivedate=28 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships with others==
The 1920 Revolution Brigade has used bombings, kidnappings, and armed attacks against U.S. forces but does not target non-Muslims or Shiites, staying out of the sectarian war. As a result, it has developed a growing rift with [[The Jihad Base Organization in Mesopotamia]], which has used suicide bombings to often target Shiites which they regard as infidels. The 1920 Revolution Brigade turned down an offer to pledge allegiance to an insurgent coalition group, the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), established by the Jihad Base Organization in Mesopotamia.

On 27 March 2007, the leader of the 1920 Revolution Bridage, Harith Dhahir Khamis al-Dari (nephew of the most prominent Sunni Iraqi cleric, Haith al-Dari) was killed in an ISI ambush. Intermittent gunbattles have taken place between fighters of the 1920 Revolution Brigades and the Islamic State in Iraq, and rumors have circulated of negotiations between members of the group and the Iraqi government and U.S. forces.

Although the group has used bombings, kidnappings, and armed attacks against U.S. forces, on 20 June 2007, ''The Washington Post'' reported that, per telephone interview with Lt. Col. Joseph Davidson, executive officer of the 2nd Infantry Division, U.S. forces were now "partnering with Sunni insurgents from the 1920 Revolution Brigades, which includes former members of ousted president Saddam Hussein's disbanded army."&lt;ref name="WashPost2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/19/AR2007061900315.html|title=Offensive Targets Al-Qaeda in Iraq |work=The Washington Post |location=Baghdad |author=John Ward Anderson |author2=Salih Dehima |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has since replied that: "We say to … the occupation and to your followers and agents that you made a very big lie" in linking us with the Diyala anti-al Qaida campaign.&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc.com"/&gt; The group maintains that the organization to which the US military spokesman referred had become the "[[Hamas of Iraq|Iraqi Hamas]]" organization, which consisted of members who left before the Diyala operation and were no longer associated with the 1920 Brigades.&lt;ref name="UrukNet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrigadeMemo"/&gt;

In October 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the 1920 Revolution Brigades would not join [[Political Council for the Iraqi Resistance|an alliance of six other Iraqi insurgent groups]]. The six groups listed a 14-point political program, including a call for continued action against US forces and a declaration that all laws passed by the Iraq government were null and void. A spokesman for the brigades said it did not join because it did not want to fight with those Sunni tribal groups working with the US against al-Qaida. The spokesman also denied an Economist report that the 1920 Revolution Brigades was working with Americans, and insisted the group was still attacking Americans.&lt;ref name="GuardBRAlliance"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,2189436,00.html|title=Sunni insurgents form alliance against US |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Ewen |last=MacAskill |date=12 October 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheikh Sir Abdul Qadir''' (15 March 1874 – 9 February 1950) was a [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] [[editor]] and  a Muslim community leader in [[British India]].&lt;ref name=salaam/&gt;

He led the famous  Muslim organization, [[Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam]] and used his position as the leader of this organization to form other, pro-partition, organizations. He was an early activist of the [[Pakistan Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7q9EubOYZmwC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;lpg=PA282&amp;dq=Abdul+Qadir+and+Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MwA8UgLWpV&amp;sig=OBvlK-96VFrqm46kon-vz_dzjvg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8mvnl9MXXAhVi4oMKHecvA2EQ6AEIXjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Abdul%20Qadir%20and%20Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam&amp;f=false|title=Indian Muslims and Partition of India|publisher=GoogleBooks (books.google.com website)|author= S.

==Early life and career==
Qadir was born in [[Ludhiana]] on 15 March 1872. He was the editor of  ''The Observer'', the first Muslim newspaper published in English in 1895.  In 1901, he launched the magazine ''Makhzan'', an [[Urdu language]] publication.  This magazine published the early works of [[Allama Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref name=salaam/&gt;  

In 1904, Qadir went to study law in London, and was called to the bar in 1907 after which he returned to India, where he served as a member of the Punjab Legislative Council and ''the minister of education'' in [[Punjab, British India]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=salaam&gt;[http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/biography/viewentry.php?id=53 Profile of Abdul Qadir on salaam.co.uk website] Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Qadir was knighted by the British in the 1927 Birthday Honours and in 1935 became a member of the governing council of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wokingmuslim.org/photos/is-rev-mar35.htm photo and very limited explanation about Qadir] Islamic Review, Published March 1935, Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  He died on 9 February 1950 at the age of 77 and was buried in [[Miani Sahib Graveyard]], Lahore.

[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]'s book ''Mahatma Gandhi'' contains a chapter by Qadir, where he particularly relates his various experiences with the understanding of Gandhi in Europe in the 1930s.

His son [[Manzur Qadir]], was a prominent Pakistani jurist who served as the [[Foreign Minister of Pakistan]] during the military rule of [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1043960 Without a foreign minister] Dawn (newspaper), 19 September 2013, Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abhayananda''' (born 1842), born '''Marie Louise''', was the first woman initiated into [[Vivekananda]]'s mission. She was also the first American female and a female Westerner to have become a [[swami]] [[monk]].&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivekananda.net/pplheknew/others/abhayananda.html |title=Marie Louise AKA Swami Abhayananda - Frank Parlato Jr |publisher=Vivekananda.net |date=1912-08-10 |accessdate=2015-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222201103/http://www.vivekananda.net/pplheknew/others/abhayananda.html |archivedate=2015-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louise was initiated by [[Vivekananda]] at [[Thousand Island Park]] in 1895. She was given the [[Monasticism|monastic]] name Abhayananda. She later disassociated herself from Vivekananda and preached philosophy, retaining the same name. Abhayananda claimed to be the only female swami in the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Oldmeadow, Harry | authorlink=Harry Oldmeadow | title=Journeys East: Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions | year=2004 | isbn=978-0941532570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were many other Westeners who, in the first half of the century, became Hindu disciples/sannyasis/gurus: others included the Mother (b. Mira Alfassa, Paris, 1878), perhaps the first Westener to become a guru in India; Swami Abhayananda (b. Marie Lousie) one of the only three Westeners whom Vivekananda, in 1895, initiated as sannyasis&amp;mdash;the other two being Leon Landsberg/Swami Kripananda and Dr Street/Swami Yogananda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vC1qAj6RbRQC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=Mary+Louise,+Abhayananda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lrx6U3iiAT&amp;sig=d43CzOAX581eMcwVqKZr1c5I-Jo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GMoTT8auM8PLrQfixPiTAg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Louise%2C%20Abhayananda&amp;f=false |title=Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions - Harry Oldmeadow - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal details==
Abhayananda immigrated to the US in 1865. Before becoming a swami and entering monastic life, she lectured on a number of issues such as [[woman's rights]], and was a [[Suffragette|suffragist]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda_biography/08_vedanta_in_america.htm |title=Vedanta in America |publisher=Ramakrishnavivekananda.info |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There appears to be only one sketch depicting her and only one photograph, appearing in an article as a "convert to [[Hinduism]]" in [[the Lethbridge Herald]] on August 10, 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivekananda.net/NewDiscoveries/SketchesAbhayananda.html |title=New Discoveries - Swami Abhayananda - Frank Parlato Jr |publisher=Vivekananda.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a letter written by her addressed to one of his disciples, [[Sister Christine]], referring her last arrival in [[India]] as an allusion of her desire for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivekananda.net/KnownLetters/1902.html |title=Letters written by Swami Vivekananda - Frank Parlato Jr |publisher=Vivekananda.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her exact death details are unknown.

An article in [[The New York Times]] parsed "Swami Abhayananda": "Swami means monk, Abahaya means fearless, and nanda means bliss. The literal interpretation of her name is, therefore, the 'Monk of Fearless Bliss'."

Marie Louise disassociated herself from Vivekananda after she arrived [[India]]. [[Sister Nivedita]]'s letters portrayed Louise as an egotistic, self-centered woman that had little interest in hearing the Vivekananda's teachings.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt; Louise was also alleged to have come from a destitute past and to have been in need of financial assistance.

==Her mission==
According to Louise:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I teach four classes of philosophy-the Karma Loga(reporter might have misspelt for [[Karma Yoga]]), which is the philosophy of actions; the Bhakti Loga(reporter might have misspelt for [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]], the philosophy of devotion and love; the Rajah Loga (reporter might have misspelt for [[Raja Yoga]]), a [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] man, and the Gnana Loga (reporter might have misspelt for [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]], or philosophy. ... I teach Christ the man. All men are Christs, and are [[Crucifixion|crucified]] on the cross of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Regarding women's suffrage, Louise said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The woman Suffragists, are children playing with dolls, but if men vote, then women have a right to vote on the theory of right; but on the plane of love they have no right to vote. A 'right' implies brute force and power. A King has a 'right' to behead half of his subjects if he chooses, if the subjects preserve their 'right' to live. It is the 'right' of brutes. My [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of government is no government at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankreport.com/vivekananda/PPlHeKnew/Others/LeonLandsberg.html |title=Leon Landsberg - Frank Parlato Jr |publisher=Frankreport.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015304/http://www.frankreport.com/vivekananda/PPlHeKnew/Others/LeonLandsberg.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad''' (All India Akhara Council), one of the organisation of [[Hindu]] [[Sant (religion)|Sants]] (saints) and [[Sadhu]]s (ascetics) in [[India]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Akhara Parishad welcomes verdict on Ayodhya|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/akhara-parishad-welcomes-verdict-on-ayodhya/story-GoYoZt7toABuouUtCZEEcP.html|publisher=The Hindustan Times|date=2010-09-30|accessdate=2010-10-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101004003017/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Akhara-Parishad-welcomes-verdict-on-Ayodhya/Article1-606592.aspx| archivedate= 4 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite web|title=Akhara Parishad do not see eye-to-eye with VHP|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/06/14/stories/2005061410370300.htm|publisher=The Hindu|date=2005-06-14|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABAP is composed of 14 ''[[Akhara]]s'', or organisations of Hindu sants and sadhus. [[Nirmohi Akhara]] (involved in the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] [[Ayodhya dispute|dispute]] in Ayodhya) and [[Shri Dattatreya Akhara]] are two of the prominent akharas which are part of it.

==Organisation==
The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad is based on the system of ''Akharas'' in Hindu society. An ''Akhara'' literally means a [[wrestling ring]] in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], but also stands for a place of debate.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite book|title=What Is Hinduism?: Modern Adventures Into A Profound Global Faith|authors=Editors of Hinduism Today|pages=244|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|year=2007|isbn=978-1-934145-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 14 such organisations based on the form of [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] they adhere to. Most Akharas are [[Vaishnavas]] (followers of Lord [[Vishnu]]) and [[Shaivism]] (followers of Lord [[Shiva]]).

==History==
The system of ''Akharas'' may date as far back as early 8th century, when [[Adi Shankaracharya]] is believed to have established seven ''Akharas'' (possibly 10 as they are also known as Dasnaami): Mahanirvani, Niranjani, Juna, Atal, Avahan, Agni and Anand Akhara. The earliest recorded founding of an ''Akhara'' was that of the Abhana in 547 CE.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; During periods of [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim rule in India]] and later [[British Raj|British rule]], the ''Akharas'' congregated and organised together, especially during the ''[[Kumbha Mela]]'' to work for the preservation of Hindu religion and culture.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; In 1565, Madhusudana Sarasvati started preparing ''Akharas'' as an armed [[military force]] to resist invasions and protect Hindus.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

==Politics==
{{Hinduism}}
While the ABAP does not participate in electoral politics, it has a position of great importance in Hindu society as a leading Hindu leadership organisation. At times, it has cooperated with the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), a Hindu religious organisation more openly involved in politics and part of the ''[[Sangh Parivar]]'' of [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] organisations. However, the ABAP has also openly criticised the VHP for raising unnecessary controversies and refused to follow an agenda set by the VHP.&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite book|title=India Votes: Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha Elections 1999, 2000: Poll Analysis, Election Data, and Party Manifestos|author=Mahendra Singh Rana|publisher=B.R. Pub. Corp.|year=2000|isbn=978-81-7646-139-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad has encouraged and supported the movement for the construction of a [[Ram Janmabhumi|Ram Janmabhumi Temple]] on the site where the now-demolished [[Babri Mosque]] stood in [[Ayodhya]]. The place is believed to be the site of birth of [[Rama]], the eighth and one of the most popular [[Avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]]. In 1989, the [[Nirmohi Akhara]] filed litigation regarding the site, and in 2010 their claim was upheld by the Allahabad High Court, which gave the Akhara control of one-third of the site. The ABAP welcomed the verdict, asserting that it would prevent further exploitation of the issue by political parties.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

[[File:AMORC_Symbol.png|thumb|right | Official Worldwide Emblem of the Rosicrucian Order]]
[[File:Mbstacy cross.jpg|thumb|right|A Rosicrucian Master's Cross, from the AMORC Rosicrucian Library in San Jose]]
{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}
The '''Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis''' (AMORC), also known as the '''''Rosicrucian Order''''', is the largest [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] organization in the world. It has various lodges, chapters and other affiliated bodies throughout the globe, operating in 19 different languages.

AMORC claims an association with a "[[perennial philosophy]]", often referred to as "[[The Primordial Tradition]]". The Order further states that it is heir and custodian of the "Rose-Croix" of the past, thereby making it the oldest existing Traditional Fraternity and a modern-day manifestation of the 'Rosicrucian Fraternity' of old, which is believed by some to have originated in the traditions of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mystery schools]]. The ancient Mysteries are said to have been preserved through the millennia by closed secret societies until the early years of 17th Century Europe. At that point, according to AMORC internal mythology, the time was right for the existence of this body of secret knowledge to become open, i.e. revealed, to the world, in the form of the [[Rosicrucian Manifestos|Rosicrucian manifestos]].
Famous seventeenth century Rosicrucian [[Michael Maier]] described the origins of Rosicrucianism as "Egyptian, Brahmanic, derived from the Mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maier|first1=Michael|title=Silentium Post Clamores, Hoc Est, Tractatus Apologeticus: Quo Causae Non Solum Clamorum, seu Revelationum Fraternitatis Germanicae de R.C. sed &amp; Silentii, seu non redditae ad singulorum vota responsionis, una cum malevolorum refutatione, traduntur &amp; demonstrantur|date=1617|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=l9tb8rZUGQUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his other works also allude to the mysterious origins of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Real History of the Rosicrucians: Chapter X. Rosicrucian Apologists: Michael Maier|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/rhr/rhr20.htm|website = www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, AMORC is regarded as representing an "open cycle" of the ancient Rosicrucian tradition, its existence being a "reactivation" of Rosicrucian teaching in the United States, with previous Rosicrucian colonies in the United States having become dormant.

AMORC presents itself as a worldwide philosophical and humanistic, non sectarian and apolitical fraternal order devoted to "the study of the elusive mysteries of life and the universe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amorc.org/ Official AMORC International Web Site Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also open to both men and women of legal adult age (18 years old in most countries) regardless of their various religious persuasions.

== Name ==
The name AMORC is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] title ''Antiquus Mysticusque Ordo Rosæ Crucis'' ("Ancient and Mystic Order of the Rosy Cross" – "Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis"). [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]], author and mystic who re-activated AMORC in the United States of America, wrote that "from the very start, and with the issuance of the first public manifesto, the correct name of the international Rosicrucian organization was used, namely, the ''Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis''. This is a slightly abbreviated form of the original Latin name, ''Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis'', and the initials AMORC were immediately used as well as the true and original symbol of the Rosicrucian Order – the golden cross with but ''one red rose'' in the center".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, H. Spencer ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'', pp. 180–181, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1929, {{ISBN|0-912057-37-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMORC holds legal rights to the above-mentioned titles including the title "Rosicrucian Order".

==Teachings==
AMORC's teachings cover what may be termed the "Sacred Sciences" and include ideas based on the major [[philosopher]]s, particularly [[Pythagoras]], [[Thales]], [[Solon]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Democritus]]. The teachings are divided into "Degrees" which are further grouped into broad categories under titles such as '' Postulant'', ''Neophyte,'' and ''Initiate'' sections. These degrees cover various fields related to physical, mental, psychic, and spiritual existence such as [[physics]], [[metaphysics]], [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[parapsychology]], [[comparative religion]], traditional healing techniques, [[health]], [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[extrasensory perception]], material and spiritual [[alchemy]], [[meditation]], [[sacred architecture]], symbolism, and that mystical state of consciousness relating to the experience of unity with the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;According to AMORC's publication ''Mastery of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and structure==
AMORC is a worldwide organization, established in the [[United States]] as a [[nonprofit]] [[501(c)(3)]] public benefit [[corporation]], with the specific and primary purpose of advancing the knowledge of its history, principles, and teachings for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes. It is financed mainly through fees paid by its members. Income is used by the organization to pay expenses, develop new programs, expand services, and carry out educational work.

The organizational headquarters for different jurisdictions of the AMORC are designated as "Grand Lodges." The English-speaking Grand Lodge for the Americas is headquartered in [[Rosicrucian Park]] in San Jose, California. All Grand Lodges are governed by The Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC. The Supreme Grand Lodge meets annually, often in [[Lachute]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] (however, in August 2009 the Supreme Board met in [[Toulouse]], [[France]], in honor of the 100th Anniversary of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation there), and is responsible for the worldwide coordination of AMORC, the establishment of new administrations, and the appointment of jurisdictions to Grand Lodges, usually based on language. This body consists of the [[Imperator]], Grand Masters, and related executive officers.

On a local level, members of AMORC often form smaller affiliated groups organized as Lodges, Chapters, Pronaoi, or Atrium Groups. These various titles differ according to the number of members of each body in regular attendance. Participation in these groups is optional, and participants retain compulsory membership with their respective Grand Lodge. Many of these groups charge additional dues to participants to cover expenses such as rent, utility and maintenance costs. Most affiliated bodies of the AMORC offer Open Meetings or Lectures to which the general public is invited and welcome.

Each AMORC Grand Lodge has its own headquarters and facilities. In North America, the Grand Lodge is located at 1342 Naglee Ave. The headquarters of the English Grand Lodge for the Americas owns the Rosicrucian Park in [[San Jose, California]], founded in 1927, which includes the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]], the fifth planetarium built in the USA (and the first to have a US-built star projector, built by Dr. [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]]), the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, Rosicrucian Research Library, Grand Temple, Administration Building, Fountain Plaza and Gardens, the Alchemy Garden and the walking Labyrinth.

Discussion groups, an informal type of gathering for both members and the public, were formally introduced in 2009 in North America. They are authorized by AMORC but are not affiliated bodies.

==History==
[[File:Francis Bacon.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Francis Bacon]], an Imperator of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian Order]] (as claimed by AMORC)]]

According to AMORC's internal history in 1909 [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]] visited France in search of Rosicrucians, was initiated in Toulouse, France, and given the mandate to establish an order in North America. After further qualification and preparation the first official Manifesto was issued in the United States in 1915, announcing the establishment of Rosicrucian activity in America. May Banks-Stacy, the co-founder of AMORC, was said to be one of the last successors to the original colony of Rosicrucians that settled in America during the late 17th century, and an initiate of the Rosicrucians of the East.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Rebisse, pp.161–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis became a "secret partner" of [[Big Business]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;H. Spencer Lewis ''Rosicrucian Principles for Home and Business'', p. 15, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1953 ASIN: B000O3PY9K; 1st ed. 1929&lt;/ref&gt; According to railroad magnate [[Arthur Stillwell]], no other man has exerted a greater influence as a secret partner in American [[free enterprise]] than Lewis. [[Walt Disney]] was once a member of AMORC as was ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], [[Jack Palance]]'s daughter [[Holly Palance]] and many other well known individuals who prefer to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Davis ''The Visionary State'', p. 112, Chronicle Books, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8118-4835-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMORC headquarters were located in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], and then [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] before moving to [[San Jose, California]], in 1927. Harvey Spencer Lewis died in 1939 and, in accordance with wishes stipulated in his will, was succeeded in the Office of Imperator by his son [[Ralph Maxwell Lewis]] who had previously served as Supreme Secretary. [[Gary L. Stewart]] who previously served as Grand Master of the English-Speaking jurisdiction and then Vice President of the Board of Directors was appointed to the Office of Imperator upon Lewis' death in 1987 by AMORC's Board of Directors which forms the Supreme Grand Lodge. [[Christian Bernard]] who had been the Grand Master of France and then succeeded Stewart to the position of Vice President of the Board was elected to the Office of Imperator in 1990 by the Board of Directors.

During [[World War II]] AMORC underwent a dramatic period of growth. After the war ended AMORC was able to lend support to its European sister organizations. Eventually many of these then came under the administration of AMORC's leadership in San Jose. 2009, the centennial year of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation in [[Toulouse]], saw growth in membership in the English Grand Lodge for the Americas and very active participation in on-line activities including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], online Discussion groups, a social networking site, podcasts and Rosicrucian TV on [[YouTube]]. [[Rosicrucian Park]] in San Jose received many improvements as well, including the completion of accessibility upgrades to the museum, planetarium and grounds and the installation of sustainable native plant gardens.

AMORC uses ''traditional''  history, consisting of tales and legends represented as having been passed down for centuries by word of mouth as well as the conventional ''chronological''  history, which consists of verifiable fact. According to its ''traditional'' history AMORC traces its origin to ''[[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mystery Schools]]'' established in Egypt during the joint reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III and Hatshepsut, about 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Steven, "Hidden Harmonies: Rediscovering the Egyptian Foundations of the Rosicrucian Path," ''Rosicrucian Digest'' Volume 85 Number 1 2007, 47–50 at https://d628e93a87508d390763-57cef68fda4fc1e410cee0eeddd485c4.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/hidden_harmonies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They united the priesthoods of Egypt into a single order under the leadership of Hatshepsut's Vizier, Hapuseneb.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol 2, The Eighteenth Dynasty (1906; repr., New York: Russell and Russell, 1962), 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; Each Temple had its associated ''Per Ankh'' (House of Life) where the Mysteries were handed down.&lt;ref&gt;Garth Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In uniting the priesthoods, the ''Per Ankhu'' were also united. These schools were formed to probe into "the mysteries of life" — in other words, natural phenomena, and initiatic spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeremy Naydler, Shamanic Wisdom of the Pyramid Texts (Rochester VT: Inner Traditions, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; AMORC also claims that among their most esteemed pupils were Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) and his wife Nefertiti.

Over centuries these Mystery Schools spread into Greece and thence into Rome. During the Middle Ages they were concealed under various names. AMORC claims that Rosicrucianism is mentioned as far back as 1115 [[Common Era|CE]] in a book of the collection of Brother Omnis Moriar in Germany. However, no other record of such a brother and book has appeared. The alleged name probably derives from the opening words of Horace in Ode 3.30 in which he writes: "Non Omnis Moriar" ("I shall not completely die").

[[File:Boehme Portrait 1730.jpeg|upright|thumb|left|[[Jakob Böhme]], a Rosicrucian (as claimed by AMORC)]]
Rosicrucianism rose to considerable prominence in Europe during the 17th century following the publication and wide circulation of a small pamphlet, the ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]]''. AMORC scholars have suggested that Rosicrucians first came to America in the area of present-day [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]] in The [[Vizcaíno Expedition]] of 1602–1603.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A, Schultz, "The Essene Lineage in California: Carmelites and Rosicrucians at Carmel in 1602." Rosicrucian Digest 85:2 2007, 12–20. Available at https://b1e36bcd2b2f667c32cd-4fb9b5302a048ee02dcf5b2b1a8e57f9.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/02_carmel_schultz.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The next Rosicrucian expedition to America is said to have been by the chartered vessel ''Sarah Maria'' during the early months of 1694 under the leadership of Grand Master [[Johannes Kelpius]] and they established a colony in what is now [[Fairmount Park]], Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Friedrich Sachse ''The German Pietists of Provincial Pennsylvania'', Self-Publishing, 1895 ASIN: B000GTCOVI&lt;/ref&gt; They finally settled on the banks of the [[Wissahickon, Philadelphia|Wissahickon]]. "In that retired valley beside the flowing brook the secret rites and mysteries of the true Rosicrucian Philosophy flourished unmolested for years, until the state of affairs brought about by the American Revolution, together with pernicious Sunday legislation which also discriminated against the keepers of the scriptural Sabbath day, gradually caused the incoming generation to assimilate with the secular congregations."&lt;ref&gt;Sachse pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;  This is disputed by another organization, the [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis|Fraternity of the Rosy Cross]] at one time headed by Dr. [[R. Swinburne Clymer]]. [[Johannes Kelpius]] of the Jacob Boehme Lodge in Germany allegedly led the German [[Pietists]] to America,  although no historical evidence exists to support this claim, nor the common claim to be connected to the [[Ephrata Cloister]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Spencer Lewis ''Rosicrucian Manual'', p. 16, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1982 {{ISBN|0-912057-00-9}}; 1st ed. 1918&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a fact that the two rival organizations historically disputed their claims to Rosicrucian genuineness.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer's side of the argument is found in R. Swinburne Clymer  ''The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America'', v. 1 &amp; v. 2, The Rosicrucian Foundation, 1935 ASIN: B000KY2K8G. H. Spencer Lewis discusses the disputes in H. Spencer Lewis, ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers With Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'' (San Jose: Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1929), 151–159; 204–206. Recent scholarship on the dispute may be found in Christopher McIntosh, ''The Rosicrucians'' (3rd Rev. Ed.) (Boston: Weiser Books, 1997), 119–132 and Christian Rebisse, ''Rosicrucian History and Mysteries'' (San Jose: English Grand Lodge, 2005), 223 n. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership and new groups===
From 1915 to 1990 the leadership of AMORC was entrusted to the Office of an [[Imperator]] who was solely responsible for all doctrine and ritual of the Order as well as a corporate president who sat at the head of the board of directors, which was responsible for determining all corporate matters related to the organization. When AMORC reorganized in April, 1990, the dual function of the Office was merged into one position, that of President of the worldwide AMORC organization. However, internally, the President was still referred to by the traditional title of [[Imperator]]. In addition to the Imperator, each [[Grand Lodge]] has a Grand Master.

In 1990 there was a dispute over the leadership of the AMORC, which was then under the leadership of Imperator [[Gary L. Stewart]], prompted by allegations made by members of the Board of Directors of embezzlement on the part of Stewart. In April, 1990, a [[lawsuit]] was filed by the Board and, as a result of the allegations, Stewart was kept from returning to AMORC's properties by virtue of a Temporary Restraining Order until trial. The newly expanded Board of Directors voted that the Vice President of the Board of Directors, [[Christian Bernard]], should assume Stewart's offices. An installation ritual was held at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] in [[San Francisco]], California. During the next three years there was little progress regarding the lawsuit. Eventually, the new AMORC Board of Directors sought to settle out of court, due to the ongoing financial strain of legal costs. On 10 August 1993, AMORC dismissed their case against Stewart with prejudice. The dismissal was the final severing of the relationship between Stewart and AMORC.

The governance of AMORC is overseen by the Supreme Grand Lodge (the Imperator, Grand Masters and Administrators), with local (geographic and/or language based) Grand Lodges throughout the world.

After his removal from AMORC in 1990, former Imperator Stewart founded the Confraternity of the Rose Cross and uses the original version of H. Spencer Lewis' [[Rosicrucian Monographs|monographs]] with addenda added by Stewart as well as additional monographs written by Stewart (as opposed to the monographs currently used by AMORC, which were initially rewritten in large parts under Imperator Bernard's supervision and are now regularly revised and updated according to AMORC traditional custom dating from the time of H. Spencer Lewis's first published materials in 1916&lt;ref&gt;Multiple versions of the published materials from the earliest printed materials in the ''American Rosae Crucis'' (1916, seq) and ''Cromaat'' (1918) publications to the formal monographs in many later editions over the years may be found in the collection of the Rosicrucian Research Library and the Publications Department at [[Rosicrucian Park]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].&lt;/ref&gt;). Stewart also founded the Order Militia Crucifera Evangelica and assisted with the formation of the British [[Martinist Order]]. Other organizations using the name Rosicrucian formed after Stewart's removal from AMORC include the Ghanaian Order of the Rose Cross led by Benjamin Quaye and the Norwegian Order of the Rose Cross led by Robert Aarberg of which both orders are closely allied with Stewart's Confraternity of the Rose Cross; and the short-lived Ancient Rosae Crucis which was led by Ashley McFadden.

==Diego Rivera as member==
A well-known member of AMORC was Mexican muralist painter [[Diego Rivera]]. The association has puzzled art historians, as Rivera was a staunch adherent of [[Marxism]]. In 1926, Rivera was among the founders of AMORC's Mexico City lodge, called Quetzalcoatl, and painted an image of [[Quetzalcoatl]] for the local temple.&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Tibol, "Apareció la serpiente: Diego Rivera y los rosacruces," ''Proceso'' 701 (9 April 1990), pp. 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954, when he tried to be readmitted into the Mexican Communist Party from which he had been excluded because of his support of [[Leon Trotsky]], Rivera had to justify his AMORC activities, which looked strange for a Marxist. Rivera answered that, by joining AMORC, he wanted to infiltrate a typical "Yankee" organization on behalf of Communism. However, he also claimed that AMORC was "essentially materialist, insofar as it only admits different states of energy and matter, and is based on ancient Egyptian occult knowledge from [[Amenhotep IV]] and [[Nefertiti]]."&lt;ref&gt;Diego Rivera, ''Arte y política'', México: Grijalbo, 1979, p. 354. {{ISBN|968-419-083-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public activities==

Many of the activities of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC are open to the public, as well as members. These include:

* '''Online Classes''': In the fall of 2006, the English Grand Lodge for the Americas began offering free online classes in many subjects. Most of these Rose+Croix University Online Classes are open to both AMORC members and the public. These are conducted today on Facebook.
* '''Open Classes''': These are held in many locations, including in North America and the [[Caribbean]], and are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site in the external links below. Other such public activities can be found on the international sites.
* '''Meditation for Peace''': In 2004, [[Imperator]] [[Christian Bernard]] proclaimed the annual Rosicrucian Meditation for Peace Ceremony at the Rosicrucian World Peace Conference (see below). This is held at the Grand Lodge and in affiliated bodies throughout the world on the fourth Sunday of June each year. North American and Caribbean locations are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site.
* '''Autumn Equinox Memorial Ceremony''': The annual Memorial Ceremony is held at the Grand Lodge in San Jose and in affiliated bodies throughout the world at the [[Autumn Equinox]] each year. North American and Caribbean locations are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site.
* '''Council of Solace Ritual''': The [[Imperator]] and Supreme Board of AMORC recently opened the Council of Solace Ritual, welcoming both members and the public to participate. In North America and the Caribbean, this meditation ceremony is held at the Grand Lodge headquarters in San Jose, and in most Grand Lodges worldwide.

AMORC often organizes various conferences around the world, increasingly having many sessions open to the public, and several councils of experts on various topics. In August 2001 the world convention took place in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. The main theme of the convention was world peace and harmony. The convention was of significant importance to Rosicrucian history because Imperator Bernard presented the "Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis" to inform the public about AMORC's position on the current world situation. A subsequent manifesto, the "Appellatio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis"was issued in 2014 as a call to action on these themes.

In July 2004 The Rosicrucian World Peace Conference was held in San Jose. Over 2000 Rosicrucians from 70 countries gathered with Imperator [[Christian Bernard]], and North American Grand Master Julie Scott. The Imperator dedicated the [[Rosicrucian Park]]'s Rosicrucian Peace Garden, designed according to examples from Egypt's 18th Dynasty by Grand Master Emeritus of the English Grand Lodge for Australia, New Zealand and Asia, Peter Bindon.

The World Convention for 2007 was held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] with the theme "Love Will Build the Bridge." All of the events, except for the ritualistic convocations, were open to the Public.

[[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], the headquarters of the Portuguese Grand Lodge of AMORC, hosted the August 2011 World Convention: The Sacred and the Primordial Tradition.

The World Convention in 2015 was again held in San Jose CA USA celebrating the 100th Anniversary of AMORC's founding in America in 1915.

The International Research Council is a group of AMORC members who have expertise in several areas, including [[physics]], [[biology]], [[philosophy]] and music. According to the AMORC, the members of the International Research Council dedicate themselves to the advancement of their profession for the benefit of humanity.

The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum launched a substantial new exhibit on Spiritual and Physical [[Alchemy]] on the [[Spring Equinox]] 2015.

The Rosicrucian Order hosted an academic conference for Scholars and Practitioners of Esotericism at Rosicrucian Park, 22–25 July 2010. The theme for the papers and presentations given by members of many different esoteric groups was the influence of esoteric Orders on the modern world. Several of the papers were to be published in the June 2011 Rose Croix Journal.

The Council of Solace is a group of Rosicrucians who meditate and direct spiritual force for health and harmony daily on behalf of others. They offer free, 24-hour [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] aid to those in need, regardless of membership. Members and the public may by invitation take part in the Council of Solace meditation ritual held in various locations.

The AMORC publishes several publications including a public magazine called the [[Rosicrucian Digest]], an online academic periodical called the ''Rose-Croix Journal,''  as well as books which focus on topics such as [[metaphysics]], [[mysticism]], and [[Egyptology]].

===Rosicrucian Digest===
The Rosicrucian Digest was first published in 1915 under the name ''American Rosae Crucis'', and then ''The Triangle'', ''The Mystic Triangle'' and finally ''The Rosicrucian Digest''. It has been adapted to serve the needs of each period. Beginning with the December 2006 issue (Vol 84:2) the Digest began a series of multimedia thematic issues available online and in print twice a year. The first such issue (December 2006) dealt with [[Atlantis]], while the 2007 volumes covered [[Ancient Egypt]] and The [[Essenes]]. 2008 issues followed with The [[Orphic Mysteries]] and the [[Delphi]], while 2009 issues covered The [[Pythagoreans]] and the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and other Timeline topics through 2014.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the public magazine is named ''Rosicrucian Beacon'' and is published quarterly by the "English speaking jurisdiction for Europe, Africa and the Middle East of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC." In Australasia the magazine is titled ''The Rosicrucian''. Other AMORC jurisdictions have similar publications.

===Rose+Croix Journal===
AMORC's ''Rose+Croix Journal'' is "an international, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, peer-reviewed online journal that focuses on topics that relate to the sciences, history, the arts, mysticism, and spirituality, especially interdisciplinary topics and transdisciplinary inquiries that traverse and lie beyond the limits of different fields of study. These topics may relate to any of the arts and sciences and/or to other emerging fields of human endeavor" (from the ''Rose+Croix Journal '' http://www.rosecroixjournal.org). The Journal's Website also has a Resources section with the five [[Rosicrucian Manifestos]], ''Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians,'' ''Rosicrucian Documents,'' online editions of the ''Rosicrucian Digest,'' etc. Submissions are solicited from members and the public.

===Multimedia and web presence===
According to AMORC tradition, H. Spencer Lewis received the mandate from the Rosicrucians of [[Toulouse]] when he was initiated in 1909 to make the tradition available and comprehensible to modern women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Rebisse, 161–180.&lt;/ref&gt; In accord with this, [[H. Spencer Lewis]], and after him [[Ralph M. Lewis]], used all of the technologies available to them to accomplish their work. An example was the radio station H. Spencer Lewis had broadcasting from his office at the [[Rosicrucian Park]], and before that, at the previous headquarters in Tampa, and [[San Francisco]]. The broadcasting from San Jose began on 15 February 1928 and was delivered by two 30-metre radio towers inside the park. The radio towers have since been removed, though for some time AMORC continued to broadcast through the historic San Jose [[KZSF|KEEN]] radio station. Today, the Order communicates using newer media:

* Websites for all of the international jurisdictions of AMORC now provide instant access to information and resources for members and the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amorc.org AMORC website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The English Grand Lodge for the Americas began a series of public [[podcasts]] in 2006 and launched Rosicrucian TV on [[YouTube]] in 2009. Topics range include [[mysticism]], [[Egyptology]], [[peace]], [[esotericism]] and other subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* English Grand Lodge for the Americas members enjoy a private community [[social networking]] forum based in the [[Ning (website)|Ning]] system.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* [[Facebook]] has rapidly become a major forum for North American AMORC, with over 300,000 likes for its main Facebook page as of October 2013. There are also fan pages for Rosicrucian Park, the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]], Rose+Croix University Online Classes (including discussions of each issue of the new Rosicrucian Digests), the new Alchemy Exhibit at the Museum, and the Hidden in Plain Sight Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Rosicrucian.Order.AMORC Rosicrucian Order AMORC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Twitter]] followers receive frequent updates from the Order, the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum and the Rosicrucian Research Library.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The public presence of the Rosicrucians in Western Europe was made known through the publication of three manifestos. AMORC introduced a fourth manifesto, the ''Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis''&lt;ref name=PFRC&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.org/publications/positio.pdf Text of ''Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis'']&lt;/ref&gt; at an AMORC convention in Sweden in August 2001. The Positio offers AMORC's observations on problems in the modern world, along with proposed solutions. The Positio closes with an invocation that expresses what it calls "Rosicrucian Utopia":&lt;ref name=PFRC/&gt; A subsequent manifesto, the "Appellatio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis"was issued in 2014 as a call to action on these themes. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;God of all beings, God of all life, In the humanity we are dreaming of:

* Politicians are profoundly humanistic and strive to serve the common good;
* Economists manage state finances with discernment and in the interest of all;
* Scientists are spiritualistic and seek their inspiration in the Book of Nature;
* Artists are inspired and express the beauty and purity of the Divine Plan in their works;
* Physicians are motivated by love for their fellow-beings and treat both the soul and the body;
* Misery and poverty have vanished, for everyone has what one needs to live happily;
* Work is not regarded as a chore; it is looked at as a source of growth and well-being;
* Nature is considered to be the most beautiful temple of all, and animals are considered to be our brothers and sisters on the path of evolution;
* A World Government composed of the leaders of all nations, working in the interest of all humanity, has come into existence.
* Spirituality is an ideal and a way of life, which springs forth from a Universal Religion, founded more upon the knowledge of divine laws than upon the belief in God;
* Human relations are founded upon love, friendship, and community, so that the whole world lives in peace and harmony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Honors ==

[[File:Astronomica.png|thumb|alt=A 15th-century illuminated manuscript|The first page of the ''Astronomica'', from a 1461 manuscript]]
The '''''Astronomica''''' ({{IPA-la|as.troˈno.mi.ka|lang}} or [[Help:IPA for Latin|[as.trɔˈnɔ.mɪ.ka]]]), also known as the '''''Astronomicon''''', is a [[Latin]] [[didacticism|didactic]] poem{{#tag:ref|Though, as explained by Katharina Volk, "in histories of Latin literature, Manilius is typically treated under the rubric of didactic poetry",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; there has been much debate as to whether the ''Astronomica'' should be categorized as an "epic poem" or as a "didactic poem".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Campbell 2004|Campbell (2004)]], p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources refer to this work simply as an epic; for instance, Alison Keith writes in her book ''A Latin Epic Reader: Selections from Ten Epics'', that "Manilius is the earliest exponent of imperial epic with his ''Astronomica''",&lt;ref name=keithxix/&gt; and [[Anthony Grafton]], [[Glenn W. Most]], and Salvatore Settis note in ''The Classical Tradition'' that "the earliest complete astrological text we possess from antiquity is Manilius's Latin epic the ''Astronomica'' (ca. 25 CE)".&lt;ref&gt;[[#AnthonyMostSettis 2010|Anthony, Most, &amp; Settis (2010)]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources simply refer to the ''Astronomica'' as a "didactic poem", such as the [[Loeb Classical Library]] webpage for G. P. Goold's 1977 translation.&lt;ref name=harvardloeb/&gt; According to Victoria Moul, "there is very little acknowledgement in either ancient or early modern criticism of didactic as a genre of its own, rather than a form of epic".&lt;ref name=moul&gt;[[#Moul 2017|Moul 2017]].&lt;/ref&gt; Volk likewise writes that "didactic poems [e.g. ''De natura rerum'' and ''Astronomica''] ... were often regarded as (some kind of) epic poetry".&lt;ref name=voolk2009175&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Volk stresses that "there are ... such crucial differences between didactic poetry and narrative epic that it makes sense to consider the former a genre in its own right."&lt;ref name=voolk2009175/&gt;|group="nb"}} about celestial phenomena, written in [[hexameter]]s and divided into five books. The ''Astronomica'' was penned c. AD 10{{en dash}}20 by a Roman poet whose name was likely [[Marcus Manilius]]; little is known of Manilius, and although there is evidence that the ''Astronomica'' was probably read by many other Roman writers, no surviving works explicitly quote him.

The earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly intact, the ''Astronomica'' describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the [[zodiac]] and [[astrology]]. The poem{{em dash}}which seems to have been inspired by [[Lucretius]]'s [[Epicurean]] poem ''[[De rerum natura]]''{{em dash}}espouses a [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Determinism|deterministic]] understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the ''Astronomica'' features a [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]], which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.

The poem was rediscovered {{circa|lk=no}}{{nbsp}}1416{{en dash}}1417 by the Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] and scholar [[Poggio Bracciolini]], who had a copy made from which the modern text derives. Upon its discovery, the ''Astronomica'' was read, commented upon, and edited by a number of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become as popular as other classical Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. This started to change during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist [[A. E. Housman]] published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in five books. Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider the ''Astronomica'' to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory. At the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate highly technical astronomical concepts and complex mathematical computations into poetry.

==Authorship and date==

{{multiple image| total_width = 500|image2=Statue-Augustus.jpg|alt2=Statue of Caesar Augustus, outstretched arm pointing|image1=TiberiusLouvre.jpg|alt1=Bust of Tiverius, looking left|footer=Scholars have debated whether the "Caesar" referred to in the poem is [[Augustus]] ''(right)'' or [[Tiberius]] ''(left)''.}}

Because no contemporary Roman sources mention his name, the exact identity of the ''Astronomica''{{'}}s author is a tantalizing question, but his name was probably [[Marcus Manilius]].&lt;ref name=volk1&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt;{{#tag:ref|In the manuscript of the poem known as M, the author is identified three times in the genitive, as "M[arcus]. Manili", "M. Manlii", and "M. Milnili"; "Manlii" and "Milnili" are likely both corruptions of the [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]] "Manlii", making the author's name "Marcus Manlius" ("Marci Manlii" in the genitive).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gain|Gain (1970)]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} This uncertainty has led to Marcus Manilius being confused over the years with Manilius Antiochus (fl.{{nbsp}}c.{{nbsp}}100{{nbsp}}BC, mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]''); [[Flavius Manlius Theodorus]] (fl.{{nbsp}}c.{{nbsp}}AD{{nbsp}}376{{en dash}}409, a [[consul]] in AD{{nbsp}}399) and [[Boethius|Boëthius]] (the sixth-century Roman senator and author of ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De consolatione philosophiae]]'', whose full name was Anicius Manlius Severinus Boëthius).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], pp. 2, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m&amp;gxi/&gt; Although the poem suggests that the writer was a citizen and resident of Rome, some have contended that Manilius was a non-Roman; according to Katharina Volk, a [[Latinist]] who specializes in Manilius, this belief is generally based on either "the poet's supposedly inferior Latinity" or "the wish to see Manilius as the member of a Greek intellectual milieu at Rome".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century classicist [[Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs|Fridericus Jacobs]] and the 19th- and 20th-century historian [[Paul Monceaux]] have argued that he was an African, based largely on his writing style, which they say resembles that of other African authors.&lt;ref name=Chisholm&gt;[[#Chisholm|Chisholm (1910{{en dash}}1911)]], pp. 580{{en dash}}81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brock1911&gt;[[#Brock|Brock (1911)]], p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Volk counters this view, arguing that Manilius writes "from ... a conventional Roman perspective" and "takes recourse to Roman history to illustrate the [[astrology|astrological]] facts he discusses".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], pp. 162{{en dash}}63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work's date has been debated. The only clear reference to an historical event is a reference to the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]{{em dash}}a decisive loss for Rome, forcing it to withdraw from [[Magna Germania]]{{em dash}}in AD{{nbsp}}9.&lt;ref name="Volk 2009 p. 138"&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In considering the poem's date, scholars have proposed three hypotheses: that it was written entirely under [[Augustus]] (who ruled from 27 BC until AD 14), under the reigns of both Augustus and [[Tiberius]] (who ruled from AD 14{{en dash}}37), or entirely under Tiberius. The first conjecture was favored primarily from the [[Renaissance]] until the 19th century, when [[Karl Lachmann]] argued that references to the emperor in the poem made more sense if they were referring to Tiberius.&lt;ref name="Volk 2009 p. 138"/&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, scholars such as [[A. E. Housman]] began favoring the idea that the first two books were written under Augustus, the last two under Tiberius, and that the third was "undatable".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], pp. 138{{en dash}}39.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This is based on the facts that the first book mentions the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (suggesting an Augustan date), the second claims that [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] is the Emperor's natal sign (indicating this book was written under Augustus), and the fourth describes [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] as the natal sign of the leader (suggesting that this book was written under Tiberius). Books three and five are difficult to date, but book five is assumed to have been written under Tiberius because it followed the (Tiberian) book four.&lt;ref name=m&amp;gxi&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} This debate has not been settled,&lt;ref name="Volk 2009 p. 139"&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; although Volk has argued that the poem should be dated to c.

According to Volk, Manilius's ''Astronomica'' is the earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly extant.&lt;ref name=volk5/&gt; Volk wrote that since he dedicates the poem to stellar phenomena, it is "indicative of the great fascination&amp;nbsp;... that the stars held for the Romans of Manilius' period".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk2011|Volk (2011)]], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Astronomica'', which is written in [[hexameters]], opens with Manilius contending that he is the "first to sing of astrology".&lt;ref name=gooldxvii/&gt; He also claims that the god [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]] engendered his interest in celestial bodies.&lt;ref name=gooldxvii&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first book he ponders the origin of the universe, considering theories by [[Xenophanes]], [[Hesiod]], [[Leucippus]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Thales]], and [[Empedocles]] before arguing that the universe was created from [[Classical element#Greece|the four elements]] and is governed by a divine spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.118{{en dash}}254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], pp. xviii, xx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=book1_volk/&gt; According to Manilius, the universe is composed of two spheres: one—the Earth—is solid and the other—the "sphere of stars", often called the [[firmament]]— is hollow. The constellations are fixed in the firmament; the Earth is stationary and the firmament revolves around it, explaining the movements of the stars. The planets, the moon, and the Sun also revolve around the Earth in the vast space between its surface and the edge of the firmament.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Earth is in the center of the universe, it is equidistant from the firmament and is thus not compelled to "fall" in any specific direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Manilius, the universe is ruled by a god (''conspirat deus'') and is governed by reason (''ratione gubernat'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=godreasonuniverse/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Volk writes that Manilius is unclear as to how the deity, the universe, and reason are all connected to one another.&lt;ref name=godreasonuniverse&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Manilius occasionally treats these key terms as distinct concepts and at other times like synonyms for one another, further complicating the meaning of their use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 61, note 8.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} Manilius next discusses the constellations and stars&lt;ref name=book1_volk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.255{{en dash}}560.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Celestial spheres|celestial circles]].&lt;ref name=book1_volk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.561{{en dash}}804.&lt;/ref&gt; In this section, the poet spends considerable time contemplating the [[Milky Way]] band,&lt;ref name=book1_volk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.684{{en dash}}804.&lt;/ref&gt; which, after exploring several hypotheses as to its existence,{{#tag:ref|Including that the Milky Way band is: the place in the sky where the two hemispheres are merging or diverging; a path the Sun once took; the route [[Phaethon]] took when he drove [[Helios]]'s sun chariot; milk from [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s breast; or a cluster of small stars.&lt;ref name=marmanmilky&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.718{{en dash}}761.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gooldxxxv&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; |group="nb"}} he concludes is likely the celestial abode for dead heroes.&lt;ref name=book1_volk&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marmanmilky/&gt;&lt;ref name=gooldxxxv/&gt;&lt;ref name=book1summary&gt;[[#Manilius &amp; Goold|Manilius &amp; Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book ends with an exploration of comets, which Manilius sees as harbingers of calamity or great disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heilen|Heilen (2011)]], p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], pp. 266{{en dash}}67.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Volk, books two and three deal mainly with the finer details of the zodiac.&lt;ref name=book23&gt;[[#Volk 2014|Volk (2014)]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Book two opens with a preface in which Manilius presents a brief history of hexameter poetry, singling out [[Homer]] and Hesiod. His purpose, he argues, is to emphasize the uniqueness of his poem in comparison to others rather than to insert himself into this poetic tradition. According to Manilius, "Every path that leads to [[Mount Helicon|Helicon]] has been trodden" (''omnis ad accessus Heliconos semita trita est''; all other topics have been covered) and he must find "untouched meadows and water" (''integra'' ... ''prata'' ...

The third book—which focuses mainly on "determin[ing] the degree of the [[ecliptic]] which is rising about the horizon at the moment" of a person's birth—opens with Manilius's reiteration that his work is original.&lt;ref name=book3summary/&gt;&lt;ref name=ennius&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. lxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Because his topic is complex and difficult, the poet tells his audience they can "expect truth but not beauty".&lt;ref name=volk268/&gt; He them discusses the third astrologically significant circle, the [[Arabic parts|lots]],{{efn|'''Lots''': "Points on the birth chart that carry special significance.

Books four and five are largely about "the effects of particular celestial phenomena on the native".&lt;ref name=book23/&gt; Book four covers many topics that originated in Egypt, leading Goold to write that Manilius based his work on an Egyptian source.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. lxxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the first portion of this book deals with [[decans]]{{efn|'''Decans''': divisions of the zodiac that measure ten degrees; each zodiac sign is composed of and governs three decans.&lt;ref name=volk272/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Astronomica 4.294"&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 4.294{{en dash}}386.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''partes damnandae'',{{efn|'''''Partes damnandae''''': Latin for The "degrees to be rejected"; this phrase represents certain degrees of the zodiac signs that are considered harmful or bad.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 4.308{{en dash}}501.&lt;/ref&gt; both of which allow Manilius another chance to convert mathematical and astrological tables into poetic verse.&lt;ref name=book4summary&gt;[[#Manilius &amp; Goold|Manilius &amp; Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; A short description of the rising of individual zodiacal degrees is followed by a more comprehensive survey of zodiacal geography.{{efn|'''Zodiacal geography''': the allotment of specific countries, regions, or division of lands to the rule of specific zodiac signs.&lt;ref name=volk274/&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 4.502{{en dash}}817.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=book4summary/&gt; Near the end of the book, Manilius writes about the ecliptic signs.{{efn|'''Ecliptic signs''': signs of the zodiac in which either the sun or the moon is to be found during an eclipse.&lt;ref name=volk272/&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 4.818{{en dash}}65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=volk269/&gt; The book is punctuated at lines 4.387{{en dash}}407 and 4.866{{en dash}}935 by "exhortation[s] of the frustrated student", where complaints that astrology is difficult and nature is hidden are countered by statements that "the object of study is nothing less than (union with) god" and "the universe (microcosm) wishes to reveal itself to man".&lt;ref name=volk269&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the fifth (and final) book is a discussion of ''[[Stars in astrology#Use|paranatellonta]]''{{efn|'''''Paranatellonta''''': "constellations, parts thereof&amp;nbsp;... or especially bright individual stars, which become visible or invisible at the same time as certain degrees or decanal sections&amp;nbsp;... of the ecliptic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hübner|Hübner (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;}} via the myth of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] and [[Perseus]].&lt;ref name=digression_p_a&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 5.538{{en dash}}618.&lt;/ref&gt; Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents; [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]].

===Worldview===

According to Volk, "The basic tenet of what we might call Manilius' natural philosophy is the idea that the universe is divine".&lt;ref name=volk217/&gt; She writes that Manilius is inconsistent about the location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims the perfectly regular movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars is proof that the universe is [[Teleological argument#Roman era|the product of a god]]; he also says the universe itself is a god (''mundum ... ipsum esse deum'').&lt;ref name=volk217&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.484{{endash}}485.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same book, Manilius again says the universe is the "work of a great divinity" (''magni ... numinis ordo'').&lt;ref name=volk217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 1.531.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes; "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe&amp;nbsp;... Is the world simply ruled by a ''diuinum numen'' (cf. 1.484) or is it a ''deus'' (cf 1.485) itself?"&lt;ref name=volk218&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Volk answers that in the cosmology of the ''Astronomica'', "God can be understood as the soul or breath&amp;nbsp;... present within the world [and] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god".&lt;ref name=volk219&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Volk, this interpretation of the universe, which states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly way, thus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect affecting everything within the cosmos and that fate rules all.&lt;ref name=volk220&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volk points out the poem borrows or alludes to a number of philosophical traditions, including [[Hermeticism]], [[Platonism]], and [[Pythagoreanism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], pp. 234{{en dash}}51.&lt;/ref&gt; but the prevailing belief of commentators is that Manilius espouses a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] worldview in the ''Astronomica''.&lt;ref name=volk226first&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison between Manilius's beliefs and those of other Stoics reveals parallels that according to Volk "are immediately obvious".&lt;ref name=volk227&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Stoics and Manilius agree on the divinity of the universe, the argument from design, the assumption that the supreme god is both the creator of the universe and the active force within it, the interconnectedness of everything, the understanding that humans are intimately connected to the cosmos, the importance of considering the heavens, and the belief in an inescapable fate that rules over all.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 227{{endash}}30.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement on this latter point is of special importance because, according to Volk, belief in fate is "one of the most notorious aspects of the Stoic system".&lt;ref name=volk228&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of the poem as Stoic, however, is not unanimous.&lt;ref name="MacGregor 2005 p. 41"&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=volk226&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 226, note 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, against the common opinion of contemporaneous scholars, [[Gustave Lanson]] contested the idea that the poem is Stoic.&lt;ref name=volk226/&gt; In 2005, Alexander MacGregor said that while contemporary scholars such as Goold and Volk read Manilius as a Stoic,&lt;ref name="MacGregor 2005 p. 41"/&gt; the ''Astronomica'' actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places.&lt;ref name="MacGregor 2005 p. 65"&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Manilius exalts [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], and [[Pythagoras]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], pp. 47{{en dash}}49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God,&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor 2005]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; denies the [[ekpyrosis]] (a key Stoic belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every [[Great Year]] followed by a cosmic [[Palingenesis|recreation]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; never discusses the [[Paradoxa Stoicorum|six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero]],&lt;ref name=macg54&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and ignores the importance of controlling the soul.&lt;ref name=macg54/&gt; Manilius also focuses on a number of Pythagorean tenets; the Pythagorean order of the planets,&lt;ref name=macg56&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of geometry and numbers,&lt;ref name=macg56/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 57{{en dash}}59.&lt;/ref&gt; and the significance of [[tetraktys]] ([[triangular number|triangular figure]]s made up of ten points arranged in four rows).&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 59{{en dash}}65.&lt;/ref&gt; In key places, Manilius also makes use of non-Stoics like [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor (2005)]], p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an [[idealism|idealistic]] Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic.&lt;ref name="MacGregor 2005 p. 65"/&gt;

===Style===

Many consider the ''Astronomica'' to be a work of erudition, elegance, and passion.&lt;ref name=harvardloeb/&gt; Scaliger and Bentley praised Manilius's handling of numbers in verse,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 4|Manilius &amp; Housman (1920)]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Harvard University Press]] later echoed this commendation, writing that Manilius "exhibit[s] great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form",&lt;ref name=harvardloeb/&gt; and that the poet "writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars".&lt;ref name=harvardloeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronomica {{en dash}} Manilius|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674995161|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housman, however, calls Manilius "facile and frivolous" but also describes him as "the one Latin poet who excelled even Ovid in verbal point and smartness".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 3|Housman (1916)]], p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 1|Housman (1903)]], p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, while metrically correct, has been noted for its technical language and unusual word choices.&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hatch|Hatch (2007)]], p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt; The classicist [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]] argues that while "at his best, Manilius may remind us of [[Lucretius]]", the "metre [that he uses] has the regular and monotonous flow of the age".&lt;ref name=verrall1913/&gt; Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have attributed the ''Astronomica''{{'s}} idiosyncrasies to Manilius's reported African origin; they argue he wrote and spoke a form of ''[[Africitas]]''—a putative African dialect of Latin "with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary, syntax, sentence-structure, and style"—thus explaining the poem's quirks.&lt;ref name=brock1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilfrid|Wilfrid (1928)]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the dubiously hypothesized presence of ''Africitas'' in the poem, however, [[Dorothy Brock|M. Dorothy Brock]] argues there is very little evidence that Manilius was from Africa.&lt;ref name=brock1911/&gt;

In addition to its stylistic oddities, the ''Astronomica'' includes some internal inconsistencies. According to Green, the poem is "riddled with confusion and contradiction"; he cites its "presentation of incompatible systems of astrological calculation, information overload, deferral of meaning and contradictory instruction".&lt;ref name=green56/&gt; At the same time, Green notes that similar issues exist in other first-to-third-century astrological works.&lt;ref name=green56&gt;[[#Green|Green (2014)]], p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caroline Stark, Manilius paradoxically claims astrological knowledge may be acquired by individuals and that it is only granted by divine favor.&lt;ref name="g&amp;v267"&gt;[[#Stark|Stark (2011)]], p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; T. Barton says Manilius may have included these contradictions and complexities so he would be regarded as "a figure of unreachable knowledge for the novice student-reader".&lt;ref name=green56/&gt; Green, while not ruling out this hypothesis, says Manilius was probably not motivated by a "desire to carve out for himself a position of power in the new imperial world of experts" as Barton says.&lt;ref name=green56/&gt; Rather, Green says Manilius—due to his "pride in poetic innovation" and his "deference&amp;nbsp;... to the Emperor"—sought to present "himself as a compliant imperial agent, intent on producing a creative poetic enterprise that plots its own way through the levels of acceptable stellar discourse in the early empire".&lt;ref name=green56/&gt; [[David Pingree]] concludes that the poem's "principal purpose seems to have been to delight its audience with poetry and to arouse admiration for the poet by its cleverness".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pingree|Pingree (1980)]], p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Completeness of work}}Completeness===

It is unknown whether the ''Astronomica'' is a finished work; a large lacuna (i.e. a gap) between lines 5.709 and 5.710 presents a problem with this discussion.&lt;ref name=volk5/&gt; According to Housman, based strictly on the contents of the ''Astronomica'', one cannot cast a full horoscope because necessary information—such as an in-depth survey of the planets and the effects constellations both inside and outside the zodiac produce upon their setting—is missing.&lt;ref name=volk5/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhlxxii&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 1|Housman (1903)]], p. lxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Volk, the lack of a lengthy consideration of the planets is rather puzzling because Manilius claims several times that he will examine their zodiacal nature.&lt;ref name=volk5&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Goold writes that "a didactic poem is seldom an exhaustive treatise" and argues that Manilius likely gave a "perfunctory account of the planets' natures in the great lacuna [and then] considered his obligations duly discharged".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued the work was originally longer and some hypothesize it comprised eight books.&lt;ref name=mhlxxii/&gt;&lt;ref name=goold5not8/&gt; These writers base their assertion on a letter sent in AD 983 by [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbertus Aureliacensis]] (later Pope Sylvester{{nbsp}}II) to the Archbishop of Rheims, in which the former reports he had recently located "eight volumes about astrology by Boethius" (''viii volumina Boetii de astrologia'') at the abbey at [[Bobbio]].&lt;ref name=goold5not8/&gt; Boethius was often confused with Manilius because one of the former's names was "Manlius".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who favor the idea the poem was once longer argue the manuscript at Bobbio was a misattributed eight-book version of the ''Astronomica''. Goold repudiates this hypothesis, noting the catalogue at Bobbio lists the work Gerbertus was likely referring to as composed of "three books by Boethius about arithmetic, and the rest [i.e. five] about astronomy" (''libros Boetii iii de aritmetica {{sic}} et alterum de astronomia'').&lt;ref name=goold5not8/&gt; This, according to Goold, is evidence Gerbertus found one manuscript that contained both Boethius's ''De arithmetica'' and Manilius's ''Astronomica'' rather than an eight-book version of the latter.&lt;ref name=goold5not8&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. cviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volk, when considering the problem of completeness, proposed several hypotheses: the work is mostly complete but internally inconsistent about which topics it will and will not consider; the lacuna in book five may have originally contained the missing information; the lacuna may be relatively small and the work is unfinished; or entire books may have originally existed but were lost over time through the "hazardous process of textual transmission".&lt;ref name=volk5/&gt;

==Influences==

[[File:Lucretius drawn by Michael Burghers.png|thumb|right|alt=Engraving of the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius|Although it was inspired by the [[Epicurean]] poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' by [[Lucretius]] (''pictured''), the ''Astronomica'' embraces [[Stoicism]].]]

Manilius frequently imitates Lucretius, who wrote the didactic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]''. Some classicists have suggested that Manilius may have sought to emulate Lucretius by writing six books, but evidence for this hypothesis is scarce, and it remains mostly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 120, note 138.&lt;/ref&gt; While Lucretius's work espouses [[Epicurean]]ism (a philosophy that emphasizes [[materialism]] and [[Religious skepticism|skepticism of superstition and divine intervention]]), Manilius's work is largely Stoic, and promotes a Greco-Roman understanding of creationism as well as [[fatalism|fatalistic]] [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=keithxix&gt;[[#Keith|Keith (2013)]], p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=volk192/&gt;&lt;ref name=steele325/&gt; Both Volk and the Lucretian scholar David Butterfield have argued that Manilius is in many ways, an "anti-Lucretius", with the former arguing that "his presentation in the ''Astronomica'' of an orderly cosmos ruled by fate is a direct attack on the random universe depicted by his predecessor".&lt;ref name=volk192&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 48, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Manilius sometimes conveys his philosophical stance via [[Voice (grammar)|grammatical voice]]: unlike Lucretius, who often uses a [[passive voice|passive]] construction to convey his understanding of nature, Manilius uses [[active voice|active]] grammatical constructions to convey the intentionality he sees in creation (e.g. "God and reason, which rules all things, guide earthly animals by heavenly signs", ''deus et ratio quae cuncta gubernat ducit ab aeternis terrena animalia signis'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steele|Steele (1932)]], p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 2.107{{endash}}108.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while Lucretius used ''De rerum natura'' to present a non-theistic account of creation, Manilius "was a creationist rather than a materialistic evolutionist", and he consequently refers to "one spirit" (''unus spiritus'', 2.64), a "divine power" (''divina potentia'', 3.90), a "creator" (''auctor'', 3.681), and a "god" (''deus'', 2.475) throughout his poem.&lt;ref name=steele325&gt;[[#Steele|Steele (1932)]], p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Astronomica'' is influenced by Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Ennius]]'s ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]'', and the Greek didactic poet [[Aratus]].&lt;ref name=keithxix/&gt;&lt;ref name=ennius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter's influence on Manilius is especially noticeable, and it seems likely that Manilius based much of his first book on portions of Aratus's ''Phaenomena''.&lt;ref name=godreasonuniverse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2014|Volk (2014)]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his debt to the poet, Manilius diverges from his understanding of the cosmos; Aratus focuses on mythology and "graphic description", whereas Manilius emphasizes the scientific aspects of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abry|Abry (2007)]], pp. 1, 8{{en dash}}9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain if Manilius had direct knowledge of Aratus's poem or if he used a translation by [[Cicero]], Ovid, or [[Germanicus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abry|Abry (2007)]], p. 2, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=volknote&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 189, note 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter position is favored by several 21st-century scholars, such as D. Liuzzi and Emma Gee.&lt;ref name=volknote/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gee|Gee (2013)]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the poet's relationship with Germanicus, Wolfgang Hübner writes: "The few echoes of Germanicus' translation of Aratus are insufficient for us to establish which of the two drew on the other, or whether the two were composed independently of each other."&lt;ref name=Hubner2/&gt;

The ''Astronomica'' directly references Homer (as the "greatest poet", ''maximus vates'') as well as Hesiod (calling him "nearest to [Homer]", ''proximus illi''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 2.1, 2.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steele|Steele (1932)]], p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; and alludes to numerous other Greek poets and writers such as [[Apollonius Rhodius]], [[Choerilus of Iasus]], [[Choerilus of Samos]], and [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], pp. 366, 369, 434.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem also contains a direct allusion to Ennius's ''Annales'', which, according to Goold, is the ''Astronomica''{{'}}s "one solitary notice of Latin literature."&lt;ref name=ennius/&gt;

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Engraving of Poggio Bracciolini in middle age|The ''Astronomica'' was rediscovered by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] c.{{nbsp}}1416{{en dash}}1417.]]

Although there are over thirty existing manuscript copies of the ''Astronomica'', the text as it is known today is derived from three key manuscripts: ''Codex Gemblacensis'' (G), ''Codex Lipsiensis'' (L), and ''Codex Matritensis'' (M).{{#tag:ref|In 1903, Housman said that the modern version of the ''Astronomica'' depended on four manuscripts: G, L, M, and V.&lt;ref name="m&amp;hviiviii"/&gt; He originally proposed that V{{emdash}}much like M{{emdash}}was a descendant of manuscript β (the manuscript first discovered by the Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] and scholar Poggio Bracciolini in the early fifteenth century), but in 1930 he redacted this hypothesis, calling V instead one of the many "scions of M".&lt;ref name="m&amp;hviiviii"/&gt;&lt;ref name=astrofivehous/&gt;|group="nb"}} These in turn belong to two separate manuscript families: "α" (which includes G and L), and "β" (which includes M).&lt;ref name=astrofivehous/&gt;&lt;ref name=cvi&gt;[[#Goold|Goold (1997) [1977]]], p. cvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two families, Robinson Ellis wrote: "[α] represents a text more correct, but worse [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolated]]; [β], a text which is fuller of copyists' errors, but less interpolated."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis|Ellis (1904)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first family, "α", takes its name from a now-lost source and includes manuscripts G and L.&lt;ref name=astrofivehous/&gt;&lt;ref name=cvi/&gt; G, dating from the late 10th to the 11th century, was found at the monastery of [[Gembloux Abbey|Gembloux]] in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in modern-day Belgium; L, from the library of [[Leipzig]], was probably written around the mid-11th century and has many corrections made by a scribe.&lt;ref name="m&amp;hviiviii"/&gt; Housman argues that L is the superior of the two, as it was probably copied straight from α, whereas G was probably derived from a copy of a copy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 5|Housman (1930)]], pp. v{{en dash}}vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second family, "β", takes its name from the now-lost [[Archetype (textual criticism)|archetype]] and includes manuscript M,&lt;ref name=astrofivehous&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 5|Housman (1930)]], p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cvi/&gt; which itself is a direct descendant of the manuscript that [[Poggio Bracciolini]] rediscovered (i.e. the aforementioned manuscript β) near [[Constance]] during a break in the [[Council of Constance]] c.{{nbsp}}1416{{en dash}}17.&lt;ref name="m&amp;hviiviii"/&gt;&lt;ref name=astrofivehous/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 5|Housman (1930)]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; M had been transcribed by a German [[amanuensis]] on Bracciolini's request, but due to the scribe's incompetence{{#tag:ref|Bracciolini wrote that the scribe was ''ignorantissimus omnium viventium'' ("the most ignorant thing alive").&lt;ref name="m&amp;hviiviii"/&gt;|group="nb"}} the resultant manuscript was riddled with mistakes, prompting Bracciolini to sarcastically remark that the new copy had to be "divined rather than read" (''divinare oportet non legere'').&lt;ref name="m&amp;hviiviii"&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 1|Housman (1903)]], pp. vii{{en dash}}viii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Asso|Asso 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although poorly written, M has been singled out as possibly the most important surviving manuscript, because it was a direct copy of the archetype (β), whereas G and L are derived from a less "faithful" copy (that is, α) of the archetype.&lt;ref name=cvi/&gt;

Following the invention of the printing press, the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''Astronomica'' was published in [[Nuremberg]] around 1473 by the astronomer [[Regiomontanus]] from an error-riddled Italian copy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m&amp;hxii&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 1|Housman (1903)]], p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=introduction_rob_2&gt;[[#Ellis|Ellis (1904)]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was then [[textual criticism|critically edited]] by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]], whose first edition was published in Paris in 1579; a second and improved edition, collated at least partially from the ''Codex Gemblacensis'', was published in Leiden in 1599{{en dash}}1600, and a third edition was published in 1655 after Scaliger's death by [[Johann Heinrich Boeckler]].&lt;ref name=volk3/&gt;&lt;ref name=m&amp;hxiii&gt;[[#Housman Vol. 1|Housman (1903)]], p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=introduction_rob_2/&gt; An updated edition was published by [[Richard Bentley]] in 1739.&lt;ref name=introduction_rob_3&gt;[[#Ellis|Ellis (1904)]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in five volumes between 1903 and 1930, Housman published what is considered by many scholars the authoritative edition of the poem (with an additional ''editio minor'' in 1932).&lt;ref name=volk3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Garrod|Garrod (1933)]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Volk, "[Housman's] work is famous{{em dash}}some might say notorious{{em dash}}for its bold handling of the text, its incisive commentary, and its merciless ... invective against other scholars."&lt;ref name=volk3&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, G.

[[File:Alfred Edward Housman.jpeg|thumb|alt=Photographic portrait of a middle-aged A. E. Housman|Although Manilius hoped that the ''Astronomica'' would earn him literary immortality, it barely survived the Middle Ages. [[A. E. Housman]] (''pictured'') compared it to a shipwreck, citing it as an example of why "no man ever ought to trust the gods".&lt;ref name=volk3/&gt;]]

While Manilius is not quoted by any extant Roman author, many scholars argue that he is alluded to by a number of authors, including: [[Ausonius]], [[Claudian]], [[Commodian]], [[Dracontius]], [[Juvenal]], [[Lucan]], [[Manetho]], [[Martianus Capella]], [[Nemesianus]], [[Orientius]], [[Pseudepigrapha|Pseudo-]]Empedocles, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], [[Tertullian]], [[Titus Calpurnius Siculus]], and [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;ref name=volk1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hubner2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk2011|Volk (2011)]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; With this said, Hübner cautions that such assumptions should be considered carefully (or downright rejected, in the cases of Manetho and Pseudo-Empedocles), as the similarities may be due to a lost ancient epic precursor that Manilius and the others were all alluding to or borrowing from.&lt;ref name=Hubner2&gt;[[#Hübner2|Hübner (2012)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]] (who wrote in the time of [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] about astrology and other subjects) resembles Manilius's work in many ways; for instance, in his ''Matheseos libri octo'' (composed c.{{nbsp}}334{{en dash}}37), Firmicus follows Manilius's method of instruction closely and analyzes the poet's astrological fundamentals.&lt;ref name=volk1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that Firmicus almost certainly used Manilius (or someone inspired by him) as a guide.&lt;ref name=volk1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt; But despite the similarity between Firmicus's work and Manilius's, Firmicus neither mentions Manilius by name nor lists him as among the few Romans (viz.

Volk notes that the earliest references to ''Astronomica''{{em dash}}aside from literary allusions{{em dash}}may be found in two Roman funerary inscriptions, both of which bear the line, "We are born to die, and our end hangs from the beginning" (''nascentes morimur finisque ab origine pendet'') from the poem's fourth book.&lt;ref name="inscriptions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 1, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''Astronomica'', 4.16.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is not without its detractors, and scholars such as A. Maranini and Gómez Pallarès have suggested that these two inscriptions are forgeries dating from the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="inscriptions"&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. 62, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few copies of the ''Astronomica'' survived into the medieval period, and consequently Manilius seems to have been little read during this period. However, there are a few exceptions to this dearth of attention. Hübner, for instance, writes that Manilius may have inspired some of the writings of [[Columbanus]].&lt;ref name=Hubner2/&gt; Additionally, an AD 988 letter from Gerbertus Aureliacensis to the abbey at Bobbio in which a request is made for a work "by M.{{nbsp}}Manilius (or possibly Manlius) about astrology" (''M.{{nbsp}}Manilius'' (''[[:wikt:varia lectio#English|v.l.]] Manlius'') ''de astrologica'') is evidence that a copy of the ''Astronomica'' was probably kept in the [[Bobbio Abbey#Library|library at Bobbio]].&lt;ref name=goold5not8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], pp. 1{{en dash}}2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was largely ignored during [[Ancient history|antiquity]] and the Middle Ages, the poem generated scholarly interest upon its 15th-century rediscovery. The Italian humanist Lorenzo Bonincontri delivered lectures on the ''Astronomica'' to large audiences and compiled his lecture notes into the work's first commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heilen|Heilen (2011)]], p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonincontri was apparently interested in Manilius's treatment of the nature of comets in the first book of the ''Astronomica'', and, according to Stephan Heilen, portions of Bonincontri's ''De rebus naturalibus et divinis'' are based on Manilius's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heilen|Heilen (2011)]], pp. 278{{en dash}}310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the attention it received after its rediscovery, the ''Astronomica'' has never been as widely studied as other classical Latin poems. With that said, interest in the poem developed in the second half of the 20th century when scholars began to study Manilius's philosophical and scientific ideas.&lt;ref name="g&amp;v1"&gt;[[#Volk2011|Volk (2011)]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-length English [[monograph]] on Manilius and the ''Astronomica'' was Volk's ''Manilius and His Intellectual Background'', which was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2009|Volk (2009)]], p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Volk and Green edited ''Forgotten Stars: Rediscovering Manilius' Astronomica'' with essays from scholars worldwide. The book's purpose was to "encourage readers to discover Manilius" and expand scholarly interest in the ''Astronomica'', since previous research of the work's poetic, scientific, and philosophical themes had been primarily limited to Germany, France, and Italy.&lt;ref name="g&amp;v1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk 2002|Volk (2002)]], p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; And while Manilius and his poem have been analyzed by scholars, many lay readers find the ''Astronomica'' confusing and overly technical. According to Kristine Louise Haugen, "The ambiguous phrases and extravagant circumlocutions necessitated by Manilius's hexameter verse must often have made the ''Astronomica'' seem, as it does today, rather like a [[trigonometry]] textbook rendered as a Saturday ''[[New York Times]]'' [[crossword puzzle|crossword]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haugen|Haugen (2011)]], p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have noted the irony of Manilius's relative obscurity, because he wrote the ''Astronomica'' in the hope of attaining literary immortality. Housman voiced this sentiment in a dedicatory Latin poem written for the first volume of his edition that contrasted the movement of celestial objects with [[Death|mortality]] and the fate of Manilius's work.&lt;ref name=volk3/&gt; He compared the ''Astronomica'' to a shipwreck (''carmina'' ... ''naufraga''), arguing that it was incomplete and imperfect, having barely survived textual transmission; Housman mused that because Manilius's ambitions of literary fame and immortality had been almost entirely dashed, his work should serve as an example of why "no man ever ought to trust the gods" (''ne quis forte deis fidere vellet homo'').&lt;ref name=volk3/&gt;

The '''Banū Munqidh''', also referred to as the '''Munqidhites''', were an [[Arab]] family that ruled an [[emirate]] in the [[Orontes River|Orontes Valley]] in northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] from the mid-11th century until the family's demise in an [[1157 Hama earthquake|earthquake in 1157]]. The emirate was initially based in [[Kafartab]] before the Banu Munqidh took over the fortress of [[Shaizar|Shayzar]] in 1081 and made it their headquarters for the remainder of their rule. The capture of Shayzar was the culmination of a long, drawn out process beginning with the Banu Munqidh's nominal assignment to the land by the [[Salih ibn Mirdas|Mirdasid emir]] of [[Aleppo]] in 1025, and accelerating with the weakened grip of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule in northern Syria in the 1070s. 

Under the reign of Emir Ali ibn Muqallad (r. 1059–1082), the Banu Munqidh reached their territorial peak with the emirate extending from the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] port of [[Latakia]] to [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]]. The [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] conquest of Syria in 1085 and subsequent struggles with local Muslim lords reduced the Munqidh emirate to Shayzar and its environs. Under Emir Sultan ibn Ali (r. 1098–1154), the Banu Munqidh alternated between combating the [[Crusaders]] who landed in Syria in 1099 and paying tribute to them. During this period, the family also had to contend with [[Nizari Ismaili state|Ismai'li]] newcomers encroaching on their domains. To firmly protect the emirate, Sultan ultimately put the Banu Munqidh under [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] suzerainty. After the death of Emir Muhammad ibn Sultan (r. 1154–1157) and his family, the emirate passed to the Zengid emir [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]], who granted it to the [[Banu al-Daya]] family.

Through a combination of wealth, diplomatic acumen and military skills, the Banu Munqidh survived as a local power and successfully resisted attempts by the Crusaders and stronger Syrian Muslim dynasties to seize their strategic fortress in Shayzar. Among their enemies and allies, the Banu Munqidh gained a reputation for "martial valor, honor, piety and courtly refinement" in the words of historian Adnan Husain. Their rural lands, which were largely populated by [[Greek Orthodox Christian]]s, were distinguished for their well-kept and prosperous state. From early on, the family was also known to provide refuge for a wide array of people, ranging from Muslim refugees fleeing Crusader assaults or exiled Muslim generals, officials and other dignitaries. The most well-known member of the family, [[Usama ibn Munqidh]] (1095–1188), went on to have to have a proficient career in literature and diplomacy serving on the courts of the Zengids, [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]]s, [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]]s.

==History==
===Emergence===
The Banu Munqidh were an [[Arab]] family belonging to the Kinana branch of the [[Banu Kalb]] tribe.&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"&gt;Humphreys 1993, p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy6"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Banu Kalb were largely concentrated around Damascus in the late 10th century, the Kinana inhabited the eastern environs of the [[Orontes River]] in northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]].&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"/&gt; A member of the family, Ali ibn Munqidh ibn Nasr al-Kinani, is first mentioned in 960 when he was taken captive by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s during a major [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] defeat; also taken prisoner was the poet and governor [[Abu Firas al-Hamdani]].&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"/&gt; 

It was not until the 11th century that the Banu Munqidh emerged in regional politics.&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"/&gt; At that time, the family entered the service of [[Salih ibn Mirdas]], founder of the [[Aleppo]]-based [[Mirdasid dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"/&gt; According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the Banu Munqidh were numerous and strong enough at the time to "play an influential role in the life of the Mirdasid dynasty".&lt;ref name="Zakkar85"&gt;Zakkar 1971, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon capturing Aleppo in 1025, Salih granted the Munqhidi chieftain, Muqallad ibn Nasr ibn Munqidh, the lands around [[Shayzar]] as an ''[[iqta|iqṭāʿ]]'' (fief); the town of Shayzar itself was in Byzantine hands, however.&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy6"/&gt; With their assignment to Shayzar being in name only, the Banu Munqidh instead used [[Kafartab]] as their headquarters.&lt;ref name="Kennedy6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakkar85"/&gt;

===Reign of Ali===
Muqallad died in 1059, after which his son Ali inherited his ''iqtaʿ''.&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"/&gt; Under Ali, the Banu Munqidh played a dominant role in the affairs of their nominal Mirdasid suzerains.&lt;ref name="Humphreys577"/&gt; Tensions with the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, [[Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud|Mahmud ibn Nasr]], led Ali to depart Aleppo for [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] where he was able to gain further recognition of the Banu Munqidh's budding principality in the middle Orontes valley.&lt;ref name="Bianqis121"&gt;Bianqis 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; During the chaotic succession process following Mahmud's death, Ali was instrumental in installing Mahmud's son Sabiq as Aleppo's emir.&lt;ref name="Bianqis121"/&gt; However, Sabiq's succession was opposed by the other members of the Mirdasid house and the [[Banu Kilab]] tribe to whom they belonged who favored Sabiq's brother Waththab.&lt;ref name="Bianqis121"/&gt; After a number of major battles between the opposing sides and amid severe famine in Aleppo, [[Muslim ibn Quraysh]], the [[Uqaylid dynasty|Uqaylid]] emir of [[Mosul]] saw an opportunity to take the city.&lt;ref name="Bianqis122"&gt;Bianqis 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of his entry into Aleppo in 1080 and the refusal of the Mirdasids to surrender the citadel, Ali intervened to mediate between the two sides.&lt;ref name="Bianqis122"/&gt; Ultimately, Ali facilitated the city's surrender to Muslim in return for the allotment of ''iqṭāʿat'' to the Mirdasids in Aleppo's hinterland.&lt;ref name="Bianqis122"/&gt;

====Struggle for Shayzar====
[[File:Shayzar3.jpg|right|thumb|The fortress of [[Shaizar|Shayzar]] became the headquarters of the Banu Munqidh between 1080 until the citadel’s collapse and the family’s consequent demise in the [[1157 Hama earthquake|1157 earthquake]] ]]

Meanwhile, the Banu Munqidh led renewed efforts to capture the Shayzar fortress in what historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]] described as a “long, drawn out process”.&lt;ref name="Kennedy6"/&gt; The catalyst of these efforts was the weakening grip of the Byzantines in northern Syria following their defeat by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Sultanate]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071.&lt;ref name="Kennedy6"/&gt; In 1076, Ali began construction of the Hisn al-Jisr fortress, which would limit Shayzar’s access to the Orontes River.&lt;ref name="Kennedy6-7"&gt;Kennedy 2012, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hisn al-Jisr was used to hamper the flow of supplies into Shayzar from the Byzantine mainland.&lt;ref name="Kennedy6"/&gt; At the time, it was also utilized by Ali for diplomatic efforts amid the struggle for Syria between the ascendant Seljuks and their opponents.&lt;ref name="Kennedy7"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1078/79, he sheltered the families of the Seljuks’ Turkish opponents from Aleppo and he hosted the Seljuk general Afshin, persuading him to spare both Kafartab and Byzantine Shayzar from his pillaging.&lt;ref name="Kennedy7"/&gt; These were early demonstrations of how “diplomatic skills, more than military power, enabled the Banu Munqidh to maintain their precarious independence”, according to Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Kennedy7"/&gt;

The Banu Munqidh’s pressure on Shayzar compelled its Byzantine rulers to surrender the fortress to Ali in December 1081 in exchange for a certain sum and guarantees of upkeep of the town bishop’s home.&lt;ref name="Kennedy7"/&gt; Shayzar became the center of the Munqidh emirate (principality).&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"&gt;Humphreys 1993, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; The family under Ali soon after faced a siege by the Uqaylids but leveraged their significant wealth to settle with Muslim ibn Quraysh.&lt;ref name="Kennedy8"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Ali's death in 1082, the Banu Munqidh's emirate extended to the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] port town of [[Latakia]] and included [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] and a few smaller places, in addition to Shayzar and Kafartab.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt;

===Reign of Nasr===
Sadid al-Mulk succeeded was succeeded by his son Nasr.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; The principal challenge the Banu Munqidh faced during Nasr's reign was the expansion of Seljuk rule into Syria.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; Like their previous encounter with the Uqaylids, the family employed the same strategy to stave off an attack by the Seljuk ruler [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Sulayman ibn Qutulmush]] in 1085.&lt;ref name="Kennedy8"/&gt; Moreover, Nasr's conviction that the Seljuks could not be defeated led him to cede his family's territories in Latakia, Apamea and Kafartab to the sultanate in exchange for their firm recognition of the Banu Munqidh's possession of Shayzar in 1086/87.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; Through his good offices with the Seljuk ruler of Aleppo, he was able to return the ceded towns to the Banu Munqidh in 1091.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; However, in 1096 Apamea and Kafartab were lost to the family's Arab rival, Khalaf ibn Mula'ib, the formerly semi-independent lord of [[Homs]].&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb11"&gt;Cobb 2005, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Mula'ib was a former subordinate of Nasr who he gradually had to contend with as a frequently hostile neighbor of the Banu Munqidh.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb11"/&gt; In one encounter, Nasr was badly defeated in an ambush by Ibn Mula'ib during an attack outside Shayzar.&lt;ref name="Cobb11"/&gt;

===Reign of Sultan===
[[File:Siege de Shaizar (1138).jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of [[John II Komnenos|John II]]’s Byzantine-Crusader coalition [[Siege of Shaizar|siege of Shayzar]] in 1138, French manuscript 1338.]]

In 1098, Nasr ibn Ali died and the lordship of Shayzar passed to his sons. For unknown reasons, Nasr's brother and chosen successor, Murshid,&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; withdrew himself from the line of succession in favor of his younger brother Sultan,&lt;ref&gt;Husain 2011, pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt; who had served as the Banu Munqidh's governor in Latakia.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; Murshid maintained a prominent leadership role as his then-childless brother's deputy.&lt;ref name="Husain194"&gt;Husain 2011, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 11th century, the Banu Munqidh’s possessions were under threat not only by their Turkish suzerains, but also the encroachments of the Banu Kilab, the growing presence of the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Nizari Ismaili]]s in the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|coastal mountains of northern Syria]] and the newly arrived [[Crusades|Crusaders]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2012, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During Sultan’s reign, the Banu Munqidh had become more numerous and Sultan chiefly depended on his own kinsmen in confrontations with the constellation of powers, local and regional, that controlled northern Syria.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; He could also rely on his Kinana tribesmen to an extent and the militiamen of Shayzar.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; To a much lesser extent the family recruited [[Kurds|Kurdish]] mercenaries and Turkish ''[[mamluk]]s'' (slave soldiers).&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; Meanwhile, a tentative alliance was formed with Ibn Mula'ib despite the wounding of Sultan and Murshid in a battle with him in 1104.&lt;ref name="Cobb11"/&gt; Together, the Banu Munqidh and Ibn Mula'ib attacked a small Crusader-held fort in their region in 1106, but Ibn Mula'ib betrayed the Banu Munqidh by deserting and stealing their horses.&lt;ref name="Cobb11"/&gt; Before the family could retaliate, Ibn Mula'ib was killed by an Ismai'il assassin.&lt;ref name="Cobb11"/&gt; At this time, friendly relations were also established with the family's other erstwhile rivals, the Turkish Ibn Qaraja emirs of Hama and Homs.&lt;ref name="Cobb12"&gt;Cobb 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal Crusader threat to the Banu Munqidh was posed by the neighboring [[Principality of Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; The prince of Antioch, Tancred, attacked and plundered the Banu Munqidh's emirate in 1110 and imposed a heavy tribute on Shayzar, a testament to its wealth at the time.&lt;ref name="Kennedy10"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Tancred built the Tell Ibn Ma'shar fortress along the west bank of the Orontes, across from Shayzar,&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; to prepare an assault against the city.&lt;ref name="Kennedy10"/&gt; Sultan reached out to [[Mawdud]] of Mosul to prevent this, while Tancred gathered a larger Crusader coalition including the rulers of Jerusalem and Tripoli.&lt;ref name="Kennedy10"/&gt; In the ensuing [[Battle of Shaizar|Battle of Shayzar]], which was according to Kennedy was more of "a prolonged confrontation" than a battle, the Crusader armies retreated in October 1111.&lt;ref name="Kennedy11"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Banu Munqidh continued paying the annual tribute to Antioch.&lt;ref name="Kennedy11"/&gt;

Shayzar also became a target of the Isma'ili sect subsequent to their exodus from Syria's major cities to the coastal mountains.&lt;ref name="Kennedy9"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to seize Shayzar in 1114 while the Banu Munqidh family were away participating in the Easter celebrations of their Orthodox Christian subjects.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy9"/&gt; The attack was coordinated with the town's Isma'ili residents, who had been generally well-treated by the Banu Munqidh.&lt;ref name="Kennedy9"/&gt; About one hundred Isma'ilis seized the citadel, expelling its residents.&lt;ref name="Kennedy9"/&gt; A bloody struggle ensued upon the Banu Munqidh's return to Shayzar, and involved the participation of the family's women.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; It ended with the slaying of all the Ismai'ili attackers and the enactment of certain measures to prevent a recurrence.&lt;ref name="Kennedy9"/&gt; The following year, a Muslim–Crusader coalition composed of Roger of Antioch, Toghtekin of Damascus and Ilghazi of Mardin besieged Shayzar in response to the plans of the Banu Munqidh's ally Mawdud of Mosul to conquer Syria.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt;

====Suzerainty of the Zengids====
In 1127 Sultan put the Banu Munqidh under the suzerainty of the ascendant Muslim ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]], which allowed for a greater level of security for the family's domains.&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt; This was interrupted by a short siege of Shayzar by the Burid ruler of Damascus, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il, in 1133 and a greater crisis by the Byzantine–Crusader [[Siege of Shaizar|siege of Shayzar]] in 1138 led by 
[[John II Komnenos]].&lt;ref name="Humphreys578"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy11"/&gt; The Byzantine-led army initially attacked the Banu Munqidh-held forts of Kafartab and Hisn al-Jisr, causing their inhabitants to flee, before proceeding in their assault against Shayzar.&lt;ref name="Kennedy12"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic and Greek sources both indicate that the Banu Munqidh and the people of Shayzar resisted the siege and the Byzantines' catapults for several days before John II's army withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2012, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Arabic sources claim the Byzantines left after hearing of the arrival of Zengid reinforcements&lt;ref name="Kennedy12"/&gt; while the Greek sources claim the withdrawal was precipitated by a Zengid attack on on Byzantine-held [[Edessa]] and Sultan's offer to pay off John II.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The domain of the Banu Munqidh entered a long period of stability and prosperity beginning in 1138.&lt;ref name="Kennedy16"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Shayzar and it’s dependencies remained under the control of Sultan who ruled under the authority of the Zengid dynasty.&lt;ref name="Kennedy16"/&gt; However, in 1140/41 the Ismai'ils captured the fortress of [[Masyaf]] from the Banu Munqidh, who had purchased it in 1127/28.&lt;ref name="Lewis109"&gt;Lewis, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It thereafter became the Isma'ilis' main stronghold in Syria.&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis109"/&gt; This generally peaceful period also coincided with tensions between Sultan and his nephews. Murshid's position as the Banu Munqidh's second highest-ranking leader enabled the latter's sons, including [[Usama ibn Munqidh|Usama]], to rise politically within the emirate.&lt;ref name="Husain194"/&gt; They gained a reputation for their martial and diplomatic skills and Sultan viewed their prominence as a threat to his leadership.&lt;ref name="Kennedy16"/&gt; These tensions culminated after Murshid's death in 1136/37 and the birth of Sultan's son Taj al-Mulk Muhammad in the following year.&lt;ref name="Kennedy16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Husain194"/&gt; As a consequence, Usama and his brothers were exiled from Shayzar,&lt;ref name="Husain194"/&gt; finding asylum with [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]], the Zengid emir of Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Kennedy16"/&gt; After Sultan's death in 1154, Taj al-Mulk Muhammad succeeded him without incident.&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"/&gt; 

===Demise===
Most of the Banu Munqidh, including Taj al-Mulk and his children, died in the collapse of the Shayzar citadel during the [[1157 Hama earthquake|August 1157 earthquake]], which devastated a number of other towns in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2012, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; This brought an end to their rule of the Shayzar principality, which was soon after seized by Nur ad-Din to prevent its capture by the Crusaders.&lt;ref name="Kennedy20"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Nur ad-Din did not seek to find any surviving members of the Banu Munqidh to resume their lordship of Shayzar, whose fortifications he had promptly restored.&lt;ref name="Kennedy20"/&gt; Instead, he handed the town over to a certain Sabiq al-Din Uthman ibn al-Daya.&lt;ref name="Kennedy20"/&gt; The latter's family, the Banu al-Daya, remained the lords of Shayzar through [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] rule until 1233.&lt;ref&gt;Tonghini and Montevecci 2006, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomacy and social relations==
===Relations with the Crusaders===
The Banu Munqidh initially reacted to the Crusader invasion of coastal Syria by offering the Crusader king of Jerusalem, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], a tributary arrangement, provisioning of food supplies and protection for Christian pilgrims passing through the family's territory.&lt;ref name="Husain192"&gt;Husain 2011, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Kingdom of Jerusalem did not border the Banu Munqidh's domains, the neighboring Frankish principality of Antioch was under Jerusalem's overall authority.&lt;ref name="Husain192"/&gt; This accord with the newly arrived Crusaders in [[Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]] spared Shayzar the latter's devastating raids.&lt;ref name="Husain192"/&gt; Intermittent warfare in the form of raids and clashes partly characterized the contact between the Banu Munqidh and the Crusader states, but they largely maintained practical ties.&lt;ref name="Husain193"/&gt; In 1108, a large annual tribute was imposed by the Crusaders on the Banu Munqidh.&lt;ref name="Husain193"/&gt; 

In addition to the financial sums, they also had to provide guides for the emissaries of the neighboring [[Principality of Antioch]] on their way to [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Husain193"/&gt; The family was particularly close to King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] (r. 1118-1131) and hosted him in Shayzar in 1124 at the request of his Muslim captor and ruler of Aleppo, Timurtash ibn Ilghazi, during negotiations for Baldwin's release.&lt;ref name="Husain193"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler126"&gt;Kohler, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The Munqidhi emirs Sultan and Murshid successfully mediated the ransom for Baldwin's freedom.&lt;ref name="Kohler126"/&gt; Subsequent to his release, Baldwin relieved the Banu Munqidh of their tribute and services in appreciation of their generosity.&lt;ref name="Husain193"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler126"/&gt; The bonds forged between the Banu Munqidh and King Baldwin II enabled Usama ibn Munqidh to play a mediating role in the diplomatic negotiations of the early 1130s between Baldwin and [[Taj al-Muluk Buri]], the [[Burid dynasty|Burid]] ruler of [[Damascus]] in whose court Usama served.&lt;ref name="Husain193"/&gt; 

===Relations with Muslim states and lordships===
Despite generally peaceful relations with the Franks, the Banu Munqidh remained loyal to their Muslim suzerains, fighting alongside the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damasucs in their battles and campaigns against the Crusaders in 1111, 1115 and 1119.&lt;ref name="Kohler125"/&gt; The family also fended off Crusader attacks against their domains between 1122 and 1124.&lt;ref name="Kohler125"/&gt; The family maintained friendly ties with a number of the semi-independent Muslim lords of other fortress towns who shared their social standing, the Fatimid lord [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]] of [[Abu Qubays]] and the Banu Salim ibn Malik of [[Qal'at Ja'bar]];&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler126"/&gt; the former's sister was married to Sultan and the emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar shared similar Arab tribal origins as the Banu Munqidh.&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler126"/&gt; The Banu Munqidh's emirs paid social visits to Iftikhar al-Dawla,&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"/&gt; while keeping frequent contact with Shihab al-Din Salim ibn Malik via letters, couriers and the exchange of gifts.&lt;ref name="Kohler126"/&gt; The emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar played a similar diplomatic role as the Banu Munqidh and both families were described in the Syrian ''Chronicon, A.C. 1234'' as "a good sort of people, friendly to all and good mediators at any time".&lt;ref name="Kohler126"/&gt; 

===Provision of asylum===
The Banu Munqidh often provided asylum for refugees and exiles.&lt;ref name="Kohler125"/&gt; In 1041, they gave temporary refuge in Kafartab to the Fatimid governor of Syria, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]], when he was ousted from Damascus and then escorted him safely to the [[Citadel of Aleppo]].&lt;ref name="Zakkar85"/&gt; Later, in the Crusader era, the Banu Munqidh gave refuge to Muslim families fleeing the [[Siege of Ma'arra|Crusader assault on Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]] in 1098; the son of their erstwhile rival Khalaf ibn Mula'ib of Apamea in 1106; the ousted Muslim ruler of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], Qadi Fakhr al-Mulk ibn Ammar, in 1109; and the Isma'ili ''[[da'i]]'' (missionary) of Aleppo, Ibrahim, when he fled Seljuk persecution in 1113.&lt;ref name="Kohler125"/&gt;

==Recreation==
Based on the accounts of Usama ibn Munqidh, the family were avid hunters and went on expeditions in the wetlands of Orontes valley west of Shayzar and in the hills south of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2012, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The expeditions were led by the family's emirs who led retinues containing tens of horsemen, including relatives and ''mamluks''.&lt;ref name="Kennedy18"&gt;Kennedy 2012, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with various birds of prey, dogs and cheetahs, they hunted [[francolin]], waterfowl, hares, wild boars and partridges.&lt;ref name="Kennedy18"/&gt; However, the ultimate prey of the Munqidhi emirs were lions and leopards, the slaying of which were an apparent symbol and function of the emir's authority.&lt;ref name="Kennedy18"/&gt; According to Kennedy, "killing lions and leopards" was "one of the ways" an emir "demonstrated his protection of and care for the people who lived on his lands".&lt;ref name="Kennedy18"/&gt;

==Assessment==
From the citadel of Shayzar, which was perched on a rocky hilly enveloped by the Orontes River, the Banu Munqidh ruled a relatively a small emirate largely inhabited by [[Greek Orthodox Christian]]s.&lt;ref name="Husain190"&gt;Husain 2011, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout their rule, the emirate was surrounded by frequently hostile powers, whether local or regional Muslim lords, Crusader principalities or Bedouin tribes.&lt;ref name="Husain191-192"&gt;Husain 2011, pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their military abilities, the family often pursued diplomacy and alliances with their larger neighbors.&lt;ref name="Husain191-192"/&gt; together, their martial skills and diplomatic maneuvers enabled their survival.&lt;ref name="Husain191-192"/&gt; The Banu Munqidh were described as an "elite, patrician family of well-known warriors who enjoyed a wide reputation of for martial valor, honor, piety, and courtly refinement" by historian Adnan Husain.&lt;ref&gt;Husain 2011, pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an account of a conversation between an emissary of [[Roger of Salerno|Roger of Antioch]] and Sultan in 1116, the lands of the Banu Munqidh were distinguished by their development and prosperity from the ruinous state of the surrounding region.&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Husain193"&gt;Husain 2011, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler125"&gt;Kohler, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an apparent testament to the Banu Munqidh’s wealth.&lt;ref name="Kennedy17"/&gt;

'''Benjamin Hobson''' (1816–1873) (Chinese：合信) was a [[Protestantism in China|Protestant]] [[Medical missions in China|medical missionary]] who served with the [[London Missionary Society]] in [[imperial China]] during its [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasty]]. His ''Treatise on Physiology'', reproducing and elaborating on work by [[William Cheselden]], helped revolutionize Chinese and later [[Tokugawa Japan|Japanese]] medical understanding and treatment.

==Life==
Hobson was born in 1816 in [[Welford, Northamptonshire|Welford]], [[Northamptonshire]], in [[England]].{{sfn|''BDCC''}} He graduated from [[University College London|London University]] with a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB]] and passed an examination as a [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]].&lt;ref name=wf&gt;{{harvp|Wylie|1867|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=jRQQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125 125]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining the [[London Missionary Society]] as a [[Medical missions in China|medical missionary]] to the [[Qing Empire]], he departed with his wife Jane Abbey Hobson and Messrs Legge and [[William Milne (missionary)|Milne]] on {{ship||Eliza Stewart|1833 ship|2}}. It left London on 28 July 1839, and reached [[Anyer]] on 12 November 12 and [[Portuguese Macao|Macao]] on 18 December. Assisted by [[Elijah Bridgman]], Hobson found a residence and joined the local [[Medical Missionary Society]]. Its hospital reopened on August 1, 1840. When [[William Lockhart (priest)|William Lockhart]] left for [[Zhoushan]] at the end of the month and Dr Diver retired from poor health soon afterwards, Hobson was left in sole charge of its operation. In early 1843, he left to establish an MMS hospital in [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. This opened to patients on June 1&lt;ref name=wf/&gt; and the demand for its services so outstripped both expectations and capacity that he relied heavily on help from Chinese assistants. This led him to consider how to explain western medical training to the Chinese,{{sfn|''BDCC''}} then reliant on often [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medicine]].

In 1845, his wife's health was so poor that they left for Britain in July but she died while at anchor off Dungeness on December 22. Left with a young son and daughter,&lt;ref name=wf/&gt; he married Rebecca Morrison,{{sfn|''BDCC''}} the daughter of his fellow Chinese missionary [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert]], while in England. He returned with her and Mr Hirschberg on the ''Hugh Walker''. This left Britain on March 11, 1847, and reached Hong Kong on July 27, whereupon he resumed direction of its hospital.&lt;ref name=wf/&gt;

He visited [[Guangzhou]] ([[Postal Map Romanization|then known]] as "Canton") with Mr Gillespie in October 1847 and moved there the next February, operating a clinic out of his residence. In April, he opened a pharmacy and, in June, purchased the house on Kum-Le-Fo&lt;ref name=ws&gt;{{harvp|Wylie|1867|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=jRQQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA126 126]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|金|利|埠}}}}, ''Jīnlì Bù'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit|literally}}.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Golden Benefit Wharf") in the [[Xiguan|western suburbs]]&lt;ref name=gib/&gt; for use as the Missionary Hospital&lt;ref name=ws/&gt; or {{nowrap|Wo Ai}} Clinic {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|惠|愛|醫館}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|惠|爱|医馆}}}},}} ''Huìài Yīguǎn'').&lt;ref name=gib&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |contribution=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林 |title=''《广东史志》'' |date=1999 |publisher=CNKI }}. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he was assisted by the Chinese ministers and missionaries [[Liang Fa]] and [[Zhou Xue]]. At the end of 1854, he traveled to [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] for a five-week rest for health reasons. He and his family were forced to evacuate to Hong Kong in October 1856 on account of the onset of the [[Second Opium War]].&lt;ref name=ws/&gt;

The missionary community of Shanghai prevailed upon him to return in February 1857 and he took Dr Lockhart's place at their hospital when Lockhart returned to England at the end of that year. His eldest son took work with a merchant house, but the rest of the family returned with him to Europe, reaching England in March 1859. His health not permitting his return to China, he then resided at Clifton and [[Cheltenham]].&lt;ref name=ws/&gt; He died at [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]] near [[London]] in 1873.{{sfn|''BDCC''}}

He hears a voice from heaven telling him to "kill and eat." Peter is naturally taken aback, because eating some of these animals would mean breaking the Jewish rules about kosher foods. But then he hears a voice that tells him, "What God has cleansed, you must not call common [unclean]" (that is, you do not need to refrain from eating nonkosher foods; 10: 15). The same sequence of events happens three times.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the [[New Testament]] does give a few guidelines about the consumption of meat, practiced by the [[Christian Church]] today; one of these is not consuming food knowingly offered to pagan [[Idolatry|idols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2002 |title=The Weaker Brother |journal=Third Way Magazine |volume=25 |issue=10 |page=25 |quote=Christ came for the Gentiles as well as the Jews (the real meaning of that vision in Acts 10:9;16) but he also calls us to look out for each other and not do things that will cause our brothers and sisters to stumble. In Corinthians Paul urges the believers to consider not eating meat when with people who assume that meat must be offered to idols before consumption: 'Food will not bring us close to God,' he writes. 'We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block for the weak.' (1 Corinthians 8:8-9)}}&lt;/ref&gt; a conviction that the [[Primitive Church|early]] [[Church Fathers]], such as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]] preached.&lt;ref name="Binder2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binder |first=Stephanie E. |title=Tertullian, On Idolatry and Mishnah Avodah Zarah |date=2012-11-14 |publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]] |language=English |isbn=978-90-04-23478-9 |page=87 |quote=Clement of Alexandria and Origen also forbid eating meat dedicated to idolatry and partaking in meals with demons, which, by association, are the meals of fornicators and idolatrous adulterers.

In the New Testament, [[Paul of Tarsus]] notes that some devout Christians may wish to [[abstinence|abstain]] from consuming meat if it causes "my brother to stumble" in his faith with God (cf. {{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|8:13|KJV}}).&lt;ref name="Phelps2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Phelps |first=Norm |title=The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible |year=2002 |publisher=Lantern Books |language=English |isbn=978-1-59056-009-9 |page=171 |quote=Nevertheless, toward the end of the chapter, Paul suggests that even Christians with strong faith may want to abstain from eating meat offered to pagan deities if any chance that their example will tempt fellow Christians of weaker faith into inadvertent idolatry.

With reference to medieval times, Jillian Williams states that "unlike the Jewish and Muslims methods of animal slaughter, which requires the draining of the animal's blood, Christian slaughter practices did not usually specify the method of slaughter". In actual practice, states Williams, European Christians have flexibly practiced both the method of draining the blood, and wringing the animal's neck to retain its blood as valuable food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jillian Williams|title=Food and Religious Identities in Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9shBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81704-2|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Basheer Ahmad Masri, the "Jewish and the Christian methods of slaughter fulfill the Islamic condition of bleeding the animal".&lt;ref name="Masri1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Masri |first=Basheer Ahmad |title=Animals in Islam |year=1989 |publisher=Athene Trust |language=English |isbn=978-1-870603-01-0 |quote=Both the Jewish and the Christian methods of slaughter fulfill the Islamic condition of bleeding the animal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, David Grumett and Rachel Muers state that the Orthodox Christian ''Shechitah'' and Jewish ''Kosher'' methods of slaughter differ from the Muslim ''Halal'' (Dabh) method in that they require the cut to "sever trachea, oesophagus and the jugular veins" as this method is believed to produce meat with minimal suffering to the animal.

Some [[Christian denomination]]s condone the moderate drinking of alcohol (moderationism), such as Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, and the Orthodox,&lt;ref name="Scratchley1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scratchley |first=David |title=Alcoholism and Other Drug Problems |year=1996 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |language=English |isbn=978-0-684-82314-0 |page=298 |quote=Although the Jewish, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Episcopal, and Lutheran traditions generally allow moderate drinking for those who can do so, it is simply incorrect to accuse them of condoning drunkenness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others, such as  Seventh-day Adventists, [[Baptist]]s, Methodists, and [[Pentecostal]]s either abstain from or prohibit the consumption of alcohol ([[teetotalism|abstentionism]] and [[prohibitionism]]).&lt;ref name="Conlin2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Conlin |first=Joseph |title=The American Past: A Survey of American History, Enhanced Edition |date=11 January 2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |language=English |isbn=978-0-495-56609-0 |page=748 |quote=Protestants who called themselves "fundamentalists" (they believed in the literal truth of the Bible--Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals) were dry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all Christian Churches, in view of the [[Alcohol in the Bible|Biblical position on the issue]], universally condemn [[drunkenness]] as [[Christian views on sin|sinful]].&lt;ref name="DomenicoHanley2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Domenico |first1=Roy P. |last2=Hanley |first2=Mark Y. |title=Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Politics |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |language=English |isbn=978-0-313-32362-1 |page=18 |quote=Drunkenness was biblically condemned, and all denominations disciplined drunken members.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cobb |first=John B. |title=Progressive Christians Speak: A Different Voice on Faith and Politics |year=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |language=English |isbn=978-0-664-22589-6 |page=136 |quote=For most of Christian history, as in the Bible, moderate drinking of alcohol was taken for granted while drunkenness was condemned.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consecrated life''', in the [[canon law of the Catholic Church]], is a stable form of [[Christian]] living by those faithful who are [[Vocation|called]] to follow Jesus Christ in a more exacting way recognized by the Church. It "is characterized by the public profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience, in a stable state of life recognized by the Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 944] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429072610/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM |date=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code of Canon Law defines it as "a stable form of living by which the faithful, following Christ more closely under the action of the Holy Spirit, are totally dedicated to God who is loved most of all, so that, having been dedicated by a new and special title to his honour, to the building up of the Church, and to the salvation of the world, they strive for the perfection of charity in the service of the kingdom of God and, having been made an outstanding sign in the Church, foretell the heavenly glory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 573 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418141521/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What makes the consecrated life a more exacting way of Christian living is the public [[religious vows]] or other sacred bonds whereby the consecrated persons commit themselves, for the love of God, to observe as binding the [[evangelical counsels]] of chastity, poverty and obedience from the [[Gospel]], or at least, in the case of consecrated virgins and widows/widowers, a vow of total chastity. The Benedictine vow as laid down in the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], ch. 58:17, is analogous to the more usual vow of religious institutes. Consecrated persons are not part of the [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church]], unless they are also [[ordination|ordained]] bishops, priests or deacons.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PT.HTM canon 207]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments: "From the very beginning of the Church there were men and women who set out to follow Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate him more closely, by practising the evangelical counsels. They led lives dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, became hermits or founded religious families. Thus the Church, by virtue of her authority, gladly accepted and approved them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 918] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429072610/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM |date=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consecrated life may be lived either in institutes or individually. While those living it are either clergy (if ordained) or lay people, the state of consecrated life is neither clerical nor lay by nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 588 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418141521/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutes of consecrated life==
Institutes of consecrated life are either [[religious institute]]s or [[secular institute]]s.

*Religious institutes are societies in which members, according to proper law, pronounce public [[Religious vows|vows]], either perpetual or temporary, which are to be renewed, however, when the period of time has lapsed, and lead a life as brothers or sisters in common".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Z.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 607]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secular institutes, are "institutes of consecrated life in which the Christian faithful, living in the world, strive for the perfection of charity and work for the [[sanctification]] of the world especially from within".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2F.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 710]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides institutes of consecrated life, the Catholic Church recognizes:
*the [[Hermit|eremitic life]], also known as the [[Anchorite|anchoritic life]], "by which the Christian faithful devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude and assiduous prayer and penance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 603 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418141521/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Church law recognizes as a hermit "one dedicated to God in a consecrated life if he or she publicly professes the three [[evangelical counsels]], confirmed by a vow or other sacred bond, in the hands of the [[diocesan bishop]], and observes his or her own plan of life under his direction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 603 §2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418141521/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mystery of the Church, that is, personal intimacy with Christ. Hidden from the eyes of men, the life of the hermit is a silent preaching of the Lord, to whom he has surrendered his life simply because he is everything to him. Here is a particular call to find in the desert, in the thick of spiritual battle, the glory of the Crucified One."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 921] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429072610/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM |date=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Consecrated virgin]]s who "expressing the holy resolution of following Jesus more closely, are consecrated to God by the diocesan bishop according to the approved liturgical rite, are mystically [[betrothed]] to Christ, the Son of God, and are dedicated to the service of the Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 604 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418141521/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sacred virgins are one of oldest forms of consecrated life, and the Ordo Virginum (Order of Virgins) began with the consecration of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the Annunciation.  They "share with the Church her own title of Virgin, Bride, and Mother" and have a specifically spousal vocation with Jesus Christ.  Consecrated virgins have come from all walks of life and their numbers include a Doctor of the Church, St. Hildegard.
*Consecrated widows may be established who, like virgins, "profess chastity apart from the world by a public profession".&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 570] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103052719/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html |date=November 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]]'s post-synodal apostolic exhortation [[Vita consecrata]] of 25 March 1996 said: "Again being practised today is the consecration of widows, known since apostolic times (cf. {{bibleverse|1|Tim|5:5|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Tim|9-10|ESV}}; {{bibleverse|1|Cor|7:8|ESV}}), as well as the consecration of widowers. These women and men, through a vow of perpetual chastity as a sign of the Kingdom of God, consecrate their state of life in order to devote themselves to prayer and the service of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_25031996_vita-consecrata_en.html ''Vita consecrata'', 7] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202150022/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_25031996_vita-consecrata_en.html |date=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the [[Latin Church]] has no specific [[liturgy|liturgical]] rite for the consecration of widows and widowers, the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'' envisages individual [[Eastern Catholic Churches|eastern Churches]] choosing to have consecrated widows.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"/&gt;
*The Code of Canon Law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 605] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418141521/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 571] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103052719/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html |date=November 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; envisage new forms of consecrated life being approved by the [[Holy See]].

== Societies of apostolic life ==

[[Society of apostolic life|Societies of apostolic life]] are dedicated to pursuit of an apostolic purpose, such as educational or missionary work. They "resemble institutes of consecrated life"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 731 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104121216/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2G.HTM |date=November 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are distinct from them. The members do not take religious vows, but live in common, striving for perfection through observing the "constitutions" of the society to which they belong. Some societies of apostolic life, but not all of them, define in their constitutions "bonds" of a certain permanence whereby their members embrace the [[evangelical counsels]].&lt;ref&gt;Code of Canon Law, canon 731 §2&lt;/ref&gt; The Code of Canon Law gives for societies of apostolic life regulations much less detailed than for institutes of consecrated life, in many instances simply referring to the constitutions of the individual societies.&lt;ref&gt;Code of Canon Law, canons 731&amp;ndash;746&lt;/ref&gt;  Although societies of apostolic life may in externals resemble religious life, a major distinction is that they are not themselves consecrated and their state of life does not change (i.e. they remain secular clerics or laypersons).

Examples of societies of apostolic life are the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri]], the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]], and the [[Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice]], and societies such as the [[Missionary Society of St. Columban]].

== History ==

Each major development in religious life, particularly in the Latin West, can be seen as a response of the very devout to a particular crisis in the Church of their day.

=== Eremitic life ===
:::''See also main article [[Hermit]]''
[[File:Hermit's Cell - geograph.org.uk - 83433.jpg|thumb| Hermit's cell near [[Moville]] high cross, Republic of Ireland]]
When [[Constantine the Great]] was legalizing Christianity in the Roman Empire in the early [[4th century]], and the Christian faith became the favoured religion, it lost the self-sacrificing character that had profoundly marked it in the age of Roman persecution. In response to the loss of martyrdom for the sake of the Kingdom of God, some of the very devout men and women left the cities for the testings of the life in the desert that was meant to lead the individual back into a more intimate relationship with God, just like the wandering of the Israelites in the [[Wilderness of Sin]]. The Greek word for desert, ''eremos'', gave this form of religious living the name ''eremitic (or eremitical) life'', and the person leading it the name [[hermit]]. [[Anthony the Great]] and other early leaders provided guidance to less experienced hermits, and there were soon a large number of Christian hermits, particularly in the desert of Egypt and in parts of Syria.

Though the eremitic life would eventually be overshadowed by the far more numerous vocations to the cenobitic life, it did survive. The Middle Ages saw the emergence of a variant of the hermit, the [[anchorite]]; and life in [[Carthusian]] and [[Camaldolese]] monasteries has an eremitic emphasis. The Greek Orthodox and the Russian Orthodox Churches have their own eremitic traditions, of which [[Mount Athos]] is perhaps the most widely heard of today.

In modern times, in the Roman Catholic Church the Code of Canon Law 1983 recognises hermits who - without being members of a religious institute - publicly profess the three [[evangelical counsels]], confirmed by [[religious vows|vow]] or other sacred bond in the hands of their respective diocesan bishop, as Christian faithful that live the consecrated life (cf. canon 603, see also below).

=== Monastic institutes ===
{{Main|Catholic religious order}}
[[Image:Fra Angelico 031.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Benedict of Nursia]] (c. 480-543), who wrote the leading religious rule for monastic living, "evokes the Christian roots of Europe", said [[Pope Benedict XVI]].]]
The [[Hermit|eremitic]] life was apparently healthy for some, but led to imbalance in others. [[Pachomius the Great]], a near-contemporary of [[Anthony the Great]], recognized that some monks needed the guidance and rhythm of a community (''cenobium''). He is generally credited with founding, in Egypt, the first community of monks, thus launching [[Cenobitic monasticism]].

[[Basil of Caesarea]] in the East in the [[4th century]], and [[Benedict of Nursia]] in the West in the [[6th century]], authored the most influential "rules" for religious living in their areas of the Christian world ("rule" in this sense refers to a collection of precepts, compiled as guidelines for how to follow the spiritual life). They organized a common life with a daily schedule of prayer, work, spiritual reading and rest.

Almost all monasteries in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] today follow the [[Basilian monks#Rule of St. Basil|Rule of St Basil]]. The Rule of St Benedict is followed by a variety of [[Consecrated life#Institutes of consecrated life|orders of monastics]] in the West, including the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], [[Cistercians]], [[Trappists]], and [[Camaldolese]], and is an important influence in [[Carthusians|Carthusian]] life.

=== Canons regular ===
[[Canons regular]] are members of certain bodies of priests living in community under the [[Augustinian Rule]] (''regula'' in Latin), and sharing their property in common. Distinct from monks, who live a cloistered, contemplative life and sometimes engage in ministry to those from outside the monastery, [[canon (priest)|canons]] devote themselves to public ministry of [[liturgy]] and [[sacrament (Catholic Church)|sacraments]] for those who visit their churches.

Historically, monastic life was by its nature [[laity|lay]], but canonical life was essentially [[clergy|clerical]].

=== Mendicant institutes ===

Around the 13th century during the rise of the medieval towns and cities the [[mendicant orders]] developed. While the monastic foundations were rural institutions marked by a retreat from secular society, the mendicants were urban foundations organized to engage secular city life and to meet some of its needs such as education and service to the poor. The five primary mendicant religious Order of the 13th century are the [[Dominican Order|Order of Friars Preachers]] (the Dominicans), [[Franciscan|Order of Friars Minor]] (the Franciscans), Order of the Servants of Mary ([[Servite Order]]), Order of St. Augustine or the ([[Augustinians]]) and the [[Carmelites|Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] (the Carmelites). Unlike the monks and nuns of the earlier orders, the members of the latter orders called their houses convents, rather than monasteries (in English, Dominican convents for men may also be called priories, and Fransciscan and Carmelite convents friaries).

=== Apostolic institutes ===

Until the 16th century recognition was granted only to institutes with solemn vows. Institutes with simple vows arose in the 16th century and increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life Arthur Vermeersch, "Religious Life" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1911] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115054809/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life |date=2012-01-15 }}. Accessed 18 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They provided specific services or ministries for the Church and society, building schools, hospitals and new missionary enterprises around the world. The period of their greatest growth was in the wake of the French Revolution in early 19th century France and Belgium. Only in 1900 did they obtain full recognition as religious.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution "Conditae a Christo" of 8 December 1900, cited in [http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf Mary Nona McGreal, ''Dominicans at Home in a New Nation'', chapter 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150743/http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Society of Jesus]] is an example of an institute that obtained recognition as an "order" with solemn vows, although the members were divided into the professed with solemn vows (a minority) and the "coadjutors" with simple vows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC&amp;pg=PA1421&amp;dq=jesuits+%22solemn+vows%22+%22simple+vows%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dVclTo2RDNGwhAeI-43lCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=jesuits%20%22solemn%20vows%22%20%22simple%20vows%22&amp;f=false Karl Rahner, ''Sacramentum Mundi'', article "Religious Orders"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]], introducing several innovations designed to meet the demands of the 16th century crisis. Its members were freed from the commitments of common life, especially the common prayer, which allowed them to minister individually in distant places. Their unusually long formation, typically thirteen years, prepared them to represent the intellectual tradition of the Church even in isolation.

=== Congregations ===
{{Main|Congregation (Catholic)}} 
By the constitution ''Inter cetera'' of 20 January 1521, [[Pope Leo X]] appointed a rule for [[third order|tertiaries]] with simple vows. Under this rule, [[enclosed religious orders|enclosure]] was optional, enabling non-enclosed followers of the rule to engage in various works of charity not allowed to enclosed religious.&lt;ref name=Vermeersch&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life Arthur Vermeersch, "Religious Life" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1911), vol. 12.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115054809/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life |date=2012-01-15 }} Accessed 18 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1566 and 1568, [[Pope Pius V]] rejected this class of institute, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval,&lt;ref name=Vermeersch/&gt; finally gaining on 8 December 1900 recognition as [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]]. Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to [[social service]] and to [[evangelization]], both in [[Europe]] and in mission areas. The number of these "[[congregation (Catholic)#Congregations as a historical category of religious institutes|congregations]]" (not "[[Catholic religious order|orders]]") increased further in the upheavals brought by the [[French Revolution]] and subsequent [[Napoleonic]] invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of monks and nuns of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living their religious life

=== Secular institutes ===

Secular institutes have their modern beginnings in 18th century France.  During the French Revolution, the government attempted to [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|dechristianise France]]. The French government had required all priests and bishops to swear an oath of fidelity to the new order or face dismissal from the Church, and had forbidden any form of religious life. Fr [[Pierre-Joseph de Clorivière|Pierre-Joseph Picot de Clorivière]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], founded a new society of diocesan priests, the Institute of the Heart of Jesus.  He also founded the Daughters of the Heart of Mary ({{Lang-fr|Société des Filles du Coeur de Marie}}). While living a life of perfection, they did not take vows, remaining a secular institute to avoid being considered a religious society by the government. They would eventually receive [[pontifical institute]] status in 1952. The Daughters of the Heart of Mary, though resembling a secular institute in some ways, were recognized as an institute of religious life.  On 2 February 1947 [[Pope Pius XII]] issued the apostolic constitution ''Provida Mater Ecclesia'' recognizing secular institutes as "a new category of the state of perfection" {{Lang-la|nova categoria status perfectionis}}.&lt;ref&gt;Castano, Jose F. ''Gli Istituti di Vita Consacrata; cann. 573 730''. Romae:  Millennium, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 Code of Canon Law recognizes secular institutes as a form of consecrated life.&lt;ref&gt;Canons 710&amp;ndash;730&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from religious institutes in that their members live their lives in the ordinary conditions of the world, either alone, in their families or in fraternal groups. They include, among others, Caritas Christi, The Grail, and the [[Servite]] Secular Institute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3422">'''Edward Lennox Sloan''' (1830–1874) was a [[Latter-day Saint]] editor and publisher.  He also was the arranger of the text of the [[hymn]] "For the Strength of the Hills" into the version currently contained in the [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|hymnal]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

Sloan was born in [[Bangor, Ireland]] and was trained as a weaver.  At some point in his teens, he joined the LDS Church. He was ordained an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] in the church at age 18 and then served as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] in [[Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[England]] and [[Scotland]].  At this time he published a volume of poetry he had written entitled ''The Bard's Offering''.

In 1851, Sloan married Mary Wallace, who was also a native of Ireland.

After having served as editor of the ''[[Millennial Star]]'', Sloan immigrated to [[Utah Territory]] in 1863.  He crossed the ocean on the ''Amazon'' on which he served as the first counselor in the presidency over the Latter-day Saints on board.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Jensen and Gordon Irving, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/03/the-voyage-of-the-amazon-a-close-view-of-one-immigrant-company "The Voyage of the Amazon: A Close View of One Immigrant Company"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', March 1980, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Utah, Sloan was the founder of the ''[[Salt Lake Daily Herald]]'' in 1870, which he ran with [[W. C. Dunbar]].  When his efforts to get a column on women's issues included in the ''Herald'' were defeated by Dunbar, Sloan went ahead and organized the ''[[Women's Exponent]]'' with [[Lula Greene]] as editor.  Sloan also published the first [[city directory]] of [[Salt Lake City]].

Sloan also served as secretary of the [[Deseret Sunday School Union]] at the time of its organization in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church News]]'', November 22, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the founding of the ''Herald'', Sloan had assisted [[George Q. Cannon]] in editing the ''[[Deseret News]]''.  He was also the recorder of many of the discourses included in the ''[[Journal of Discourses]]''.

Sloan practiced [[plural marriage]] and had three wives and 15 children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20092">'''Freedomites''', also called ''Svobodniki'' (Russian: "free people"), later called the '''Sons of Freedom''', first appeared in 1902 in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], and later in the [[Kootenays|Kootenay]] and [[Boundary Country|Boundary]] Districts of [[British Columbia]] (BC), as zealots who separated from [[Doukhobors]]. Of about 20,000 active Doukhobors in Canada today, ancestors of about 2,500 were Freedomites,&lt;ref name="Mealing"&gt;F.M. Mealing (1976), [http://cjtm.icaap.org/content/4/v4art4.html Sons-Of-Freedom Songs in English] Canadian Journal for Traditional Music.&lt;/ref&gt; of which very few today identify with or practice zealous protesting, and many joined Community Doukhobors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website|url=http://www.usccdoukhobors.org/|website=USCC Doukhobors.|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion that Freedomites were Doukhobors arose because all moved to Canada together to escape [[religious persecution]] in [[Russia]], and seek land and freedom. A few, unsatisfied with broken promises by the Canadian government, attempted to trek back to Russia, and called followers of their break away movement ''Svobodniki'' (translated as Freedomite in the press). Journalists rushed to the story when some protested nude, but mistakenly mixed the terms Freedomites with the law abiding Doukhobors, falsely implying that different groups were one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tarasoff|first1=Koozma J.|title=News War|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h6LcIZ88N5RtigF0Qb2CAQm3g-bghxlphcPoYtW-7Uw/edit#slide=id.g295415f1c_0275|website=Evolution of the Doukhobor Movement|accessdate=November 18, 2016|page=42|format=slides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doctrine ==
Freedomite meetings were similar to other [[spiritual Christian]] folk-[[Protestants]] from Russia. They met in simple buildings, sat on benches, prayed in Russian, sang religious hymns and songs in Russian, and spoke about matters of religious and community interest mostly in Russian. The ideals of the Freedomites emphasized basic traditional Russian communal living and action—growing food, building homes, living a peaceful rural life, [[religious ecstasy| ecstatic religious]] doctrine when agitated for protest, and [[anarchic]] attitudes towards external regulation.&lt;ref name="Mealing" /&gt;

== Public protest ==
Although Canada at first provided a more tolerant religious environment than the [[Russian Empire]], conflict soon developed, most importantly over the schooling of children and land registration. These ''Svobodniki'' (Russian: free people) generally refused to send their children to government-run schools. The governments of Saskatchewan and later British Columbia did not heed reports by sociologists to appease the concerns of parents, and chose to legally charge many of the parents for not sending the children to school.&lt;ref name="Mealing" /&gt;
[[File:Doukhobors-Langham Saskatchewan-1903.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Nude protest, 1900s photograph, 20+ years before naming their group "Sons of Freedom"]]

The ''Svobodniki'' became famous for various public protests—sometimes publicly burning their own money and possessions and parading nude in public. There was a doctrinal justification for nudity: that human skin, as God's creation, was more perfect than clothes, the imperfect work of human hands. The public nudity has generally been interpreted as a form of protest against the materialist tendencies of society.&lt;ref name="Mealing" /&gt;

A small minority of the Freedomites were noted for their arson campaigns, as a protest against materialistic life. They targeted belongings and other material possessions. The attacks occurred throughout the 20th century, but the periods of greatest activity were during the 1920s and 1960s. Both arson and bombing were used. The first use of explosives occurred in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawthorn, ed.|first1=Harry B.|title=The Doukhobors of British Columbia|date=1955|publisher=University of British Columbia and J. M. Dent and Sons Ltd.|place=Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two were killed by their own bombs in 1958 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Judy|title=Public Violence in Canada, 1867-1982|date=May 1, 1988|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN7gVxtefFAC&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q=sons%20freedom&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets included their own property and unfortunate Doukhobor neighbors to further exhibit their loathing of materialism, attacks on schools to resist government pressure to school ''Svobodnik'' children, and attacks on transportation and communications. One such incident was the bombing of a railway bridge in [[Nelson, British Columbia]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="spokesman1961"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bomb Blasts Rail Bridge in Kootenay|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p1spAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_ecDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5368,3816839|accessdate=4 October 2010|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=11 December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these acts were committed in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mealing" /&gt;

Among the reactions of the British Columbia and Canadian government was taking away Freedomite children and placing them in an internment center in [[New Denver, British Columbia|New Denver]].&lt;ref name="miami21Jan1958"&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia Handed Propaganda Gift By Persecuted Sect In Canada|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=47wyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JewFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2314,2561471|accessdate=19 November 2010|newspaper=[[Miami News]]|date=21 January 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse of these children was later alleged, and a formal apology demanded. The BC government made an official ''Statement of Regret'' that satisfied some, but not others. The Government of Canada has not apologized for its role in the removal, saying that it is not responsible for actions taken by the government in place 50 years ago.&lt;ref name="Mealing" /&gt;

== Operation Snatch: timeline of actions taken ==
Between 1953 and 1959, roughly 200 Doukhobor children, aged 7–15, were seized by the BC government, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP), and the federal government in "Operation Snatch". These children were confined in New Denver, BC in a prison-like setting. The Sons of Freedom children lost their human rights throughout their imprisonment by the BC government.&lt;ref name="Stolen Children of the Doukhobors" /&gt;

The following is a timeline of the actions that were taken leading up to, during, and after the confinement of the children.

== Operation Snatch: additional information ==
When the government made a decision to seize the [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]] children, it was in an attempt to respond to the widespread civil disorder happening in the [[Kootenays]]. The [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Federal Department of Justice]] faced two problems with the apprehension and conviction of the Doukhobors: where should the adult convicts be confined and what should be done with their children?&lt;ref name="The National Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Makortoff|first=Kalyeena|title=B.C. Doukhobors forced into residential schools want apology akin to natives’|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/21/b-c-doukhobors-forced-into-residential-schools-want-apology-akin-to-natives/|publisher=The National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years leading up to the creation of the residential school's, the Sons of Freedom had become a concern for the province of British Columbia as a whole; they seemed to have a problem with any sort of government, in addition to the laws and policies that were being enforced. Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.&lt;ref name="The National Post"/&gt;

"It was between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and Elsie Ericson's mother had just begun lighting the stove when four RCMP officers barged into their tiny wooden home in the village of Krestova, B.C. The child jumped out of bed and hid under it, only to be dragged out by their feet. Elsie and her brother spent the next four years in what she said felt like a jail.  They were housed with nearly 200 other in a [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] in [[New Denver, British Columbia|New Denver, B.C.]]"&lt;ref name="The National Post"/&gt;

The '''Gaddi Nashin''' is the leader of the Ravidass Deras in the [[Ravidassia]] religion. The religion's founder Guru [[Ravidass]] is worshipped as Guru, and the Gaddi Nashin are considered a messenger of God following the Guru (Spiritual Leader). Only one Gaddi Nashin holds the position at a time, as the highest-ranking member of the religion. Below him are a large number of Ravidassia ''Sant Samaj'' who work under the leader, directing and giving instructions relating to affairs and matters of the religion. 

The current Gaddi Nashin is Sant [[Niranjan Dass]] who has been holding that position since 24 November 2007.

A trusty is a key person who held and leads the traditional Sufi rituals in Dargah's daily activities and particularly during Urs—(death anniversary).
There are many well known Gaddi Nasheens within the Sufiana Darbar's in Punjab.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="566">In [[Islamic]] context, '''Ghafara (غفر)''' (v. past tense) or '''maghfira''' (''forgiveness'') is one of three ways of [[forgiveness]], as written in the [[Qur'an]] and one of [[Allah]]'s characteristics. It is to forgive, to cover up ([[sins]]) and to [[remittance|remit]] ([[absolution]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9704">[[File:Henri Ghéon by Jean Veber.jpg|right|thumb|Henri Ghéon by Jean Veber]]'''Henri Ghéon''' (March 15, 1875 – June 13, 1944&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=5318492&amp;dopt=Abstract US National Centre for Biological Information]&lt;/ref&gt;), born '''Henri Vangeon''' in [[Bray-sur-Seine]], [[Seine-et-Marne]], was a French playwright, novelist, poet and critic.

== Biography ==
Brought up by a devout [[Roman Catholic]] mother, he lost his faith in his early teens, while still at the Lycée in [[Sens]]. Among the factors that brought this about, one stood out in his own mind: at school religion was taught without life or understanding. Ghéon did not miss it. As [[Frank Sheed|F. J. Sheed]] says, "His was a happy [[atheism]]."&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Sheed. ''Sidelights on the Catholic Revival'', New York: Sheed and Ward, 1940, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced Catholicism with a semi-pagan cult of beauty in all its forms — nature, literature, music, painting.

He moved to Paris in 1893 to study medicine. Around the same time, he started to write poetry, along with his colleagues [[Francis Jammes]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. He also published [[avant garde]] criticism. In 1887 he met [[André Gide]], who became his literary guide and friend for twenty years. Ghéon, writes Gide's biographer [[Alan Sheridan]], "was Gide's closest friend and companion on innumerable homosexual exploits."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan. ''André Gide: A Life in the Present'', Harvard University Press, 1999, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghėon actually drafted a militant text in favour of homosexuality, ''La Vie secrète de Guillaume Arnoult'', which was one of the inspirations for Gide's ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]''.&lt;ref name="Hadjadj"&gt;Fabrice Hadjadj. [http://www.lefigaro.fr/livres/2008/06/19/03005-20080619ARTFIG00010-henri-gheon-un-chretien-tourmente.php "Henri Ghéon, un chrétien tourmenté"], ''Le Figaro'', 18 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 they were founding members of the [[Nouvelle Revue Française]] (NRF). Ghéon also painted, studied music and travelled widely.

It was the sceptic Gide who occasioned the first cracks in Ghéon's paganism when he invited him to visit Florence with him in 1912. There Ghéon discovered the religious art of [[Giotto]] and [[Fra Angelico]] and was overwhelmed to the point of shedding tears. "At [[San Marco, Florence|St Mark's]]," he wrote, "with Christ dying on the cross and the Virgin waiting for the angel in a bare and silent corridor..., even our senses had a soul. Art had transported me before, but never so high."&lt;ref name="Abbey"&gt;Dom Antoine Marie osb. [http://www.clairval.com/lettres/en/2008/05/13/2140508.htm "Henri Ghéon"], ''Letter of Saint-Joseph Abbey'', May 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as an army doctor in the First World War. During this period he regained his Catholic faith, as described in his work ''L'homme né de la guerre'' (''The Man Born from the War''). His conversion was bound up with a devoutly Catholic naval officer, Pierre Dominique Dupouey, whom he met only three times in the space of a few weeks, but who impressed him greatly. It was again Gide who was the occasion for this fateful encounter: when Ghéon left for the Belgian front, Gide urged him to try to find Dupouey, who had once been his disciple and with whom he still corresponded. On [[Holy Saturday]], 1915, Dupouey was killed in action on the [[Yser]]. By Christmas, Ghéon had returned to the Catholic faith.

He founded the "Compagnons de Notre Dame" (Companions of Our Lady), a sort of amateur theatre confraternity of young people, for which he wrote over 60 plays, usually on episodes from the [[Gospel]] or the lives of the [[saints]]. Ghéon's plays had clear similarities with the medieval [[mystery play|mystery and miracle plays]]. The Companions of Our Lady performed with success in Paris and throughout France, as well as in Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, and Ghéon was awarded a prize for his work by the [[Académie française]].&lt;ref name="Abbey"/&gt; He also wrote poems, saints' biographies, and novels, among them a three-part work, ''Les Jeux de l'enfer et du ciel'' (''Games of Hell and Heaven''), centred on the [[Jean Vianney|Curè d'Ars]].

Ghéon died of cancer in a Paris clinic on June 13, 1944, a week after the [[Normandy landing|Allied landing in Normandy]] and six days after the opening of his most recent play, ''Saint Gilles''.

==Reputation==
In 2008 the writer and philosopher [[Fabrice Hadjadj]], reviewing Catherine Boschian-Campaner's biography of Ghéon&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Boschian-Campaner. ''Henri Ghéon, camarade de Gide: Biographie d'un homme de désirs'', Presses de la Renaissance, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', wrote, "Henri Ghėon is not a minor writer and his work speaks for itself. If his novels recall [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], his theatre loses nothing in comparison with [[Jean Anouilh|Anouilh]] and [[Jean Giraudoux|Giraudoux]]. It was he alone who, in the first half of the 20th century, revived the popular burlesque and verticality of the medieval mystery plays, thus anticipating [[Dario Fo]]."&lt;ref name="Hadjadj"/&gt;

His ''Miroir de Peine'' was set to music by [[Hendrik Andriessen]].

The '''history of the Jews in the Roman Empire''' traces the interaction of [[Jews]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] during the period of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC – AD 476). Their cultures began to overlap in the centuries just before the [[Christian Era]]. Jews, as part of the [[Jewish diaspora]], migrated to [[History of the Jews in Italy|Rome]] and Roman Europe from the [[Land of Israel]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Babylon]] and [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Alexandria]] in response to economic hardship and incessant warfare over the land of Israel between the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] empires. In Rome, Jewish communities enjoyed privileges and thrived economically, becoming a significant part of the Empire's population (perhaps as much as ten percent).&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=[[The Times Atlas of World History]] |title=Spectrum–Times Atlas van de Wereldgeschiedenis |editor-first=Geoffrey |editor-last=Barraclough |editor-link=Geoffrey Barraclough |year=1981 |orig-year=1978 |publisher=Het Spectrum |pages=102–103}} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman general [[Pompey#Pompey in the East|Pompey in his eastern campaign]] established the [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman province of Syria]] in 64 BC and [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|conquered Jerusalem]] in 63 BC. [[Julius Caesar]] conquered Alexandria {{circa}} 47 BC and [[Caesar's Civil War|defeated Pompey]] in 45 BC. Under Julius Caesar, [[Judaism]] was officially recognised as a legal religion, a policy followed by the first Roman emperor, [[Augustus]]. [[Herod the Great]] was designated ‘King of the Jews’ by the [[Roman Senate]] in {{circa|lk=no}} 40 BC, the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman province of Egypt]] was established in 30 BC, and [[Judea|Judea proper]], [[Samaria]] and Idumea (biblical [[Edom]]) were converted to the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Iudaea]] in 6 AD. [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire|Jewish-Roman tensions]] resulted in several [[Jewish–Roman wars]], 66-135 AD, which resulted in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple]] and institution of the [[Fiscus Judaicus|Jewish Tax]] in 70 and [[Hadrian]]'s attempt to create a new [[Roman colony]] named [[Aelia Capitolina]] {{circa|lk=no}} 130.

Around this time, [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christianity developed from Second Temple Judaism]]. In 313, Constantine and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] giving official recognition to Christianity as a legal religion. [[Constantine the Great]] moved the Roman capital from Rome to [[Constantinople]] (‘New Rome’) {{circa|lk=no}} 330, sometimes considered the start of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380, Christianity became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]]. The Christian emperors persecuted their Jewish subjects and restricted their rights.{{r|times}}

[[File:Siege and destruction of Jerusalem (f. 155v) Cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|Siege and destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. Painted c.1504]]
According to the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' article on Rome:&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=352&amp;letter=R&amp;search=rome#1005 Jewish Encyclopedia: Rome: Early Settlement in Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Jews have lived in Rome for over 2,000 years, longer than in any other European city. They originally went there from [[Alexandria]], drawn by the lively commercial intercourse between those two cities. They may even have established a community there as early as the second pre-Christian century, for in the year 139 B.C. the pretor [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Hispanus|Hispanus]] issued a decree expelling all [[Jews]] who were not Italian citizens.}}

The Jewish Encyclopedia connects the two civil wars raging during the last decades of the first century BC: [[Hasmonean Civil War|one in Judea]] between the two [[Hasmonean]] brothers [[Hyrcanus II]] and [[Aristobulus II]] and [[Caesar's Civil War| one in the Roman republic]] between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and describes the evolution of the Jewish population in Rome:

{{quote|... the Jewish community in Rome grew very rapidly. The Jews who were taken to Rome as prisoners were either ransomed by their coreligionists or set free by their Roman masters, who found their peculiar custom obnoxious. They settled as traders on the right bank of the [[Tiber]], and thus originated the [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish quarter in Rome]].}}

Even before Rome annexed Judea as a province, the Romans had interacted with Jews from their diasporas settled in Rome for a century and a half. Many cities of the Roman provinces in the eastern Mediterranean contained very large Jewish communities, dispersed from the time of the sixth century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Mary Smallwood|title=The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian : a Study in Political Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSYbpitEjggC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=0-391-04155-X|pages=120–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome's involvement in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] dated from 63 BC, following the end of the [[Third Mithridatic War]], when Rome made [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] a province. After the defeat of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], the [[proconsul]] Pompeius Magnus ([[Pompey the Great]]) remained to secure the area, including a visit to the [[Jerusalem temple|Jerusalem Temple]]. During the 1st century BC, the [[Herod the Great|Herodian Kingdom]] was established as a Roman [[Client state|client kingdom]] and in 6 AD parts became a [[province]] of the [[Roman Empire]], named [[Iudaea Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac ''The Near East under Roman Rule: Selected Papers'' (Leiden: Brill 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julius Caesar]] formulated a policy of allowing Jews to follow their traditional religious practices, a policy which was followed, and extended, by [[Augustus]], first emperor of Rome, reigned 27 BC - 14 AD. This gave Judaism the status of a ''[[religio licita]]'' (permitted religion) throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smallwood|first=E.Mary|title=The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian : A Study in Political Relations|year=2001|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-0-391-04155-4|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jews retained their traditions and customs, including kosher dietary customs. During the late Hellenistic and Roman era, pork, a meat by Jewish law, became a common and frequent cuisine for Romans. Since Jews had the status of a ''religio licita'', allowing them to continue their practices, they refused to eat pork. Jordan Rosenblum has argued that by refusing pork, Jews symbolically separated themselves from Romans and created a cultural identity for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblum|first=Jordan|date=2010|title=Why Do You Refuse to Eat Pork? Jews, Food, and Identity in Roman Palestine|url=|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=Vol. 100, No. 1|pages=95-110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Caligula#Financial crisis and famine|financial crisis under Caligula]] (37–41) has been proposed as the "first open break between Rome and the Jews", even though problems were already evident during the [[Census of Quirinius]] in 6 and under [[Sejanus]] (before 31).&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}, ''The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula'', pages 254-256: "The reign of Gaius Caligula (37-41) witnessed the first open break between the Jews and the [[Julio-Claudian]] empire. Until then &amp;mdash; if one accepts [[Sejanus]]' heyday and the trouble caused by the [[Census of Quirinius|census after Archelaus' banishment]] &amp;mdash; there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire ... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]]. ... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish–Roman wars==
{{Main|Jewish–Roman wars}}
[[File:Arch of Titus Menorah.png|thumb|[[Relief]] from the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome depicting a menorah and other objects looted from the Temple of Jerusalem carried in a [[Roman triumph]]]]

In 66 AD, the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] began. The revolt was put down by the future Roman emperors [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]]. In the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD]], the Romans destroyed much of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and, according to some accounts, plundered artifacts from the Temple, such as the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]. Jews continued to live in their land in significant numbers, the [[Kitos War]] of 115-117 nothwithstanding, until [[Sextus Julius Severus|Julius Severus]] ravaged Judea while putting down the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132–136. 985 villages were destroyed and most of the Jewish population of central Judaea was essentially wiped out – killed, sold into slavery, or forced to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=237&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Bar%20Kokba#762 Jewish Encyclopedia: BAR KOKBA AND BAR KOKBA WAR: Publius Marcellus]: "...and thus about fifty strongholds and 985 undefended towns and villages fell into their hands (Dio Cassius, lxix. 14)."&lt;/ref&gt; Banished from Jerusalem, which was renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]], the Jewish population now centered on [[Galilee]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=32&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Galilee Jewish Encyclopedia: Galilee]: "After the fall of the Jewish state a new period of prosperity set in for Galilee; and it gradually became the center of Jewish life in Palestine."&lt;/ref&gt; initially at [[Council of Jamnia|Yavneh]].

After the [[Jewish-Roman wars]] (66&amp;ndash;135), [[Hadrian#Hadrian in Judea|Hadrian]] changed the name of [[Iudaea province]] to ''[[Syria Palaestina]]'' and [[Jerusalem in Judaism|Jerusalem]] to ''[[Aelia Capitolina]]'' in an attempt to erase the [[Pre-Roman history of ancient Israel and Judah|historical ties of the Jewish people to the region]].&lt;ref name="H.H. Ben-Sasson, 1976, page 334"&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}, page 334: "In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria-Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, after 70, Jews and Jewish [[Proselytes]] were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus|Jewish tax]], and after 135 were barred from Jerusalem except for the day of [[Tisha B'Av]].

==The diaspora==
{{Main|Jewish diaspora}}
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects depicted in 2nd century [[gold glass]] from Rome]]
Many of the Judaean Jews were sold into [[slavery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/books/a-jewish-slave-in-rome/2017/07/24/&lt;/ref&gt; while others became citizens of other parts of the [[Roman Empire]]. The book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] in the [[New Testament]], as well as other [[Pauline epistles|Pauline texts]], make frequent reference to the large populations of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenised Jews]] in the cities of the Roman world.  These Hellenised Jews were only affected by the [[diaspora]] in its spiritual sense, absorbing the feeling of loss and homelessness which became a cornerstone of the Jewish faith, much supported by persecutions in various parts of the world.  The policy towards [[proselytization]] and conversion to Judaism, which spread the Jewish religion throughout [[Hellenistic civilization]], seems to have ended with the wars against the Romans and the following reconstruction of Jewish values for the post-Temple era.

Of critical importance to the reshaping of Jewish tradition from the Temple-based religion to the traditions of the Diaspora, was the development of the interpretations of the Torah found in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]].

==Late Roman period==
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Land of Israel}}
In spite of the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jews remained in the land of Israel in significant numbers. The Jews who remained there went through numerous experiences and armed conflicts against consecutive occupiers of the Land. Some of the most famous and important Jewish texts were composed in Israeli cities at this time. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]], the completion of the [[Mishnah]] and the system of [[niqqud]] are examples.

In this period the ''[[tannaim]]'' and ''[[amoraim]]'' were active [[rabbi]]s who organized and debated the Jewish [[oral law]]. A major catalyst in Palestinian Judaism is haNasi, who was a wealthy rabbi and one of the last tannaim, oral interpreters of the Law. He was in good standing with Roman authority figures, which aided in his ascent to being the Patriarch of the Jewish community in Palestine. The decisions of the ''tannaim'' are contained in the [[Mishnah]], [[Beraita]], [[Tosefta]], and various [[Midrash]] compilations. The [[Mishnah]] was completed shortly after 200 AD, probably by [[Judah haNasi]]. The commentaries of the ''amoraim'' upon the Mishnah are compiled in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], which was completed around 400 AD, probably in [[Tiberias]].

In 351, the Jewish population in [[Sepphoris]], under the leadership of Patricius, started a [[Jewish revolt against Gallus|revolt]] against the rule of [[Constantius Gallus]], brother-in-law of Emperor [[Constantius II]]. The revolt was eventually subdued by Gallus' general, [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]].

According to tradition, in 359 [[Hillel II]] created the [[Hebrew calendar]], which is a [[lunisolar]] calendar [[Metonic cycle|based on math]] rather than observation. Until then, the entire Jewish community outside the land of Israel depended on the observational calendar sanctioned by the [[Sanhedrin]]; this was necessary for the proper observance of the Jewish holy days. However, danger threatened the participants in that sanction and the messengers who communicated their decisions to distant communities. As the religious persecutions continued, Hillel determined to provide an authorized calendar for all time to come that was not dependent on observation at Jerusalem.

[[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], the only emperor to reject Christianity after the [[conversion of Constantine]], allowed the Jews to return to "holy Jerusalem which you have for many years longed to see rebuilt" and to rebuild the Temple. However Julian was [[Julian the Apostate#Death|killed in battle]] on 26 June 363 in his failed campaign against the [[Sassanid Empire]], and the [[Third Temple]] was not rebuilt at that time.

During the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]] many Jews sided against the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]], which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria. In reaction to this further anti-Jewish measures were enacted throughout the Eastern Roman realm and as far away as [[Merovingian]] France.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamson et al. The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 compared with Islamic conquest of 638.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, 634, the [[Muslim conquests]] began, during which many Jews initially rose up again against their Eastern Roman rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwein, Barbara H. (2004). A Short History of the Middle Ages. Ontario. pp. 71–72. {{ISBN|1-55111-290-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispersion of the Jews in the Roman Empire==
[[File:Expulsion of the Jews in the Reign of the Emperor Hadrian AD 135 How Heraclius turned the Jews out of Jerusalem Fac simile of a Miniature in the Histoire des Empereurs Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century.png|right|thumb|Expulsion of the Jews in the Reign of the Emperor [[Hadrian]] (135 CE): ''How Heraclius turned the Jews out of Jerusalem.'' (Facsimile of a miniature in the ''Histoire des Empereurs'', 15th-century manuscript, in the [[Library of the Arsenal]], Paris.)]]
Following the 1st-century [[First Jewish–Roman War|Great Revolt]] and the 2nd-century [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], the destruction of [[Judea]] exerted a decisive influence upon the dispersion of the [[Jewish people]] throughout the world, as the center of worship shifted from the [[Temple]] to Rabbinic authority.

Some Jews were sold as slaves or transported as captives after the fall of Judea, others joined the existing diaspora, while still others remained in Judea and began work on the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. The Jews in the diaspora were generally accepted into the [[Roman Empire]], but with the [[State church of the Roman Empire|rise of Christianity]], restrictions grew. Forced expulsions and persecution resulted in substantial shifts in the international centers of Jewish life to which far-flung communities often looked, although not always unified, due to the Jewish people's dispersion itself. Jewish communities were thereby largely expelled from [[Judea]] and sent to various Roman provinces in the Middle East, Europe and North Africa. The Roman Jewry came to develop a character associated with the urban middle class in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. R.

The '''Jade Emperor''' ({{zh|c=玉皇|p=Yù Huáng}} or {{lang|zh|玉帝}}, ''{{transl|zh|Yù Dì}}'') in [[Chinese culture]], [[Chinese folk religion|traditional religions]] and [[Chinese mythology|myth]] is one of the representations of the [[Primordial Divinity (Tai Di)|first god]] ({{lang|zh|太帝}} ''{{transl|zh|tài dì}}''). In [[Taoism|Daoist theology]] he is the assistant of [[Yuanshi Tianzun]], who is one of the [[Three Pure Ones]], the three primordial emanations of the [[Tao]]. He is also the ''{{lang|vi|Cao Đài}}'' ("Highest Power") of [[Caodaism]] known as [[:vi:Ngọc Hoàng Thượng đế|Ngọc Hoàng Thượng đế]]. In [[Buddhist cosmology]] he is identified with [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GgpkAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Simple Approach To Taoism]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Korean mythology]] he is known as [[Hwanin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=awCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Annals of King T'aejo]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Jade Emperor is known by many names, including Heavenly Grandfather ({{lang|zh|天公}}, ''{{transl|zh|Tiān Gōng}}''), which originally meant "Heavenly Duke", which is used by commoners; the Jade Lord; the Highest Emperor; Great Emperor of Jade ({{lang|zh|玉皇上帝}}, ''{{transl|zh|Yu Huang [[Shangdi]]}}'' or {{lang|zh|玉皇大帝}}, ''{{transl|zh|Yu Huang Dadi}}'').

==Chinese mythology==
{{Taoism}}
There are many stories in [[Chinese mythology]] involving the Jade Emperor.

===Origin===
It was said that the Jade Emperor was originally the crown prince of the kingdom of Pure Felicity and Majestic Heavenly Lights and Ornaments.  At birth, he emitted a wondrous light that filled the entire kingdom.  When he was young, he was kind, intelligent and wise. He devoted his entire childhood to helping the needy (the poor and suffering, the deserted and single, the hungry and disabled).  Furthermore, he showed respect and benevolence to both men and creatures.
After his father died, he ascended the throne.  He made sure that everyone in his kingdom found peace and contentment.  After that, he told his ministers that he wished to cultivate [[Tao]] on the Bright and Fragrant Cliff.

After 1,750 eons, each eon lasting for 129,600 years (360&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; years), he attained Golden Immortality. After another one hundred million years of cultivation, he finally became the Jade Emperor (using the given figures, this period before his becoming the Jade Emperor lasted for a total of about 226,800,000 years.)

===Vanquishing evil===
One of the myths describes how the Jade Emperor became the monarch of all the deities in heaven. It is one of the few myths in which the Jade Emperor really shows his might.

In the beginning of time, the earth was a very difficult place to live, much harsher than it is now. People had to deal with a variety of monstrous beings, and they didn’t have many gods to protect them; in addition, many powerful demons were defying the immortals of heaven. The Jade Emperor was an ordinary immortal who roamed the earth helping as many people as he could. He was saddened because his powers could only ease the suffering of humans. He retreated to a mountain cave to cultivate his Tao. He passed 3,200 trials, each trial lasting about 3 million years.

On earth at this time, a powerful, evil entity had the ambition to conquer the immortals and gods in heaven and proclaim sovereignty over the entire universe. This evil entity also went into retreat and meditation to expand its power, though later than the Jade Emperor did. He passed through 3,000 trials, each trial lasting about 3 million years. After its final trial, it felt confident that no one could defeat it. It re-entered the world and recruited an army of demons with the purpose of attacking heaven.

The immortals, being aware of the threat, gathered themselves and prepared for war. The gods were unable to stop the powerful demon and it defeated them all.

The Jade Emperor finished his cultivation during this war. When he was changing the land to make it more liveable for men and repelling a variety of monsters, he saw an evil glow radiating from heaven and knew something was amiss. He ascended and saw that the evil entity was too powerful to be stopped by the gods. He challenged it, and they fought. Mountains shook and rivers and seas toppled. Due to his deeper and wiser cultivation, his benevolence instead of his might, the Jade Emperor won the battle. After the evil entity was defeated, its army was scattered by the gods and immortals.

Because of his noble and benevolent deeds, the gods, immortals and humans proclaimed the Jade Emperor the supreme sovereign of all.

===Creation===
The world started with ''[[wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]'' ({{lang|zh|無極}}, nothingness) according to the [[Chinese creation myth]]. The Jade Emperor was the head of the pantheon, but not responsible for creation.

In another [[creation myth]], the Jade Emperor fashioned the first humans from clay and left them to harden in the sun. Rain deformed some of the figures, which gave rise to human sickness and physical abnormalities. (The most common alternative Chinese creation myth states that human beings were once fleas on the body of [[Pangu]].)

In another myth, [[Nüwa]] fashions men out of the mud from the Yellow River by hand. Those she made became the richer people of the earth. After getting lazy, she dipped her scarf into the mud and swung it around. The drops that fell from the scarf became the poorer humans.

===In ''The Journey to the West''===
{{Main|Journey to the West}}

In the popular novel by [[Wu Cheng'en]], the Jade Emperor is featured many times.

===''The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl''===
{{Main|The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl}}
In another story{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, popular throughout Asia and with many differing versions, the Jade Emperor has a daughter named '''Zhinü''' ({{zh|s=织女|t=織女|p=zhī nǚ}} or Chih'nü, literally: weaver girl). She is most often represented as responsible for weaving colorful clouds in the heaven.  In some versions she is the Goddess Weaver, daughter of the Jade Emperor and the Celestial Queen Mother, who weaves the Silver River (known in the West as the [[Milky Way]]), which gives light to heaven and earth.  In other versions, she is a seamstress who works for the Jade Emperor.

Every day Zhinü descended to earth with the aid of a magical robe to bathe. One day, a lowly cowherd named '''Niu Lang''' ({{zh|c=牛郎|p=niú láng}}) spotted Zhinü as she bathed in a stream.  Niu Lang fell instantly in love with her and stole her magic robe which she had left on the bank of the stream, leaving her unable to escape back to Heaven. When Zhinü emerged from the water, Niu Lang grabbed her and carried her back to his home.

When the Jade Emperor heard of this matter, he was furious but unable to intercede, since in the meantime his daughter had fallen in love and married the cowherd. As time passed, Zhinü grew homesick and began to miss her father. One day, she came across a box containing her magic robe which her husband had hidden. She decided to visit her father back in Heaven, but once she returned, the Jade Emperor summoned a river to flow across the sky (the [[Milky Way]]), which Zhinü was unable to cross to return to her husband. The Emperor took pity on the young lovers, and so once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month of the [[lunar calendar]], he allows them to meet on a bridge over the river.

The story refers to [[constellation]]s in the night sky. Zhinü is the [[star]] [[Vega]] in the constellation of [[Lyra]] east of the Milky Way, and Niu Lang is the star [[Altair]] in the constellation of [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] west of the Milky Way. Under the first quarter moon (7th day) of the seventh lunar month (around August), the lighting condition in the sky causes the Milky Way to appear dimmer, hence the story that the two lovers are no longer separated on that one particular day each year.

The seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar is a holiday in China called [[Qixi Festival]], which is a day for young lovers much like [[Valentine's Day]] in the [[Western countries|West]].  In [[Japan]], it is called [[Tanabata]] (star day). In [[Korea]], it is called [[Chilseok]]. In [[Vietnam]], it is called Thất Tịch and if it rains on that day, it is said to be Zhinü crying tears of happiness for being reunited with her husband.

===The zodiac===
There are several stories as to how the twelve [[animal]]s of the [[Chinese zodiac]] were chosen. In one, the Jade Emperor, although having ruled Heaven and Earth justly and wisely for many years, had never had the time to actually visit the Earth personally. He grew curious as to what the creatures looked like. Thus, he asked all the animals to visit him in heaven. The cat, being the most handsome of all animals, asked his friend the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]] to wake him on the day they were to go to Heaven so he wouldn't oversleep. The [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], however, was worried that he would seem ugly compared to the cat, so he didn't wake the cat. Consequently, the cat missed the meeting with the Jade Emperor and was replaced by the [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]. The Jade Emperor was delighted with the animals and so decided to divide the years up amongst them. When the cat learned of what had happened, he was furious with the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]] and that, according to the story, is why cats and [[Rat (zodiac)|Rats]] are enemies to this day.

The [[Cat (zodiac)|Cat]] however, ''does'' have a place in the [[Vietnamese zodiac]], replacing the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]].

===''The Four Dragons''===
The Jade Emperor ordered the four dragons, the Yellow Dragon (representation of the [[Yellow River]]), the Long Dragon (representation of the [[Yangtze River]]), the Black Dragon (representation of the [[Amur River]]) and the Pearl Dragon (representation of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]) by not making a rain since it was his own power to make rain for the crops to save. After 10 days, he did not make it rain because of his selfishness and he broke his own promise to the four dragons to make rain because people may die due to starvation. After the dragons let themselves to defy his orders to make rain without his permission, his men take these dragons to his kingdom and putting them each on a mountain until they die.

===His predecessor and successor===
The Jade Emperor was originally the assistant of the Divine Master of the Heavenly Origin, [[Yuanshi Tianzun]]. Yuanshi Tianzun is said to be the supreme beginning, the limitless and eternal creator of Heaven and Earth, who picked Yu-huang, or the Jade Emperor, as his personal successor.

The Jade Emperor will eventually be succeeded by the Heavenly Master of the Dawn of Jade of the Golden Door ({{lang|zh|金闕玉晨天尊}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookhome.net/zhexue/zongjiao/djds.html 道教的神] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519140532/http://www.bookhome.net/zhexue/zongjiao/djds.html |date=2010-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters for both are stamped on the front of the arms of his throne.

Yuk Wong Kung Tin ({{lang|zh|玉皇宮殿}}) also known as Yuk Wong Po Tin ({{lang|zh|玉皇寶殿}}) is a temple in [[A Kung Ngam]], [[Hong Kong]], dedicated to the Jade Emperor. In the mid 19th century, people from [[Huizhou]] and [[Chaozhou]] mined stones in the hill for the development of the central urban area. They set up a shrine to worship Yuk Wong. At the beginning of the 20th century, the shrine was developed into a small [[temple]] and was renovated many times. The latest renovation was in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chinese Temples Committee]]: [http://www.ctc.org.hk/en/directcontrol/temple2.asp Yuk Wong Kung Din, A Kung Ngam]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Fielding Smith''' (January 30, 1899 – August 29, 1964) was [[Presiding Patriarch]] and a [[general authority]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1942 until 1946.

Smith was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], the son of LDS Church [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Hyrum M. Smith]] and Ida Elizabeth Bowman. He went to school at the [[University of Utah]], where he majored in Theater. In 1929, he married Ruth Pingree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourfamilyhistories.org/familygroup.php?familyID=F77541&amp;tree=00 Family: Joseph Fielding Smith/Ruth Pingree]. OurFamilyHistories.org&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had seven children, Ruth, Ida, R.P. "Joe", Denis, Lynne, Hyrum, and Pauline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723135650/http://www.codyenterprise.com/articles/2007/05/10/obituaries/april_2004/obit959-1084.txt Lynne Esther Smith Partridge],{{Dead link|date=February 2011}} ''Cody Enterprise'' ([[Cody, Wyoming]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriarch to the Church==
At the time of his calling to the patriarchate, Smith was a member of the church's [[Young Men (organization)|Mutual Improvement Association]] General Board, head of the Speech Department at the University of Utah (though he did not hold a Ph.D.), and was also president of the National Speech Association.&lt;ref name="Bates Lost Legacy" /&gt; His calling as patriarch filled a vacancy that had lasted just over ten years, and his selection for the office has been seen by some as a departure from the expected line of patriarchal succession from father to his eldest son in good standing with the church.&lt;ref name="Bates Lost Legacy" /&gt; Some sources suggest this move came during a time when some members of the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] were attempting to move away from the rule of primogeniture in selecting the presiding patriarch, giving church leaders the ability to pass over unsuitable candidates who would otherwise inherit the office somewhat automatically.&lt;ref name="Bates Lost Legacy" /&gt; Smith's official title was "Patriarch to the Church," in place of the previous style of "Patriarch over the Church" or "Presiding Patriarch," a change which was also accompanied by a reduction in the scope of the duties of the office; Smith was not permitted to ordain or formally supervise local stake patriarchs.&lt;ref name="Bates Lost Legacy" /&gt;

==Homosexual affairs==

At the age of 43, Smith was ordained a [[High priest (Mormonism)|high priest]] and Patriarch to the Church on October 8, 1942, by [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Heber J. Grant]]. He served only four years before it was reported by the church that he had requested to be released from his position. His request was granted by church president [[George Albert Smith]] on October 6, 1946, with the church announcing that Smith was released for reasons of "ill health."&lt;ref&gt;"Patriarch to the Church: Released from Duties", ''[[Improvement Era]]'' '''49''' (November 1946) pp. 685, 708.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 it had been discovered that the patriarch was involved in several [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] affairs, including two in the 1920s while employed at the [[University of Utah]] (with student Norval Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salinas|first1=Hugo|title=Queer Mormons of the 19th Century|url=http://affirmation.org/resources/books-films-plays-television/books-articles/queer-mormons-of-the-19th-century/|website=affirmation.org|publisher=Affirmation|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a drama department colleague named Wallace A.

Smith died and was buried in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Smith's grandson [[Jefferson Smith (politician)|Jefferson Smith]] served in the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] from 2008 to 2012.

Smith shares a name with his grandfather, [[Joseph F. Smith]], and his uncle, [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], both of whom served as [[Apostle (Mormonism)|apostles]] and later as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church presidents]].

'''Kepler College''' (formerly '''Kepler College of Astrological Arts and Sciences''') is an online certificate program for the pseudoscientific study of [[astrology]].&lt;ref name=Strauss&gt;{{citation|date=14 Jan 2011|title=The Astrology College Story|first=Valerie|last=Strauss|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/the-astrology-college-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeplerAbout&gt;{{cite web|title=Kepler College: About Us|url=http://www.kepler.edu/home/index.php/about|website=Kepler.edu|accessdate=26 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407002208/http://kepler.edu/home/index.php/about|archivedate=7 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based out of [[Seattle, Washington]], U.S., it is named after the mathematician and astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630).&lt;ref name=Strauss/&gt;

Kepler College was founded in 2000 as an [[Unaccredited institutions of higher learning|unaccredited institution of higher learning]]&lt;ref name=Kuzyk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curry&gt;{{citation|title=Falling Stars|last=Curry|first=Dan|year=2001|magazine=Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=47|issue=43|page=A8|issn=0009-5982}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was authorized to grant degrees from 2000 until 2010&lt;ref name=Strauss/&gt; by the Higher Education Coordinating Board of Washington State.&lt;ref name=Kuzyk&gt;{{citation|title=Astrology in Seattle: Kepler College Looks to the Stars, But It Is Not Accredited|last=Kuzyk|first=Mark G|year=2001|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=25|issue=6|pages=5–7|issn=0194-6730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Stars Above!|last=Derbyshire|first=John|year=2001|work=National Review|volume=53|issue=13|page=26|issn=0028-0038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its programs were based in the liberal arts and it offered degrees in astrological studies with a focus on the history of astrology. Since 2010, students have been awarded certificates of completion of a course of study instead of degrees.&lt;ref name=Strauss/&gt;&lt;ref name=KeplerAbout/&gt;

==History==
In March 2000, Kepler College received provisional authorization from Washington State's Higher Education Coordinating (HEC) Board to grant degrees while the school pursued [[higher education accreditation|regional or national accreditation]], a requirement for maintaining degree-granting status.&lt;ref name=Strauss/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuzyk/&gt;

The HEC Board's decision was criticized by many academics due to Kepler's focus on the pseudoscience of astrology.&lt;ref name=seattlepi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{citation|title=Pathway to the Stars|last=Bird|first=Maryann|year=2001|work=Time Europe|volume=157|issue=24|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuzyk/&gt; An administrator at the University of Washington called the HEC Board's approval "ludicrous" and compared the study of astrology to "quack medicine".&lt;ref name=seattlepi/&gt; [[John Silber]], chancellor of [[Boston University]], wrote in a ''Boston Herald'' editorial that the school's promoters "honored Kepler not for his strength but for his weakness, as if a society advocating drunkenness named a school for [[Ernest Hemingway]]".&lt;ref name=seattlepi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/32348_astrology23.shtml|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|first1=Robert|last1=McClure|title=Astrology school sets off controversy|date=22 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Silber/&gt; Silber also said, "The fact is that astrology, whether judged by its theory or its practice, is bunkum. In a free society there is no reason to prevent those who wish to learn nonsense from finding teachers who want to make money peddling nonsense. But it is inexcusable for the government to certify teachers of nonsense as competent or to authorize—that is, endorse—the granting of degrees in nonsense."&lt;ref name=Silber&gt;{{cite news|last=Silber|first=John|title=Silliness under Seattle Stars|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/73063951.html?dids=73063951:73063951&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+16%2C+2001&amp;author=John+Silber&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=OP-ED%3B+Silliness+under+Seattle+stars&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=16 May 2001|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kepler College promoted itself as the only institution in the [[Western Hemisphere]] to offer bachelor's and master's degrees in astrological studies and 31 students enrolled for the first term in July 2000.&lt;ref name=Kuzyk/&gt; The majority of coursework was offered online, allowing students from across the U.S. to enroll with the requirement that they were present in-person for one week of the 11-week term.&lt;ref name=Silber/&gt;

Kepler College did not obtain the required accreditation status by 2010 and as a result, the HEC Board revoked Kepler's right to grant degrees. After losing this authority, Kepler became an online certificate program.&lt;ref name=Strauss/&gt;

The '''Kong Family Mansion''' ({{zh|c=孔府|p=Kǒng fǔ}}) was the historical residence of the [[Duke Yansheng|direct descendants of Confucius]] in the City of [[Qufu]], the hometown of [[Confucius]] in Shandong Province, China.&lt;ref name=whatlas2005&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tFRgajxu3wIC&amp;pg=PT86 Atlas of World Heritage: China, Long River Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The extant structures mainly date from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. From the mansion, the family tended to the Confucian sites in Qufu and also governed the largest private rural estate in China. The Kong family was in charge of conducting elaborate religious ceremonies on occasions such as plantings, harvests, honoring the dead, and birthdays. Today, the mansion is a museum and part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] "Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu".

==Layout==
The mansion is located immediately to the east of the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|Temple of Confucius]]&lt;ref name=whatlas2005/&gt; to which it had been formerly connected. The layout of the mansion is traditionally Chinese and separates official spaces in the style of a [[Yamen]]&lt;ref name=fu2002&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2T1mScdj8CYC Xinian Fu, Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt: Chinese Architecture, Yale University Press, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; in the front of the complex from the residential quarters in the rear. Besides the yamen and the inner quarters, the complex also contains an eastern and a western study as well as a back garden.&lt;ref name=fu2002/&gt; Within this overall arrangement, the spatial 
distribution of the buildings according to the seniority, gender, and status of their inhabitants reflects the Confucian principle of order and hierarchy: The most senior descendant of Confucius took up residence in the central of the three main buildings; his younger brother occupied the Yi Gun hall to the east. The eastern study was used by the Duke of Yansheng to meet official guests and worship his  ancestors.&lt;ref name=fu2002/&gt; The western study was used by the family for study, meals, and entertaining friends.&lt;ref name=fu2002/&gt; In its 
present layout, the mansion comprises 152 buildings with 480 rooms, which cover an area of {{convert|12470|m2|sigfig=4}}. Its tallest structure is the 4-story refuge tower ({{zh|c={{linktext|避|难|楼}}|p={{linktext|Bì|nán| Lóu}}}}) that was designed as a shelter during an attack but was never used. The mansion houses an archive with about 60,000 documents related to the life in the mansion  over a period of 400 years during the Ming and Qing dynasties.&lt;ref name=whatlas2005/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kong mansion watchtower 2005 04 21.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Refuge tower of the mansion.]] 
The first mansion for the Kong family of the [[Duke Yansheng]] was built in 1038 during the [[Song Dynasty]].  In 1377, the mansion was relocated and rebuilt under orders of the [[Hongwu Emperor|first emperor of the Ming Dynasty]]. In 1503, during the reign of the [[Hongzhi Emperor]], the  complex was expanded into three rows of buildings with 560 rooms and - like the neighboring Confucius Temple - nine courtyards. During the Qing Dynasty, the mansion underwent a complete renovation in 1838 only to be damaged in a fire 48 years later that destroyed the women's quarters in 1886.&lt;ref name=fu2002/&gt; Even during the fire, men did not dare to enter the women's part of the mansion to fight the fire, leading to greater damage to this portion of the mansion complex.&lt;ref name=fu2002/&gt; The damaged portions of the mansion were rebuilt two years later; the cost of both these 19th-century renovations was covered by the emperor. Despite these later renovations, the Kong Family Mansion remains the best preserved Ming-era residential complex of its size.&lt;ref name=fu2002/&gt; The last head of the Kong family to live in the mansion was [[Kung Te-cheng|Kong Decheng]], the 77th generation descendant of Confucius. Kong Decheng fled to [[Chongqing]] because of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. He did not return to Qufu but moved on to [[Taiwan]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=orientalarchitecture&gt;[http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/china/qufu/kongmansion.php Kong Mansion, Qufu, China. Asian Historical Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another Kong Family Mansion in [[Quzhou]] built by the southern branch of Confucius descendants.

==Structures==
The major structures along the central axis of the mansion (from south to north) are:

===Administrative portion===

====Main Gate====
The main entrance gate to the complex ({{zh|c={{linktext|孔|府|大|门}}|p={{linktext|Kǒng|fǔ |Dà|mén}}}}) is marked by a tablet that reads "Holy Mansion" 
({{zh|c={{linktext|聖|府}}|p={{linktext|Shèng|fǔ}}}}).

====Central Courtyard====
The central courtyard is flanked to the east and west by former administrative office buildings. The administration of the Kong family's official functions and businesses was structured into departments similar to the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|six ministries of the imperial government]]: Department of Rites (ancestor worship), Department of Seals (jurisdiction and edicts), Music, Letters, and Archives, Rent Collection and Sacrificial Fields.&lt;ref name=leffman2003&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dA_QbQiZkB4C David Leffman, Simon Lewis, Jeremy Atiyah: China, Rough Guides, May 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gate of Double Glory====
[[File:Confucius mansion chongguang gate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gate of Double Glory]]
Located to the north of the Central Courtyard, the Gate of Double Glory ({{zh|c={{linktext|重|光|门}}|p={{linktext|Chóng|guāng |Mén}}}}) was erected in 1503 and opened only for ceremonial purposes, visits by the emperor, or the arrival of imperial edicts.&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=frommershortcuts&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yva-sYW8dcEC Eastern Central China, including Qingdao and Nanjing: Frommer's ShortCuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Apr 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is 6.24 meters wide, 2.03 meters deep, and 5.95 meters in height. It is also known as the "Yi Gate" ({{zh|c={{linktext|仪|门}}|p={{linktext|Yí |Mén}}}}) or "Sai Gate" ({{zh|c={{linktext|塞|门}}|p={{linktext|Sāi |Mén}}}}) .

====Great Hall====
The Great Hall ({{zh|c={{linktext|大|堂}}|p={{linktext|Dà |Táng}}}}) was the site of the duke's official business and the place for the proclamation of imperial edicts.&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt; When holding court, the duke was seated in the hall on a wooden chair that was covered by a tiger skin.&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt;

====Second Hall====
The Second Hall ({{zh|c={{linktext|二|堂}}|p={{linktext|èr |Táng}}}}) was used for receiving high-ranking officials as well as for examinations in music and rites by the duke. It contains seven tablets inscribed by emperors, including one with the character "shou" (longevity) written by the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].&lt;ref name=frommershortcuts/&gt;

====Third Hall====
The Third Hall ({{zh|c={{linktext|三|堂}}|p={{linktext|Sān|Táng}}}}), also known as the "Hall of Withdrawal", was used by the duke for drinking tea.&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt;

===Residential portion===

====Gate to the Inner Apartments====
[[File:Kong mansion water outlet 2005 04 21.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Drinking water outlet at the gate to the inner apartments]]
This gate ({{zh|c={{linktext|内|宅|门}}|p={{linktext|Nèi|zhái |Mén}}}}) dates to the Ming Dynasty. The gate building stands 11.8 meters wide, 6.1 meters deep, and 6.5 meters tall. During the residence of the Kong family, the gate was heavily guarded and restricted access to the residential portion of the mansion accessible only to the family and a small number of mostly female servants. Trespassing into the inner compound was punishable by death. Drinking water had to be delivered through a trough in the wall.&lt;ref name=frommershortcuts/&gt; On the internal ghost wall behind this entrance is a painting of a "tan" (tān), a mythical animal representing greed.&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt; Although the tan already has the [[Eight Treasures]] (associated with the [[Eight Immortals]], it is still attempting to swallow the sun. The painting was placed at the exit from the inner apartments to the administrative portion to warn the members of the Kong family against greed in their business dealings outside.

====Front Reception Hall====
The Front Reception Hall ({{zh|c={{linktext|前|上|房}}|p={{linktext|Qián|shàng |Fáng}}}}) is a structure with seven bays that was used for receiving relatives, banquets, marriage and funeral ceremonies.&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt;

====Front Main Building====
Built during the Qing era reconstruction after the fire of 1886, the Front Main Building ({{zh|c={{linktext|前|堂|楼}}|p={{linktext|Qián|táng |Lóu}}}}) has two storeys and contained the private rooms of the wife and the concubines of the duke&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt;

====Rear Building====
The rear building ({{zh|c={{linktext|后|堂|楼}}|p={{linktext|Hòu|táng |Lóu}}}}) was erected during the reign of the Qing dynasty's [[Jiaqing Emperor]]. It has a floor space of 3900 square meters and contained the private rooms of the duke.&lt;ref name=leffman2003/&gt; The last duke to inhabit the Rear Building was [[Kung Te-cheng|Kong Decheng]].

====Rear Five Rooms====
Originally a study for the duke, the rear five rooms ({{zh|c={{linktext|后|五|间}}|p={{linktext|Hòu|Wǔ| Jiān}}}}) become a quarter for the maids of the residence during the late Qing dynasty.

====Garden====
The Back Garden ({{zh|c={{linktext|后|花|园}}|p={{linktext|Hòu |Huā|yuán}}}}) also known as the 
Tieshan Garden ({{zh|c={{linktext|铁|山|园}}|p={{linktext|Tiě|shān| Yuán}}}}) was added during the Ming-era expansion of the mansion in 1503. The major building at the northern end of the garden is the Flower Hall ({{zh|c={{linktext|花|厅}}|p={{linktext|Huā |Tīng}}}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the lesser East African Indian Ocean states (not Madagascar) is composed of only a Latin hierarchy, without a proper [[ecclesiastical province]] but joined in a single [[episcopal conference]], &lt;br&gt;comprising four exempt jurisdictions, i.e. directly dependent on the Holy See : 
* three exempt dioceses (on [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]] and the [[Seychelles]]) 
* two missionary pre-diocesan [[Apostolic vicariate]]s (entitled to [[titular bishop]]s) : one for the [[Comoros]] and [[Mayotte]]; the other in above Mauritius.

There are no titular sees.
 
All defunct jurisdictions have current successors.

There are also three papal diplomatic representations (in fact all vested in the [[apostolic nunciature]] (embassy) on Madagascar) : 
* an apostolic nunciature to Mauritius
* an apostolic nunciature to the Seychelles
* an [[apostolic delegation]] (papal legation) to the Comoros; &lt;br&gt;none to Mayotte or Reunion, as those depend on metropolitan [[France]] without full statehood.

== Current jurisdictions ==

=== Episcopal Conference of the Indian Ocean (minor African East Coast Island states) ===

:''all Immediately subject to the Holy See

* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Louis|Diocese of Port-Louis]] on [[Mauritius]] (also covers the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]])
** [[Apostolic Vicariate of Rodrigues]], covering part of Mauritius
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Denis-de-La Réunion|Diocese of Saint-Denis-de-La Réunion]] on and for [[La Réunion]]
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Port Victoria o Seychelles|Diocese of Port Victoria]] on and for the [[Seychelles]]
* [[Apostolic Vicariate of Archipel des Comores]], on the [[Comoros]], also for [[Mayotte]].

== Aalar ==
'''Aalar''', in the [[King James Version]], appears in 1 Esdras 5:36, as one of those who came up from "Thermeleth and Thelersas" who could not show their genealogical records. Instead of ''Aalar'', the NRSV reads '''Immer'''.

=== Abdeel ===
'''Abdeel''' ([[Obadiah|Ab'dē]] [[El (god)|el]]) (Hebrew עַבְדְּאֵל  "servant of God"; akin to Arabic عبد الله ''[[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]]''&lt;ref&gt;Strong's Hebrew and Greek Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;) is mentioned in {{bibleverse-lb|Jeremiah||36:26|HE}} as the father of [[Shelemiah]], one of three men that were commanded by King [[Jehoiakim]] to seize the prophet [[Jeremiah]] and his secretary [[Baruch ben Neriah|Baruch]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=194&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Abdeel |title=ABDEEL |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Septuagint]] omits the phrase "and Shelemiah son of Abdeel", probably a scribal error due to [[homoioteleuton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anchor Bible Dictionary|last=Fretz|first=Mark J.|publisher=Doubleday|year=1992|isbn=9780300140811|editor-last=Freedman|editor-first=David Noel|volume=1|location=New York|page=8|chapter=Abdeel (Person)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abdi===
The name '''Abdi''' (Hebrew עַבְדִּי) is probably an abbreviation of Obediah, meaning "servant of [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]", according to the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, "Abdi."&lt;/ref&gt; Easton's Bible Encyclopedia, on the other hand, holds that it means "my servant".  The name "Abdi" appears three times in forms of the Bible that are in use among Jews, Protestants, and Roman Catholics. There is also one additional appearance in 1 Esdras, considered canonical in Eastern Orthodox Churches.
# 1 Chronicles 6:29.&lt;ref&gt;This verse, in the King James Version and some other Bibles, is verse 44 of chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  "And on the left hand their brethren the sons of Merari: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewish Publication Society Bible of 1917&lt;/ref&gt;
# 2 Chronicles 29:12. "Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# Ezra 10:26. "And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# 1 Esdras 9:27, where the name appears in the Hellenized form ''Oabd[e]ios.''&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne and Black (1899), ''Encyclopaedia Biblica,'' entry for "Abdi."&lt;/ref&gt; "Of the sons of Elam: Matthanias and Zacharias and Iezrielos and Obadios and Ieremoth and Elias."&lt;ref&gt;''New English Translation of the Septuagint''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cheyne and Black (1899), the two mentions in the Books of Chronicles are of a single individual, and the mentions in Ezra and 1 Esdras are of a second individual.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne and Black (1899), ''Encyclopaedia Biblica,' entry for "Abdi."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abdon===
'''Abdon''' (Hebrew עַבְדּוֹן from עָבַד "to serve") is the name of four biblical individuals. It is a diminutive form of the name Ebed.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne and Black (1899), ''Encyclopaedia Biblica,'' second entry titled "Abdon."&lt;/ref&gt;
# An Abdon in the book of Judges:  see the article [[Abdon (Judges)]].
# The first-born of Gibeon of the tribe of Benjamin, mentioned only in passing in genealogies (1 Chronicles 8:30, 9:36).
# Abdon the son of Micah. Josiah sent him, among others, to the prophetess Huldah, in order to discern the meaning of the recently rediscovered book of the law (2 Chronicles 34:20).  He is referred to as Achbor in 2 Kings 22:12.
# Abdon son of Sashak.  He is only mentioned as a name in a genealogy (1 Chronicles 8:23).&lt;ref&gt;This section on Abdon incorporates information from the 1897 Easton's Bible Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its use as a personal name, the proper name "Abdon" is used for a Levitical city mentioned in Joshua 21:30 and 1 Chronicles 6:74 (6:59 in some versions).&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne and Black (1899), ''Encyclopaedia Biblica,'' first entry for "Abdon."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elnaam ===
'''Elnaam''', according to 1 Chronicles 11:46, was the father of Jeribai and Joshaviah, two of [[David's Mighty Warriors]].

===Elnathan===
'''Elnathan'''  (Hebrew אלנתן ''El-Natan'' "God gave") is a Hebrew name found in 2 Kings, Jeremiah and Ezra.

According to {{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:8|NKJV}}, Elnathan ben Achbor of Jerusalem was the father of [[Nehushta]]. Nehushta was the mother of [[Kings of Judah|king]] [[Jeconiah]], whose father was king [[Jehoiakim]]. Despite this close relationship to the king, Elnathan is one of those who, according to {{bibleverse-lb||Jeremiah|36:25|NIV}} opposes Jehoiakim when he cuts up and burns a scroll that had been brought to him, containing [[Jeremiah]]'s prophesies of the forthcoming destruction of Judah. Elnathan's father [[Achbor]] was a strong supporter of the earlier reforms of king [[Josiah]], which may have influenced Elnathan's behavior,&lt;ref&gt;See for example Magonet, Jonathan (1992) ''Bible Lives'' (London, SCM), 107&lt;/ref&gt; although according to {{bibleverse-lb||Jeremiah|26:20–23|NIV}} he had earlier been closely involved in the persecution of the prophet [[Uriah ben Shemaiah]].

In {{bibleverse||Ezra|8:16|NKJV}}, the name Elnathan occurs three times:
:''Then sent I for [[#Eliezer|Eliezer]], for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, which were teachers.'' (Revised Version)
According to Donna Laird, the repetition of Elnathan, and the similarity between the names Jarib and Joiarib, may indicate a copyist's accidental repetition.&lt;ref name="Laird2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donna Laird|title=Negotiating Power in Ezra–Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCYiDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295|date=3 October 2016|publisher=SBL Press|isbn=978-0-88414-163-1|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matrilineality in Judaism''' or '''matrilineal descent in Judaism''' is the tracing of [[Judaism|Jewish]] descent through the maternal line. Virtually all Jewish communities have followed matrilineal descent from at least early [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] (c. 10-70 CE) times to Modern times.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;Reviewed by [[Louis Jacobs]], [https://louisjacobs.org/articles/there-is-no-problem-of-descent/] Originally published in Judaism 34.1 (Winter 1985), 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins and date-of-origin of matrilineal descent in Judaism are uncertain. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], who believe that [[matrilineality]] and matriarchy within Judaism are related to the metaphysical concept of the Jewish soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaapkens|first1=Natan|title=Inside Orthodox Judaism: A Critical Perspective On Its Theology|isbn=978-1-365-39059-3}}  Also, from the perspective of classical Jewish belief, the primary identity of ''all'' people follows the mother. Genesis 20:12, Rashi.&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that matrilineal descent is an Oral Law from at least the time of the Receiving of the Torah on [[Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]] (c. 1310 BCE).&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;Midrash Rabbah, Numbers, 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] Theologian Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]] suggests that the marriage practices of the Jewish community were re-stated as a law of matrilineal descent in the early Tannaitic Period (c. 10-70 CE).&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt; 

== Contemporary practice of Jews ==
In practice, Jewish denominations define "[[Who is a Jew?]]" via descent in different ways. All denominations of Judaism have protocols for [[Conversion to Judaism|conversion]] for those who are not Jewish by descent.

Orthodox Judaism practices matrilineal descent and considers it axiomatic.&lt;ref&gt;see Rabbi Moses Feinstein’s re-affirmation of matrilineal descent,  Elberg, Rabbi S., September, 1984, HaPardes Rabbinical Journal, Hebrew, vol.59, Is.1, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Jewish Movement also practices matrilineal descent as virtually all Jewish communities have for at least two thousand years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt; In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative Movement to the practice of matrilineal descent.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/assets/public/halakhah/teshuvot/20012004/31.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] of [[Reform Judaism]] passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent, provided that either (a) one is raised as a Jew, by Reform standards, or (b) one engages in an appropriate act of public identification, formalizing a practice that had been common in Reform synagogues for at least a generation. This 1983 resolution departed from the Reform Movement's previous position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the closely associated  [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism]] has rejected this resolution and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515 Reform Judaism in Israel: Progress and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karaite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. In 1968, the [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement became the first American Jewish movement to pass a resolution recognizing Jews of patrilineal descent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== The Importance of the Matriarchal lines in the traditions of the Torah ==
=== The Matriarchs of Israel ===
According to the Jewish tradition, the maternal lines of the three founding families of Israel were essential for the foundation of the Nation of Israel. The patriarchs and matriarchs of Israel established the foundation for Israel in three families over three generations. The Torah specifically emphasizes the importance of the bloodlines of the four matriarchs of Israel: Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.

Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah were all family of Abraham. In the Jewish Tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah were as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. Rabbati, Vayeze, p. 119; Yalkut Shimoni, Vayetze- Remez 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah lists the son-after-son descendants from Shem, son of Noah, to Terah, the father of Abraham: Arpachshad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Re'u, Serug, Nahor, Terah.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11:10-26&lt;/ref&gt; Terach, was the father of Abraham, Nahor and Haran.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11:27. The Talmud, Sanhedrin 69B, suggests the possibility that the Torah may be establishing an order of wisdom rather than birth.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Jewish Tradition, Sarah was the daughter of Haran&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;Genesis 11:29 see Rashi, Sanhedrin 69b&lt;/ref&gt; (the brother of Abraham) and the granddaughter of Terah. Rebekah, Rachel and Leah were each direct descendants (through Milcah, daughter of Haran) of both Haran and Nahor, the two brothers of Abraham. Rebekah was the great-granddaughter of Haran&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11:29 and Genesis 22:20-23&lt;/ref&gt; and also the granddaughter of Nahor.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 22:20-23&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel and Leah, nieces of Rebekah, also descend from both Haran and Nahor but one generation later than Rebekah.

Abraham and Sarah (who in the Jewish Tradition was greater than Abraham in prophecy)&lt;ref&gt;Rashi Genesis 21:12&lt;/ref&gt; migrated as a married couple out of Ur Kasdim (in Mesopotamia) to Haran (in Mesopotamia) and eventually to the land of Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11:31&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah came from the same family as Abraham. In the Torah, Abraham refers to Sarah as his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 20:2. Interestingly science currently believes that mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA), a human genome that is exceptionally both circular and distinct from Nuclear DNA, is unique in that it is transmitted exclusively by a mother to both her daughters and sons. (Nuclear DNA in a human consists of 22 pairs of autosomes and two sex chromosomes. The 22 pairs of autosomes are derived half from each parent. The two sex chromosomes, XX in females XY in males, are also derived half from each parent. A female inherits one X from her father and one from her mother. Y-DNA, inherited exclusively by a male from his father, contains fewer genes than an X chromosome because it is shorter and is one of his two sex chromosomes, the other being the X that he inherits from his mother.) The Torah may similarly be suggesting that a brother and sister from the same mother are closer than a brother and a sister from just the same father (Genesis 20:12).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jewish Tradition, Sarah was Abraham's niece, Iscah (Jessica).&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; (Haran, brother of Abraham, was the father of both Milcah and Iscah.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11:29&lt;/ref&gt; There is a Jewish oral tradition that Milcah is the ancestor of all prophets of non-Jewish nations.&lt;ref&gt;see Yalkut Shimoni, Parshat Balak, 23&lt;/ref&gt;)

Before fathering Isaac, Abraham had a son, Ishmael, with Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 16:3,15&lt;/ref&gt; After Sarah died, Abraham also had six other children with a woman named Keturah.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 25:1,2&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac alone came from the maternal line of Sarah. The Torah's story line continues with the life of Isaac. ''The Nation of Israel descends directly from Isaac, child of Sarah'', and not directly from Abraham's first born, Ishmael, nor from any of Abraham's six other sons.&lt;ref&gt; Genesis 25:6. And God said, "[no] for Sarah your wife will give birth to a son for you, and you shall name him Isaac, and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his seed after him…”(Genesis 17:19)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;And God said to Abraham, "Be not displeased concerning the lad and concerning your handmaid; all that Sarah tells you, hearken to her voice, for through Isaac will your seed be called….”(Genesis: 21:12) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;	
 
Isaac married Rebekah, who came from the City of Nahor in Aram-Naharaim &lt;ref&gt;Genesis 24:10&lt;/ref&gt; (in Mesopotamia). They had Jacob and Esau. Rebekah came from the same family as Abraham. Under duress, Isaac refers to Rebekah as his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 26:7&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah makes it clear that Rebekah was Abraham's great niece through one of his brothers and his great-great niece through his second brother.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11:29 and Genesis 22:20-23. Also Genesis 22:23 Rashi that this whole genealogy was written just for Rebekah.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jewish Tradition, Rebekah was also separately the great-niece of Sarah.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt;

Esau, Jacob's fraternal twin married two Hittite women.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 26: 34,35&lt;/ref&gt; Neither were from the family of Abraham. Esau's third wife was from the family of Ishmael.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 28: 9&lt;/ref&gt; Ishmael's mother was Hagar. None of Esau's children are the focus of the story line of the Torah. (Esau was the progenitor of Edom.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 36: 1, 8, 9, 19, 43&lt;/ref&gt; One of the sons of the sons of Esau, son of Isaac, was the chieftain of Amalek.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 36: 16. The mother of Amalek was Timna, concubine of Eliphaz. Genesis 36: 12. The Horites lived in the land of Seir before Edom migrated there. Genesis 36: 8, 20, 22, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In the account of the Torah, Isaac instructed Jacob, who was to father the twelve tribes, specifically to marry a niece of Rebekah.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 28:2&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob was married to Leah,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 29:22-26&lt;/ref&gt; and then married Rachel.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 29:28,29&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel and Leah lived in Padan-Aram (in Mesopotamia).&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 28:2, Genesis 28:18-30&lt;/ref&gt; They were Jacob's first cousins. They came from the same family as Rebekah. Rachel and Leah were also both Abraham's great-great nieces and his great-great-great nieces. In addition, according to the Jewish Tradition,&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; Rachel and Leah were separately also Sarah's great-great nieces. In the Jewish tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah, handmaidens of Rachel and Leah and the birth-mothers of four of the tribes, were Rachel and Leah's half-sisters.

According to the Jewish Tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah had the same father as Rachel and Leah, ''but not the same mother.''&lt;ref&gt;Gen. Rabbati, Vayeze, p. 119; Yalkut Shimoni Vayetze- remez 125; Targum Yonasan Gen. 29:24; Targum Yonasan Gen. 29:29; Pirkei D'Rabi Eliezer chapt. 36&lt;/ref&gt; ''It was Rachel &lt;ref&gt;see Genesis 31:4, Tanchuma Buber.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leah who bore the lines of the kingship, the priesthood and the right to the double portion of the first born in Israel.''

The Jewish People see themselves as descending from the three founding families of Israel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;Based on Jewish scripture and oral tradition.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to those who adhere to Jewish Law, Israelite Nationhood or belonging to the Jewish People via descent exclusively follows the mother's line.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/601092/jewish/Why-is-Jewishness-matrilineal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Matriarchs of Israel are ''the mothers of'' the Tribes of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;The Torah (Genesis 3:20) uses the term "mother of" regarding Eve: "and the man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all life."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tamar and Judah===
Following the Torah, Prophets and Writings, kingship in Israel descends directly from Peretz, the firstborn son that Tamar had with Judah and not from Judah's older son, Shelah. 

Judah's first wife was the daughter of a Canaani man named Shua, with whom he had three sons.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 38:2-5&lt;/ref&gt; The first two were considered evil and killed by God.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 38:6-11&lt;/ref&gt; The third son was Shelah.

After “Shua's daughter, Judah's wife, died;” and after “Judah was consoled,”&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 38:12&lt;/ref&gt; Judah had an encounter with Tamar that produced twin sons.&lt;blockquote&gt;And it was at the time that she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb.&lt;ref&gt; Genesis 38:27&lt;/ref&gt;
And it was when she gave birth, that he [the infant] stretched out his hand. And the midwife took and bound a crimson thread on his hand, saying, "This one came out first."&lt;ref&gt; Genesis 38:28&lt;/ref&gt;
And it was, as he was drawing back his hand, and behold, his brother emerged, and she [the midwife] said, "With what strength you have burst forth!" And he [Judah] named him Peretz (burst forth).&lt;ref&gt; Genesis 38:29&lt;/ref&gt;
And afterwards, his brother emerged, the one on whose hand was the [shining] crimson thread, and he [Judah] named him Zerah (shine). &lt;ref&gt;Genesis 38: 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Jewish Tradition, in addition to Leah, Matriarch of Israel, Tamar is also considered to be the mother of the line of kingship in Israel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt; Judah's son, Shelah, born from the daughter of Shua, was older, but Shelah did not receive the line of kingship. Instead, it went through Peretz, Judah's first born from Tamar.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 38:29-30 and Ruth 4:18-22&lt;/ref&gt; Judah alone could not establish the line of kingship, only through Tamar could the line of kingship be established in Israel. Following the Torah, Prophets and Writings, ''kingship in Israel descends directly from the firstborn child of Tamar, and not from Judah's older son, Shelah.''&lt;ref&gt;i.e. see Ruth 4:12: "And may your house be like the house of Peretz, whom Tamar bore to Judah..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yocheved and Miriam===
Another example in the Torah of the importance of the matrilineal line is the mentioning of the maternal line of [[Yocheved]], the mother of Moses. Even though tribal affiliation traditionally passes through the father, the greatest leader of Israel, Moses, is listed as descending from the House of Levi not only through his father [[Amram]] but specifically through his mother Yocheved as well.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 2:1 and see Numbers 26:59&lt;/ref&gt; Yocheved was the daughter of Levi.&lt;ref name="Numbers 26:59"&gt;Numbers 26:59&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, Moses's sister [[Miriam]] was both the granddaughter of Levi and the great-granddaughter of Levi.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 26:59 and Exodus 6:16-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses married [[Zipporah]], daughter of Jethro, Priest of Midian. They had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 18:3-4&lt;/ref&gt; both born before the Exodus.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 18:1-10&lt;/ref&gt; The sons of Moses are not explicitly referenced anywhere in Jewish Tradition as being Israelite. The sons of Moses are absent from the genealogy of Levi in Exodus.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 6:16-27 also see Numbers 3:1-4, Numbers 26:58-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses married a Cushite woman&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 12:1&lt;/ref&gt; (who, according to classical interpretations, may or may not refer to Zipporah).&lt;ref&gt;See Rashi on Numbers 12:1 also see Ibn Ezra there&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah makes no mention of any offspring from this union.

Aaron married a woman from the Tribe of Judah. Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel, married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab (descendant of Tamar) and sister of Nahshon,&lt;ref name="Exodus 6:23"&gt;Exodus 6:23&lt;/ref&gt; Prince of the Tribe of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 1:7,16&lt;/ref&gt; They had Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.&lt;ref name="Exodus 6:23"/&gt; Aaron and Elisheba's four children were given the priesthood in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 28:1 and see Ramban there&lt;/ref&gt;

Miriam married a man from the Tribe of Judah. Miriam, Prophetess in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 15:20&lt;/ref&gt; married Caleb ben Yephunneh&lt;ref&gt; Sotah 11b, Rashi on Exodus 17:10, Targum Yosef on Chronicles I, 2:18,19 and Ex. Raba 1:17&lt;/ref&gt; (descendant of Tamar),&lt;ref&gt;Sotah 11b-12a and Chronicles I, 2:18,19&lt;/ref&gt; a leader in the Tribe of Judah.&lt;ref&gt; Numbers 13: 2-6,30 and Numbers 14: 6-10, Numbers 26:65&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Jewish Tradition, Miriam and Caleb were the parents of Hur,&lt;ref&gt; Sotah 11b and Sanhedrin 69b also see Rashi on Exodus 17:10 and Rashi on Exodus 24:14; Pirkei D'Rabi Eliezer chapt 45; Midrash Tanchuma Ki Tisa- section 13: "Bezalel ben Uri ben Hur".&lt;/ref&gt; leader in Israel&lt;ref&gt; Exodus 17:10 and Exodus 24:14 &lt;/ref&gt; and grandfather of Bezalel (chief artisan for the Tabernacle).&lt;ref&gt; Chronicles I, 2:19, 20 and Exodus 38:22 and Exodus 31:1-5&lt;/ref&gt;   

Moses, Aaron and Miriam were the leaders of Israel during the time periods of the Exodus from Egypt and the Revelation at Mt. Sinai.

In the Jewish Tradition, the Houses in Israel of the Priesthood and the Levites descend from Yocheved, and the House of Kingship in Israel descends from Miriam.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 1:21, Rashi&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional references from Prophets and Writings ==
=== Ruth the Moabitess and Naamah the Ammonitess ===
In the accounts of the Prophets and Writings (which covers a time period of nearly a millennium) there are two cases of non-Israelite women who voluntarily (not resulting from conflict) married Israelites where their children were considered Israelite. According to the Talmud, both of these women, Ruth and Naamah, formally converted.&lt;ref&gt;Yevamoth 77a, 47b&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruth,&lt;ref&gt;see Ruth 3:10 where Boaz of Judah blessed Ruth for her extraordinary kindness both to Naomi of Judah and to the Judean People. (Ruth is seen in the Jewish Tradition as in contradistinction to the peoples of Moab and Amon in general who are noted in Deuteronomy 23:5 for their lack of kindness. see Rashi Deut. 23:5.) Also, see Ruth Rabbah 2:9 that Ruth was the daughter of Eglon, the king of Moab.&lt;/ref&gt; ''who lived centuries after Abraham,&lt;ref&gt;see Midrash Rabbah, Genesis 41:5&lt;/ref&gt; came from the people of Moab who descend from the older daughter of Lot''.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 19:37&lt;/ref&gt; (Lot was the son of Haran and the nephew of Abraham).&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11: 27, 31; Genesis 14: 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruth the Moabitess became the great-grandparent of King David.

In the account of the Book of Ruth (which is part of Writings but is set in the time period of the Judges), Naomi was the wife of Elimelech of Bethlehem, Judah. Due to famine in the land, Elimelech went with his family to live in the fields of Moab and then died. &lt;ref&gt; Ruth 1: 3&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi’s two sons married Moabite women. Mahlon (Sickness) married Ruth, and Chilion (Obliteration), Orpah.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth 4:10&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi’s two sons then died.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth 1: 1-5. Naomi’s husband predeceased their two sons.&lt;/ref&gt; In a state of poverty and accompanied by her former daughter-in-law, Ruth the Moabitess,&lt;ref&gt; Ruth 1: 22&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi journeyed back to Bethlehem, Judah. &lt;ref&gt; Ruth 1: 19&lt;/ref&gt; Then in selling her late husband’s land in Judah and the estates of her sons, Naomi set up the stipulation that her financial redeemer also marry her former daughter-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth 3:1-5, 4:3,9&lt;/ref&gt; The first potential redeemer declined, lest this [marriage] ruin his inheritance. &lt;ref&gt; Ruth 4:6&lt;/ref&gt; Boaz, the next of kin and descendant of Tamar, became Naomi’s redeemer, married Ruth and became the father of Obed. &lt;ref&gt; Ruth 4: 13, 18-22 &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And Naomi took the child and placed him in her bosom, and she became his nurse. &lt;ref&gt; Ruth 4:16&lt;/ref&gt;
And the women neighbors gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi," and they called his name Obed- he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. &lt;ref&gt; Ruth 4:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Naamah,&lt;ref&gt;Naamah is noted favorably by the Talmud, Bava Kama 38b. See http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11254-naamah that Naamah was the granddaughter of Nahash, a king of Amon.&lt;/ref&gt; ''who lived centuries after Abraham,&lt;ref&gt;see Midrash Rabbah, Genesis 41:5&lt;/ref&gt; came from the people of Ammon who descend from the younger daughter of Lot''.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 19:38&lt;/ref&gt; Naamah the Ammonitess, was the mother of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon and a Judean king of the Davidic Line.&lt;ref&gt;Kings I, 14:21, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Naamah is the only presumed wife of Solomon&lt;ref&gt;The Prophets describe how Solomon's foreign wives not only did not follow the Israelite beliefs of their husband, King Solomon, (I Kings 11:8) but instead they drew King Solomon away from a whole hearted belief in the God of Israel (I Kings 11:3-4):
&lt;blockquote&gt;King Solomon loved many foreign women and the daughter of Pharaoh; Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites. (I Kings 11:1)
Of the nations about which the Lord had said to the Children of Israel, "You shall not go (mingle) among them and they shall not come among you, for certainly they will sway your heart after their deities." To these did Solomon cleave to love [them]... (I Kings 11:2)
...And it was at the time of Solomon's old age, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not whole with the Lord, His God, like the heart of David his father... (I Kings 11:4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
As a result of King Solomon's behavior, according to the accounts of the Prophets and Writings, the Kingdom of Israel was dissolved (I Kings 11:11-13) and the ten northern tribes revolted against the House of David until today (I Kings 11:16-21, II Chronicles 10:16-19, II Chronicles 11:1-23):
&lt;blockquote&gt;And the Lord said to Solomon, "For as this has been with you, and you have not observed My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and I shall give it to your servant. (I Kings 11:11)
...And all of Israel saw that the king [Rehoboam] did not listen to them, and they replied to the king saying: "What share do we have in David? And no heritage in Jesse's son. To your homes, O Israel! ...(I Kings 11:16)

...So Israel revolted against the House of David until this day. (I Kings 11:19, also see II Chronicles 10:19)

...there was none that followed the House of David except the tribe of Judah alone. (I Kings 11:20)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned by name in Jewish scripture.&lt;ref&gt;see I Kings Chapter 11, I Kings 14:21, 14:31; II Chronicles 12:13&lt;/ref&gt; Rehoboam is the only child of Solomon mentioned ''at all'' in Jewish scripture.&lt;ref&gt;see I Kings 11:43, 14:21-31; II Chronicles 9:31-12:16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ezra ===
The Jewish Oral Tradition cites the Book of Ezra, Chapters 9, 10, regarding the law of matrilineal descent in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabbah, Numbers, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book of [[Ezra]], Ezra the Scribe, (c. 400 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5968-ezra-book-of&lt;/ref&gt; returned to Judea from the Babylonian Exile with more than forty thousand Israelites in order to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;Ezra 2:64 and Nehemiah 7:66&lt;/ref&gt; They re-committed to observing the Torah, including separating from their non-Israelite wives (their marriages to Israelites notwithstanding) and the children they had with them (and irrespective of whether or not they had children with them).&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 10:3, Ezra 9:2-10:44&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And when these were completed, the chiefs approached me, saying "The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites were not separated from the peoples of the lands, like the abominations of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 9:2&lt;/ref&gt;
…And when I heard [of] this matter, I rent my garment and my robe, and I tore the hair of my head and my beard, and I sat bewildered.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 9:4&lt;/ref&gt;
…And now, let us make a covenant with our God to cast out all the wives and those born to them, by the counsel of the Lord and those who hasten to [perform] the commandment of our God, and according to the Law it shall be done.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 10:3. Rashi in his commentary on "and according to the Law it shall be done" writes: he who performs this act, who will cast out his gentile wife and children &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
Ezra designated Elders in Israel who convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter (of Israelite men who needed to separate from their non-Israelite wives- a matter that could require a judicial determination unlike the status of the children that would simply result from this determination) until the first day of the first month when the task was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 10:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the account of Ezra in the Book of Ezra, one hundred and twelve Israelites&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 10:18-44&lt;/ref&gt; (out of a congregation of more than forty thousand Israelites)&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; were listed as having been found wanting in this matter "and some of them had wives by whom they had children."&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 10:44 and Rashi there: "They cast out all of them, both the wives and the children."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tamar, daughter of king David ===
The medieval French commentator, [[Rashi|Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki]] (1040-1105 CE) in his commentary on Prophets references the law of matrilineal descent regarding Tamar, daughter of King David.&lt;ref&gt;II Samuel 13:13, Rashi&lt;/ref&gt; In the account of the Prophets, in an attempt to stave off Amnon who was obsessed with a sickness over her, Tamar let him know that she was open to a legitimate marriage with him.&lt;ref&gt;II Samuel 13:13&lt;/ref&gt; Tamar and Amnon both had the same father, King David (c. 9th century BCE). Still, Tamar says that King David would permit them to marry legally: “for he will not withhold me from you.” Although they were half siblings biologically, by law they were not related. Tamar’s mother (at least at the time when she was conceived) was not Israelite, her mother was Maacah the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur.&lt;ref&gt;II Samuel 3:3, II Samuel 13:1&lt;/ref&gt; According to what Tamar claimed in the account of the Prophets, the law would disregard the biological fact that they shared a father. (In the Jewish Tradition, Amnon was mutilated by Tamar,&lt;ref&gt;II Samuel 13:15, Rashi&lt;/ref&gt; and in the account of the Prophets, he was killed by Tamar’s brother, Absalom, two years later.&lt;ref&gt;II Samuel 13:23-39&lt;/ref&gt;)

==References from Hellenistic histories==
The Hellenized Jewish philosopher, [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE) calls the child of a Jew and a non-Jew a ''nothos'' (bastard), regardless of whether the non-Jewish parent is the father or the mother.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Life of Moses'' 2.36.193, ''On the Virtues'' 40.224, ''On the Life of Moses'' 1.27.147&lt;/ref&gt;
While Flavius [[Josephus]] (c. 37-100 CE), the Romanized Jewish historian, writing about events that were alleged to have occurred a century prior, has [[Antigonus II Mattathias]] (c. 63-37 BCE), the last Hasmonean king of Judea, denigrating [[Herod the Great|Herod]] –whose father's family were Idumean Arabs forcibly converted to Judaism by [[John Hyrcanus]] (c. 134-104 BCE)&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Antiquities, 13.9.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose mother, according to Josephus, was either an Idumean Arab&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Antiquities, 14.7.3.&lt;/ref&gt; or Arabian (Nabatean-Arab)&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Wars, 1.8.9.&lt;/ref&gt;– by referring to him as "an Idumean i.e. a half-Jew" and as therefore unfit to be given governorship of Judea by the Romans:&lt;blockquote&gt;But Antigonus, by way of reply to what Herod had caused to be proclaimed, and this before the Romans…said that they [the Romans] would not do justly, if they gave the kingdom to Herod, who was no more than a private man, and an Idumean, i.e. a half Jew, whereas they ought to bestow it on one of the royal family, as their custom was; for that in case they at present bear an ill-will to him [to Antigonus], and had resolved to deprive him of the kingdom, as having received it from the Parthians, yet were there many others of his family [the Hasmoneans] that might by their law take it, and these such as had no way offended the Romans; and being of the sacerdotal family [the Hasmoneans], it would be an unworthy thing to put them by.&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Antiquities, 14.15.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
===Orthodox Jewish beliefs and practices===
Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Jewish Oral Law of matrilineality in Judaism dates at least to the time of the Receiving of the Torah at Mount Sinai (c. 1310 BCE).&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt; The law of matrilineal descent was first codified, as all Jewish Oral Law, in the Mishna (c. 2nd century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Kiddushin 3:12. see Rashi on Kiddushin 66b. In Judaism, tribal affiliation follows the father of a child but is only applicable if the marriage of the parents is viable according to Jewish law (where both parents are Jews). In a case where the mother of a child is not a Jew, the child is the same as the mother, "is like her" i.e. the investigation stops there.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Talmud&lt;ref&gt;see Kidushin 68b and Yevamot 23a&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 500 CE) adduces the law of matrilineal descent from the Torah: "you shall not intermarry with them: you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son. For he will turn away your son from following Me, and they will worship the gods of others…"&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 7:3-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud interprets "For he" as the non-Jewish father and the concern is that "he will turn away your son from following Me." The Talmud understands that the offspring of a non-Jewish father and a Jewish mother is "your son" as opposed to the second situation mentioned of a non-Jewish mother and a Jewish father where the Torah comments no further because the offspring, according to the Torah, is not Jewish and is not bound to keep the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Kiddushin 68b and see Pesikta Zuta and Rashi on Deuteronomy 7:4&lt;/ref&gt; 

This Jewish Law is codified in the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (1563 CE)&lt;ref&gt;Even HaEzer 8:5&lt;/ref&gt; without mention of any dissenting opinion. No source in any classical Halachic text raises any evidence of a differing ruling about this Jewish Law.

====Orthodox Jewish practices====
[[Orthodox Judaism]] follows matrilineal descent. Orthodox Judaism holds that anyone with a Jewish mother also has irrevocable Jewish status; that even were such a Jew to convert to another religion, that person would still be considered Jewish by Jewish Law.

===Conservative Jewish beliefs and practices===
Rabbi Louis Jacobs, who was the founder of the Masorti (Conservative) Jewish Movement in Britain and a well-known theologian writes regarding his review of an article by Professor Cohen on matrilineal descent in Judaism:&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been a development of the law in these instances from Biblical and pre-Rabbinic times. The attempt to find reasons for the change, however, has proved to be elusive and is quite unnecessary since it can be explained entirely economically by the logic of the law itself and is typical of Rabbinic thinking in general. But the development in the law had already taken place before the redaction of the Mishnah at the very latest. With the exception of the Rabbi in the Jerusalem Talmud (Qiddushin, 3:12) who permitted the child of a gentile mother and Jewish father to be circumcised on the Sabbath and whose opinion was vehemently rejected, the law is accepted unanimously in both Talmuds. It is recorded as the law in all the Codes without dissenting voice and has been the universal norm in all Jewish communities. For such a law to be changed, only the weightiest religious and ethical advantages will suffice and it is difficult indeed to discover any such in the change in this particular instance. To change this particular law would strike at the heart of the whole halakhic process and would involve a theological as well as an halakhic upheaval. And for what? The potential loss is great. The gains, if any, are few and the price is far too high.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Shaye J. D. Cohen]] of Harvard University and formerly a Dean at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, questions the date of origin of matrilineal descent:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The preexilic portions of the Hebrew Bible are not familiar with the matrilineal principle. Numerous Israelite heroes and kings married foreign women; for example, Judah married a Canaanite, Joseph an Egyptian, Moses a Midianite and an Ethiopian, David a Philistine, and Solomon women of every description. Although Exod. 34:16 and Deut. 7:1-3 prohibit intermarriage only with the Canaanites, a prohibition that was supposed to have originated with the patriarchs Abraham (Gen. 24:3) and Isaac (Gen. 27:46-28:1), some Israelites extended the prohibition to include all foreigners (Judg. 14:3). But it never occurred to anyone in preexilic times to argue that such marriages were null and void. Marriage was the non- sacramental, private acquisition of a woman by a man, and the state had little or no legal standing in the matter. The foreign woman who married an Israelite husband was supposed to leave her gods in her father's house, but even if she did not, it never occurred to anyone to argue that her children were not Israelites. Since the idea of conversion to Judaism did not yet exist, it never occurred to anyone to demand that the foreign woman undergo some ritual to indicate her acceptance of the religion of Israel. The woman was joined to the house of Israel by being joined to her Israelite husband; the act of marriage was functionally equivalent to the later idea of conversion. In some circumstances biblical law and society did pay attention to maternal identity-the children of concubines and female slaves some- times rank lower than the children of wives-but it never occurred to anyone to impose any legal or social disabilities on the children of foreign women.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Matrilineal Principle in Rabbinic Law'', Shaye J.D. Cohen, AJS Review, V. 10.1, 1985, 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his review of Cohen's article, Rabbi Jacobs accepts that the law may have changed in the early Tannaitic period (circa 10-70 CE): "From the historical evidence marshalled by Professor Cohen it would appear that the change from the patrilineal to the matrilineal principle for the offspring of mixed unions of Jew and gentile took place in the early Tannaitic period."&lt;ref name="autogenerated14" /&gt; 

But Jacobs dismisses Cohen's suggestion that "the Tannaim were influenced by the Roman&lt;ref&gt;In Roman law, without ''connubium'', the right to contract a legal marriage according to Roman Law (i.e. where both parties are Roman citizens and where both parties gave consent), the marriage was not a ''justum matrimonium'', a legal Roman marriage and the children from a such a union had no legal father and therefore followed the status (i.e. Roman citizenship status) of the mother.  Interestingly, “[t]hese restrictions as to marriage were not founded on any enactments; they were a part of that large mass of Roman law which belongs to ''Jus Moribus Constitutum'' [unwritten Roman law].” http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Matrimonium.html&lt;/ref&gt; legal system..."&lt;ref name="autogenerated14" /&gt; and contends that "even if the Rabbis were familiar with the Roman law, they might have reacted to it [instead] by preserving the patrilineal principle, holding fast to their own system."&lt;ref name="autogenerated14" /&gt;

Instead, Jacobs offers another explanation. Jacobs believes that an Israelite man who married a non-Israelite woman and had a child, that woman and child were considered not part of the "family clan" and therefore were not considered Israelite: "A child born of a Jewish father and a gentile mother cannot be given the status of the father since the patrilineal principle is stated only with regard to unions within the clan. How can the father who steps out of the clan bestow a clan status on the child whom he sires?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;

Therefore, Jacobs hypothesizes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The child of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not a gentile because of the application of any matrilineal principle...He is a child without Jewish parentage since the patrilineal principle cannot operate for a union carried out beyond the limits of the clan. The child is not a gentile because his mother is a gentile but because the only way a child can be born as a Jew is for him to have the Jewishness of his father transmitted to him and this cannot happen where the union is outside of the clan limits. Thus, for the Rabbis there is no switch here from a patrilineal to a matrilineal principle. The patrilineal principle still stands, only it cannot operate in this instance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism conducted a survey of 1,617 members of 27 Conservative congregations in the U.S. and Canada in 1995.&lt;ref&gt; Cohen, Steven M. “Chapter 1: Assessing the Vitality of Conservative Judaism in North America: Evidence from a Survey of Synagogue Members”. In Wertheimer, Jack (2000). Jews in the Center: Conservative Synagogues and Their Members. Rutgers University Press, p. 20.   Steven M. Cohen who co-conducted this survey (Wertheimer, 5) notes that the sample under represents congregants from certain major metropolitan areas (the New York region being represented by only one congregation and the Toronto and Montreal regions having no representation), over represents socially upscale congregants, and under represents congregants under the age of thirty-five. (Wertheimer, 20) &lt;/ref&gt; 69% of respondents to the Ratner Center survey agreed that they would regard personally as a Jew anyone who was raised Jewish—even if their mother was Gentile and their father was Jewish (Wertheimer, 59). In this same survey, 29% of respondents indicated that they attended Jewish religious services twice a month or more and 13% that they engage in the study of a Jewish text once a month or more (Wertheimer, 55-57).

====Conservative Jewish Practices====
The [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Movement]] practices matrilineal descent. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative movement to the law of matrilineal descent. Furthermore, the movement stated that any rabbi who accepts the principle of patrilineal descent will be subject to expulsion from the Rabbinical Assembly. Still, the Conservative Movement affirmed that "sincere Jews by choice" should be warmly welcomed into the community and that "sensitivity should be shown to Jews who have intermarried and their families." The Conservative movement actively reaches out to intermarried families by offering them opportunities for Jewish growth and enrichment.

===Reform Judaism beliefs and practices===
In 1983, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity.  This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism]] has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515 Reform Judaism in Israel: Progress and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515 |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din formed in Denver, Colorado to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism was dissolved in 1983, due to that Reform resolution.&lt;ref name="Wertheimer, A People Divided"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|title=A People Divided: Judaism in Contemporary America|publisher=University Press of New England|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing "that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process."&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Jerry |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/UK-Reform-rabbis-accept-patrilineal-descent-409298 |title=UK Reform rabbis accept patrilineal descent - Diaspora - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis "would be able to take local decisions – ratified by the [[Beit Din]] – confirming Jewish status."&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt;

Other movements within the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]] also adopted essentially the same position. These include: [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] in England; Progressive Judaism in Australia; one congregation in Austria; some congregations in Eastern Europe. Note that Reform Judaism in Canada and England adopts a different position, similar to that of Conservative Judaism (though there may be an accelerated conversion process for the children of Jewish fathers).

===Karaite Judaism belief and practices===
Karaite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. Karraite Judaism does not accept the authoritativeness of the Talmud or Jewish Oral Law.

====Karaite Judaism practices====
The majority view in [[Karaite Judaism]] is that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml Karaite FAQs]; [http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/current_articles/Giyyur_Conversion.shtml Congregation Or Saddiqim, Giyyur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.half-jewish.org/bibleintermarriage.html half-jewish.org/bibleintermarriage.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.half-jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.html half-jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Only someone who is patrilineally Jewish (someone whose father's father was Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the ''Mo'eṣet HaḤakhamim'', or the Karaite Council of Sages based in Israel.

===Reconstructionist Judaism belief and practices===
Reconstructionist Judaism, which values equity and inclusivity, was the first movement to adopt the idea of bilineal descent in 1968.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} According to Reconstructionist Judaism, children of one Jewish parent, of either gender, are considered Jewish if raised as Jews.

===Additional notes===
The State of Israel adheres to the Jewish law of matrilineal descent for matters which could affect Israeli family law.&lt;ref&gt;For the re-affirmation of matrilineal descent by the Chief Rabbinical Board of the State of Israel see Elberg, Rabbi S., September, 1984, HaPardes Rabbinical Journal, Hebrew, vol.59, Is.1, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven marriage contracts that took place before the 13th century between Karaite and Rabbinic individuals have so far been discovered in the [[Cairo Genizah]].&lt;ref&gt; See https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
PERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE 
In order to contract marriage, the parties must be "marriageable," that is: the partners must be Jewish, the woman must be unmarried, and the parties should not fall into any of the kinship categories prohibited by Karaite law. 
1. The parties' religious affiliation 
Marriages with non-Jewish partners are not acceptable for Karaites. Marriages with Rabbanite partners were perfectly legal and commonly practised before the thirteenth century. Medieval Karaism was and saw itself as an integral part of Judaism, and such marriages did not entail any form of "conversion" of any of the parties. Seven marriage contracts involving Karaite and Rabbanite individuals have so far been discovered in the Cairo Genizah. These marriage contracts stipulated the mutual tolerance of those practices in which the Karaites and the Rabbanites differed. These specific stipulations concerned differences in dietary law, such as the Rabbanite husband's promise not to bring to their house parts of animals authorized by the Rabbanites but forbidden by the Karaite halakhah (the fat tail, the kidneys, the lobe of the liver, the meat of a pregnant animal). Other stipulations concerned the Karaite restrictions on lighting the Sabbath candles and the promise of Rabbanite husbands not to make love to their Karaite wives during Sabbath and festivals—practices strictly forbidden by Karaite law. Due to the calendrical differences, Karaite and Rabbanite festivals did not coincide, and the marriage contracts always included a clause which guaranteed that both parties would be allowed to observe their festivals on their respective dates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, approximately 25,000 Jews lived in Egypt, mostly in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-cairo/  &lt;/ref&gt; A percentage of the Jewish community was [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]].&lt;ref&gt;It is not specifically known what percentage of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community was Karaite. As of 1906, it was estimated that there were approximately 12,000 Karaites worldwide with fewer than 2,000 estimated to possibly be in Egypt. See http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9211-karaites-and-karaism. Today, there are 11 Karaite synagogues in Israel. See https://www.jweekly.com/1999/12/10/israel-s-30-000-karaites-follow-bible-not-talmud/ &lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] became one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Egypt shortly after his arrival there in 1165 CE. Virtually all Jews in the world at this time including the Egyptian Jewish Community followed matrilineal descent. In fact, Maimonides (1138-1204 CE) himself re-codified the law of matrilineal descent in his compilation of Jewish Law:&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the general rule: The status of an offspring from a gentile man or from a gentile woman is the same as his mother's; we disregard the father.&lt;ref&gt; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (c. 1170-1180 CE), Laws of Forbidden Relationships, 15:4. see http://www.asktherabbi.org/DisplayQuestion.asp?ID=38736#.WkbfpdKou1s &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Egyptian Jewish Karaites, however, followed patrilineal descent.&lt;ref&gt;Yaron, Y., Joe Pessah, and Abraham Qanai. An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice, and Culture. N.p.: Qirqisani Center, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these same 12th century Egyptian Karaites forbade marriage with non-Jews&lt;ref&gt; https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women &lt;blockquote&gt; 
PERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE 
In order to contract marriage, the parties must be "marriageable," that is: the partners must be Jewish, the woman must be unmarried, and the parties should not fall into any of the kinship categories prohibited by Karaite law. 
1. The parties' religious affiliation 
Marriages with non-Jewish partners are not acceptable for Karaites...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and also did not allow converts into their community.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/601092/jewish/Why-is-Jewishness-matrilineal.htm But see Footnote 22 that today "This ban was recently lifted by the Karaite Council of Sages."&lt;/ref&gt; In effect then, 12th century Egyptian Karaites required that ''both'' parents be Jewish, but they referred to this requirement as patrilineal descent. Marriages between Karaites and the Rabbinic community came to a halt in the thirteenth century when Maimonides ruled for a specific serious reason that there was a problem with them.&lt;ref&gt;https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women. In the 13th century Maimonides ruled that they fell under the classification of ''mamzerut''.    
See https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Marriages between Karaite and Rabbanite partners came to a halt when Moses MAIMONIDES (Rambam, 1138–1204) argued that while the Karaite marriage itself was binding, their bill of divorce was invalid (probably because of its formulation in Hebrew). Since the children issued from the second union of a Karaite divorcée would be illegitimate (mamzerim), and since it was not always possible to ascertain that a divorce had not occured &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; in previous generations in a Karaite family, Maimonides decided to consider all Karaites as potential mamzerim, and therefore prohibited for marriage. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This specific ruling by Maimonides also means that Maimonides considered the Karaites of 800 yrs ago of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community to be Jewish on their mother's side as well.

==Additional reference from Jewish Scripture==
Samson, from the tribe of Dan served as Judge of Israel for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt; Judges 13:25, 15:20&lt;/ref&gt; According to current scholarship, the most recent likely date for the authorship of the Book of Judges is approximately 500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9051-judges-book-of : “Hence the compilation of the stories of the five Great Judges must be dated soon after the division of the kingdom. Single passages… may be much older. The editor who combined his own additions with the book containing the stories, producing thereby the earlier Book of Judges, probably wrote in the last decades of the kingdom of Israel. The Deuteronomistic edition was undertaken during the Exile at which time the other additions were probably also incorporated….”&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of Samson’s parents to his desired marriage to a Philistine woman may indicate the cultural expectations in Israel regarding marriage at this time:&lt;blockquote&gt; And his father and his mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your brothers and among all of my people that you should go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?”… &lt;ref&gt;Judges 14:3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the account of the Book of Judges, Samson married this woman and soon killed thirty Philistine men in Ashkelon.&lt;ref&gt; Judges 14&lt;/ref&gt; (Samson’s wife was then given to another man by her father who said that Samson utterly hated her. &lt;ref&gt; Judges 15: 2&lt;/ref&gt; Samson then set the fields of the Philistines on fire.&lt;ref&gt; Judges 15:3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  The Philistines then went and killed this woman and her father.&lt;ref&gt; Judges 15: 6&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Image:Longmen-binyang-middle-sakyamuni-upper.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The upper portion of the central Sakyamuni figure (May 2004)]]
'''Middle Binyang Cave''' ({{Zh|s=宾阳中洞|t=賓陽中洞|p=Bīnyáng Zhōng Dòng}}) is cave number 140 at the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]], [[China]].

==Dimensions==
12m long, 10.9m wide, 9.3m high.

==History==
Constructed by order of [[Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei China|Emperor Xuanwu]] of the [[Northern Wei]] in honour of his parents [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei China|Emperor Xiaowen]] and [[Empress Wenzhao of Northern Wei China|Empress Wenzhao]], the cave was supposed to imitate [[Lingyansi Cave]] at the [[Yungang Caves]].  Work began in 500 and was completed in 523.  In 1987 a brick-entrance was demolished to reveal two new figures: a four-headed, four-armed [[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahma]] and a one headed, four armed [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] devendra.

==Features==
The back wall is a carved [[Sakyamuni]], with two discliples and two [[bodhisattva]]s.  The main Buddha and bodhisattvas are representative of the Northern Wei sculptural style.  A lotus-flower pool decorates the floor.  The ceiling is engraved with a blossoming lotus flower, 8 musical [[apsaras]]es, 2 attending apsarases and tassel and drapery patterns.  The front wall is covered with a large [[Vimalakirti]] relief, the [[Prince Sattva]] [[jataka]], the [[Prince Sudatta]] jataka, an emperor/empress worshipping scene and ten deity kings.

==Nearby caves==
The cave is flanked by [[North Binyang Cave|North]] and [[South Binyang Cave|South]] Binyang Caves.

"'''Modern Love'''" is a song written and recorded by [[David Bowie]]. It is the opening track to his album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'', and was issued as the third single from the album in late 1983.

By the time "Modern Love" was issued and edited as a single, Bowie's [[Serious Moonlight Tour]] was underway. The video for the song used footage of Bowie and his band performing the song from concert in [[Philadelphia]] on 20 July 1983.  A live version, recorded in [[Montreal]] on 13 July 1983, was on the B-side.

The single reached No. 2 in the UK, and No. 14 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Whitburn]] (2004). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 8th Edition (Billboard Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as being a staple of the tour, it featured in Bowie's set at [[Live Aid]] in 1985, and in his subsequent [[Glass Spider Tour]] and [[Sound+Vision Tour]] of 1987 and 1990.  A re-recording with [[Tina Turner]] was also featured on a [[Pepsi]] commercial in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= EXCLUSIVE: Didier Drogba unleashed... the shocking, other side of the Chelsea striker |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1227076/EXCLUSIVE-Didier-Drogba-unleashed--shocking-Chelsea-striker.html |first= Laura|last= Williamson |work= Dailymail.co.uk |publisher= Associated Newspapers Ltd |date= 12 November 2009 |accessdate= 29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of America'''  is the Blessed Virgin Mary as she identified herself in response to the US Bishops declaring Her Patroness of the United States as The Immaculate Conception, and is not to be confused with and in no way displaces Our Lady of Guadalupe who is known as '''Empress of the Americas'''. It is a title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] based on [[private revelation]]s reported by Sister Mary Mildred Neuzil (then using the name Sister Mary Ephrem) of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood. Devotion to Our Lady of America was approved and promoted by [[Paul Francis Leibold]], [[Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archbishop of Cincinnati]] for the specific group of people who sought private healing through this Marian title.&lt;ref name="burkeletter"&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Raymond |last= Burke |authorlink = Raymond Burke (archbishop) |title = Regarding Our Lady of America |format= (letter to [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]) |date= 2007-05-31 |url= http://www.ewtn.com/library/BISHOPS/burkeolamer.htm |accessdate=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Catholic Church]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] has not officially recognized or approved the alleged apparitions according to the personal diary of Sister Mary Ephrem. The United States and Latin America have churches dedicated to Mary with the title 'María, Reina de las Américas'.

==History==
The [[Catholic devotions|devotion]] to Our Lady of America has its source in a personal diary by Sister Mary Ephrem in which she describes [[Marian apparition|apparitions]] of the Blessed Virgin Mary she claims to have experienced some time prior to 1956. Sister Mary Ephrem (baptized Mildred) Neuzil, was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1916  and in 1933 was professed in the Congregation of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood of Jesus, of [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="burkeletter"/&gt;

The ministry of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood includes prayer, education, art, music, care of the elderly, social services, healthcare, parish and pastoral ministry. Around 1957 Sister Ephrem became part of a cloistered contemplative branch of the same congregation established in [[New Riegel, Ohio]]. The New Riegel cloister received papal approval in 1965. In 1977 the three surviving members, including Sister Mary Ephrem separated from the Sisters of the Precious Blood and formed an autonomous congregation, the Contemplative Sisters of the Indwelling Trinity in [[Fostoria, Ohio]], directed by Sister Mary Ephrem. She also established an organization called "The Our Lady of America Center". 

The Holy See rejected their petition for separation the following year, on the ground that three was “too small a number for a well-formed community”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2013/D04-10/C:12-2157:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1116011:S:0 "McCarthy v Fuller", United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sisters of the Indwelling Trinity survive to the present day even though they never received approval or have been recognized by the local ordinary of [[Toledo, Ohio]]. 

Sister Mary Ephrem died in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090428004544/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0704623.htm Brinker, Jennifer. "Nun sees interest in Our Lady of America gaining momentum", Catholic News Service, August 14, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apparition==
Sister Mary Ephrem allegedly experienced seemingly mystical spiritual experiences of Our Lady of America between September 25, 1956 and November 15, 1956 in the Our Lady Mother of Mercy Chapel in Rome City, [[Indiana]].  According to Sister Ephrem's personal diary, upon which accounts of the alleged apparitions are based, these visits requested devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and asked Sister Ephrem to propagate them. She then turned to Monsignor [[Paul Francis Leibold]], her spiritual director until 1972. It is said that Sister Ephrem was asked to have a medal struck that would bear the image of Our Lady of America on the front and the symbol of the Christian Family and the [[Blessed Trinity]] on the back. 

The Sisters of the Precious Blood later sold the Rome City property to The Way International, a biblical research, teaching and fellowship ministry.

==Position of the Roman Catholic Church==
A booklet containing the contents of the revelation, and bearing the ''[[Imprimatur]]'' of Archbishop Leibold, Sister Mary Ephrem's [[spiritual director]], was published in 1960 and again in 1971.&lt;ref name="burkeletter"/&gt;
A distinction must be made between the devotion to Our Lady of America itself, and the claimed apparitions said to have initiated it. In 1963, Leibold, then an auxiliary bishop of Cincinnati (later Archbishop of Cincinnati 1969-1972), granted his [[Imprimatur]] to the text of a prayer Sister Mary Ephrem had written in honor of Our Lady of America, and to the design of a medal. While a number of church officials have indicated support for the devotion, finding nothing against church teaching, no decision  has been rendered as yet with regard to the supernatural origin of the reported apparitions of Our Lady to Sister Mildred Neuzil. &lt;ref&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-america-messages.php "Our Lady of America Messages", International Marian Research Institute'', University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports and claims of healings upon the grounds at Rome City, Indiana have not been verified and approved by the [[Catholic Church]]. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati has stated that the Devotion to Our Lady of America, as a matter of private revelation, has not been canonically approved despite the claims of some individuals.

==Other devotions to Our Lady of America==

===Melkite Catholic Church===
In 1972, Father Albert Gorayeb, of Saint Ann Melkite Catholic Church commissioned an icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary. As Fr. Gorayeb dedicated the Icon of Our Lady to bless the American people, it bears the title Our Lady of America. On June 27, 1976 Patriarch Maximos V Hakim and Archbishop Joseph Tawil solemnly blessed and consecrated the Icon, as a special blessing to America and to all those who pray before Her. The icon has gone on pilgrimage to parishes that request it, but resides at the Church of St. Ann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintannmelkite.org/our-lady-of-america/ "Our Lady of America", Saint Ann Melkite Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Philippines===
Prayer to Our Lady of America is a popular devotion in the Philippines, with a chapel, three shrines eleven churches dedicated to her. [[Baguio Cathedral]] has a Chapel of Our Lady of America. She is considered the patroness of the Thomasites, of Igorot people, of the Cordilleras and of Northern Luzon.

'''Paul Rosenberg''' (29 December 1881 – 29 June 1959) was a French [[art dealer]]. He represented [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Both Paul and his brother [[Léonce Rosenberg]] were among the world's major dealers of modern art.

==Career==
The younger son of antiques dealer Alexandre Rosenberg, Paul and his elder brother [[Léonce Rosenberg|Léonce]] joined their father's business. Alexandre had established his business in 1878, and by 1898 had become a noted dealer of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt; He educated his sons in this passion by allowing them both a [[grand tour]] via London, Berlin, Vienna and New York to acquire experience and contacts. During the tour, Paul bought two [[van Gogh]] drawings and a [[Manet]] portrait for $220, which he had transported to his father's gallery and sold onwards at a profit.&lt;ref name=DBeast/&gt; From 1906 on, the brothers worked as partners within the business.  When their father retired, they became directors. Having established their own networks, the brothers opened their own separate galleries in the city's [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]], with Paul at 21 [[rue La Boétie]] (opened in 1911) and Léonce in the rue de la Baume.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;

===Paris: 1911–1940===
Léonce became a noted champion of [[Cubism]], a lead that Paul followed, but being located in a more noted art district, he gained better contacts and greater finances. Working initially with his brother-in-law [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], Paul and his partner [[Georges Wildenstein]] established and then won over from Kahnweiler exclusive relationships with: [[Picasso]] (from 1918); [[Braque]] (1922); [[Marie Laurencin]]; [[Fernand Léger]] (1927); and latterly [[Matisse]] (1936).&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;

Paul's stock included pieces by all of the classical and contemporary French and major European artists, and latterly American artists, including: [[Marsden Hartley]]; [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]]; [[Abraham Rattner]]; [[Karl Knaths]]; [[Harvey Weiss]]; [[Oronzio Maldarelli]]; [[Nicolas de Staël]]; [[Graham Sutherland]]; [[Kenneth Armitage]]; and [[Giacomo Manzù]]. The result was that from 1920, Paul Rosenberg's company was widely acknowledged to be without doubt the most active and influential gallery in the world.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;

With the early artist relationships, like Kahnweiler had, Rosenberg gave the artists financial security by agreeing to buy their works on the basis of an exclusive contract. Rosenberg lent Picasso money after his honeymoon with the ballerina [[Olga Khokhlova]] and found them an apartment in Paris next to his own family home, generosity which resulted in a lifelong friendship between these two very different men. Rosenberg's purchases from Picasso included ''[[Nude, Green Leaves and Bust]]'' (1932), a portrait of Picasso's mistress [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], which Rosenberg sold in New York in 1951 to [[Frances Lasker Brody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Picasso painting fetches record $106m at auction | work = BBC News | date = 2010-05-05 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8661338.stm | accessdate = 2010-05-05 | ref = CITEREFbbc2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every summer the Rosenberg family and the Picasso family would depart for the South of France, holidaying there with friends including [[F.

Rosenberg's reputation for clean dealing enabled him by 1935 to persuade his  brother-in-law [[Jacques Helft]], a noted antiques dealer, to open a branch in [[Bond Street]], London, to enable them to engage with more Americans.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt; Noted clients included museums such as the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)]] (of which Rosenberg was an early supporter and donor), and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. His private clients included [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]],&lt;ref name=MoMAEx/&gt; [[Chester Dale]], [[Douglas Dillon]], and [[Marjorie Acker Phillips|Marjorie]] and [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]], who through purchases from Rosenberg created much of the modern collections within [[The Phillips Collection]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=DBeast/&gt;

In the late 1930s, Rosenberg, alert to signs of an approaching war, began quietly moving his collection out of continental Europe to the London branch and to storage in America (via the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]), Australia and latterly South America. He then stopped adding to his collection in France, and advised his artists to make similar arrangements. Although his relocation plans were well advanced, by the time of the 1940 [[Nazi invasion of France]], he still held over 2,000 pieces in the country, both in his gallery and in storage.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt; The Rosenbergs were Jewish and had to flee Nazi-occupied France.  They owed their lives to the Portuguese Consul-General in Bordeaux, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who issued them visas to his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sousamendesfoundation.org/helft-loevi-rosenberg/|title=Helft/Loevi/Rosenberg|work=sousamendesfoundation.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032911/http://sousamendesfoundation.org/helft-loevi-rosenberg/|archivedate=2013-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1940, Nazi [[Alfred Rosenberg]] established the Parisian base of the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR)]],&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; whose purpose was to confiscate [[free masonry|masonic]] artifacts and the highest-quality works of art for Hitler's planned [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; All looted art works, including Paul Rosenberg's, were initially shipped by truck to the depot created in the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]].&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; There Nazi art historians, experts, photographers, and maintenance and administrative personnel appraised, filed, photographed and packed what were now termed "ownerless cultural goods" for rail transport to Germany.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt; French officials at the end of the war estimated that one third of all art in French private hands had been confiscated.&lt;ref name=Feliciano&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy To Steal The World's Greatest Works Of Art|author=[[Hector Feliciano]]|publisher=Basic Books|date=25 April 1998|ISBN=978-0465041916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/|title=The Lost Museum|author=Hector Feliciano|date= 1998|accessdate= 4 November 2013|work=Bonjour Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York: 1940–1959===
Rosenberg, his wife, his daughter Micheline and her husband Joseph Robert Schwartz,&lt;ref name=DBeast/&gt; all travelled via [[Lisbon]], arriving at the Madison Hotel in New York in September 1940. There, with the help of well established friends and pieces that he had already disbursed around the world, he established a new gallery at No. 79 East 57th Street. The opening was well received by the art world, and garnered a four-page article within ''[[Art Digest]]''.

From this base post-war, Rosenberg managed to reclaim and re-purchase a number of pieces from his pre-war collection, but these represented less than half of the works he had lost.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; After the end of hostilities, he personally travelled to Paris to hear the tales of the family chauffeur Louis, who told of the coming of ERR trucks not long after the family had departed.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; On this first trip, Rosenberg managed to regain the 1918 Picasso portrait of his wife and daughter—one of three—renamed by Göring ''Mother and Child''—from a small museum in Paris.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt;

Rosenberg later regained a number of pieces after their confiscation by the US Army. In 1953, an exhibition of 89 pieces from Rosenberg's personal and private post-war collection were displayed at MoMA.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890762,00.html |date=December 7, 1953 |title=Art: Dealer's Choice |work=Time Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included ''[[Nude Reclining by the Sea]]'' (1868) by [[Gustave Courbet]], which was taken on 5 September 1941 by the ERR in a raid on Rosenberg's bank vault in [[Bordeaux]] together with another 162 of his paintings. The Courbet was catalogued at the Jeu de Paume in December 1941. It was later recovered from Göring's personal collection and repatriated to Rosenberg in New York. Rosenberg sold it in April 1953 to the New York collector [[Louis E. Stern]], who donated it in 1964 to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/98-487-371.html?page=2|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Collections  :  Provenance|author=Philadelphia Museum of Art|work=philamuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandre joined his father in New York in 1946 and became a partner in 1952. After the death of his father in 1959 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10D15FE3458137B93C3A9178CD85F4D8585F9 |title=Paul Rosenberg, Art Dealer, Dies |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 1, 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandre became the company's principal. In 1962 Alexandre was a co-founder and first President of the [[Art Dealers Association of America]], remaining one of the association's permanent board members throughout his life. He also served as an adviser to both the American Government and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] on matters pertaining to art works. After Alexandre's premature death in 1987 in London from an [[aneurysm]], whilst attending the reunion of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|US Army Second Armored Division]],&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; his wife Elaine took over the business. Following the death of Micheline in 2007, the family agreed to donate their grandfather's archives to MoMA, which held a supporting exhibition of the collection in 2010.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/PaulRosenbergf|title=The Paul Rosenberg Archives  A Gift of Elaine and Alexandre Rosenberg|work=moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=MoMAEx&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/paulrosenberg/|title=MoMA.org - Paul Rosenberg and Company: From France to America|work=moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection recovery==
[[File:Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume.jpg|thumb|250px|Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]]

Because the Nazis banned so-called "[[degenerate art]]" from entering Germany, art so designated in France was looted and held in what became known as the "Martyr's Room" at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |date = 1998 |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Rosenberg's professional and personal collection was branded as "degenerate art" and thereby fell under the mandate of the Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art. Following [[Joseph Goebels]] personal directive to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the [[Führermuseum]] and the wider war effort, [[Hermann Göring]] appointed a series of [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]]-approved dealers to liquidate these assets. Göring instructed them to give him the proceeds, with which he intended to grow his personal art collection.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; With much of this looted art sold onwards via Switzerland, Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe.

Today, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large [[Pablo Picasso]] watercolor, ''Naked Woman on the Beach'', painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by [[Matisse]]; and the ''Portrait of Gabrielle Diot'' by [[Degas]].&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

[[File:The Train (1964 film) trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|L. to R.: [[Paul Scofield]], [[Michel Simon]] (background) and [[Burt Lancaster]] in ''The Train'' - trailer]]
In June 1940, via the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], his son Alexandre Rosenberg had escaped to England. There he was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the [[Free French Forces]]. After being part of the [[D-Day Invasion]], in August 1944 north of Paris a troop under the command of Lt. Rosenberg dynamited tracks north of Nazi train No. 40,044 and seized it, as it was attempting to transfer looted treasures to Germany.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; Upon his soldiers opening the train's boxcar doors, Alexandre viewed many plundered pieces of art that had once been displayed in the home of his father. The seizure saved about 400 pieces of his father's art from being lost, including many masterpieces. Alexandre was demobilized in 1946, and left immediately for his family in New York to join his father's business. The train's interception was the inspiration for the 1964 film ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'', starring  [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Michel Simon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Patricia and Mashberg, Tom.

In the mid-1950s, Rosenberg lost a French lawsuit that he started to recover a Matisse in the south of France, after the judge decreed the masterpiece belonged to the defendant, Rosenberg's own family kin.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; After the death of Paul, the family agreed under Alexandre to continue to try to recover the family art works. Consequently, in 1971 they bought back the Degas ''[[Deux Danseuses]]'' for far below its worth.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt;

In December 1987, whilst reading at the [[Frick Museum]] in New York, Elaine Rosenberg found the painting ''[[Portrait of Gabrielle Diot]]'' by Degas listed for sale in an art magazine at the Mathias F. Hans Gallery in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; The listing included the fact that it had come to the current owner via the dealership of Paul Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; After she called the dealer and explained her connection to the looted picture, the dealer explained that under his confidentiality rules he could not disclose the current owner's name, but promised to let her know this very important piece of information. On calling a few days later, Elaine Rosenberg was told by the dealer that the "owner" had taken the piece from the gallery and disappeared without leaving any forwarding details.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

His granddaughter is TV journalist [[Anne Sinclair]], host of political shows and the former wife of [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/world/europe/21sinclair.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all Backing Her Man With Impressive Resources], The New York Times, May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/dominique-strauss-kahn-anne-sinclair-separated_n_1636183.html | work=Huffington Post | title=DSK, Anne Sinclair Have Reportedly Separated | date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1997, Rosenberg's heirs filed suit in [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]], Seattle, to recover the painting ''[[Odalisque]]'' (1927 or 1928) by Matisse from the [[Seattle Art Museum]], the first lawsuit against an American museum concerning ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia R.

===Recent developments===
In 2012, German tax authorities found pieces from Rosenberg's collection in an [[2012 Nazi loot discovery|apartment rented by Cornelius Gurlitt]], son of 1930s German art dealer [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]]. Over 1,500 pieces were recovered with an estimated value of up to €1bn, including ''Portrait of a Woman'' by Matisse that Rosenberg had left behind after fleeing Paris.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27810363|title=Gurlitt's Matisse is confirmed to be looted 'Nazi art'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt's collection was sent to a secure warehouse in Garching.

In 2012, the Rosenberg family identified ''Profil bleu devant la cheminée'' (Woman in Blue in Front of Fireplace; 1937), a Matisse painting that was confiscated by the Nazis in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mashberg (April 5, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/arts/design/rosenberg-family-asks-norwegian-museum-to-return-a-matisse.html Family Seeks Return of a Matisse Seized by the Nazis], The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; in an exhibition catalogue and demanded that the [[Henie-Onstad Art Centre|Henie-Onstad Art Centre (HOK)]] near [[Oslo]], Norway, return it. Rosenberg had bought the painting directly from Matisse in 1937 and had it stored at the time of the Nazi invasion in a bank vault in [[Libourne]], a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Gironde]] in [[Aquitaine]], southwestern France. The ERR entered the vault in March 1941, and, after cataloging at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in September 1941, it was earmarked for Göring's private collection. Then in the hands of various dealers during the Nazi period, post-war in the late 1940s it was bought by Norwegian shipping magnate [[Niels Onstad]] from the Paris-based dealer [[Henri Bénézit]]. It has since appeared in numerous publications and toured the world on several occasions. Although under Norwegian law, due to the period of ownership, the painting now belongs to HOK, Norway was one of 44 signatories to the [[1998 Washington Conference Principles]] on Nazi-Confiscated Art. Protracted mediation, overseen by Christopher A. Marinello of the [[Art Recovery Group]], saw the painting returned to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26680049|title=Nazi looted Matisse work returned by Norwegian gallery|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Marinello also recovered, for the Rosenberg heirs, ''Portrait of a Seated Woman'' by Henri Matisse, which had been found in the Munich home of [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Cornelius Gurlitt]].&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Eddy, May 15, 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46539">{{Fiqh |marital}}Under [[Quranist]], Sunni and Shia [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], Muslim men are allowed to practice [[polygyny]], that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time.The practice of a woman having more than one husband is a sin in Islam.

==Scriptural basis for polygyny==

The verse most commonly referred to with the topic of polygyny is Verse 3 of [[Surah 4 An-Nisa (Women)]]. A translation by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] is shown below:

{{quote|If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.|Qur'an, Sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), Ayah 3&lt;ref name="cite quran|4|3|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|4|3|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

("[[Ma malakat aymanukum|One that your right hands possess]]" means a slave.) At first glance, this can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on one's agenda. However, it is important to understand the verse in context of both the Qur'an as well as the historical context when Muslims believe it was revealed. It is believed these Verses were revealed after the [[Battle of Uhud]], in which many Muslim men were killed, leaving widows and orphans. Thus, many {{who|date=March 2018}} argue that these Verses have been revealed "because of Allah's concern for the welfare of women and orphans who were left without husbands and fathers who died fighting for the Prophet and for Islam. It is a verse about compassion towards women and their children; it is not about men or their sexuality." &lt;ref&gt;"Polygamy in Context." Common Grounds News Services. Alia Hogben. 02-Mar-2010. &lt;http://www.commongroundnews.org/article.php?id=27379&amp;lan=en&amp;sp=0&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hadith collection compiled by al-Bukhari, the historical context of Verse 4:3 is further explained when [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|‘Ursa]] narrates {{quote|that he asked 'Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) 'Aisha said, "O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them." |Collected by [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|62|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Qur’anic context can be explained by Surah 4:2, which states "To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age), nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your own. For this is indeed a great sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the first part of verse 4:3 is dealing with orphan women who are under the protection of a male guardian, and it is advising the guardian to "deal justly" with the orphans.

In the second part of Verse 4:3, the Qu’ran states "but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice."&lt;ref name="cite quran|4|3|s=ns"/&gt; If a man cannot deal justly with more than one wife, then he must marry only one. It is clear that this quote was revealed out of compassion towards women, and not as a means to please male sexuality, which is a common modern interpretation of such verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD%3D1%26ID%3D1885%26CATE%3D10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209050936/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1885&amp;CATE=10 |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting the verses regarding polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context by examining the nature of marriage in Islam helps understanding them. The Quran [4:21- "And how could ye take it when ye have gone in unto each other, and they have Taken from you a solemn covenant?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|21|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage is more than just a "solemn covenant" however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|30|21|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love and mercy are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that "They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|187|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinions of classical Islamic scholars on polygamy ==

Whilst [[traditional Islamic scholarship]] upholds the notion that Islamic law permits polygyny and furthermore enforces the divine command to "marry only one" where the man fears being unable to fulfil the rights of all his wives in a fair manner, a substantial segment of the Islamic scholarship elaborates further on the ruling regarding men who are able to ensure complete equality amongst the multiple wives.&lt;ref name="polygamyinislam.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polygamyinislam.com/2014/11/04/opinions-of-classical-islamic-scholars-on-polygyny/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141229190458/http://polygamyinislam.com/2014/11/04/opinions-of-classical-islamic-scholars-on-polygyny/ |archivedate=2014-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their opinion was derived from performing ijtihad (independent legal reasoning) which determined their belief that it is to be deemed preferable (even for the male individual who is capable of delivering justice to the multiple families) to refrain from joining more than one wife in the marital bond.

This opinion has been codified into the official positions of the [[Hanbali]] and [[Shaafi’i]] schools of jurisprudence which assert that it is held recommended for a Muslim male to have only one wife, even if he may act equitably with more than one woman.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ash-Shirbeeni from the [[Shafi‘i|Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence]], said: "It is a Sunnah not to marry more than one wife if there is no apparent need." [Mughni al-Muhtaj 4/207].&lt;ref name="islamweb.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=257272|title=Marrying two, three or four women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Al-Maawardi, from the Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence, said: "Allaah has permitted a man to marry up to four wives, saying: {…two or three or four…}, but Allaah advised that it is desirable for man to marry only one wife, saying: {…But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one}" [al-Hawi al-Kabir 11/417].&lt;ref name="islamweb.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Qudaamah from the Hanbali School of jurisprudence, said in Ash-Sharh Al-Kabeer: "It is more appropriate to marry only one wife. The author of Al-Muharrar [i.e. Abul Barakaat Al-Majd ibn Taymiyyah] said this, based on the saying of Allaah (which means) {…But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one}." [Ash-Sharh Al-Kabeer authored by Shams-ud-deen Ibn Qudaamah].&lt;ref name="islamweb.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These scholars felt that adherence to monogamy would minimise the risk of oppression because the requirement of meting out justice amongst a plurality of wives would be immensely challenging for any man. Therefore, they opined that it is preferable to avoid polygyny altogether, so one does not even come near the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives.&lt;ref name="polygamyinislam.com"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Imam Ahmed ibn Naqib al Masri, from the Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence, said ‘’It is fitter to confine oneself to just one’’ [Umdatu Salik].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Imam Ghazali, from the Shaafi’i School of jurisprudence, stated: "It does not call for two wives, [since] plurality may render life miserable and disrupt the affairs of the home." [Kitab al Nikah, Ihya Uloom ud Din].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Imam Shaafi’i offered an additional exegesis for the final clause of the pivotal verse discussing the divine legislation of polygyny and the divine limitations imposed upon this ancient institution.&lt;ref name="polygamyinislam.com"/&gt;
He espoused that the closing clause of verse 4:3,  usually interpreted as ‘that is more suitable that you may not incline to injustice’ should be understood as ‘that is more suitable that you may not be financially strained by numerous children’.

Imam Shaafi’i reasoned that divine decree had already listed fear of committing injustice as a reason to not wed more than once, hence it was pointless for the same reason (for not wedding more than once) to be expounded twice in the same verse.

His alternative interpretation pursued the perception which held that the presence of a plurality of women in a man's conjugal life would produce undesirably large numbers of offspring, which could be a potential cause of financial hardship and poverty in the future.

Given the emphasis that Islamic law stipulates on the welfare of children and nurturing children with permitted means of income, Imam Shaafi’i opined that it was legislated for a man to marry just once as an increase in the population of a family due to multiple marriages could potentially harbour harmful monetary consequences for the man who marries more than once.&lt;ref name="polygamyinislam.com"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ash-Shaafi’i is of the view that it is desirable to confine oneself to marrying only one although it is permissible for him to marry more than one. This is to avoid being unfair by being more inclined to some of them than others, or being unable to financially support them. [al-Hawi al-Kabir 11/417].&lt;ref name="islamweb.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Pre-Islamic (''jahiliyya'') context ==

Prior to the emergence of Islam, the Arabian Peninsula was characterized by a wide range of marriage practices—both polygynous and polyandrous alike, as well as monogamous. As Leila Ahmed states in her work, ''Women and Gender in Islam'', "evidence suggests that among the types of marriage practiced was matrilineal, uxorilocal marriage, found in Arabia, including Mecca, about the time of the birth of Muhammad (circa 570)--the woman remaining with her tribe, where the man could visit or reside with her, and the children belonging to the mother's tribe--as well as polyandrous and polygamous marriages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is widely accepted that polygyny was not the only type of matrimony practiced during the jahiliyya (pre-Islamic era), but one part of a highly variegated and diverse pool of matrimony types.

Noteworthy was the fact that it was customary for men to marry women without limit, a practice that ended with the advent of the Qur'an and its divine revelation. It was common in jahiliyya Arabia for there to be no restriction on the number of wives a man could have.&lt;ref name="Engineer 1992 21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Engineer|first=Asghar Ali|title=Rights of Women in Islam|year=1992|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ali 1883 118–29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Moulavi Chiragh|title=Proposed Political, Legal, and Social Reforms in the Ottoman Empire and Other Muhammadan States|year=1883|publisher=Education Society's Press|location=Bombay|pages=118–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, tribal leadership tended toward polygynous marriages with the express purpose of establishing relationships with other powerful families, effectively injecting the practice of marriage with a political purpose.&lt;ref name="Engineer 1992 21"/&gt; Further, it is important to note that marriages in this era, including polygynous ones, were not sacramental in nature, but purely contractual. It was not until Islam, one could say, standardized marriage and therefore what it constituted, that matrimony assumed a different set of characteristics beyond those of the purely contractual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Engineer|first=Asghar Ali|title=The Rights of Women in Islam|year=1992|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To amplify the context within which polygyny occupies an Islamic relevance, one should look to the current debates surrounding polygyny in Islam, and more broadly, polygamy, and the implications that emerged from their contextual transition from the jahiliyya to the Islamic era. Two highly dichotomous views on the social significance of the institutionalization of polygyny by Islam are provided by Leila Ahmed and Asghar Ali Engineer, and their views differ on the question of women. How did the establishment of polygyny in Islam as the only alternative to monogamy change the social condition of women? One verse that is often cited in these arguments is that which was quoted earlier — verse 3 of Surah 4.

Some, like Ali, argue that the overall condition of women who lived in the jahiliyya improved with the advent of Islam. These scholars cite a general establishment of order and protection provided by the Qur'anic verses, espousing the view that "the position of women was ameliorated to a greater degree by the mission of Muhammad."&lt;ref name="Ali 1883 118–29"/&gt; Nefarious practices of infanticide-particularly that of female newborns-capricious divorces, and unlimited license of polygyny all were social phenomena eradicated by the revelation of Qur'anic verses relating to the question of polygyny. Moulavi Chiragh Ali summarizes this view, stating, "The Qur’an gradually improved and elevated the degraded condition of women [in the jahiliyya] by curtailing, in the first place, the unlimited number of wives to four...and, in the second place, declaring it impossible to deal equitably with more than one wife even if men ‘would fain to do so,’ and thus virtually abolishing polygamy."&lt;ref name="Ali 1883 118–29"/&gt; Conversely, those of Ahmed's perspective would argue that with the arrival of Qur’anic law came the loss of sexual autonomy for women. In this view, jahiliyya marriage practices, including that of pre-Islamic polygyny, correlated with women's being "active participants, even leaders, in a wide range of community activities...their autonomy and participation were curtailed with the establishment of Islam, its institution of patrilineal, patriarchal marriage as solely legitimiate, and the social transformation that ensued."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extended discussion of the intersection of feminism and polygyny can be found in later sections of this article; ''see'' [[Polygyny in Islam#Muslim feminism and polygyny|Muslim Feminism and Polygyny]].

== Modern interpretations and practice ==

Most modern Muslims view the practice of polygyny as allowed, but unusual and not recommended.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali-Karamali|first=Sumbul|title=The Muslim Next Door: The Qur'an, the Media, and that Veil Thing|year=2008|publisher=White Cloud Press|location=Ashland, Oregon|isbn=978-0-9745245-6-6|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of polygyny is often viewed in its historical context, as the marriage was the only way for a woman to be provided for during the time of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walther|first=Wiebke|title=Women in Islam|year=1993|publisher=Marcus Weiner Publishing|location=New York, New York|isbn=1-55876-052-0|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many countries today either outlaw the practice of polygyny or place restrictions on it.

Several countries, such as [[Polygamy in Libya|Libya]], allow polygyny with few or no restrictions.&lt;ref name="libya"&gt;{{cite news|title=Libyan men now allowed to remarry without consent of first wife: court rule|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2013/02/07/264927.html|accessdate=31 October 2016|publisher=[[Al Arabiya]]|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Countries that ban polygyny ===

[[Turkey]] was the first Muslim country to legally ban polygyny in 1926. This decision was not based on religious reasons, but rather was an entirely secular ban.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 142"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walther 1993 232"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walther|first=Wiebke|title=Women in Islam|year=1993|publisher=Marcus Weiner Publishing|location=New York, New York|isbn=1-55876-052-0|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tunisia]] was the next country to ban polygyny through legislation passed in 1956 and restated in 1964.&lt;ref name="Walther 1993 232"/&gt; Unlike Turkey, Tunisia banned polygyny on religious grounds, citing two main reasons. First, the [[Quran]] limited the practice of polygyny, thus it did not support the practice and clearly intended for the practice to be eliminated over time.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali-Karamali|first=Sumbul|title=The Muslim Next Door: The Qur'an, the Media, and that Veil Thing|year=2008|publisher=White Cloud Press|location=Ashland, Oregon|isbn=978-0-9745245-6-6|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Quran demands equal treatment of all wives in a polygynous marriage, which is impossible, thus making the practice illegal.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt; Finally, [[Israel]] banned polygyny as well by 1978.&lt;ref name="Noel Coulson 1978 40"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in the Muslim World|year=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn= 9780674954816 |page=40|author=Noel Coulson|authorlink=Women and Law Reform in Contemporary Islam|author2=Doreen Hinchcliffe|editor=Louis Beck and Nikki Keddie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Countries that restrict polygyny ===

The following countries restrict the practice of polygyny:
* [[Egypt]] (1920)&lt;ref name="Kusha"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kusha|first=Hamid R.|title=Polygyny|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236MIW/e0641|work=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Sudan]] (1929)&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;
* [[India]] (1939)&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;
* [[Algeria]]&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt;
* [[Jordan]] (1951)&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;
* [[Syria]] (1953)&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;
* [[Morocco]] (1958)&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;
* [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt;
* [[Iraq]] (1959)&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;
* [[Iran]] (1967, 1975)&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;
* [[Kuwait]]&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt;
* [[Lebanon]]&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt;

Some countries, including India, Iran, Iraq, Bangladesh, Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Jordan, and Kuwait, allow women to include a clause prohibiting polygyny in marriage contracts.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noel Coulson 1978 40"/&gt; Other countries, such as Iran and Pakistan, require that a man get permission to take a second wife from his first wife, and then show the court proof of his first wife's consent.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt; Finally, countries such as Malaysia state that a man must get permission from both his wife and from the governmental religious authority in order to take a second.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt;

Although many countries have laws restricting or banning polygyny, it is still practiced illegally. It is difficult to enforce anti-polygyny laws and restrictions in countries with large rural populations. Furthermore, illegal polygyny often occurs in countries with poor social services as women rely on husbands to support them in these situations.&lt;ref name="Ali-Karamali 2008 145"/&gt;

One way that polygyny is still legally practiced in Iran today is through the practice of ''mut'a'',&lt;ref name="Noel Coulson 1978 40"/&gt; a temporary contractual relationship based on the mutual consent of a man and a woman. Throughout the contracted time, the woman must remain exclusively faithful to the man, and in return he must provide for her financially. Although this practice is technically legal, it is very highly disputed.&lt;ref name="Kusha"/&gt;

==Muslim feminism and polygyny==

=== Emergence of feminism ===
Muslim feminism is a fairly new movement, even though women's rights issues have been at the forefront of social reform for a while.  
This began to change when Muslim women realized they could alter their roles in society by rereading the main religious texts that dictated Muslim society and ethics.  This return to reinterpretation was not a new practice – male Islamic scholars had been doing it ever since Muhammad's death – but for women, it was unprecedented: this was the first time that women were learning how to read and study the Qur'an and the hadiths in an analytical way.  Their new religious knowledge led them to a better understanding of their faith, as well as the ability to make educated interpretations of the texts.  Many of these [[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminist]] scholars began to realize that there was no inherent tie between Islam and the patriarchal practices of Islamic society.  For example, these feminists studied Muhammad's life and argued that he treated women very progressively for that era.  [[Muhammad]] included all of his wives in his religious practices and respected them enough to take their advice and grievances seriously.  They also even accompanied him to battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale UP|location=New Haven|pages=64–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muslim feminists, Islamic polygyny was meant to curtail the practice that was already widespread in pre-Islamic times.  Conquering rulers would collect massive harems of women and treat them without any respect; whereas Islam reduced the allowable amount of wives each husband could have and required that he treat them all equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale UP|location=New Haven|pages=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists place emphasis on the idea that only those men who are capable of loving and financially providing for each wife equally are permitted to have more than one.  They also point out the practice of polygyny in Islam was created for the purpose of taking care of fatherless children, or orphans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wadud|first=Amina|title=Qur'an and Women: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective|year=1999|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, polygyny was allowable for charitable and honorable purposes.  Islamic feminists point out that "a recognition that gender inequality in the old world was assumed and that perceptions of women in Christian and Jewish texts are not that different from those of Islamic texts" is lacking from common understandings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mir-Hosseini|first=Ziba|title=Muslim Women's Quest for Equality: Between Islamic Law and Feminism|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=2006|volume=32|issue=4|pages=641|doi=10.1086/508085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two leading feminist Muslim scholars who are seeking to increase women's rights through the reinterpretation of religious texts are [[Amina Wadud]] and [[Asma Barlas]].  Both women embrace Islam as a religion that preaches gender equality.  They see societal practices, not Islam, as the main problem.  Wadud points out the three reasons that the Qur'an views as acceptable forms of polygyny: if the husband is not sexually satisfied he may take another wife rather than turn to prostitutes or an affair, if the first wife is unable to reproduce or another woman with child needs to be taken care of, and/or if the husband is financially stable enough to care for another woman in the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wadud|first=Amina|title=Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective|year=1999|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wadud, the form of polygyny that the Qur'an supports focuses on "justice: dealing justly, managing funds justly, justice to the orphans, and justice to the wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wadud|first=Amina|title=Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective|year=1999|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlas, who published her theological research several years later, argues a very similar point.  Both feminist scholars point out the origin of the Islamic theory of polygyny in Ayah 4:3.  This verse of the Qur'an was not meant to utilize polygyny as a way to oppress women, but to ensure that they were taken care of.

The other form of feminism in the Islamic world is independent or state feminism.  The premise behind this movement is that "no reform is possible in an Islamic legal and political system where ‘the very structure of power is male dominated to an absolute degree, back by the Constitution, an all-male clerical system ruling the country.’"&lt;ref name="Moghadam 2002 1151"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moghadam|first=Valentine|title=Islamic Feminism and Its Discontents: Toward a Resolution of the Debate|journal=Signs|year=2002|volume=27|issue=4|pages=1151|doi=10.1086/339639}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that Islam supports and perpetuates a clear female role that designates women to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="Moghadam 2002 1151"/&gt; These Muslim feminists argue that there is only so much that reinterpreting the texts can do and believe that the best – and perhaps only – way to increasing women's rights is outside of the parameters of Islam.&lt;ref name="Moghadam 2002 1151"/&gt; Therefore, changing polygynist practices would involve reforming the political and legal systems instead of just trying to reinterpret the Qur’an and the hadiths to determine if they really support the practice and to what extent.

=== Women's movements and family law reforms in Africa ===
Feminism's effect on polygyny in Islam is different in every Muslim society, depending on the different cultures that are interacting with Islam in each location.  For example, in Iran, changes to women's rights occurred in the wake of the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] in 1979.  During this revolution the [[Iran's Family Protection Law|Family Protection Law]], which had given some power to women and imposed minimal restrictions on polygyny, was overturned.  Muslim women were encouraged to return to their traditional roles.  This loss of rights led to the movement realizing that they could not necessarily rely on the government alone to protect their rights.  This spurred the creation of the personal status laws, which covered many issues relating to marriage and divorce including polygyny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramazani|first=Nesta|title=Women in Iran: The Revolutionary Ebb and Flow|journal=Middle East Journal|year=1993|volume=47|issue=3|pages=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passed in 1986, the law "effectively reinstates the provision of the 1975 Family Protection Law granting a wife the right to obtain a divorce if her husband marries a second woman without the wife's permission of if…a man does not treat his wives fairly and equally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramazani|first=Nesta|title=Women in Iran: The Revolutionary Ebb and Flow|journal=Middle East Journal|year=1993|volume=47|issue=3|pages=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; This offers Iranian Muslim women some legal protection against polygyny, but the enforcement of the law is still up to the interpretation of the courts.  Muslim women's movement organizations have begun to gain more power in Iran due to the increasing number of Muslim women who are studying the Qur'an analytically.  These new scholars are able to argue for interpretations of Islam that empower rather than oppress women.  They also lead organizations like the Association of Muslim Women and Zeynab.  Many Muslim women also go jalasehs where they can openly discuss religious texts in a safe environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramazani|first=Nesta|title=Women in Iran: The Revolutionary Ebb and Flow|journal=Middle East Journal|year=1993|volume=47|issue=3|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; So even though the revolution attempted to reinstate many patriarchal values, like unlimited polygyny, it ended up inspiring women to push for more rights and become more credible by studying religious texts.

Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco also began restricting polygynous practices in Islam.  Egypt's personal status laws underwent many changes between 1979 and 1985, but in the end they were very restrictive for women and reduced the limits on polygyny.&lt;ref name="Hatem"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatem|first=Mervat|first2=Shahla |last2=Haeri |first3=Valentine M. |last3=Moghadam |first4=Susan Schaefer |last4=Davis |first5=Leila |last5=Hessini |first6=Anita M. |last6=Weiss |first7=Sharon |last7=Siddique|title=Women and Social Reform|journal=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incentivized Egyptian feminists to create a new marriage contract (approved in 2000) that would give women some rights concerning divorce and what was allowable in marriage.&lt;ref name="Hatem"/&gt; Jordan was able to have more success in 2001 when it amended its Civil Status Law, which requires the consent of the wife before the husband marries again.&lt;ref name="Hatem"/&gt; This change was accompanied by a handful of other progressive decisions on women's rights in the country, greatly improving the status of women.  Morocco was also pushed along by its Muslim feminist groups to make entering into a polygynous marriage more difficult.

=== Muslim feminism in Asia ===
Islamic communities in Asia, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, have also experienced feminist movements which work to restrict polygynous practices.  Indonesian feminists have challenged these practices through the study and reinterpretation of religious texts.  Fatayat NU, a voluntary Muslim women's organization, was created in 1950 for middle-aged women who were a part of [[Nahdlatul Ulama]], a Sunni Islam group, and wanted to have a voice. Initially experiencing membership issues due to large percentage of women who were married or uneducated, Fatayat NU began to gain power as institutions outside of Indonesia took notice of it and supported the organizations work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amez|first=Monika|title=Empowering Women through Islam: Fatayat NU between Tradition and Change|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|year=2010|volume=21|issue=1|pages=66|doi=10.1093/jis/etp025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women in Fatayat NU use Islam and the religious texts to justify their actions and guide their decisions, so women who have extensively studied the religion are crucial.  Out of the many controversial issues that Fatayat NU takes a stand on, polygyny is one that has recently come into contention.  Although polygyny in Indonesia was never very popular, some Muslim women are worried that it is starting to gain more support.  Nahdlatul Ulama is one of the organizations that approves of polygyny as an Islamic practice, but Fatayat NU is taking a contradicting stance; the members believe that polygyny can only be possible if men and women are unequal, which goes against their interpretation of the Qur'an's message on gender status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amez|first=Monika|title=Empowering Women through Islam: Fatayat NU between Tradition and Change|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|year=2010|volume=21|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.1093/jis/etp025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malaysia, polygyny has been considered a topic that is not fit to be brought up in public, but recently it has begun to enter public discourse.  This change came about through the passage of a new Islamic family law, which supports polygynous practices by making them easier for men to take part in.  This has created a "debate between Islamic fundamentalists who dominate the burgeoning Islamic Affairs Department that administers Shariah law and mostly Western-educated Muslim feminists who say the department, in its overzealous interpretation of the Qur’an, has gone overboard in making new laws that discriminate against women and children."&lt;ref name="Kuppusamy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuppusamy|first=Baradan|title=Malaysia: Feminists, Others Call for Tempering Islamic Law|newspaper=New York Amsterdam News|date=5 Jan 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign against this law was very popular, but the law was still passed.  Muslim women's organizations in Malaysia plan to continue protesting it until it is revoked.&lt;ref name="Kuppusamy"/&gt;

== Polygyny in Islamic popular culture ==

=== Theater ===
[[Mirza Fatali Akhundov|Mirza Fath Ali Akhundzade]] is a famous 19th century Azeri playwright who revealed his support for women's rights in his theatrical pieces.  Known for his questioning of traditional Islamic beliefs, Akhundzade's plays were seen as a form of protest against ideas like arranged marriage, polygyny, and women obediently serving their husbands.  Akhundzade's distaste for polygyny can be traced back to his Islamic upbringing and his mother's marriage to his father and her consequently unhappy relationship with the first wife.&lt;ref name="Kia 1998 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kia|first=Mehrdad|title=Women, Islam and Modernity in Akhundzade's Plays and Unpublished Writings|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|year=1998|volume=34|issue=3|pages=2|doi=10.1080/00263209808701230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to Akhundzade, polygyny was "an evil and corrupting practice that not only oppressed women but also caused eternal animosity and hatred between the wives and their children."&lt;ref name="Kia 1998 2"/&gt;  Using satire as his weapon, Akhundzade attempted to impact Islamic society through plays like ''The Story of Monsieur Jourdan the Botanist and Dervish Mast Ali Shah'' (1851), ''The Story of the Vizier of the Khan of Sarab'' (1851), ''The Story of the Bear that Caught the Robber'' (1852), and ''The Story of the Attorneys at Law'' (1855).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kia|first=Mehrdad|title=Women, Islam and Modernity in Akhundzade's Plays and Unpublished Writings|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|year=1998|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1–33|doi=10.1080/00263209808701230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these plays portrayed women in increasingly progressive ways, so that the main female character in ''The Attorneys at Law'' was complex, strong, and went against her powerful aunt and Islamic tradition to marry for love.  Akhundzade's belief that polygyny reflected an unjust treatment of the first wife influenced his ultimate dismissal of Islam as a just and egalitarian religion.

=== Literature ===
Polygyny has appeared in literature in many different Islamic societies.  Indian Muslim literature has traditionally stood divided on its position on polygyny as a justifiable practice.  Two Indian authors, Akbari Begum and Bashiruddin Ahmad, revealed in their novels a belief that polygyny is acceptable in certain circumstances; whereas Nazr Sajjad Hyder opposed this notion and completely rejected the practice in her work.  ''Gudar ka Lal'' (The Ruby in Rags), written in 1907 by Akbari Begum, projected the author's beliefs on a wide range of subjects involving the treatment of Muslim women and girls, including polygyny.  The story's plotline revolves around the relationships between Yusuf Raza and his two wives, Maqbool and Mehr Jabeen.  Yusuf Raza remarries when he realizes that his first wife is so uneducated that she does not know how to properly take care of her children or the household.  At first, Maqbool is resentful of Mehr Jabeen, but eventually she recognizes Mehr Jabeen's kind and friendly nature, and the two become friends.  This happy outcome reflects Begum's belief that polygyny in Islam can be justified when marriages are seen as incompatible and could benefit from a second wife who could help around the house and thus ease tensions.  Bashiruddin Ahmad's novel, ''Iqbal Dulham'' (The Bride Iqbal), also promotes the ideal polygynous relationship where the wives become friends and find vital companionship instead of competition.  Published in 1908, Iqbal Dulham follows a young man, Iqbal Mirza, who marries a second wife after his first wife fails to conceive children.  The initial tension between the wives is relieved when the second wife gives birth.  Once Iqbal Mirza has children, his relationship with his first wife improves, and the two wives are then able to become friends.  Thus, Ahmad portrays how polygyny can be used to ease the pressure on the first wife to produce children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alam|first=Asiya|title=Polygyny, Family and Sharafat: Discourses amongst North Indian Muslims, circa 1870-1918|journal=Modern Asian Studies|year=2011|volume=45|issue=3|pages=631–668|doi=10.1017/s0026749x10000168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both stories polygyny is a solution to domestic disharmony.

Nazr Sajjad Hyder, however, shows her disproval of the practice of polygyny in ''Ah-e Mazluman'' (Sighs of the Oppressed), written around 1912.  The two households in ''Ah-e Mazluman'', both engage in polygynous practices, but Hyder presents the relationships between husband and wives as very negatively affected; the stories "accentuate the cruelty of husbands towards their wives and aim to intensify the exclusion and alienation experienced by the first wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alam|first=Asiya|title=Polygyny, Family and Sharafat: Discourses amongst North Indian Muslims, circa 1870-1918|journal=Modern Asian Studies|year=2011|volume=45|issue=3|pages=662|doi=10.1017/s0026749x10000168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyder perceives polygyny as a practice that is harming Islam and giving it a bad reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alam|first=Asiya|title=Polygyny, Family and Sharafat: Discourses amongst North Indian Muslims, circa 1870-1918|journal=Modern Asian Studies|year=2011|volume=45|issue=3|pages=664|doi=10.1017/s0026749x10000168}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recommends its end and pleads that Muslim men act in a more just manner towards their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alam|first=Asiya|title=Polygyny, Family and Sharafat: Discourses amongst North Indian Muslims, circa 1870-1918|journal=Modern Asian Studies|year=2011|volume=45|issue=3|pages=663–4|doi=10.1017/s0026749x10000168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of Islamic polygyny is also revealed in [[Assia Djebar]]'s ''Ombre sultane'' (Shadow sultana).  Written in Algeria in 1987, it is told from the perspective of the first wife, Isma.  She thus constructs through her descriptions how the reader perceives the second wife and the husband.  The second wife, Hajila, is seen as a rival and is reduced through Isma's portrayals to body parts that are disassociated from Hajila as a whole person.  This reveals Isma's lack of respect for Hajila and the process of "othering" that Isma uses to degrade Hajila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prabhu|first=Anjali|title=Sisterhood and Rivalry In-between the Shadow and the Sultana: A Problematic of Representation in "Ombre Sultane"|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=74–5|doi=10.1353/ral.2002.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the idea that polygyny creates a sense of solidarity between wives is shown to be flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prabhu|first=Anjali|title=Sisterhood and Rivalry In-between the Shadow and the Sultana: A Problematic of Representation in "Ombre Sultane"|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=71|doi=10.1353/ral.2002.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isma also describes Hajila in unflattering terms that distance her from the attentions of the husband they share and of other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prabhu|first=Anjali|title=Sisterhood and Rivalry In-between the Shadow and the Sultana: A Problematic of Representation in "Ombre Sultane"|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=79–80|doi=10.1353/ral.2002.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to Isma's depiction of herself as constantly being the object of male desire, creating a sense that sisterhood between the two women is out of the question.  However, Isma's diction also creates a relationship between herself and Hajila in which neither can exist without the other; "they are locked in a sorority created, in a way, in tandem with the patriarchal force that remains a threat to their very existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prabhu|first=Anjali|title=Sisterhood and Rivalry In-between the Shadow and the Sultana: A Problematic of Representation in "Ombre Sultane"|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=81|doi=10.1353/ral.2002.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Djebar's portrayal of polygyny is multifaceted and conflicting: it has the ability to create both rivalry and solidarity.

=== Music ===
Polygyny in Islam has surfaced in music around the world and across the decades.  For instance, in Malaysia in the 1950s and 60s, the famous entertainer [[P. Ramlee]] dealt with many sociopolitical issues in his art.  Whereas the rest of the music industry was under the outside influence of Latin America, India, and the United States, Ramlee's music was inspired by what was going on in Malaysian society.  He critiqued the practice of polygyny to keep in line with his self-proclaimed role of exposing the weaknesses of his society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lockard|first=Craig|title=From Folk to Computer Songs: The Evolution of Malaysian Popular Music, 1930-1990|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|year=1996|volume=30|issue=3|pages=6|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1996.00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These socially critical songs did not necessarily fit into the categories of popular music at the time, but they were still embraced by his audiences.

Muslim hip hop has also become increasingly popular, especially as Islam has spread to, and begun to establish itself in, the United States.  As young Muslims grow up in the American culture, they are being exposed to ideas and beliefs that earlier generations of Muslims never came into contact with.  This has led to a new wave of Muslims trying to reconcile their faith with their country's cultural practices.  Out of this tension have risen new forms of Islamic creative expression, including hip hop.  Two Muslim hip hop artists who bring up the concept of polygyny in their music are Miss Undastood and Sons of Hagar.  "Miss Undastood, a young veiled, African-American lyricist, raps on her CD ''Dunya or Deen'' (Life or Faith) about war, love, the challenges of being a young Muslim woman in America, and the power of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aidi|first=Hisham|title="Verily, There Is Only One Hip-Hop Umma": Islam, Cultural Protest and Urban Marginality|journal=Socialism and Democracy|year=2004|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Miss Undastood's songs, "Co-Wife," criminalizes men who practice polygyny for the wrong reasons: out of lust or when they are financially unstable.&lt;ref name="Miss Undastood"&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Undastood|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/mmw/2008/10/miss-undastood/|publisher=Muslimah Media Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, though, Miss Undastood believes that Islamic polygyny is justifiable.&lt;ref name="Miss Undastood"/&gt; Sons of Hagar is another hip hop group that seeks to positively portray Islam in their lyrics and support Islamic practices in their actions.  Their song, "Sisterssss," supports polygynous practices.  The members of the group rationalize that even though polygyny is illegal in America, rapping about it is much less offensive than when other artists rap about prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parvaz|first=D|title=Muslim Rap: Local Group Rhymes about Islam, Mideast Politics|newspaper=Seattle PI|date=16 Feb 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Islamic polygyny has also appeared as a controversial issue in films.  For example, [[Ayat-Ayat Cinta|''Ayat-ayat Cinta'']] (Verses of Love) was released in Indonesia in 2008.  This movie follows the life of Fahri bin Abdillah, a student in Egypt, and his relationships with four other women.  The film inspired more open, public discussion on polygyny in Indonesia by calling attention to the conditions of women who enter into polygynous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khalik|first=Abdul|title=Women Reject Polygamy, Choosing Divorce|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=2 Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Indonesian movie that tackles the subject of polygyny is [[Love for Share|''Berbagi Suami'']] (Love for Share), which came out in 2006.  The director, Nia Dinata, was inspired by her experiences in Indonesia with women who were in polygynous relationships.&lt;ref name="Bijan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bijan|first=Tehrani|title=Love for Share deals with the polygamy in Indonesia today|url=http://www.cinemawithoutborders.com/1209-love-for-share-deals-with-the-polygamy-in-indonesia-today/|website=Cinema Without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt; She acknowledges that every woman reacted in different ways to their marriage but ultimately all felt isolated and saddened by the addition of a new wife.&lt;ref name="Bijan"/&gt; Three stories are told within the movie and all three leading actresses learn to at least outwardly accept their situations, whether they are the first wife finding about the existence of other women or the new addition to the family who has to situate herself in the household hierarchy.

'''Qalupalik''' is an [[Inuit mythology|Inuit mythological creature]]. 

==About==
The Qalupalik is a human-like creature that lives in the sea, with long hair, green skin, and long fingernails.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, Evelyn. ''Inuit Mythology''. Berkeley Heights, NJ: Enslow Pub, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7660-1559-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is that qalupaliks wear an [[amauti]]it (a form of pouch that Inuit parents wear to carry their children) so they can take babies and children away who disobey their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Millman, Lawrence, and Timothy White. ''A Kayak Full of Ghosts Eskimo Tales''. Santa Barbara: Capra Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-88496-267-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was used to prevent children from wandering off alone, lest the qalupalik take the children in her amautik underwater and keep them forever.&lt;br/&gt; Qalupaliks are said to make a distinctive humming sound; therefore, they can be heard before they appear.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==In culture==
===Film===
*Ame Papatsie adapted the myth as a [[stop motion animation]] short ''Qalupalik'' (2010), produced by the [[Inuit Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] through its Nunavut Animation Lab. The film made its world premiere at the 2010 [[Terres en vues/Land InSights]] festival.&lt;ref name="nfb pr"&gt;{{cite web|title=The NFB points up the 20th anniversary of the First Peoples' Festival with 10 new films, including two world premieres|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/press-room/press-releases.php?id=19895|work=Press release|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=7 November 2011|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papatsie|first=Ame|title=Nunavut Animation Lab: Qalupalik|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/nunavut_animation_lab_qalupalik/|work=NFB.ca|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=7 November 2011|format=Animated short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
* Canadian children's literature author [[Robert Munsch]] featured the Qalupalik in his 1988 book ''A Promise is a Promise'', co-authored with Inuit writer [[Michael Kusugak]] and illustrated by [[Vladyana Krykorka]]. The protagonist of the story is caught by the Qalupalik (spelled "Qallupilluit" in the book) and promises to bring all her siblings to them if they let her go. The Qalupalik agrees, and the child confesses her promise to her parents, who help her outsmart the monsters.&lt;ref name="MunschKusugak1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert N. Munsch|author2=Michael Kusugak|author3=Vladyana Krykorka|title=A promise is a promise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hMNAQAAMAAJ|year=1988|publisher=[[Annick Press]]|isbn=978-1-55037-031-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine art===
* Ningeokuluk Teevee exhibited the painting, ''Legend of Qalupalik'' (2011), at Spirit Wrestler Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Spirit Wrestler Gallery| url=http://www.spiritwrestler.com/catalog/index.php?products_id=6659 |title=Legend of Qalupalik|date=2011|author= Teevee, Ningeokuluk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
*In ''[[Helix (TV series)|Helix]]'': "[[List of Helix episodes#Season 1 .282014.29|Survivor Zero" (season 1, episode 7)]], [[Helix (TV series)#Cast|Anana]], an Inuit policewoman whose brother [[Helix (TV series)#Cast|Miksa]] went missing when they were children and who is investigating the Arctic biostation as the possible location where 31 stolen children were taken, tells [[Helix (TV series)#Cast|Sergio Ballesaros]] she and other children were cautioned to stay near their people's hunting sites, lest the Qalupalik steal them; she likens the Qalupalik to the [[bogeyman]]. Sergio, in turn, confides that children from the [[favela]]s in his hometown, [[Espírito Santo]], Brazil, also went missing and implied he was one of them.

In season 9 episode 10 of Murdoch Mysteries, constable George Crabtree believed the culprit of a murder to be a Qalupalik until realising that the constabulary was in possession of the victim's body, contrary to the belief that a Qalupalik drags its victims beneath the sea.

The organization has also pressed for Sikh rights in many states in India, including Jammu &amp; Kashmir where it demanded that the state should recognize National Commission of Minorities jurisdiction and protect Sikhs as minorities in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/rashtriya-sikh-sangat-members-meet-jk-governor-116010501211_1.html Rashtriya Sikh Sangat members meet JK Governor], Business Standard (January 5, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion in Greece''' is dominated by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], which is within the larger communion of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. It represented 90% of the total population in 2015&lt;ref name="Pew2017"/&gt; and is constitutionally recognized as the "prevailing religion" of [[Greece]].

Also a small number of Greek [[Atheists]] exists, not self-identifying as religious.

===Greek Orthodoxy===

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]], a member of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], is accorded the status of "prevailing religion" in [[Constitution of Greece|Greece's constitution]], and Greece is the only country in the world where an Eastern Orthodox Church is clearly recognized as a [[state religion]]. Since 1850, Greek Orthodoxy within Greece is handled by the [[Church of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, '' Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches.''

The status of the Orthodox church as the "prevailing religion" is largely based on the role the church played for the preservation of the Greek nation through the years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] but also for the role the church played in the [[Greek War of Independence]]. As a result, many{{Who|date=May 2010}} attribute to the modern Greek nation an [[ethnoreligious]] identity.

Furthermore, the mainstream Orthodox clergy's salaries and pensions are paid for by the State at rates comparable to those of teachers. All Greek students in primary and secondary schools in Greece attend Christian Orthodox instruction, although there is an exemption system for students who do not want to attend, as long as the exemption is requested by both parents. In addition, the Constitution prohibits [[proselytism]] from other religions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Armenian Church===
{{see also|Armenians in Greece}}
[[File:Armenian Church of Virgin Mary Salonica 1.jpg|thumb|180px|Armenian Church of Virgin Mary in [[Thessaloniki]].]]

The presence of [[Armenians]] in Greece dates back centuries (from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period), when Armenians settled in Thessalia, Macedonia, Thrace and the islands of Crete and Corfu for various reasons such as war or business.

The Armenians in Greece acquired the character of a community after the 1920s, when 70,000 to 80,000 survivors of the [[Armenian Genocide]] fled to Greece. Today, emigration to North America has diminished the Armenian population of Greece. The number now counts for roughly 20,000-35,000 Greco-Armenians.

The Jewish community in Greece currently amounts to roughly 7,500 people, concentrated mainly in [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Larissa]], [[Volos]], [[Chalkis]], [[Ioannina]], [[Trikala]] and [[Corfu]], while very few remain in [[Kavala]] and [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref name="KIS_number"&gt;[http://www.kis.gr/chr_olokautoma_english.pdf Short History Of The Jewish Communities In Greece] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926175738/http://www.kis.gr/chr_olokautoma_english.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} (pdf), publicized by the [http://www.kis.gr/home_en.html Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed largely of two groups, the [[Romaniotes]], Jewish communities dating back to [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], and the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardim]], who arrived from Spain and settled chiefly in Thessaloniki during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times.

==Islam==
{{Main|Islam in Greece|Greek Muslims}}
[[File:Xanthi Muslim elders - Eastern Macedonia &amp; Thrace.JPG|thumb|180px|Muslim elders in [[Xanthi]]]]

The number of Greek citizens followers of Islam is estimated to be at 97,604 people or 0.95% of the total population, according to the 1991 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/musmingr.htm Υπουργείο Εξωτερικών, Υπηρεσία Ενημέρωσης: Μουσουλμάνικη μειονότητα Θράκης] and [http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/musmingr.htm Ελληνική Επιτροπή για τη διαχείρηση των υδατικών πόρων: Στοιχεία από την πρόσφατη απογραφή του πληθυσμού]&lt;/ref&gt; They live mostly in Western Thrace and are [[Turkish language|turkish]], slavonic ([[Pomaks]]) and [[Romani language|romani]] (Gypsies) speakers.

==Sikhism==
{{main article|Sikhism in Greece}} 
Sikhs have been in Greece since the [[World Wars]], as part of the [[British Indian Army]]. [[Guru Nanak]] is also known to have passed through Greece during one of his journeys. However, actual immigration to Greece began in the 1970s. It reached its peak during the 1990s-2000s. As of 2017, [[Sikhs]] are estimated to number 20,000-25,000. There are eight [[Gurudwaras]] in [[Greece]], most of them based in [[Central Greece]] and only one being in [[Crete]]. [[Gurudwaras]] are often officially documented as personal properties, community centres or libraries, due to the paperwork needed and also due to the lack of recognition of Sikhs by the [[Greek Government]]. [[Sikhs]] often face racism and discrimination by the Greek public, who confuse them with [[Muslims]], as well as legal challenges, mostly due to the distinct appearance ([[The Five Ks]]). Sikhs are not allowed to wear their turbans and ride motorcycles without helmets, as in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where their contributions in the war efforts were recognized and they were allowed to not wear helmets. Young Sikhs often face difficulties when recruited for the mandatory [[conscription in greece|conscription]], due to their long hair, beard and turbans. Sikhism is still not an officially recognized in Greece and Sikhs are often not included in censuses. Media coverage of Sikhs is minimal and their religion is often reported as ''a mix of Hinduism and Islam'', while it has a separate belief system and many differences. Sikh [[Gurudwaras]] have faced numerous attacks, including gunshots and [[molotov cocktails]], all of which received no media coverage.  On March 1, 2006, the Greek government passed a law allowing cremation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71383.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006, Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; a move welcomed by both [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]]. Since the [[2008 economic crisis]] many Sikhs have migrated to other countries, many of whom being [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Canada]], and [[Germany]]

==Buddhism==
{{See also|Greco-Buddhism}}

The number of the followers is not so high amongst the Greeks but it has increased during the last decades because of the immigration of people from [[East Asia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Southeast Asia]] in Greece. Sri Lankan and Southeast Asian migrant workers working in Greece were usually sent back to their home country to be cremated, due to cremation being banned in Greece until 2006. Today there are three religious centers, in Athens, Thessaloniki and Corinth.

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism in Greece}}
{{See also|Indo-Greeks}}

Hinduism in Greece has a small following. There is a small [[Hindu]] community in Athens. There are 25 PIOs and 12 NRIs in the city. On March 1, 2006, the Greek government passed a law allowing cremation. The law was welcomed by the Indian community in Athens.

==Other faiths==
Other minor faiths in Greece include [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (who number about 28,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] and [[Scientologists]]. Groups that constitute less than 1 percent of the population includes [[Baha'i]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecclesia.gr/greek/holySynod/commitees/heresies/omades_christ.html H ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑ ΤΗΣ ΕΛΛΑΔΟΣ: Επιτροπές της Ιεράς Συνόδου - ΣΥΝΟΔΙΚΗ ΕΠΙΤΡΟΠΗ ΕΠΙ ΤΩΝ ΑΙΡΕΣΕΩΝ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">The '''religion of the yellow stick''' ({{lang-gd|'''Creideamh a’ bhata-bhuidhe'''}}) was a facetious name given to the forced "belief" of certain churchgoers who lived in the [[Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]]. Such actions, however, were not unique to the [[Hebrides]], but occurred in other parts of [[Scotland]].

A [[Coll]] [[priest]] of former times was accustomed to drive recalcitrant natives to [[Church service|church]] by a smart application of his [[walking stick]]; those who yielded were thus said to come under ''Creideamh a’ bhata-bhuidhe''.

Another version says that Hector ({{lang-gd|Eachann}}) the son of [[Lachlan Maclean, 6th Laird of Coll|Lachlan MacLean]] of Coll, was the one who applied the yellow stick{{disputed inline|for=Hector was only ever laird of Muck; Rùm remained with Lachlan (6th of Coll) until inherited by John (7th of Coll), Hector's brother|date=September 2017}}. Hector was [[laird]] of Muck in 1715, and the religion of the yellow stick was introduced into [[Rùm]] in 1726. Dr [[Samuel Johnson]], on his famous journey round the Hebrides (1775) encountered the story; in Rùm he said that there were 
 
:"fifty-eight families, who continued [[Papist]]s for some time after the Laird became a [[Protestant]]. Their adherence to their old religion was strengthened by the countenance of the Laird’s sister, a zealous Romanist, till one Sunday, as they were going to mass under the conduct of their patroness, MacLean met them on the way, gave one of them a blow on the head with a yellow stick, I suppose a cane, for which the [[Scottish Gaelic|Erse]] had no name &lt;nowiki&gt;[actually untrue]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and drove them to the [[kirk]], from which they have never since departed. Since the use of this method of conversion, the inhabitants of [[Eigg|Egg]] [sic] and [[Canna, Scotland|Canna]], who continue Papists, call the Protestantism of Rùm, the Religion of the Yellow Stick."

[[David Livingstone]], whose ancestors came from [[Ulva]] near the [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] and [[Staffa]], said:

:"Our ancestors were Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of the religion of the yellow stick".

The "yellow stick" in Livingstone's description may be a reference to the Bishop of Lismore's crozier or baculum, in Gaelic the "Bachuil Mor" or staff of [[Saint Moluag]], the patron saint of the [[Clan MacLea|Clan MacLea or Livingstone]].&lt;ref name="The Stewarts of Appin by John H.

}}{{italic title|all=yes|noerror}}'''''Saumur v Quebec (City of)''''' [1953] 2 S.C.R. 299 is a famous constitutional decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] which struck down a municipal by-law prohibiting the distribution of literature to the public.

Laurier Saumur (6 Feb. 1921 - 22 Mar. 2007) was born and raised Catholic, but grew disillusioned as a youth and studied the teachings of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. He was baptized as a Witness in 1944 and soon began to work as a door-to-door missionary for the Witnesses, first in [[Montreal]] and then in [[Quebec City]]. At the time, police harassment of Witnesses was widespread in Quebec, and Mr. Saumur had been arrested 103 times for distribution of Witness literature when he decided to challenge the legal basis for the arrests.

A group of [[Jehovah's Witness]]es, along with Saumur, challenged a [[Quebec City]] municipal by-law that prohibited the distribution of literature in the street without the proper authorization of the city's [[Chief of Police]] on the basis that it was outside of the municipality's jurisdiction and that it had the effect of religious and political censorship. The case reached the Supreme Court in 1953.

In a 5 to 4 decision, the Court held that the subject matter of the law was [[pith and substance|in relation to]] "speech" or "religion" which were both in the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government. The majority noted that the law had the effect that the chief of police would act in the role of a censor, deciding whether certain literature was objectionable. The result, they observed, would be that unpopular groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses would be censored.

The dissent focused on the purpose of the law, observing that it was intended to protect the public and keep the streets clean. They found no basis for Saumur's claim that it prevented the Jehovah's Witnesses from their religious practice.

This decision was subsequently used to dismiss more than 1000 cases against Witnesses in the Province of Quebec. It was one of a series of cases the Supreme Court dealt with concerning the rights of Jehovah's Witnesses under the [[Maurice Duplessis|Duplessis]] government of Quebec. Previous to this there was the case of ''[[R. v. Boucher]]'' [1951] S.C.R. 265 according to which mere criticism of the government does not constitute seditious libel. Subsequent to ''Saumur'' was the case of ''[[Roncarelli v. Duplessis]]'' [1959] S.C.R. 121 which punished Duplessis for revoking a Jehovah's Witness liquor license.

The [[Allmusic]] review awarded the album 5 stars, stating: "While continuing along in his tradition of savvy instrumental innovation, ''Shuffering and Shmiling'' plays out with the same intensity and voracious soloing that mark other great Africa 70 performances like ''[[Confusion (album)|Confusion]]'', ''[[Gentleman (Fela Kuti album)|Gentleman]]'', and ''[[No Agreement]]''; but the point of departure here is the outward remarks he makes on a touchy topic: religion."&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Samuelson, S., [http://www.allmusic.com/album/shuffering-shmiling-mw0000867925 Allmusic Review], accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sisters of the Society of Saint Pius X''' are a semi-contemplative order of [[religious sisters]] founded by [[Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]] on September 22, 1974. The [[motherhouse]] is located in [[Saint-Michel-en-Brenne]], [[France]], with additional houses in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]]. As of 2018, the current [[Superior General]] is Mother Maria Jean Bréant.

==History==
The Society of Sisters was guided in its initial formation by Archbishop Lefebvre, who was formerly Superior General of the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]], and his sister, Mother Marie Gabriel. For more than forty years, Mother Marie Gabriel had devoted herself to missionary work in [[Martinique]], the [[West Indies]] and Africa, in the Congregation of the Holy Ghost Sisters. She had spent much time on the African continent.&lt;ref name="Angelus1984"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelusonline.org/index.php?section=articles&amp;subsection=show_article&amp;article_id=954 |title=SISTERS OF THE SOCIETY OF ST. PIUS X |last=Mary Augustine|first=Sister |date=1984 |website=The Angelus Online |publisher=Angelus Press |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 1973, the first [[postulant]] for this new religious congregation, Janine Ward, arrived at [[Ecône]] from Australia.&lt;ref name="Angelus1984" /&gt;

In 1974, while recovering from an illness in Europe, Mother Marie Gabriel had a religious vision which was to point her in another direction. The signs became clearer: the crisis in the Church, the continual loss of faith and religious spirit in her own congregation, her weakened health, her brother's insistent appeal for aid in transmitting the religious life, all contributed to her decision to guide the fledgling congregation of the Sisters of the Society.

The first novitiate was installed in [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], near [[Rome]]. There Janine's postulancy continued under Mother Marie Gabriel's guidance until her reception of the [[Religious habit|habit]] on September 22, 1974, the true founding of the new [[religious institute]].&lt;ref name="Angelus1984" /&gt; Two years later, September 29, 1976, the first profession was held. The congregation counted twelve [[novices]] and eight postulants in the chapel during this ceremony.

In May, 1984, Sister Mary Jude, an American sister who spent almost two years at [[St. Mary's College (Kansas)|St. Mary's College]] in Kansas (from 1981 to 1983), became the new Superior General of the Sisters. There were thirty-four professed sisters in eight houses and four different countries at this time.&lt;ref name="Angelus1984" /&gt;

The third Superior was Mother Marie-Augustin de Poulpiquet, who from 2006–2018 had been the head of the sisterhood for two terms of office.

On Monday, April 9, 2018, the [[:wikt:capitular|capitulars]] elected Sister Maria Jean Bréant, the former mistress of novices of the Order, the fourth Superior General. Her term of office is six years. Thus far, Sr. Maria Jean worked at the novitiate Notre-Dame de Compassion in [[Ruffec, Indre|Ruffec]].

[[File:St Annes Well St Annes Park Dublin.JPG|thumb|St. Ann's Well]]

'''St. Ann's Well''' in [[Raheny]], [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was once a popular holy well, and gave its name (with a slightly different spelling) to the well-known [[St. Anne's Park]], the city's largest municipal park, home for many years to the [[Guinness family]].

==Location==
The well site has a protective hood of stones, and lies just beyond the old lake of the park, with its Roman temple, and below the Watchtower folly, near the main coastal entrance.

The well itself dried up in the 1950s, and although [[Dublin City Council]] made several attempts to relocate the source, it remains dry {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.  The site is still respected, and was visited in 2000 by a formal joint procession of worshippers from the Raheny parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Church of Ireland]].

Charles Linton had worked as a blacksmith, a clerk in Philadelphia, and later, a bookkeeper.  He became a "writing medium", creating writings purportedly by [[Daniel Webster]] and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=amkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA272 | title = Modern Spiritualism, a History and a Criticism | author1 = Podmore | first1 = Frank | year = 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CA1t8FzIV5QC&amp;pg=PT557 | title = The Ashgate Research Companion to Nineteenth-century Spiritualism and the Occult | isbn = 9781409456346 | author1 = Willburn | first1 = Sarah A |  date = 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=December 2013}} 
The main text is written by Charles Linton in the style of the King James Bible.  Beginning with the second edition, ''The Healing of the Nations'' includes an introduction and appendix by Gov. Tallmadge.

===Main text===
The text is formatted into chapter and verse, in fitting with its emulation of the King James Bible.   The text begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. God the Father reigneth. His are the heavens and the earth. His is space, and its nnmberless inhabitants are but fruits of his will. &lt;br/&gt; 2. All his creation enjoyeth each one its own perfected 
happiness. &lt;br/&gt; 3. He giveth joy unto all ; for he being the center of goodness, his effects are purely happy. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Introduction and Appendix by Gov. Tallmadge===
Tallmadge gives a biographical sketch of Charles Linton, and then describes personal witness to the work's creation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A large portion of the book has been written in my presence. I have, therefore, had the very best opportunity of judging of the manner of the writer. During the time I was with liim ho wrote from five to ten pages a day. He wrote rapidly whilst the influence was on him, and when it left he would cease writing, and generally not resume it till the next day. I have frequently interrupted him in the

Author David Linton listed ''The Healing of Nations'' as among the four most important books on religious subjects, observing: "The fact that an un-learned farmer's boy of Pennsylvania should have written so wonderful a book as the 'Healing of the Nations' is to me one of the most wonderful facts of this wonderful age."&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/cu31924084550064&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGQzAQAAMAAJ|title=Friends Intelligencer|date=1886-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  English researcher [[Frank Podmore]] opined that ''The Healing of Nations'' "represents inspirational writing at its best".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykXOAAAAMAAJ|title=Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism|last=Podmore|first=Frank|date=1902-01-01|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Therese Neumann''' (8 or 9 April 1898 &amp;ndash; 18 September 1962) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Christian mysticism|mystic]] and [[Stigmata|stigmatic]].

She was born in the village of [[Konnersreuth]] in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], where she lived all her life. She was born into a large family with little income. She was a member of the [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order of St. Francis]].

==Ailments==

On 10 March 1918, Therese Neumann was partially paralyzed after falling off a stool while attending to a fire in her uncle's barn.&lt;ref name="Vogl 2-8"&gt;Vogl, Albert. (1978). ''Life and Death of Therese Neumann, Mystic and Stigmatist''. Vantage Press. pp. 2-8. {{ISBN|0-533-03379-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sustained more falls and injuries during this period. After one particular fall she claimed to have lost much of her eyesight, and in 1919 she claimed to have been [[blindness|blinded]] completely. Bedridden, she reportedly developed horrible [[bed sores]] that sometimes exposed bone.&lt;ref name="Vogl 2-8"/&gt;

Therese reported that her eyesight was restored on 29 April 1923—the day [[Thérèse of Lisieux|Therese of Lisieux]] was [[beatification|beatified]] in [[Rome]]. Therese Neumann had been praying [[novena]]s in advance of this day.&lt;ref name="Vogl 2-8"/&gt; On 17 May 1925 Therese of Lisieux was fully [[canonization|canonized]] as a saint in the [[Catholic Church]]. Therese Neumann said the saint called to her and then cured her of her paralysis and bed sores.&lt;ref name="Vogl 2-8"/&gt;

On 7 November 1925 Neumann took to her bed again, and on 13 November claimed to have been diagnosed with [[appendicitis]]. According to her account, while prepared for surgery she [[convulsion|convulsed]] violently and stared at the ceiling finally saying, "Yes." She asked her family to take her to the church to pray immediately. She then announced that she had been cured of all traces of appendicitis.&lt;ref name="Vogl 2-8"/&gt;

Physicians and skeptics have disputed Neumann's claims of miraculous cures.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. [[Prometheus Books]]. pp. 227-228. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] on one occasion Neumann claimed to have healed herself from blindness, but whilst "blind" she was examined and her pupils responded normally to light. Nickell suspected that Neumann's claims were performed by "hysterical [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondria]]" or "outright fakery".&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt;

==Stigmata==
{{Christian Mysticism}}
{{Wikisource|Autobiography of a Yogi/Chapter 39|Therese Neumann, The Catholic Stigmatist of Bavaria}}
Therese would later apparently develop the [[stigmata]]. She said that on 5 March 1926, the first Friday of [[Lent]], a wound had appeared slightly above her heart, but that she had kept this secret. However, she did report a vision of Jesus at [[Mount of Olives]] with three [[Apostles]].&lt;ref name="Vogl 2-8"/&gt;

On 12 March, she said she had another vision of Christ at Mt. Olivet, along with the [[crown of thorns|crowning of thorns]]. She also claimed that the wound above her heart reappeared on this day, and she spoke to her sister about it. She claimed the wound also reappeared on Friday of the following week. By 26 March, she was claiming the same wound accompanied by a vision of Christ bearing the cross and a similar wound on her left hand. Blood was observed on her clothing, and she no longer attempted to keep the information to herself.

On Good Friday, Neumann, according to her own testimony witnessed the entire [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] in her visions. She displayed wounds on her hands and feet accompanied by blood apparently coming from her eyes. Blood poured from the wounds, however - according to Josef Hanauer's book ''The Swindle of Konnersreuth'' - onlookers did not actually see the bleeding in action, only the blood itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hanauer, Josef, ''The Swindle of Konnersreuth, A Never-Ending Scandal''. [http://www.indian-skeptic.org/html/hanauer/swindle-of-konnersreuth-contents.html Online text], webpage found 2007-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Easter Sunday, she claimed a vision of the [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection of Christ]]. For several consecutive Fridays after that, she stated she was experiencing the [[Passion of Christ]], apparently suffering in her own body along with all his historic agonies. She claimed to have especially suffered the Passion on Good Friday each year.

On 22–23 March 1928 Neumann's stigmata claims were investigated at her home by a group of observers including bishops and physicians.&lt;ref name="Wilson 51-53"&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1988). ''The Bleeding Mind: An Investigation into the Mysterious Phenomena of Stigmata''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. pp. 51-53. {{ISBN|0-297-79099-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Martini the director of the [[University Hospital Bonn]] observed Neumann and wrote a report about her stigmata. He found her behaviour suspicious as the blood would only appear from her wounds when he was asked to leave the room.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt; According to Martini:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that two or three times the observers were made to go out just at the moment when a fresh effusion of blood evidently came to cover the wounds arouses the suspicion, on the contrary, that during this time something happened which needed to be hidden from observation. It was for the same reason that I disliked her frequent manipulations behind the raised coverings."&lt;ref name="Wilson 51-53"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A psychoanalytic study of Neumann has suggested that her stigmata resulted from [[post-traumatic stress]] symptoms expressed in unconscious self-mutilation through abnormal autosuggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Inedia==
From 1923 until her death in 1962, Therese Neumann professed to have consumed no food other than [[Eucharist|The Holy Eucharist]], nor to have drunk any water from 1926 until her death.&lt;ref&gt;''Vogl'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montague Summers]] in his book ''The Physical Phenomena of Mysticism'' speaks of her supposedly supernatural ability to survive for long periods without food or water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montague Summers|Summers, Montague]]. (1950). ''The Physical Phenomena Of Mysticism''. Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc. p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1927, Neumann's claims of inedia were examined at her house. She was physically examined and tested by the physician Otto Seidl and four [[Franciscan]] nurses, for fifteen days (July 14 to 28). Neumann was not observed to have eaten anything, however, suspicion was generated. At the beginning she had weighed 121 pounds which dropped during the test period to 112.5 pounds. By the last day her weight had returned to normal. Historian [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] commented the evidence indicated that Neumann "went back to normal food and drink intake". The test was never repeated and her family denied permission for any further tests.&lt;ref name="Wilson 114-115"&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1988). ''The Bleeding Mind: An Investigation into the Mysterious Phenomena of Stigmata''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. pp. 114-115. {{ISBN|0-297-79099-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson found the inedia claims of Neumann suspicious. He noted that she "had a vigorous, stocky build throughout most of this time, and all reason tells us that it would be impossible to survive so long without food or drink."&lt;ref name="Wilson 114-115"/&gt;

Otto Seidl who wrote a report in 1928, described Neumann as a [[Hysteria|hysteric]]. A recent medical paper that examined Seidl's report commented that "while under surveillance by four nuns for 14 days, Neumann exhibited no intake of nourishment; weight measurements and urine tests however suggest[ed] the opposite.... As far as medical records go, Therese Neumann's is one of a series of surprisingly similar cases of stigmata development, conversion disorder, and alleged absence of nutrition. In nosological terms, these would be classified today as dissociative disorders."&lt;ref&gt;Seidl, O. (2008). ''Stigmatisation and Absence of Nutrition in the Case of Therese Neumann (1898-1962)''. Nervenarzt 79 (7): 836-843.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Donovan Rawcliffe]] disputed Neumann's inedia claims and suggested she was a "deliberate fraud aided and abetted by her father."&lt;ref&gt;[[Donovan Rawcliffe|Rawcliffe, Donovan]]. (1988). ''Occult and Supernatural Phenomena''. Dover Publications. p. 245. {{ISBN|0-486-25551-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
[[File:Grabstaette-T-N.jpg|thumb|Neumann's headstone]]
It was claimed that during some of her Friday trances, she would utter phrases identified by witnesses as ancient [[Aramaic]]. She was also said to have been able to understand [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vogl'', pp. 48,49&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Third Reich]], Therese Neumann was the target of ridicule and defamation, as the Nazis knew about her dissenting views and feared her growing popularity. She was observed by the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ibid., pp. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; She was never physically harmed, though her family home, parish church and priest's house all received direct attacks.  She encouraged [[Fritz Gerlich]] to continue his opposition to [[Hitler]] and his [[NSDAP|national-socialist party]].  Gerlich was subsequently killed for his opposition.

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]] visited her and wrote about her case in his book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', published in 1946. He wrote an entire chapter, [[s:Autobiography of a Yogi/Chapter 39|Therese Neumann, The Catholic Stigmatist of Bavaria]], which reverently gives a vivid first-hand description of one of her Friday Passion trances.&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi, P. Yogananda, copyright 1946 P. Yogananda, 13th ed., 1998, Library of Congress, {{ISBN|0-87612-079-6}}, ch. 39, pp. 418-428&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhard Lorenz from [[Meißen]] (R.L.M.), a medium from the [[Neu-Salems-Gesellschaft|New Salems Society]], received a message about Neumann in 1929, allegedly coming from God the Father. It was published in "Das Wort", the periodical of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;New Salems Society, Das Wort, 1929, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 1962, Therese Neumann died from [[cardiac arrest]], after having suffered from [[angina pectoris]] for some time.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has neither confirmed nor denied the [[inedia]] (from which she suffered according to her critics), nor her stigmata. The "Resl", as she is colloquially known, nonetheless attained a place in [[popular piety]] &amp;mdash; a petition asking for her [[beatification]] was signed by 40,000 people. In 2005, [[Gerhard Ludwig Müller]], [[Bishop of Regensburg]], formally opened the Vatican proceedings for her beatification.

A '''toadman''' or '''toad-man''' is someone, in the [[folklore]] of [[The Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] and [[Lincolnshire]], who has made a deal with the devil which gives them control over horses. Stories of toadmen seem to have been prevalent in the region during the inter-war period of 1918 to 1938.&lt;ref name="MC01"&gt;{{Citation | last = Codd | first = Daniel | chapter = Supernatural Evil: Necromancers, Wisemen and Toad-men | date = | editor-last = | editor-first = | title = Mysterious Cambridgeshire | volume = | publisher = JMD Media | publication-date = 2010 | isbn = 9781859838082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CFT01"&gt;{{Citation | last = James | first = Maureen | chapter = Of the Fens and Farming: Elijah's Ghost (A Tale of a Toadman) | date = | editor-last = | editor-first = | title = Cambridgeshire Folk Tales | volume = | publisher = History Press | publication-date = 2014 | isbn = 9780752466286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiation ceremony, with certain regional variations, involved the initiate catching a male toad, hanging it from a thorn bush or pegging it to an anthill until its bones had been picked clean, and then carrying the bones on their person until dried. The bones were then thrown into a running stream on a full moon at midnight and all except one would be swept downstream. The remaining small fork-shaped bone when recovered would, through unspecified means, grant its holder psychic control over horses.&lt;ref name="MC01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CFT01" /&gt;
