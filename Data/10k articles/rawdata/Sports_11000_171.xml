The '''1974 British [[Commonwealth Games]]''' were held in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand from 24 January to 2 February 1974. The bid vote was held in Edinburgh at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games. The Games were officially named "the friendly games". There were 1,276 competitors and 372 officials, according to the official history, and public attendance was excellent. The main venue was the [[Queen Elizabeth II Park|QEII Park]], purpose built for this event. The Athletics Stadium and fully covered Olympic standard pool, diving tank, and practice pools were all on the one site. The [[Theme music|theme song]] was "[[Join Together (Steve Allen song)|Join Together]]", sung by [[Steve Allen (singer)|Steve Allen]]. QEII Park was severely damaged beyond repair by the devastating earthquake that destroyed parts of the city on [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|22 February 2011]]. The Games were held after the [[1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games]] in [[Dunedin]] for wheelchair athletes.

==Security==
The Games were the first large international athletic event after the [[Munich massacre|murder of Israeli athletes]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Munich Olympics]]. The Athletes Village, the Student accommodation of the [[University of Canterbury]], was temporarily fenced in and guarded for the duration of the games. Only official vehicles and persons were allowed into sensitive areas around the venues.

==Logo==
The logo was the second (after [[1970 British Commonwealth Games|Edinburgh]]) to be protected and trademarked,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iponz.govt.nz/cms/trade-marks/practice-guidelines-index/practice-guidelines/04-absolute-grounds-general-2/3-contrary-to-law/3-1-use-that-is-contrary-to-new-zealand-law/3-1-4-the-commonwealth-games-symbol-protection-act-1974 Commonwealth games symbol protection act 1974]&lt;/ref&gt; and set a design benchmark which was echoed in the logos of the next five games.

In recent years the logo has been regarded as one of New Zealand's iconic symbols, being reproduced on clothing and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ferrit.co.nz/11611775.html Ferrit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.zeald.com/mrvintage/shop/New/%20New%20Mens/NZZN%201974%20logo%20mens%20powder%20blue%20t-shirt?mv_pc=14508 Zeald.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
The Games were also an important milestone in New Zealand television, marking the introduction of [[colour television]]. However, due to the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation|NZBC]]'s limited colour facilities, only athletics, swimming, and [[boxing]] could be broadcast in colour.

Meanwhile, paralleling the Television coverage, the [[National Film Unit]] produced [[Games '74]], a fine feature-length documentary of the Christchurch games (and the many events) in full colour. This has since been restored and is available on DVD.

==Royal family==
The Games were the last time that the entire immediate [[British Royal Family]] ([[Elizabeth II]], her husband and children) visited New Zealand as a group. The Royal Yacht ''[[HMY Britannia|Britannia]]'' was the royal residence during the games.

==Opening ceremony==
The opening ceremony was held in the mid afternoon, with [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] as the attending royal. A fanfare announced the [[guard of honour]] by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]]s, inspected by Prince Philip. This was followed by the raising of flags of the past, present, and future hosts. [[God Save the Queen]] was sung. The field was then invaded by 2500 school children in red, white and blue rain slicks all forming in the centre to create the NZ74 symbol. A [[Māori people|Māori]] concert group then performed action songs and a [[haka]], before the teams march past. The athletes then took the oath and [[Sylvia Potts]], the runner who fell mere meters from a gold medal finish in the [[1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970 Games]], entered the stadium with the Queen's Baton. It was presented to Prince Philip who read the message from the Queen declaring the 1974 Christchurch 10th British Commonwealth Games open. The [[Commonwealth flag]] was then marched in and hauled up with a [[21 gun salute]].

==Precedents set==
While the opening ceremony was a regimented and very formal affair, the late afternoon closing ceremony was anything but.  
This set a precedent for other closing ceremonies since then. With the formalities out of the way, the handing over of the flag to representatives of [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada, the athletes broke ranks and ran amok, much to the delight of the packed stadium and the Queen herself. A flypast of the then [[Red Checkers]] [[RNZAF]] display team brought the ceremony to a close as the Queen and Prince Philip did a lap of honour around the stadium and departed.

The youngest competitor at the games was New Zealander [[Rebecca Perrott]], 12½; swimming for Fiji at the games, as her father was Registrar at the [[University of the South Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wellington's swim queen'' in "The Wellingtonian", 21 March 2013 p12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic legacy aspects==

Christchurch was (and still is) the smallest city to host the modern televised Commonwealth Games.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This was the first games that tried using the "Olympic" look with a standard colour scheme for facilities, passes, flags, stationery, and above all uniforms (which wearers only borrowed, but could buy outright as a memento thus helping keep costs down).

Its striking NZ74 design logo is now a well used (sometimes illegally) symbol of New Zealand as a nation and Christchurch as a city. It is still copyright owned by Christchurch City Council but is allowed for free use unless for commercial gain. Badges, lapels, stationery and postcards are still in re-manufactured circulation.

This was also the first time that a city had asked the Games Federation to allow commercial advertising. This was voted down as the Federation feared that advertising by big corporations would remove focus away from the amateur ethos of the Games. As no commercial hoardings were allowed, Christchurch got around this with the use of "sponsorship", one example being [[Holden New Zealand|General Motors]] providing a lease fleet of [[Holden HQ]] Kingswood sedans that would be sold off after the games. The cars are now sought after by private and museum collectors and have depreciated little in value.
[[Air New Zealand]] allowed large NZ74 symbols to be placed on the fuselage sides of the airline's brand new [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]s, giving free advertising around the world. This in itself set a trend since with airlines vying to be "official airline" of a particular event.

Although the Games themselves were a success, making a then sizable profit of $500,000, the "sponsorship" was nowhere near enough. The City of Christchurch was left with a financial facilities management debt (QEII Park) of what would be in today's (2016) amount of NZ$120 million. This deterred the city from hosting major events until 1990 when the government stepped in with lotteries funding to clear the remaining debt. By then, [[1990 Commonwealth Games|Auckland's 1990 games]] had been fully commercialized.

'''Queen Elizabeth II Park'''
The most visible facility left behind by the 1974 Commonwealth Games was the purpose built stadium and swimming complex. For a few years after, the stadium was a popular destination for sports and leisure patrons who were well indulged in first class facilities. However the costs of maintaining the complex grew over time and soon other additions included hydro-slides and fun park outside on the large grassed area that was once the race course. Christchurch City Council, the owner of the complex continued to develop the ground and for five years from 1990, allowed the Canterbury Greyhound Club to run a track on the inner oval. The main swimming pool was adapted so it could be decked over for Basketball and Netball. Football and Rugby League returned to the stadium in 1995 on a more permanent basis and a minor refurbishment of the track saw athletics events become a main summer event again. Early plans for a hosting of the 2022 Commonwealth Games were in hand when the [[2010 Canterbury Earthquake|September 2010 earthquake]] of around 7.1 hit near Christchurch and damaged the facility. Assessors immediately reported that the damage was repairable and could be covered by insurance. The swimming pools were drained to await repair when the more devastating [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|22 February 2011 earthquake]] struck Christchurch, damaging the entire facility, already weakened, beyond economic repair.  After laying abandoned for three years, the stadium was demolished and by 2016 the ground stabilized in preparation of more economical facilities and a connecting high school.

'''Future 2026/2030 Bids proposals'''
As a rebuilding legacy, there have been calls for Christchurch to bid for the new style Commonwealth Games that allow a core central city to host a more nationwide event. This has been seen as a more economical format for smaller cities, and countries to host what had become an expensive event for a singular city to host.

==Broadcasting==
The Grand Final was broadcast live throughout Australia on [[Fox Sports Australia|Fox Sports]] and [[Network Ten]].&lt;ref name="a-league1"&gt;{{cite web|title=New TV deal for Football|url=http://www.a-league.com.au/article/new-tv-deal-for-football/6phf6g6mrfew1m28c535u1f42|website=Hyundai A-League|publisher=Football Federation Australia|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
Kosta Barbarouses's 9th-minute goal was the fastest ever goal scored in an A-League Grand Final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-League grand final: Melbourne Victory beat Newcastle Jets 1-0 to win fourth championship|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-05/melbourne-victory-beat-newcastle-jets-in-a-league-grand-final/9730796|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kosta Barbarouses's 9th-minute goal was the equal 3rd fastest goal ever scored in any previous National Soccer League Grand Final &amp; A-League Grand Final history behind John Anastasiadis in 1998 for [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] against Carlton at Olympic Park, [[Mile Sterjovski]] in 1999 for [[Sydney United]] against South Melbourne at Olympic Park, and Mark Koussas in 1984 for [[Sydney Olympic]] against South Melbourne at Olympic Park. 

Melbourne Victory became the first ever team to qualify for the A-League Grand Final from outside the top 3. With their win, the Victory became the first team in A-League history to win 4 championships, and the first team in A-League history to win the Championship from outside the top 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosengarten|first1=Jake|title=Melbourne Victory’s grand final win sees Melbourne City without an Asian Champions League spot|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/melbourne-victorys-grand-final-win-sees-melbourne-city-without-an-asian-champions-league-spot/news-story/a23dc5a6ea68feb53e323399d620ab1b?nk=1b3914e74327f5543c04f2ede1cf8774-1525604965|website=Fox Sports Australia|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melbourne Victory also became the first team to win the championship from outside the top 2 positions after regular season since Adelaide City won the 1994 NSL Grand Final from 5th spot on the ladder and Melbourne Victory are only just the 9th team in history to win an away from home Grand Final in 34-year history of season deciders in NSL &amp; A-League history and were just only the 7th team in history to win the NSL Grand Final &amp; A-League Grand Final from outside the top 2 positions after regular season.

Melbourne Victory equal the record for most NSL &amp; A-League championships on four titles along with Hakoah Sydney City (1977, 1980, 1981, 1982), Marconi Stallions (1979, 1988, 1989, 1993), and South Melbourne (1984, 1991, 1998, 1999).

The crowd of 29,410 was Newcastle's biggest ever home attendance.

==Video assistant referee (VAR) controversy==
Kosta Barbarouses's goal in the 9th minute of the game came about via a header from [[James Donachie]], however Donachie was [[Offside (association football)|offside]] when [[Leroy George]] took the free kick which Donachie passed to Barbarouses. The game's [[video assistant referee]] (VAR) system failed to detect Donachie's offside position as its video feed had failed in the thirty seconds leading up to the goal, although the issue was apparent from the [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] broadcast footage. By the time the system was restored, the game had resumed, meaning the decision to allow the goal stood. The [[Football Federation Australia]] acknowledged the technical issues, and the frustration of Newcastle's team and fans.&lt;ref name="var"&gt;{{cite news|title=Major VAR glitch behind offside goal standing in A-League decider|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-06/ffa-reveal-reasons-behind-var-controversy-a-league-grand-final/9732640|accessdate=11 May 2018|work=ABC News|date=6 May 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arena MK''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Milton Keynes]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]] and is located beside [[Stadium MK]]. The {{convert|3420|sqm|sqft}} multi-use event space is positioned over three floors and anticipates music and sporting events, conferences and exhibitions and parties.&lt;ref name="fionao'hara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkdons.com/news/article/arena-stadiummk-opens-its-doors-1362921.aspx|title=arena: stadiummk opens its doors|author=Fiona O'Hara|work=Milton Keynes Dons Football Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arena MK was to be the home of the [[Milton Keynes Lions]] professional [[basketball]] team.  However, the retail developments that would have provided enabling funding were deferred due to lack of financing, leaving the Lions without a home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/sport/Winkelman-can39t-guarantee-arena.4735321.jp Winkelman can't guarantee arena!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108054055/http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/sport/Winkelman-can39t-guarantee-arena.4735321.jp |date=8 January 2009 }} – MK Citizen 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conclusion of the 2011–12 season, the Lions could not secure a venue within Milton Keynes, resulting in a move south to the [[Copper Box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/sport/other-sport/revealed-lions-to-leave-milton-keynes-for-olympic-park-in-london-1-4140859 | title=Lions to leave Milton Keynes | publisher=MK Citizen | date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBVA Compass Stadium''' is an American [[multi-purpose stadium]] located in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] that is home to the [[Houston Dynamo]], a [[Major League Soccer]] club, the [[Houston Dash]] of the [[National Women's Soccer League]], and to [[Texas Southern Tigers football]]. The stadium is the result of combined commitments of $35.5 million from the city of Houston and $60 million from the Houston Dynamo. Harris County agreed to pay for half of the land in exchange for the ability to jointly own the stadium after its completion date in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Council Approves Deal for New Dynamo Stadium|first=Bradley|last=Olson|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/facebook/6947815.html|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBVA Compass, a subsidiary of [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria]], is the stadium's sponsor company.

The stadium is located on a tract of land bordered by Texas, Walker, Emancipation, and Hutchins in [[East Downtown, Houston|East Downtown]] and east of [[Interstate 69 in Texas|Interstate 69]]/[[U.S. Route 59 (Texas)|U.S. Route 59]] and Downtown Houston.&lt;ref name= "Council approves deal for new Dynamo stadium"&gt;{{cite news |title=Council Approves Deal for New Dynamo Stadium|first=Bradley|last=Olsen|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/facebook/6947815.html|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eadomap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eadohouston.com/index.html|title=Welcome to EaDo|publisher=East Downtown Management District|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction history: 2009–2011==
 [[File:Houstondynamostadiumconstruction2011423.JPG|thumb|left|''Construction site for the stadium'']]
In June 2009, negotiations and financing began to fall into place with construction of the stadium originally beginning as early as Fall 2009. Banks and investors were in the books to finance the project and only minor details were being worked out.&lt;ref name="houston.bizjournals.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dynamo Stadium Deal Gets Closer to Goal|author=Barr, Greg|url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2009/06/22/story4.html|date=June 19, 2009|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Houston Business Journal]]|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Various locations the Dynamo were interested in building a stadium since their arrival were the former [[Six Flags AstroWorld|Astroworld]] site, [[Pearland, Texas|Pearland]], [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], and Northeast Houston near the [[Lake Houston]] area.&lt;ref name="houston.bizjournals.com"/&gt;

On January 26, 2010, the Houston Dynamo franchise had expressed an interest in a proposed {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel for the stadium location at South Rice Avenue and Westpark Drive—adjacent to [[Bellaire, Texas|Bellaire]]'s city limits, and near the southwest corner of the [[Interstate 69]]/[[U.S. Highway 59]] and the [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]] interchange.&lt;ref name="KTRK-TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7240711|title=Dynamo looking at stadium site near Galleria|author=Shay, Miya|date=January 26, 2010|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the [[Mayor]] of [[Bellaire, Texas|Bellaire]], Cindy Seigel said that she would use whatever power she could to oppose the possible new location and is in communication with the developer to dissuade him. She acknowledges that considering that the land is in Houston's city limits and only abuts her city, the odds are slim and said in an open letter to Midway:&lt;blockquote&gt;

Fans on the north and east side of Houston will have difficulty in getting to this site. Additionally, this site does not have the infrastructure in place to serve it that already exists at other athletic facilities [[Downtown Houston|downtown]] or at [[Reliant Park]].&lt;ref name="Bellaire mayor challenges Dynamo stadium plan; others on board"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcnonline.com/articles/2010/01/28/memorial_examiner/news/me_dynamo_stadium.txt|title=Bellaire mayor challenges Dynamo stadium plan|author=Auilar, Charlotte|date=January 28, 2010|work=Memorial Examiner|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The highly populated and heavily Hispanic area of [[Gulfton, Texas|Gulfton]] is within proximity, although former Council member Pam Holm stated that ethnic considerations should not be key to choosing a stadium location: "To position this as a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] sport and say the stadium has to be in proximity to Hispanic neighborhoods doesn’t do it justice, the Dynamo is something that all citizens of Houston have so embraced."&lt;ref name="Who knew?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcnonline.com/articles/2010/01/28/west_university_examiner/news/wu_stadium_reax.txt|title=Who knew? Dynamo private stadium deal was privileged info|author=Aguilar, Charlotte|date=January 28, 2010|work=West University Examiner|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2010, The Houston City Council unanimously approved an agreement Wednesday that is expected to pave the way for a new stadium for the Houston Dynamo and the Texas Southern University football team, which is expected to be on a tract of land bordered by Texas, Walker, Dowling and Hutchins in [[East Downtown, Houston|East Downtown]] and east of [[Interstate 69]]/[[U.S. Route 59]] and Downtown Houston.&lt;ref name="Council approves deal for new Dynamo stadium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eadomap"/&gt; On April 13, 2010, Harris County commissioners voted unanimously to begin construction of the new Dynamo stadium east of downtown,&lt;ref name= "Country approves Dynamo stadium deal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7382710|title=County approves Dynamo stadium deal}}&lt;/ref&gt; clearing the way for construction sometime in February 2011.

[[Oliver Luck]], at the time President and General Manager of the Dynamo, announced the financing, architect, and project manager for the new stadium. He announced [[Populous (company)|Populous]] had been chosen to design and build the stadium. Populous, one of the world's leading sports architecture firms, had previously built three other major venues in the city—[[Minute Maid Park]], [[Reliant Stadium]], and the [[Toyota Center (Houston)|Toyota Center]],&lt;ref name="myfoxhouston.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/dpp/sports/local/100504-dynamo-choose-stadium-architect%2C-project-manager|title=Dynamo Choose Stadium Architect, Project Manager}}&lt;/ref&gt; and internationally designed soccer stadia including [[Wembley Stadium]] (London), [[Emirates Stadium]] (London), [[Soccer City]] (Johannesburg), and [[Aviva Stadium]] (Dublin).

On February 5, 2011, the Houston Dynamo, led by Houston mayor [[Annise Parker]] and [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] Judge [[Ed Emmett]], broke ground on the Houston Dynamo Stadium site. Houston Dynamo President Chris Canetti strongly expressed that the stadium will be ready by April 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamo break gound on new East End stadium"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dynamo Break Ground on New East End Stadium|first=Jose|last=De Jesus Ortiz|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/soc/7414868.html|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=February 5, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ceremonial first pitch''' is a longstanding ritual of [[baseball]] in which a guest of honor throws a ball to mark the end of pregame festivities and the start of the game. Originally, the guest threw a ball from his/her place in the grandstand to the pitcher or catcher of the home team, but the ritual changed after President [[Ronald Reagan]] threw the first pitch on the field at an unscheduled appearance at a [[Baltimore Orioles]] game. Now, the guest stands in front of the [[pitcher's mound]] and throws towards [[home plate]]. He or she may also sometimes stand on the mound (as a pitcher would). The recipient of the pitch is usually a player from the home team.

The ceremonial thrower may be a notable person (dignitary, celebrity, former player, etc.) who is in attendance, an executive from a company that sponsors the team (especially when that company has sponsored that night's promotional giveaway), or a person who won the first pitch opportunity as a contest prize. Often, especially in the [[minor league]]s, multiple first pitches are made.

The practice of having a mayor, governor, or other local celebrity throw out ceremonial "first pitches" dates back to at least 1890.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter Jensen|title=President Taft, Governor McKinley and the "Lucky Seventh" Inning – the History and Origins of the Ceremonial "First Pitch" and the "Seventh Inning Stretch"|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2016/09/president-taft-governor-mckinley-and.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History Blog|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio Governor (and future U.S. president) [[William McKinley]], for example, "threw the ball into the diamond" before an opening day game between Toledo and Columbus in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Governor McKinley Started It|work=Omaha Daily Bee|date=April 17, 1892|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/1892-04-17/ed-1/seq-1/| page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, [[2012 Texas Rangers season|2012]], the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] executed a unique twist on the first pitch tradition. Before the Rangers' home game against the [[2012 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], the team held an official retirement ceremony for longtime catcher [[Iván Rodríguez]]. Instead of going to the pitcher's mound, he went behind home plate and threw the first "pitch" to longtime teammate [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], who was standing at second base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/dallas/mlb/story/_/id/7846559/ivan-rodriguez-retires-honored-texas-rangers |title=Ivan Rodriguez announces retirement |first=Richard |last=Durrett |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential first pitches==
Former Japanese Prime Minister [[Ōkuma Shigenobu]] threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the first game of an American All-Star team's tour of Japan in 1908, making him possibly the first former chief executive of any country to throw out a first pitch.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Herald|date=November 23, 1908|page= 6|title=American Baseball Team is Victorious|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19081123.2.73.15&amp;dliv=none&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[William Howard Taft]] started the American tradition of Presidential first pitches in [[1910 in baseball|1910]] at [[Griffith Stadium]], Washington, D.C., on the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]]' [[Opening Day]].  Every President from Taft to Obama has thrown out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch, either for Opening Day, the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], or the [[World Series]], usually with much fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Duggan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/01/AR2007040101262.html |title=Balking at the First Pitch |work=[[Washington Post]] |page=A01 |date=April 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current President, [[Donald Trump]], has yet to throw a ceremonial first pitch, though has done so for Minor League games prior to taking office.

The Reverend '''Charles Powlett''' (1728, England &amp;ndash; 29 January 1809, [[Marylebone]], London) was a noted [[patronage|patron]] of English [[cricket]] who has been described as the mainstay, if not the actual founder, of the [[Hambledon Club]].&lt;ref name="AC155"&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Powlett held an important position in the administration of cricket and was a member of the committee which revised and codified the [[Laws of Cricket]] in 1774.&lt;ref name="AC155"/&gt;

Powlett (sometimes spelled Paulet) was the eldest son, born illegitimately, of [[Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton]] and [[Lavinia Fenton]], who were not married until 1751 when he was 23.  Powlett was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he graduated as MA in 1755.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PWLT753C|name=Powlett, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having been ordained, he was Curate of [[Itchen Abbas]] from 1763 to 1792; and Rector of [[St Martin-by-Looe]] in Cornwall from 1785 to 1790.&lt;ref name="AC155"/&gt;

Powlett acted as a Steward at Hambledon, was "the life and soul of the club for many years" and "when the end came, was the last to abandon the sinking ship".&lt;ref&gt;Altham, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being ordained and a Steward of the club and a member of the Laws of Cricket committee, Powlett was not above gambling on the outcome of matches or of betting against his own team.  In 1775, when Hambledon/[[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] hosted [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] on [[Broadhalfpenny Down]], the match situation at one point of the Hampshire second innings was such that a Surrey victory seemed certain.  Powlett and his associate [[Philip Dehany]], another Hambledon member, decided to bet heavily on Surrey to win.  But then [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] was joined at the wicket by his captain [[Richard Nyren]] and the two put on a massive century partnership which turned the game around.  Nyren was out for 98 and Small went on to make 136, which is the earliest known [[century (cricket)|century]] in the history of [[first-class cricket]].  Surrey then collapsed and Hampshire won a famous victory.  When Nyren was out, he was confronted by Powlett and Dehaney who complained that he and Small had cost them their money.  Nyren, disgusted with them, retorted: "Another time, don't bet your money against such men as we are".&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIA Formula 3 Championship''' is an upcoming third-tier [[Open wheel car|single-seater racing]] championship based in the International and organised by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA). The championship will launch in 2019 as a feeder series for the [[FIA Formula 1 World Championship]] and [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]]s. It will be a result of a merger between two existing third-tier [[Open wheel car|single-seater racing]] championships, the [[GP3 Series]] and the [[FIA Formula 3 European Championship]] as it was announced on 10 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GP3 and European Formula 3 could merge as F1 support series in 2019|url=https://www.autosport.com/gp3/news/128490/gp3-and-european-f3-could-merge-in-2019|last=Simmons|first=Marcus|publisher=Autosport.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Motor Sport Council Confirms New Formula 3 Category For 2019|url=https://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2017/09/world-motor-sport-council-confirms-new-formula-3-category-2019/|last=Hewitt|first=Chloe|publisher=thecheckeredflag.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The championship is part of the [[FIA Global Pathway]] consolidation project plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formula 1 to promote the FIA Formula 3 Championship|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2018/3/formula-1-to-promote-the-fia-formula-3-championship.html|publisher=formula1.com|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its predecessor, the Formula 3 European Championship, the series will exclusively run in support of Formula 1 races.

==The car==
The FIA Formula 3 Championship car is used by all of the teams, and features a Dallara carbon-fiber monocoque chassis powered by a Mecachrome [[naturally-aspirated]] [[direct fuel injection|direct-injected]] [[V6 engine]] and [[Pirelli]] dry slick and rain treaded tyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New International F3 car set to use GP3 engine|url=https://www.motorsport.com/gp3/news/new-f3-set-to-use-gp3-engine-1056121/|publisher=Motorsport.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Chassis===
The F3 Championship will use 2019 specification [[Dallara F3 2019|F3 2019]] car which has been designed by Dallara Automobili. The new FIA Formula 3 Championship chassis material is Carbon/aluminium honeycomb structure and also Carbon Aramid honeycomb bodywork structure. The new FIA Formula 2 Championship car's front wings are slightly wider and also wider-lower rear wing.
====Transmission, gearbox and clutches====
The current [[gearbox]] has been manufactured by Hewland and features an 8-position barrel with ratchet body and software upgrades as well as a new transverse shafts fixing system designed to facilitate improved gear selection. Currently, the FIA Formula 2 Championship gearbox uses a 6-speed semi-automatic configuration with electronically-controlled paddle shifters with reverse operated by Reverse button on the steering wheel. The clutches of all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars are supplied by [[AP Racing]] with the multi-plate clutch operated by a hand-paddle lever.
====Wheel rims====
[[OZ Group|O.Z. Racing]] exclusively supplies wheel rims for all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars.
====Tyres====
[[Pirelli]] will continue supplying tyres for all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars since [[GP3 Series]] era. The tyre size of FIA Formula 3 car still remain same as [[GP3 Series]].
====Brakes====
[[Brembo]] supplies monobloc [[brake]] calipers and disc bells, which are exclusive to FIA Formula 3 Championship. Carbone Industrie also supplies carbon brake discs and pads for FIA Formula 3 Championship.

====Suspension====
The suspension of all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars is upper and lower steel wishbones, pushrod operated, coupled with twin Koni dampers and torsion bars suspension (front) and spring suspension (rear) similar to current [[Formula One car]] suspension.
====Steering wheel====
From the 2019 season, all FIA Formula 3 cars will utilize all new XAP steering wheels with a larger dash screen as well as three new rotary switches (similar to the current [[FIA Formula E]] steering wheel).

====Safety====
The current safety innovation of FIA Formula 3 Championship is the top priority. Front, side, rear and steering column impact tests are the FIA safety standards. All of the FIA Formula 3 Championship cars include front and rear roll hoop, impact structures and monocoque push tests. Anti-intrusion survival cell protection panels are also featured since 2019. Wheel retainer safety cables are also featured to avoid wheel flying similar to [[Formula One]], [[IndyCar Series]] (known as SWEMS) and other single-seater Formula racing series. The seat belts of all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars are supplied by [[Sabelt]] with 6-point seat belt configuration similar to [[Formula One]]. From 2019 onwards, the “[[Halo (safety device)|halo]]” cockpit protection system would be introduced to avoid the series of fatal crashes.

====Other components====
All FIA Formula 3 cars carry a Magneti Marelli-provided [[electronic control unit]] as well as Magneti Marelli power supply management unit. Live [[Telemetry#Motor racing|telemetry]] is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage and not on the track.

Rear view mirrors for all FIA Formula 3 cars are fully mandated for easy viewing of opponents behind.

===Engine===
=====First generation=====
The series will remain use the 3.4-litre V6 naturally-aspirated direct-injected engines supplied by [[Mecachrome]] until at least 2021 season. The horsepower will be scaled down from {{convert|400|to|380|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

Mecachrome V634 Turbo F3 V6 engines were crated and shipped to all FIA Formula 3 Championship teams on a serial-number basis as determined by the sanctioning body (FIA) to ensure equality and fairness in distribution.
====Fuel and lubricants components====
All Formula 3 cars currently use ordinary unleaded racing gasoline as fuel (similar to commercial vehicle unleaded street gasoline), which has been the de facto standard in third tier single-seater formula racing since the introduction of [[GP3 Series]] in 2010. Current Elf LMS 102 RON unleaded gasoline resembles ordinary unleaded gasoline but produces better mileage while being environmental-friendly and safer than other fuels{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Since 2019, [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]] exclusively continues providing the LMS 102 RON unleaded fuel and also [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf HTX 840 0W-40]] lubricants for all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars.
===Other parts===
The car also features internal cooling upgrades, a new water radiator, radiator duct, oil/water heat exchanger, modified oil degasser, new oil and water pipes and new heat exchanger fixing brackets.

'''Fantasy football''' (less commonly referred to as '''fantasy association football''' worldwide but known as '''fantasy soccer''' in the United States) is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life [[association football|footballers]] and score points based on those players' actual [[statistical]] performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. Usually players are selected from one specific division in a particular country, although there are many variations. The original game was created in England by Bernie Donnelly on Saturday 14 August 1971 and is still going strong 45 years later. Fantasy football has evolved in recent years from a simple recreational activity into a significant business due to exposure via the [[internet]].

An emerging variant is club-based fantasy football in which participants select players from within their own club. Participating clubs typically have more than one football team and adopt club fantasy football to increase communication and banter between teams. Some clubs charge a nominal amount for players to enter a team and either use the proceeds as a fundraiser or to fund the fantasy league prizes. Club fantasy football leagues tend to be less sophisticated than the national variety since most clubs run them on a [[spreadsheet]]. Niche sports websites now offer online versions with both paid and free versions available.

==Teams==
Most fantasy football leagues, especially those run by national newspapers, ask participants to select 11 players within a price budget. There is usually a restriction on the number of players per club; a typical selection would be to select 1 goalkeeper, 4 defenders, 4 or 3 midfielders and 2 or 3 forwards. Some games are squad-based, where participants choose not just a first eleven but also a set of [[Substitute (association football)|substitutes]]. Normally you can only use max. 3 players of one team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Chris | last=Klein | coauthors= | title=Fantasy Soccer Rules | date=2017-05-28 | publisher= | url =https://www.fantasyxl.com/rules/ | work =fantasyxl.com | pages = | accessdate = 2017-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In smaller leagues played by a small group of people, players are bought by bidding between the rival managers rather than for a set amount of money. This means a particular player can only play for one team, and thus any points he accrues are credited to that team only. Typically, most leagues offer the chance to transfer players in and out of the team as the season progresses, in case of injury, suspension or loss of form.

==Points scoring==
Points are then gained or deducted depending on players' performances. Points systems vary between games but typically, points are awarded for some or all of the following achievements:
* Playing in a match (or part of a match e.g. at least 60 minutes)
* Scoring a goal
* Making an [[assist (football)|assist]] (the pass or touch leading to the goal)
* Keeping a [[clean sheet]] (goalkeepers, midfielders and defenders only)
* Saving a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]]
* Goalkeeper saves 3 shots or more
* Win of the team

As well as the above, points can be deducted for some or all of the following:
* Conceding a goal (goalkeepers and defenders only)
* Receiving a yellow or red card
* Missing a penalty kick
* Scoring an own goal
* Getting substituted
* Loss of the team

The number of points each achievement or offence is credited with varies between different games, for example in the [[Daily Telegraph]] league, three points are awarded for an assist, and five for a goal. Due to the emphasis placed on assists and goalscoring, the value of players can differ greatly from real-life football, both in terms of individuals and position. For example, [[Claude Makélélé]], a world-class central midfield player, was rarely considered a valuable player in fantasy football because he was not an attacking player, as evidenced by three league goals in eight years at [[Real Madrid]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and zero for the French national team in seventy-one appearances.

For this reason some fantasy football games have changed their scoring system to put greater emphasis on real player performance instead of emphasising goals and assists. For instance the game KAISER uses player scores gained by computer analyses based on dozens of different criteria. These scores are supplied by the data provider OPTA.&lt;ref&gt;see also http://www.kaiser.co.uk/en/info/rules.html accessed on 30 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The game [[Oulala Fantasy Football]] uses a sophisticated scoring system. With 70 different points scoring criteria, which includes a matrix of any action that a player can perform, the criteria of 70 rises to a total of 275 dependent on each player's position on the field. Detailed actions include corners won, shots on/off target, successful dribbles and provoking an offside as well as many more others. These stats are sourced from [[Opta Sports]] and update in real time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oulala.com/en/scoring-system Oulala Fantasy Football Diverse points scoring matrix]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public vs private leagues==
Most fantasy football games provide a choice of joining either private or public leagues. Public leagues are open to everybody and mostly there are leagues for each club or leagues for each country. League members then compete against each other and in some cases there is cash prizes for winning those leagues. Private leagues let the manager play with their friends only. Some games combine this with having unique teams in the leagues. This means that every Premier League player exists only once. As a result, there is a lot of activity on the transfer market where players are exchanged in between the community members.

==Starter options==
At the start of the season fantasy football leagues can be set up in various ways. For leagues with unique teams, i.e. leagues where every player exists only once, there are at least two different starter options. Option 1 is a player auction. Every player is auctioned and the manager of a community needs to bid for the players. Managers have a certain budget for the auction. Option 2 is a player draft. Each manager is allocated a certain number of players.

For leagues without unique teams, i.e. every manager can own every player if he has sufficient funding, there is usually neither a draft nor an auction but managers can pick their players until they have used up their budget.

===Auction===
Various fantasy football games with unique teams offer the option of a player auction. At the beginning of the season, players are put on a transfer market and manager can bid for them. Some games even continue this auction system during the season (e.g.  kaiser.co.uk). Kaiser also offers the opportunity to take the league to the next season. In this case new leagues can be started throughout the season without making it less interesting.

===Draft===
The draft is an option to jump-start a league. This is especially interesting for leagues that are set up during the season. From day 1, managers can line up their team for the next match day and trade players with other community members or using the computer. The draft is a common feature for NFL fantasy football games and the German Bundesliga. More than one Premier League manager game offers a similar feature.

'''''Gone Batty''''' is a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animated cartoon short released by Warner Brothers on September 4, 1954. The film was re-released in October 1963 as a ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[Blue ribbon|Blue Ribbon]] cartoon.

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
Bobo the Elephant, making his first appearance since ''[[Hobo Bobo]]'', also directed by [[Robert McKimson|McKimson]], is baseball team mascot for the lean and meek Sweetwater Shnooks, all of whom are rendered unconscious by their opponents, the husky and brutal Greenville Goons.  Just as a victory by the Goons seems nearly inevitable, Bobo singlehandedly rallies his team back for a win in the bottom of the ninth inning.

==Overview==
Robert McKimson directed the animated cartoon from a story (lifted in part from the [[Friz Freleng]]/[[Michael Maltese]] 1946 opus ''[[Baseball Bugs]]'') by Sid Marcus and animator [[Ben Washam]]. Animation was done from Robert Givens' layout by [[Charles McKimson]], Herman Cohen, Rod Scribner and Phil DeLara with backgrounds by Richard H. Thomas and music by [[Carl Stalling]]. Voices were provided by [[Mel Blanc]] and an uncredited [[Robert C. Bruce]] as a play-by-play announcer.

'''Indirect calorimetry''' calculates [[heat]] that [[Organism|living organisms]] produce by measuring either their production of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[Metabolic waste|nitrogen waste]] (frequently [[ammonia]] in aquatic organisms, or [[urea]] in terrestrial ones), or from their consumption of [[oxygen]].  Indirect calorimetry is the method by which the type and rate of substrate utilization, and [[energy metabolism]] are estimated in vivo starting from [[gas exchange]] measurements (carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption during rest and steady-state exercise). This technique provides unique information, is noninvasive, and can be advantageously combined with other experimental methods to investigate numerous aspects of nutrient assimilation, [[thermogenesis]], the [[energetics]] of physical exercise, and the [[pathogenesis]] of [[Metabolic disorders|metabolic diseases]].&lt;ref name="Ferrannini"&gt;Ferrannini E.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3278194 "The theoretical bases of indirect calorimetry: a review."] Metabolism. 1988 Mar;37(3):287-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific background==
Indirect calorimetry measures O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. On the assumption that all the oxygen is used to [[oxidize]] degradable fuels and all the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby evolved is recovered, it is possible to calculate the total amount of energy produced. It should be clear that “energy production” means conversion of the chemical free-energy of nutrients into the chemical energy of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] plus loss of some energy during the oxidation process.&lt;ref name="Ferrannini"/&gt;
Respiratory indirect [[calorimetry]], or indirect calorimetry (IC) as it is known by most authors, is a noninvasive and highly accurate method of [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] which has an error rate lower than 1%.&lt;ref name="Marson"&gt;Marson F, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21892558 "Correlation between oxygen consumption calculated using Fick's method and measured with indirect calorimetry in critically ill patients."] Arq Bras Cardiol. 2004 Jan;82(1):77-81, 72-6. Epub 2004 Feb 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It has high reproducibility and has been considered a gold standard method.&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;Haugen HA, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17644692 "Indirect calorimetry: a practical guide for clinicians."] Nutr Clin Pract. 2007 Aug;22(4):377-88.&lt;/ref&gt; This method allows estimating [[Basal metabolic rate|BEE]] and [[Resting metabolic rate|REE]], and also allows for identification of energy substrates that are being predominantly metabolized by the body at a specific moment. It is based on the indirect measure of the heat produced by oxidation of [[macronutrients]], which is estimated by monitoring oxygen consumption (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide production (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for a certain period of time.&lt;ref name="Pinheiro"&gt;Pinheiro Volp AC, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21892558 "Energy expenditure: components and evaluation methods."] Nutr Hosp. 2011 May-Jun;26(3):430-40. doi: 10.1590/S0212-16112011000300002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[calorimeter]] has a gas collector that adapts to the subject and a system that measures the volume and concentrations of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; minute by minute. Through a unidirectional valve, the calorimeter collects and quantifies the volume and concentration of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inspired and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; expired by the subject. After a volume is met, [[Resting metabolic rate|Resting Energy Expenditure]] is calculated by the [[Weir formula]] and results are displayed in software attached to the system.&lt;ref name="Pinheiro"/&gt; Another formula used is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.R. Bain et al|title=Body heat storage during physical activity is lower with hot fluid ingestion under conditions that permit full evaporation Authors|journal=[[Acta Physiologica]]|date=Jun 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.2012.02452.x}} citing {{cite book|last1=Nishi|first1=Y.|editor1-last=K. Cena &amp; J. Clark|title=Bioengineering, Thermal Physiology and Comfort|date=1981|publisher=Elsevier|pages=29–39|chapter=Measurement of thermal balance in man}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M=VO_2\left(\frac{RQ-0.7}{0.3}e_c+\frac{1-RQ}{0.3}e_f\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where RQ is the [[respiratory quotient]] (ratio of volume CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced to volume of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumed), &lt;math&gt;e_c&lt;/math&gt; is {{convert|21.13|kJ|kcal}}, the heat released per litre of oxygen by the oxidation of carbohydrate, and &lt;math&gt;e_f&lt;/math&gt; is {{convert|19.62|kJ|kcal}}, the value for fat. This gives the same result as the Weir formula at RQ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (burning only carbohydrates), and almost the same value at RQ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.7 (burning only fat).

==History==
[[Antoine Lavoisier]] noted in 1780 that heat production can be predicted from oxygen consumption, using multiple regression. The [[Dynamic energy budget|Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory explains why this procedure is correct. Indirect calorimetry, as we know it, was developed at the turn of the century’s as an application of [[thermodynamics]] to animal life.&lt;ref name="Atwater"&gt;Atwater WO, et al. [http://www.sportsci.org/news/history/atwater/atwater.html "Description of neo respiration calorimeter and experiments on the conservation of energy in the human body."] US Department Agriculture, Off Exp Sta Bull 63, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; Although the development of indirect calorimetry dates back over 200 years, its greatest use has been in the last two decades with the development of total [[parenteral nutrition]], interdisciplinary nutrition support teams, and the production of portable, reliable, relatively inexpensive calorimeters.&lt;ref name="McClave"&gt;McClave SA, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1289691 "Use of indirect calorimetry in clinical nutrition."] Nutr Clin Pract. 1992 Oct;7(5):207-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection methods==
Four different gas collection and measurement techniques can be used to perform this test: 
*'''Douglas Bag''': expired respiratory gases are collected on an inflatable airtight bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Douglas, C. Gordon|authorlink=Claude Gordon Douglas|title=A method for determining the total respiratory exchange in man|journal=Proceedings of the Physiological Society|date=18 March 1911|url=http://digitalcommons.ohsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1195&amp;context=hca-cac}} ('''Douglas Bag''')&lt;/ref&gt; After completion of any test using Douglas Bags, gas collected must be analysed for volume and composition. 
*'''Canopy''' (dilution): The dilution technique is considered the gold standard technology for Resting Energy Expenditure measurement in clinical nutrition.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt; The test lasts just few minutes and consists of making a patient lie down relaxed on a bed or on a comfortable couch, with the head under a transparent hood connected to a pump, which applies an adjustable ventilation through it. Exhaled gas dilutes with the fresh air ventilated under the hood and a sample of this mixture is conveyed to the analysers, through a capillary tube and analysed. Ambient and diluted fractions of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are measured for a known ventilation rate, and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production are determined and converted into Resting Energy Expenditure.&lt;ref name="ADA"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [http://www.andeal.org/ "Measuring RMR with Indirect Calorimetry (IC)."] Nutr Clin Pract. 2007 Aug;22(4):377-88.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Face mask''' (breath by breath): Indirect calorimetry tests are also often performed with a face mask, which is used to convey exhaled and inhaled gas through a turbine [[Flow measurement|flowmeter]] able to measure the patient’s breath by breath minute ventilation, at the same time a sample of gas is conveyed to the analyser and VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and VCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are measured and converted in energy expenditure.
*'''Interface with a Ventilator''' ([[Intensive care unit|Intensive Care]] settings): In case the patient is mechanically ventilated, an indirect calorimeter can still measure breath by breath inhaled/exhaled O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if interfaced with the ventilator through the [[Tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]].

==Applications==
Indirect calorimetry provides at least two pieces of information: a measure of energy expenditure or 24-hour caloric requirements as reflected by the [[Resting metabolic rate|Resting Energy Expenditure]] (REE) and a measure of substrate utilization as reflected in the [[Respiratory quotient|Respiratory Quotient]] (RQ). Knowledge of the many factors that affect these values has led to a much broader range of applications. Studies of indirect calorimetry over the past 20 years have led to the characterization of the [[Hypermetabolism|hypermetabolic]] stress response to injury and the design of nutritional regimens whose substrates are most efficiently assimilated in different disease processes and [[organ failure]] states. Indirect calorimetry has influenced everyday practices of medical and surgical care, such as the warming of [[Burn center|burn unit]] and surgical suites and the weaning of patients from [[Medical ventilator|ventilators]].&lt;ref name="McClave"/&gt;

'''Infront Sports &amp; Media''' is a [[sports marketing]] company based in [[Zug]], [[Switzerland]]. The company handles the media and marketing rights for international sports events and federations and also provides sports services - such as advertising, sponsorship and hospitality. It represents all seven Olympic winter sport federations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Owen|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/sports/winter/skating/1025400-infront-to-acquire-dutch-agency-specialising-in-speed-skating |title=Infront to acquire Dutch agency specialising in speed skating|publisher=www.insidethegames.biz|date= |accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; several summer sport organizations and manages media rights for the FIS World Cup Events. Infront was created in late 2002 through the integration of CWL, Prisma and KirchSportAG. It has 35 offices, which belong to different subsidiaries for geographic regions.

==History==
Infront Sports &amp; Media was founded in October 2002 in order to create the television and radio broadcasts for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref name="dakfhj"&gt;http://www.prosoundnetwork.com/article/fifa-drives-audio-innovation-in-brazil/17786#sthash.iDTn1tX3.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt; The company originated from a merger of two existing Swiss-based marketing companies, CWL and Prisma Sports &amp; Media. Infront's origins are in the football business, but in 2005 the company lost a majority of its FIFA business and subsequently diversified. Today the company is divided into Summer and Winter sports properties (in line with the Olympic differentiation) and  also has dedicated Football, Endurance and Digital Production and Sports Solutions units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Adam Nelson |url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/movers_and_shakers/infront_appoints_claude_ruibal |title=Infront appoints Claude Ruibal |publisher=sportspromedia.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011 it was owned by a consortium of shareholders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In September 2011 – European private equity firm [[Bridgepoint Capital|Bridgepoint]] reached an agreement to acquire the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Helia Ebrahimi |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/privateequity/8737752/Bridgepoint-buys-Swiss-sports-rights-company.html |title=Bridgepoint Buys Swiss Sports Rights Company |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgepoint.eu/about-us/news-views/bridgepoint-reaches-agreement-acquire-infront-sports-media-ag|title=Bridgepoint Reaches Agreement to Acquire Infront Sports &amp; Media AG|publisher=Bridgepoint.eu|date=|accessdate=2011-09-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073604/http://www.bridgepoint.eu/about-us/news-views/bridgepoint-reaches-agreement-acquire-infront-sports-media-ag|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1585 |title=Mergers: Commission approves acquisition of sports marketing group Infront by Bridgepoint|publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''League of Denial''''' is a 2013 book, initially broadcast as a documentary film, about [[traumatic brain injury]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), particularly [[concussions in American football|concussions]] and [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). The documentary, entitled ''League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis'', was produced by ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' and broadcast on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fainaru|first=Mark|title=When It Comes To Brain Injury, Authors Say NFL Is In A 'League Of Denial'|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/07/229181970/when-it-comes-to-brain-injury-authors-say-nfl-is-in-a-league-of-denial|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=September 28, 2002|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfley|first=Bob|title=Much of Frontline's 'League of Denial' documentary rests on the case of Mike Webster|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/226368231.html|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title="League of Denial: The NFL’s Concussion Crisis," "Schooled" TV Reviews|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/frontlines-league-of-denial-the-nfls-concussion-crisis-epixs-schooled-the-price-of-college-sports-tv-reviews-1200688922/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 6, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory |first=Sean|title=League Of Denial Documents The NFL's Concussion Failures|url=http://keepingscore.blogs.time.com/2013/10/07/new-book-and-pbs-documentary-details-nfls-concussion-denial/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=October 7, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Don Van Natta, Jr.|title=New book, "League of Denial," says NFL used its resources and power over two decades to deny football link to brain damage|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9745797/new-book-league-denial-says-nfl-used-resources-power-two-decades-deny-football-link-brain-damage|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slothower |first=Jen|title='League of Denial' Shows NFL Ignoring Concussion Evidence, Mike Webster’s Fall, Roger Goodell Digging In|url=http://nesn.com/2013/10/league-of-denial-shows-nfl-ignoring-concussion-evidence-mike-websters-fall-roger-goodell-digging-in/|publisher=[[New England Sports Network]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written by [[ESPN]] reporters [[Mark Fainaru-Wada]] and [[Steve Fainaru]]. The book and film devote significant attention to the story of [[Mike Webster]] and his football-related brain injuries, and the pathologist who examined Webster's brain, [[Bennet Omalu]]. The film also looks closely at the efforts of researchers led by [[Ann McKee]] at [[Boston University]]'s Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, where the brains of a number of former NFL athletes have been examined.&lt;ref name=Chittum&gt;{{cite news|last=Chittum|first=Ryan|title=Frontline's landmark 'League of Denial' |url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/frontlines_landmark_league_of.php|accessdate=9 October 2013|newspaper=Columbia Journalism Review|date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ESPN]] had originally been a partner in the project, but backed out later&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/league-of-denial/a-note-from-frontline-espn-and-league-of-denial/ A Note from FRONTLINE: ESPN and “League of Denial”]&lt;/ref&gt; claiming a lack of editorial control.

During the documentary, Omalu recalled a discussion with an NFL doctor while reviewing Webster's case. Omalu said the NFL doctor told him "Bennett, do you know the implications of what you're doing? If 10 percent of mothers in this country would begin to perceive football as a dangerous sport, that is the end of football."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brinson|first=Will|title=Frontline PBS doc 'League of Denial' examines NFL concussion problem|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24051122/frontline-pbs-doc-league-of-denial-examines-nfl-concussion-problem|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frontline'' in 2010 produced a documentary on [[health issues in youth sports]] with a focus on repeated concussions and subconcussive blows in high school football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football High|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/football-high/|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==

Response to the documentary was positive, with many reviewers commenting on how powerful it was, and how it may change their views of football going forward, although noting that much of the information had been written about or shown before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katzowitz|first=Josh|title=Reactions to the Frontline PBS documentary, 'League of Denial'|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24052263/reactions-to-the-frontline-pbs-documentary-league-of-denial|publisher=CBS Sports|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Humphrey from ''[[Forbes]]'' wrote that "to deny the implications of the show and not, at the very least, take that potential hypocrisy very seriously, would be delusional. If I keep watching [football], it is at my own ethical risk. And I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Humphrey |first=Michael|title=What Is The NFL Fan To Do After Frontline's 'League of Denial?'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2013/10/08/what-is-the-nfl-fan-to-do-after-frontlines-league-of-denial/|work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote that "There is not a ton of brand-new such evidence in the documentary" but that "What is groundbreaking about League of Denial, rather, is the cleanness, coherence, and conciseness of the storytelling".&lt;ref name=newrepublic /&gt; The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said "The only problem with the much-touted ''Frontline'' investigative report ''League of Denial'' is that it probably should have been subtitled "Nation of Denial." Kevin McFarland of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote "League Of Denial provides an excellent, mandatory two-hour overview of the rise in research on this subject." and "Football is a dead sport walking in the United States. It may look healthy, vibrant, and more profitable than ever. But in a few generations it will be a flimsy husk of itself at its height. The damning evidence is all here in League Of Denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland|first=Kevin|title=Frontline: “League Of Denial: The NFL’s Concussion Crisis”|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/league-of-denial-the-nfls-concussion-crisis,103868/|publisher=''[[The A.V.

''[[The New York Times]]'' said "The program doesn't give the league much credit for recent rule changes and other safety initiatives, instead underscoring its continuing reluctance to acknowledge a link between the sport and brain injuries and its reliance on language that pushes any day of reckoning into the future." and "Much of this has already been reported, with [[Alan Schwarz]] of ''The New York Times'' often leading the way, but the program will certainly be eye-opening for anyone—especially parents with children of Pop Warner league age—who hasn't followed the subject closely or seen ''The United States of Football'', a documentary released in August."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|title='League of Denial' Looks at N.F.L. and Concussions|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/arts/television/league-of-denial-looks-at-nfl-and-concussions.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=October 7, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL senior vice president of health and safety policy Jeff Miller said "[for two decades the league has been a] leader in addressing the issue of head injuries in a serious way" and "By any standard, the NFL has made a profound commitment to the health and safety of its players that can be seen in every aspect of the game, and the results have been both meaningful and measurable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mihoces|first=Gary|title=Documentary: For years, NFL ignored concussion evidence |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/10/07/frontline-documentary-nfl-concussions/2939747/|work=USA Today|date=October 7, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muffin Wax''' is an organic [[surf wax]] made from [[hemp oil]], [[tree resin]], [[bees wax]] and one other secret ingredient. It is 
packaged in muffin cases and subsequently was named 'Muffin Wax'.  As a result of the packaging, ridges are formed and are claimed to help in application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newquayvoice.co.uk/nvnews/news/newsItem.php?news_id=1776 Surf wax entrepreneurs off to international final] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724141002/http://www.newquayvoice.co.uk/nvnews/news/newsItem.php?news_id=1776 |date=2011-07-24 }}, [http://www.newquayvoice.co.uk/ Newquay Voice], July 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The product was created by 'Timeless,' a [[Young Enterprise]] company formed from a group of 15- and 16-year-olds attending Newquay Tretherras 
School in [[Newquay]], [[Cornwall]]. Throughout the young enterprise year they won a number of awards leading up to the [[UK]] finals at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in [[London]] which they won and went to represent the UK in [[Interlaken]] [[Switzerland]]. The company has since changed their name simply to 'Muffin Wax' and became a trading company no longer part of Young Enterprise.

'''Murrayfield Stadium''' is a sports [[stadium]] located in the west end of [[Edinburgh]], the capital of [[Scotland]]. Its all-seater capacity is 67,144 which makes it the largest stadium in Scotland and the fifth largest in the [[United Kingdom]].

The stadium is the home of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] (SRU), and is primarily used as a venue for [[rugby union]] and hosts most of [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland's]] home test matches, the ''Scottish Hydro Electric Cup'' final, as well as [[Pro14]] and [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] matches.

Although mainly a rugby union stadium, Murrayfield has in the past hosted [[American football]], [[Challenge Cup|rugby league]] and [[association football]] matches and music concerts.

==Location==

Murrayfield is located near to [[Murrayfield Ice Rink]], Murrayfield Curling Rink, and close to [[Edinburgh Zoo]]. It is named after the area of Edinburgh it is located in, [[Murrayfield]].

==History==
{{expand section|date=May 2014}}
The SRU identified 19 acres of land at Murrayfield, purchasing this from Edinburgh Polo Club at Murrayfield, having raised money through [[Debenture_(sport)| debentures]].&lt;ref name="Herald 14Mar1995"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12541855.Changed_days_as_the_home_of_Scottish_rugby_takes_on_world_of_big_business_From_cricket_pitch_to_a_cash_____________jackpot/ |title=Changed days as the home of Scottish rugby takes on world of big business From cricket pitch to a cash jackpot |work=The Herald |date=4 March 1995 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stand and three embankments were constructed, which took two years.&lt;ref name="Herald 14Mar1995"/&gt; Previous internationals had been played at [[Inverleith]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman 28Jan2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/scottish-flashback-murrayfield-in-the-snow-1963-1-3672534 |title=Scottish Flashback: Murrayfield in the snow, 1963 |work=The Scotsman |date=28 January 2015 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 1925 {{nrut|England}} were the first team to visit Murrayfield, with 70,000 people watching {{nrut|Scotland}} beat them to win their first [[Five Nations Championship]] [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman 28Jan2015"/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] the ground at Murrayfield was offered to the nation and was taken over by the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] and used as a supply depot. During the war years the [[British armed forces|armed forces]] sports authorities managed to arrange two Scotland v. England services internationals each year, on a home-and-away basis. Scotland's home matches were played at Inverleith for the first two years with a return to Murrayfield in 1944 after that ground's derequisition.

Murrayfield's record attendance of 104,000 was set on 1 March 1975 when Scotland defeated {{nrut|Wales}} 12–10 during the [[1975 Five Nations Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/73600/edinburgh-roseburn-street-murrayfield-stadium |title=Edinburgh, Roseburn Street, Murrayfield Stadium |work=[[Canmore (database)|Canmore]] |publisher=[[Historic Environment Scotland]] |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attendance stood as a world record until 1999.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 28Jan2015"/&gt;

The East stand was built in 1983.&lt;ref name="Herald growing great 5Feb1994"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12685727.How_Murrayfield_is_growing_great/ |title=How Murrayfield is growing great |work=The Herald |date=5 February 1994|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1991 another debenture scheme was launched, to finance a more comprehensive redevelopment of the West Stand.&lt;ref name="Herald debenture 5Feb1994"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12685828.The_debenture_scheme_delivers_delight/ |title=The debenture scheme delivers delight |work=The Herald |date=5 February 1994 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new West Stand was designed with a 48-metre cantilever roof.&lt;ref name="Herald 13Jan1993"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12626927.Murrayfield_is_entering_a_bright_new_era/ |title=Murrayfield is entering a bright new era |work=The Herald |date=13 January 1993 |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old West Stand housed a museum, but this was not replaced and plans for a new visitor centre were shelved when the game turned professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/return-of-murrayfield-museum-remains-beyond-sru-s-pocket-1-817699 |title=Return of Murrayfield museum remains beyond SRU's pocket |work=The Scotsman |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase was completed in January 1993 with the new north and south stands opening.&lt;ref name="Herald 13Jan1993"/&gt; In February 1994 the centre section of the new West Stand opened.&lt;ref name="Herald growing great 5Feb1994"/&gt; In 1994, Murrayfield completed a £50-million renovation where floodlights were installed for the first time.

In October 2012, SRU chief executive Mark Dodson&lt;!--Not to be confused with the American record producer.--&gt; told the BBC that it was actively seeking a name sponsor for Murrayfield:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/20128230 |title=Murrayfield could be renamed for right price – Scottish Rugby |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=29 October 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The single biggest piece of our inventory is our national stadium. We would like to see if we can monetise that. It would be crazy for us not to look at using our single biggest piece of inventory to drive revenue. We want to get the right price for it.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In addition, Dodson indicated that the SRU was actively seeking a site for a completely new stadium with a capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 as a future home for Edinburgh Rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby/top-rugby-stories/sru-chiefs-seek-murrayfield-stadium-name-change-sponsor-to-help-pay-off-debts-1-2604968 |title=SRU chiefs seek Murrayfield stadium name change sponsor to help pay off debts |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=30 October 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pitch was damaged by [[nematode]]s in the lead up to the 2013 autumn internationals. This led the SRU to replace the grass with a [[Desso GrassMaster|Desso surface]] from the start of the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/393290/scots-to-install-hybrid-pitch-at-murrayfield|title=Scots to install hybrid pitch at Murrayfield|work=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A naming rights deal with [[British Telecom|BT]] was agreed in May 2014, resulting in the stadium being officially named as the BT Murrayfield Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/27605156 |title=Scottish Rugby confirms deal for BT Murrayfield Stadium |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=28 May 2014 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Rugby union===
[[File:MurrayfieldStadium2002.jpg|thumb|right|Murrayfield Stadium in 2002.]]
[[File:MurrayfieldRugbyWorldCup.JPG|thumb|right]]
Murrayfield is used for most [[Scotland|Scottish]] international [[rugby union]] matches, with all Scotland's [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] home games being played in the stadium. The stadium also hosted all of [[Edinburgh Rugby|Edinburgh's]] matches between 1996 and January 2017. (For Pro14 matches, only the lower tier of the West Stand is typically used.) Since January 2017 only selected Edinburgh matches are held at Murrayfield. From [[2006–07 IRB Sevens World Series|2007]] to [[2010–11 IRB Sevens World Series|2011]], Murrayfield hosted the [[Edinburgh Sevens|Edinburgh 7s]], then the final event in the annual [[IRB Sevens World Series]] in [[rugby sevens]], but that tournament was moved to [[Glasgow]] starting in [[2011–12 IRB Sevens World Series|2012]] due to low attendance. Murrayfield hosted select matches from the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. The stadium also hosted the [[Heineken Cup]] Final in [[2004–05 Heineken Cup|2005]], when [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] beat [[Stade Français]] 18–12, and again in [[2008–09 Heineken Cup|2009]], with Leinster defeating Leicester 19–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8057916.stm |title=Leicester 16–19 Leinster |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rugby World Cup====
Murrayfield hosted matches of the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] and [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] [[Rugby World Cup]]s.

===Rugby league===
Although a union stadium, Murrayfield hosted the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] Finals of 2000 and 2002. The stadium hosted rugby league's [[Super League]] [[Magic Weekend]] in 2009, taking over from the Millennium Stadium. The record for a rugby league attendance at the stadium is 67,247 for the 2000 Challenge Cup

===Association football===
Murrayfield has also hosted [[Association football]] matches. In December 2003, the SRU board agreed to let local [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]] (Hearts) lease the stadium for match days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/premiership/hearts-get-go-ahead-for-ground-switch-to-murrayfield-1-496509 |title=Hearts get go-ahead for ground switch to Murrayfield |work=TheScotsman |date=4 December 2003|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, [[UEFA]] confirmed that Hearts' own ground, [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]] did not meet the minimum criteria for European matches from the 2004&amp;ndash;05 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/3341135.stm |title=Tynecastle not fit for Europe |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=22 December 2003 |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearts used Murrayfield as their home venue for European matches for three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5341280.stm |title=Hearts 0-2 Sparta Prague |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=14 September 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  until Hearts made adjustments to Tynecastle that made it compliant with UEFA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heartsfc.co.uk/articles/20040702/tynecastle-stadium-1981-present_2241548_537219 |quote=2005: Plans were produced for a new Main Stand that could take the capacity of the stadium up to 25,000. In the meantime, the removal of 280 seats from the front of the Gorgie and Roseburn Stands allowed the club to extend the length of the playing pitch to meet UEFA Cup requirements.

In 2014 Glasgow club [[Celtic F. C.|Celtic]] played two qualifying matches at the stadium due to [[Celtic Park]] being unavailable because of Glasgow's hosting of the [[Commonwealth Games]]. Murrayfield was a candidate to replace Hampden as the national football venue for the early parts of Scotland's [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification]] campaign due to Hampden's renovation for the aforementioned games. However, it was decided that one of the two stadiums in Glasgow would be used.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Hearts again used the stadium for home games during the [[2017–18 Scottish Premiership]], due to the delays in construction of a new main stand at Tynecastle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/hearts-to-stage-games-at-murrayfield-due-to-main-stand-delay-1-4521745 |title=Hearts to stage games at Murrayfield due to main stand delay |first=Barry |last=Anderson |publisher=Edinburgh Evening News |date=3 August 2017 |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American football===
Murrayfield has played host to [[American football]] and was one of two home venues for the now defunct [[Scottish Claymores]] in the [[NFL Europa]] between 1995 and 2004, the other being [[Hampden Park]] in [[Glasgow]]. Additionally, it hosted [[World Bowl '96]] on 23 June 1996. It has been mentioned as a potential future host site for the [[NFL International Series]], should the [[National Football League]] add future games outside the series' current permanent home, [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]].

===Music===
[[David Bowie]] played to a capacity crowd of 47,000 people in 28 June 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i8JAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_KUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3422%2C5998294 |title=Acclaim in the rain |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=29 June 1983 |page=1 |accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 1996, [[Tina Turner]] played at Murrayfield as part of her [[Wildest Dreams Tour]].

[[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] played a sold-out show on 17 June 2009, as part of their world tour. Some antisocial behaviour at this event affected the stadium's licensing arrangements when they were reviewed a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/murrayfield-ordered-to-bid-for-booze-licence-before-every-gig-1-1215584 |title=Murrayfield ordered to bid for booze licence before every gig|work=The Scotsman |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time Oasis would play a concert in Scotland and the second time they had played the stadium, the first being on their [[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants Tour]] in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The '''North Shore Beach and Yacht Club''' or '''North Shore Yacht Club''' is an [[Albert Frey (architect)|Albert Frey]]-designed building in [[North Shore, California]].  (Not built as originally designed by Frey.)

[[Image:GreetingsFromNorthShoresm.gif|left|thumb|Scan of historic postcard depicting the North Shore Yacht Club on its bottom half]]
It opened in 1959 as part of a $2 million development along the northeastern shore of the [[Salton Sea]] which would become California's largest [[marina]]. Several prominent figures from the entertainment industry docked boats there, among them members of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Guy Lombardo]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[The Marx Brothers]]. Ever-increasing salinity from agricultural runoff from both the [[Coachella Valley]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]] combined with fluctuating water levels culminated in a major flood in 1981, destroying the club's [[jetty]] and making it impossible for boats to dock at the club; it would be completely closed by 1984. However the club remained in use by the community into the early 1990s.

Like the majority of the buildings which surround it, the North Shore Beach and Yacht Club was abandoned and vandalized. The shoreside swimming pool remained intact though badly vandalized as well. An often-photographed large advertising sign for [[Texaco|Texaco Marine]] at the site of the jetty has now been removed.

In July 2009, Riverside County supervisors approved the reception of a grant of $3.35 million as part of an overall package of $30 million to redevelop and restore the property.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mydesert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009907220309 News of redevelopment funds at Mydesert.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The property was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2015.

North Shore Beach and Yacht Club is pictured on the [[Album cover]] of [[Minutes to Midnight (Linkin Park album)|Minutes to Midnight]]
by [[Linkin Park]].

==Salton Sea History Museum==
[[Image:North Shore Yacht Club 2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|After closing in 1984 the abandoned Yacht Club was in a state of disrepair, as seen when this picture was taken, until its restoration in 2010]]
On May 1, 2010, the restored yacht club was reopened to the public as the '''Salton Sea History Museum,''' serving as a community center as well as a museum. The former pool area then served as an activity deck while the former loading area became a children's play area.&lt;ref name = ssmuseum&gt;http://saltonseamuseum.org/ Salton Sea History Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was temporarily relocated to [[Mecca, California]] at the site of [[Desert Cahuilla Wetlands Temal Pa'lekish]] while awaiting a lease agreement from the county and reinstatement of its space in the yacht club.&lt;ref name = ssmuseum/&gt; The reopening date was February 3, 2012.&lt;ref name = ssmuseum/&gt; The following year the owner of the property, the Torres Martinez Tribe, opted to revoke the agreement in order to make use of the space remodeled by museum volunteers. As of 10-2014 the museum is still awaiting the long-promised lease agreement from the county to reopen in the yacht club.

The property that was the North Shore Beach and Yacht Club is owned by [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], which made the decision to relocate the museum, and the property is now reserved for rare community events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/travel/exploring-modern-ruins-in-southern-california.html?_r=0&amp;referrer= "Exploring Modern Ruins in Southern California"], "New York Times" (March 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Papa Murphy's Park''' (formerly known as '''Bonney Field''') is a sports venue located on the grounds of [[California Exposition|Cal Expo]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]]. The [[soccer-specific stadium]] has a capacity of 11,569 and includes a full-sized (120 x 80 yard) soccer field.  Papa Murphy's Park is the current home of [[Sacramento Republic FC]] soccer team and former home of [[PRO Rugby]] team, [[Sacramento Express]].

The field is located on the former site of the [[Cal Expo Amphitheatre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://soccerstadiumdigest.com/2016/08/bonney-field-could-become-music-venue/ |title=Bonney Field Could Become Music Venue |last1=Spedden |first1=Zach |last2= |first2= |date=August 1, 2016 |website=Soccer Stadium Digest |publisher=August Publications |access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is bordered on the west and south by the Cal Expo monorail, and on the east by [[Raging Waters Sacramento|Raging Waters]] water park.

==History==
Construction of the stadium began in March 2014, following approval by the Cal Expo Board of Directors. Funding for the stadium came from an agreement between Ovations Food Services, Cal Expo, and the Republic FC. Original schedules put the grand opening for the Republic FC's June 7 match against [[Arizona United SC|Arizona United]], but that date was postponed two weeks, with the grand opening falling instead on June 20, when the Republic FC played the reserve team of the [[Colorado Rapids]] in a match that ended in a victory for the Republic. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The name of the stadium was originally Cal Expo Multi-Use Sports Field Facility, but on April 21, 2014, Republic FC President Warren Smith announced a multi-year deal with Bonney Plumbing, Heating, Air and Rooter Service for the naming rights of the stadium and the name was changed to Bonney Field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonney.com/press_releases/first-home-match-at-bonney-field-moved-to-june-20 "First home match at Bonney Field moved to June 20"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2017, Republic FC announced that the facility would be renamed Papa Murphy's Park, in a multi-year naming rights agreement with [[Papa Murphy's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacrepublicfc.com/news_article/show/767655?referrer_id=2875420]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Papa Murphy's Park is open-ended, with the south endline lacking a grandstand but hosting the VIP section.&lt;ref name="Bonney map"&gt;[http://bonneyfield.com/tickets-seating/seat-map/ "Bonney Field Seating Map"], Bonney Field.&lt;/ref&gt; The north endline is home to the Tower Bridge Battalion, the SRFC supporters group.&lt;ref name="kcra"&gt;[http://www.kcra.com/news/crews-race-to-finish-bonney-field-expansion/32254022 "Crews Race to Finish Bonney Field Expansion"], KCRA, April 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The team benches and premium seating are located along the west sideline.&lt;ref name="Bonney map"/&gt;

==Soccer==
Papa Murphy's Park is the home stadium for the [[Sacramento Republic FC]] soccer team of the [[United Soccer League|USL]].&lt;ref name="Bonney Field"&gt;[http://www.sacrepublicfc.com/matchday/bonney-field/#.U5kJPBw2KXI "Bonney Field"], Sacramento Republic FC.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic hosted its first match at Papa Murphy's Park on June 20, 2014.&lt;ref name="Bonney Field"/&gt; In addition to USL Pro matches, Papa Murphy's Park also hosted Republic friendly matches against visiting foreign teams, such as [[Liga MX|Mexican Premier Division]] team [[Club Atlas]], [[Scottish Premiership]] team [[Rangers F.C.]] and [[Premier League]] team [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2014/06/11/6476481/republic-fc-will-play-liga-mx.html "Republic FC will play Liga MX team at Bonney Field on July 6"],  Sacramento Bee, June 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby==

==Expansion==
After a successful inaugural season for the Republic FC, which consisted of 16 sell-outs in 17 matches and a USL Pro championship at Papa Murphy's Park, Smith indicated plans to expand the stadium by 2,000 to 3,000 seats for the 2015 USL Pro season.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://www.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2014/10/01/sacramento-republic-mls-expansion-usl-pro-warren-smith "Republic FC wins first USL Pro championship, will expand stadium"], Sports Illustrated, October 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion project, which forced a reschedule of the 2015 home opener, added approximately 1,300 sideline seats, 2,500 endline seats, and an expanded market area.&lt;ref name="kcra"/&gt;

The '''Rangers Training Centre''', currently known as '''The Hummel Training Centre''' for sponsorship reasons,&lt;ref name=hummel/&gt; is the [[training ground]] of [[Rangers F.C.]], located in [[Milngavie]], [[East Dunbartonshire]], Scotland. It was opened in 2001 and originally named '''Murray Park''' after the then Rangers owner [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|David Murray]]. It is also often referred to as '''Auchenhowie''', the name of the locality within Milngavie where it is situated. 

== History ==

===Development and opening===
Prior to the construction of the club's own training facility, the first team trained at several locations across [[Glasgow]] including [[Ibrox Stadium]], [[Bellahouston Park]] and the [[Hamilton Crescent|West of Scotland cricket ground]]. A dedicated training complex was first proposed by the then manager [[Dick Advocaat]] upon his arrival at the club in June 1998. It was officially opened on 4 July 2001 by Advocaat and then-chairman [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|David Murray]], after whom it was originally named as Murray Park.&lt;ref name="Rangers unveil new training complex"&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/1422680.stm | title = Rangers unveil new training complex | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 4 July 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of the complex was estimated at around £14 million.&lt;ref name="Rangers unveil new training complex"/&gt;

=== Purchase by Green's consortium and use as a security ===
On 14 June 2012, after the [[Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc]], the training facility was sold along with other Rangers' assets, in a deal worth £5.5m, to [[Ownership of Rangers F.C.|The Rangers Football Club Ltd]] - a consortium led by [[Charles Green (businessman)|Charles Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18447530 | title=Charles Green completes Rangers purchase despite Walter Smith bid | publisher=BBC News | date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, there was speculation that the Rangers board was looking to sell the facility in order to raise money, due to a fan boycott of season tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/rangers/10996605/Rangers-board-face-accusations-from-Union-of-Fans-that-they-are-planning-to-sell-Murray-Park-training-facility.html | title=Rangers board face accusations from Union of Fans that they are planning to sell Murray Park training facility |  author=Roddy Forsyth | date=28 July 2014 | publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaming ===
The use of the name Murray Park significantly reduced after the club was sold to [[Craig Whyte]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Dave King Fan Response #3"/&gt; Moreover, after the liquidation of the club and its assets, many fans held David Murray partly or wholly responsibly,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13944277.Spiers_on_Sport__The_truth_hurts__but_not_as_much_as_the_damage_done/ | title=Rangers cheated and the truth is unpalatable, the damage irreversible | publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group|work=HeraldScotland | author=Graham Spiers | date=4 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so began calling the facility Auchenhowie (after the geographic area where it is based).&lt;ref name="Dave King Fan Response #3"&gt;{{ cite news | title=Dave King Fan Response #3 | url=http://rangers.co.uk/news/headlines/dave-king-fan-response-3/ | publisher=Rangers FC |work=Rangers.co.uk|author=Dave King | date=21 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, the then Rangers [[chief executive officer|Chief executive]] Charles Green stated he would ask Rangers season ticket holders to vote on renaming the club's training ground.&lt;ref name="Rangers' Murray Park training ground may be renamed"&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18348451 | title=Rangers' Murray Park training ground may be renamed | publisher=BBC Sport | author=Keir Murray | date=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Green proposed that it could be renamed the [[Moses McNeil]] Academy or the [[Davie Cooper]] Academy after former Rangers players.&lt;ref name="Rangers' Murray Park training ground may be renamed"/&gt; In June 2016, then chairman [[Dave King (businessman)|Dave King]] revisited the issue of the renaming of Murray Park and asked Rangers fans to suggest an alternative name.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| title=Dave King wants Rangers fans to rename Murray Park | url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/rangers/dave-king-wants-rangers-fans-to-rename-murray-park-1-4160578 | publisher=Johnston Publishing|work=The Scotsman | author=Gavin McCafferty  | date=21 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the facility was officially renamed The Hummel Training Centre as part of a sponsorship deal with [[Denmark|Danish]] sportswear company and current club kit manufacturer [[Hummel International|Hummel]].&lt;ref name=hummel&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://rangers.co.uk/news/headlines/the-hummel-training-centre/ | title=The Hummel Training Centre | date=14 June 2018 | publisher=Rangers Football Club | work=Rangers.co.uk|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future developments==
In February 2016, the [[Rangers Fans Fighting Fund]] revealed plans to provide £450,000 to build a 264-seater stand at Murray Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/14289607.Rangers_Fans_Fighting_Fund_proposes___450_000_Murray_Park_stand_development/ | title=Rangers Fans Fighting Fund proposes £450,000 Murray Park stand development | author=Christopher Jack | publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group| work=HeraldScotland | date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning permission was granted in December 2017 which included the stand and further dressing room facilities, as well as a classroom area and additional floodlighting. Work began in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://rangers.co.uk/news/headlines/training-centre-enhancement-granted/| title=Training centre enhancement granted| publisher=Rangers FC |work=Rangers.co.uk| date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and facilities==
The site covers a size of thirty-eight [[acres]] (over fifteen hectares). It is divided into three areas: the administration wing, the professional wing for the first team and the youth development wing. The professional and youth wings have their own separate receptions, dining areas, changing rooms, kit stores and lecture rooms.&lt;ref name="Murray Park1"&gt;{{ cite news | title=MURRAY PARK | url=http://rangers.co.uk/club/murray-park/ | work=Rangers.co.uk | publisher=Rangers FC | accessdate=21 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704063237/http://rangers.co.uk/club/murray-park | archive-date=4 July 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both share facilities including the gym, medical suite and the indoor synthetic pitch. Outside there are six full size pitches along with two half sized, and a practice area.&lt;ref name="Murray Park1"/&gt; Two of the full-sized and one half-sized pitch are used only by the first team, these have under-soil heating, the others are used by the youth sides.&lt;ref name="Murray Park1"/&gt;

The gym equipment, costing £150,000, is linked to a computer system which can activate a personalised fitness programme for individual players.&lt;ref name="Murray Park1"/&gt; The gym also houses an iso-kinetic machine, which allows players to work out despite being injured by testing muscle strength and reactions. There is a hydrotherapy pool that has an angled, movable floor and a series of massage jets and currents that allows a range of rehabilitation exercises to take place.&lt;ref name="Murray Park1"/&gt; There is also a media editing suite costing £50,000 where a video analyst will video each training session.&lt;ref name="Murray Park1"/&gt; The footage will be used to conduct tactical lessons in the lecture room afterwards.

== Other uses==
Rangers training centre is often used by visiting club and national teams playing in Scotland. For example, the [[South Korea national football team]], then managed by Advocaat, hired the facilities for their training before the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20060528/ai_n16697207| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111020175840/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20060528/ai_n16697207/| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 20 October 2011| title = Prodigal boss returns | publisher = | date = 28 May 2006 | author=Stewart Fisher|via=FindArticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, [[Inter Milan]] trained at the centre after Rangers agreed to allow the [[Italy|Italians]] use of the facility prior to a [[UEFA Europa League]] match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].&lt;ref name="Rangers to hand Inter Milan keys to Murray Park ahead of their Europa League showdown with Celtic"&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-hand-inter-milan-keys-5169102| title =Rangers to hand Inter Milan keys to Murray Park ahead of their Europa League showdown with Celtic | publisher = Media Scoland|work=Daily Record | date = 17 February 2015 | author=Ashleigh McGinley}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first time Rangers offered support to a club that were to play city rivals Celtic, having made a similar offer to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 2013 and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (who were managed by [[Graeme Souness]]) in 2002.&lt;ref name="Rangers to hand Inter Milan keys to Murray Park ahead of their Europa League showdown with Celtic"/&gt;

[[File:Granwilly-vilas-1978.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Guillermo Vilas]] performing the ''Gran Willy'' shot.]]
The '''tweener''' or '''between-the-legs shot''' is a difficult [[tennis shot]] where a player hits the ball between his or her legs. It is typically performed facing away from the opponent, when the player attempts to recover a [[lob (tennis)|lob]] and has no time to turn back around, and hits the ball backward between their legs. Forward-facing tweeners, sometimes called "front tweeners", are also occasionally employed. In competitive matches the tweener is a crowd-pleasing, seldom used last resort, but it is a common trick shot in exhibitions. Players who famously executed the backward shot include the pioneer [[Guillermo Vilas]] (whose version was called the "Gran Willy"), [[Yannick Noah]], [[Ilie Nastase]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]] (whose version became known as "the Sabatweenie"), [[Roger Federer]], [[Juan Martín del Potro]], [[Nick Kyrgios]], [[Daria Kasatkina]], [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] and [[Simona Halep]].&lt;ref name=Grasso&gt;{{cite book |last= Grasso|first= John |year= 2011 |title= Historical Dictionary of Tennis |url= https://books.google.com/?id=W39oSS7c2xAC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=Tweener+tennis+shot#v=onepage&amp;q=Tweener%20tennis%20shot&amp;f=false |publisher= Scarecrow Press |page= 288 |isbn= 0810872374 |access-date= July 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;{{cite news |last= Siegel |first= Alan |date= September 8, 2010|title= Roger Federer and the History of Tennis Trick Shots |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/09/roger-federer-and-the-history-of-tennis-trick-shots/62549/ |newspaper= [[The Atlantic]] |access-date= July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarey&gt;{{cite news |last= Clarey |first= Christopher|date= August 31, 2010|title= Federer Hits His Greatest Shot Ever, A Second Time|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/sports/tennis/01federer.html?_r=0 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |access-date= July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dent&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theclassical.org/articles/everybodys-doing-the-tweener|title= Everybody's Doing the Tweener |last1= Dent |first1= Mark |date= May 10, 2012|website= theclassical.org |publisher= |access-date= July 6, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of the backward shot is unclear; both Argentine Guillermo Vilas and French player Yannick Noah claim to have invented it. Both players used it somewhat regularly in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarey/&gt; Vilas was inspired by an advertisement where a [[polo]] player hit a backwards shot between his horse's hind legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = La vidriera |author = |work= [[La Nación]] |date= 20 September 2006 |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/archivo/Nota.asp?nota_id=841879 |accessdate = 20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted his version in a 1974 exhibition match at the courts of Obras Sanitarias Club in Buenos Aires. Then he employed it in an official match in Indianapolis the following year against the spaniard player [[Manuel Orantes]]; the shot became known as the "Gran Willy" ("the great willy") after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Vilas volvió a hacer la "Gran Willy" a cien metros de la primera vez|trans-title = Vilas has returned to make the "Gran Willy" a hundred meters from the first time|work = Diario Buenos Aires|date = 8 December 2006|url = http://www.diariobuenosaires.com.ar/nota2.asp?IDNoticia=17666|accessdate = 20 January 2008|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008183031/http://www.diariobuenosaires.com.ar/nota2.asp?IDNoticia=17666|archivedate = 8 October 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian Ilie Năstase, who pioneered a backward over-the-shoulder shot known as the "[[Bucharest Backfire]]", also executed the backward tweener during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarey/&gt;

In the 1980s, players employing the backward tweener shot included the German player [[Boris Becker]], the Swede [[Stefan Edberg]], and Argentine [[Gabriela Sabatini]], whose version became known as "the Sabatweenie". American [[Andre Agassi]] used it in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt; In the 21st century, Swiss player Roger Federer hit tweeners on several notable occasions, further popularizing the shot. He successfully hit a backward tweener for a [[Glossary of tennis#W|winner]] to give himself [[Glossary of tennis#M|match point]] in the [[2009 US Open – Men's Singles|2009 US Open]] semifinal, which he called "the greatest shot I ever hit in my life."&lt;ref name=Grasso/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-1213286/US-OPEN-2009-VIDEO--This-greatest-shot-admits-Roger-Federer-beating-Novak-Djokovic.html Roger Federer: "It's the greatest shot I ever hit in my life]. Mail Online. 14 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Federer has also used front-facing tweeners on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federer hits through-the-legs winner at Qatar Open|author =|publisher = ESPN|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=tennis&amp;id=5987714|accessdate = 6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= White |first= Jim |date= July 2, 2015 |title= Wimbledon 2015: Roger Federer delights centre court in Sam Querrey demolition |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/11714260/Wimbledon-2015-Roger-Federer-delights-centre-court-in-Sam-Querrey-demolition.html |newspaper= The Telegraph |access-date= July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high jump front-facing tweener was also notably executed by [[Mary Pierce]] during the quarter finals of the 2000 French Open.

The '''World Hockey Association Hall of Fame''' is an independent organization dedicated to honoring the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) which operated from 1972 to 1979 as a major professional [[ice hockey]] league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidehockey.com/wha-hall-of-fame-recalls-greatness WHA Hall of Fame Recalls Greatness | INSIDE HOCKEY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatesthockeylegends.com/2010/08/wha-hall-of-fame.html Greatest Hockey Legends.com: WHA Hall of Fame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially partnered with the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]], the WHA Hall of Fame permanent museum displays are located within the United States Hall of Fame museum in [[Eveleth, Minnesota]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whahof.com/whaexhibits.html WHA HOF Exhibits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with touring displays made available to be viewed at select locations and for special events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metronews.ca/sports/713980/sports-hall-of-fame-installs-wha-exhibit/ Sports Hall of Fame installs WHA exhibit | Metro&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballots and voting==
In 2009, the voting ballot, which had been reviewed by members of the [[Society for International Hockey Research]] and the president of the [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was distributed to former WHA players and personnel, media members, and invited hockey notables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whahof.com/hofmembers2.html WHA Hall of Fame Members 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All WHA veterans were eligible for induction.

The inaugural members of the WHA Hall of Fame were announced in 2010, with 41 indivividual members, plus [[The Howe Family]] ([[Gordie Howe|Gordie]], [[Marty Howe|Marty]], [[Mark Howe|Mark]], and [[Colleen Howe]] who were inducted as a family), making up the initial group of inductees. Eight additional individual members were inducted in 2012. The Hall of Fame also includes ten individuals as "Legends of the Game" who are included in recognition of their "significant contributions or career start in the WHA".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whahof.com/hofmembers.html WHA Hall of Fame Members&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17136">{{distinguish|text=[[Zugzwang]], meaning a situation where a chess player is forced to move and any move will disadvantage the player}}

The '''zwischenzug''' ([[German language|German]]: {{IPA-de|ˈtsvɪʃənˌtsuːk|pron}} "intermediate move") is a [[chess]] [[Chess tactic|tactic]] in which a player, instead of playing the expected move (commonly a {{chessgloss|recapture}}), first interposes another move posing an immediate threat that the opponent must answer, and only then plays the expected move {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=460}} {{harvcol|Golombek|1977|p=354}}. It is a move that has a high degree of "[[Initiative (chess)|initiative]]". Ideally, the zwischenzug changes the situation to the player's advantage, such as by gaining {{chessgloss|material}} or avoiding what would otherwise be a strong continuation for the opponent.

Such a move is also called an ''intermezzo'' {{harvcol|Cox|2007|p=216}}, ''intermediate move'' {{harvcol|Kasparov|2008|p=208}}, or ''in-between move'' {{harvcol|Burgess|1997|p=494}} {{harvcol|Horowitz|Reinfeld|1954|pp=180–97}}. When the intermediate move is a [[check (chess)|check]], it is sometimes called an "in-between check" {{harvcol|Horowitz|Reinfeld|1954|pp=183–85}}, "zwischenschach" {{harvcol|van Perlo|2006|p=479}}, or "zwischen-check" {{harvcol|Mednis|1997|p=270}}.

As with any fairly common chess tactic, it is impossible to pinpoint when the first zwischenzug was played. Three early examples are Lichtenhein–[[Paul Morphy|Morphy]], [[New York City|New York]] 1857; [[Samuel Rosenthal|Rosenthal]]–[[Cecil De Vere|De Vere]], Paris 1867; and [[Savielly Tartakower|Tartakower]]–[[José Raúl Capablanca]], [[New York City|New York]] 1924. The first known use of the term zwischenzug, however, did not occur until 1933, when the prolific [[United States|American]] chess authors [[Fred Reinfeld]] and [[Irving Chernev]] used it in their book ''Chess Strategy and Tactics''.

No one knows when the first zwischenzug was played, but it was evident long before the term itself existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Master (chess)|National Master]] Dennis Monokroussos observes that "just because authors didn't use the ''word'' 'zwischenzug' doesn't mean they didn't use the ''concept'' – perhaps they simply used 'in-between move' instead". [http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/posts/1145816614.shtml Fred Reinfeld and the Zwischenzug] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807155148/http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/posts/1145816614.shtml |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One early example was Lichtenhein–Morphy, New York 1857.&lt;ref name="ChessgamesLichtenhein-Morphy"&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1224554 Lichtenhein–Morphy, New York 1857]&lt;/ref&gt; In the diagram at right, White has just captured Black's [[knight (chess)|knight]] on e4 and surely expected the recapture 10...dxe4 11.0-0, when White's king is safe and he has the better [[pawn structure]]. Morphy, the strongest player of the day, instead played the zwischenzug 10...Qh4!&lt;ref name="GoldsbyLichtenhein-Morphy"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028044450/http://www.geocities.com/lifemasteraj/lich-morp1.html Lichtenhein–Morphy, First American Chess Congress, 1857]&lt;/ref&gt; Now White cannot save the bishop, since a move like 11.Bf3?? is met by 11...Qxf2#.&lt;ref name="GoldsbyLichtenhein-Morphy"/&gt; Moreover, 11.0-0 would be met by 11...Qxe4 12.Nc3 Qg6 (not 12... Qh4? 13. Nxd5!), when "Black has the [[bishop pair|two bishops]] and a compact position without serious weakness" {{harvcol|Reinfeld|Soltis|1974|p=53}}. Instead, White correctly played 11.Qe2 (forcing Black to weaken his [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]]), but then erred with 11...dxe4 12.Be3? (after 12.0-0!, Black has only a slight advantage)&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Chess Openings'', Volume C, Third Edition, Šahovski Informator, 1997, p. 301 n.72.&lt;/ref&gt; Bg4! 13.Qc4?

Rosenthal–De Vere, Paris 1867,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1255356 Rosenthal–De Vere, Paris 1867]&lt;/ref&gt; is another 19th-century example of a zwischenzug {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=107–8}}. De Vere (Black) had earlier [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrificed]] a [[chess piece|piece]] for two pawns. White has just played 16.Bxb4. Instead of recapturing with 16...Qxb4+, De Vere first played the zwischenzug (specifically, a zwischenschach) 16...Rc1+! After 17.Kd2 Rxf1 18.Qxf1 Qxb4+ 19.Ke2 Qxf4 20.Qg1 Nxe5, De Vere's zwischenzug had netted him two more pawns, leaving him with the {{chessgloss|material|material advantage}} of [[Chess piece relative value|four pawns for a knight]]. White resigned after twelve more moves.

Another prominent example that brought the concept of zwischenzug, albeit not the term itself, to public attention was Tartakower–Capablanca, New York 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1076242 Tartakower–Capablanca, New York 1924]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a game won by the reigning [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] at one of the strongest [[tournament]]s of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chessmetrics]] ranks New York 1924 as the ninth strongest tournament between 1900 and 1930. [http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=190030SS3SS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 Strongest Tournaments 1900–1930] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530234656/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=190030SS3SS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 |date=May 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the position at right, Tartakower (White) has just played 9. Bxb8, thinking he has caught Capablanca in a trap: if 9...Rxb8, 10.Qa4+ and 11.Qxb4 wins a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] {{harvcol|Tartakower|du Mont|1975|p=295}}. However, Capablanca sprang the zwischenzug 9...Nd5!, protecting his bishop and also threatening 10...Ne3+, [[fork (chess)|forking]] White's [[king (chess)|king]] and [[queen (chess)|queen]]. After Tartakower's 10.Kf2 Rxb8, Capablanca had regained his piece and went on to win in 20 more moves. Note that after 10.Bf4 (instead of 10.Kf2), Black would not play 10...Nxf4??, which would still allow 11.Qa4+, winning a piece. Instead, after 10.Bf4 Black would play a second zwischenzug, 10...Qf6!, attacking the bishop again, and also renewing the threat of 11...Ne3+ {{harvcol|Alekhine|1961|p=208 note h}} {{harvcol|Reinfeld|1974|p=230}}. After a move like 11.Qc1, Black could either take the bishop or consider yet a third zwischenzug with 11...Bd6.

Alekhine, Reinfeld, and Tartakower and du Mont do not call 9...Nd5! a "zwischenzug" in their books (originally published in 1925, 1942, and 1952, respectively). Instead, they refer to it as, respectively, "a bit of finesse", a "sly interpolation", and an "intermediary manoeuvre" {{harvcol|Alekhine|1961|p=208 note e}} {{harvcol|Reinfeld|1974|p=230}} {{harvcol|Tartakower|du Mont|1975|p=296}}.
 
The earliest known use of the term zwischenzug did not occur until after all of these games. According to chess historian [[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], the first known use was in 1933.&lt;ref name="WinterEarliestOccurrences"&gt;[http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/earliest.html Edward Winter, Earliest Occurrences of Chess Terms]. Retrieved on 2009-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Reinfeld and Irving Chernev, annotating the game [[Max Euwe]]–[[Gyula Breyer]], Vienna 1921, called Breyer's 27th move, 27...Nge3!, "an important ''Zwischenzug''" {{harvcol|Reinfeld|Chernev|1933|p=48}}.

In [[World Chess Championship 2013#Game 5, Carlsen–Anand, 1–0|game 5]] of the [[World Chess Championship 2013|2013 World Chess Championship]] match, [[Magnus Carlsen|Carlsen]] had captured a bishop with 20.cxb6, and [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]] maintained material balance by capturing a knight with 20...fxe4, also attacking White's bishop (see diagram). Instead of immediately taking the pawn with 21.Bxe4, which would have given Anand the opportunity to fix his queenside pawn weaknesses with 21...axb6, Carlsen played the zwischenzug 21.b7. After the necessary 21...Rab8 and 22.Bxe4 Rxb7 Anand's a- and c-pawns remained [[Isolated pawn|isolated]]. Black's weaker pawn structure was an important factor to Carlsen's initiative in this first decisive game of the match.
