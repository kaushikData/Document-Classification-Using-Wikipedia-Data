'''Adiadochokinesia''' is a [[dyskinesia]] consisting of inability to perform the rapid alternating movements of [[diadochokinesia]]. Called also ''adiadochocinesia'', ''adiadochokinesis'', and ''adiadokokinesia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095351272|title=Adiadochokinesia - Oxford Reference|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare with [[dysdiadochokinesia]], which is an impairment of the ability to perform rapidly alternating movements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5155">{{About|the Indo-European augment|the Bantu augment|Augment (Bantu languages)}}
In [[linguistics]], the '''augment''' is a [[syllable]] added to the beginning of the word in certain [[Indo-European languages]], most notably [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages]] such as [[Sanskrit]], to form the past tenses.

==Indo-European languages==
[[historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] are uncertain whether the augment is a feature that was added to some branches of Indo-European or whether the augment was present in the parent language and lost by all other branches (see also [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]]).

===Greek===
====Ancient Greek====
In [[Ancient Greek]], the verb [[wikt:λέγω#Ancient Greek|λέγω]] ''légo'' “I say” has the aorist ἔλεξα ''élexa'' “I said”. The initial ε ''e'' is the augment. When it comes before a consonant, it is called the "syllabic augment" because it adds a syllable. Sometimes the syllabic augment appears before a vowel because the initial consonant of the verbal root (usually [[digamma]]) was lost:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek Grammar''. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2Vo_uni.htm#429 par. 429]: syllabic augment.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *έ-ϝιδον *''é-widon'' → (loss of digamma) *ἔιδον *''éidon'' → ([[synaeresis]]) εἶδον ''eîdon''

When the augment is added before a vowel, the augment and the vowel are [[crasis|contracted]] and the vowel becomes [[vowel length|long]]: ''[[wikt:ἀκούω#Ancient Greek|akoúō]]'' "I hear", ''ē&amp;#769;kousa'' "I heard". It is sometimes called the "temporal augment" because it increases the time needed to pronounce the vowel.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2Vo_uni.htm#435 par. 435]: temporal augment.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homeric Greek====
In [[Homer]], [[past tense|past-tense]] ([[aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist]] or [[imperfect]]) verbs appeared both with and without an augment.
*{{lang|grc|ὣς φάτο — ὣς ἔφατο}}&lt;br&gt;hō&amp;#768;s pháto — hō&amp;#768;s éphato&lt;br&gt;"so he/she said"
*{{lang|grc|ἦμος δ᾿ ἠριγένεια '''φάνη''' ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς,}}&lt;br&gt;êmos d' ērigéneia '''phánē''' rhododáktulos Ēō&amp;#769;s,&lt;br&gt;"And when rose-fingered Dawn appeared, early-born,"

====Modern Greek====
Unaccented syllabic augment disappeared during the [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine period]] as a result of the loss of unstressed initial syllables.&lt;!-- see the [[Medieval_Greek#Grammar]] article without have references.--&gt; However, accented syllabic augments remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Robert (1983). Medieval and Modern Greek (p58).&lt;/ref&gt; So Ancient ἔλυσα, ἐλύσαμεν "I loosened, we loosened" corresponds to Modern έλυσα, λύσαμε (''élisa'', ''lísame'').&lt;ref&gt;Sophroniou, S.A. ''Modern Greek''. Teach Yourself Books, 1962, Sevenoaks, p79.&lt;/ref&gt; Temporal augment has not survived in the vernacular, which leaves the initial vowel unaltered: Ancient ἀγαπῶ, ἠγάπησα "I love, I loved"; Modern αγαπώ, αγάπησα (''agapó'', ''agápisa'').

=== Sanskrit ===
[[Sanskrit grammar#Aorist system|Sanskrit]] had the augment अ- / ''a-'', prefixed to past-tense verbs (aorist and imperfect).
&lt;ref&gt;Coulson, Michael. ''Teach yourself Sanskrit''. p. 244. Hodder and Stoughton, 1976, Sevenoaks.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
* [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] seems to have had an augment. &lt;!-- source is the [[Phrygian language]] article --&gt;
* Classical [[Armenian language|Armenian]] had an augment,&lt;ref&gt;Clackson, James. 1994. ''The Linguistic Relationship Between Armenian and Greek.'' London: Publications of the Philological Society, No 30. (and Oxford: Blackwell Publishing)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- taken from [[Armenian language]] --&gt; in the form of [[wikt:ե-|e-]].
* [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]], an [[Eastern Iranian languages|East Iranian]] language spoken in [[Tajikistan]], has an augment. &lt;!-- source is the [[Yaghnobi language#Verb]] article --&gt;

==Non-Indo-European languages==
The term has also been extended to describe similar features in non-Indo-European languages.

In [[Nahuatl]], the perfect ''ō-'' prefix is called an augment.

In certain [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]], the term "augment" refers to the initial vowel of a noun class prefix such as (in Zulu) '''''u'''mu-'', '''''a'''ma-''. That vowel may be present or absent, according to grammatical rules.

==Constructed languages==
In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Quenya|High Elvish]], the repetition of the first vowel before the perfect (for instance ''utúlië'', perfect tense of ''túlë'', "come") is also called an augment.

'''Betoi''' (''Betoy'') or '''Betoi-Jirara''' is an extinct language of [[Venezuela]], south of the [[Apure River]] near the modern border with Colombia. The names Betoi and Jirara are those of two of its peoples/dialects; the language proper has no known name. At contact, Betoi was a local [[lingua franca]] spoken between the [[Uribante River|Uribante]] and [[Sarare River|Sarare]] rivers and along the [[Arauca River|Arauca]]. Enough was recorded for a brief grammatical monograph to be written (Zamponi 2003). 

Betoi is generally seen as an isolate, though Kaufman (2007) included it in [[Macro-Paesan]].

{{Antennas|components}}

A '''block upconverter''' ('''BUC''') is used in the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] ([[uplink]]) of [[satellite]] signals. It converts a band of [[frequencies]] from a lower frequency to a higher frequency. Modern BUCs convert from the [[L band]] to [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]], [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]]. Older BUCs convert from a 70&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]] intermediate  frequency (IF) to K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band or C band.

Most BUCs use [[phase-locked loop]] local [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s and require an external 10&amp;nbsp;MHz [[frequency reference]] to maintain the correct transmit frequency. 

BUCs used in remote locations are often 2 or 4 [[Watt|W]] in the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] and 5&amp;nbsp;W in the C band. The 10&amp;nbsp;MHz reference frequency is usually sent on the same feedline as the main [[carrier wave|carrier]]. Many smaller BUCs also get their [[direct current]] (DC) over the feedline, using an internal DC block.  	 

BUCs are generally used in conjunction with [[low-noise block converter]]s (LNB). The BUC, being an up-converting device, makes up the "transmit" side of the system, while the LNB is the down-converting device and makes up the "receive" side. An example of a system utilizing both a BUC and an LNB is a [[very small aperture terminal|VSAT]] system, used for [[duplex (telecommunications)|bidirectional]] [[Internet]] access via satellite.

The block upconverter is a block shaped device assembled with the LNB in association with an OMT, [[orthomode transducer|orthogonal mode transducer]] to the feed-horn that faces the reflector parabolic dish.  This is opposed to other types of frequency upconverter which may be rack mounted indoors or not co-located with the dish.

A '''call screener''' or '''phone screener''' is a staff member who first answers the [[phone]] when audience members call into [[TV]] or [[radio]] broadcasts.

For call-in [[talk show]]s, screeners determine the air quality of the call (good connection or not) and if the caller's comments will further the topic or add a new point.  Their job is to put the best calls on the air and filter out the callers that don't have anything worthwhile to add to the conversation. They also try to engage callers by acting as a "warm up" act for the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=SRudUtiUG6rqyQGA8YDIAQ&amp;id=poUHAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22call+screener%22+tv+radio&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22call+screener%22 |first=Susan |last=Tyler Eastman |first2=Douglas A. |last2=Ferguson |title=Broadcast/cable/web programming: strategies and practices| publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning |year=2002 |pages=423, 408–409 |isbn=9780534512958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MediaProg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Media Programming: Strategies and Practices|edition= 9th|first=Susan Tyler |last=Eastman |first2=Douglas A. |last2=Ferguson |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2012 |page=452 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeoJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA452&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9781133712145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Call screeners also typically provide a summary of pertinent information for the host or hosts to provide context for on air interaction, such as the caller's name, age, gender, location and a precis of what they intend to talk about.&lt;ref name="UniversityUniversity1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Richard|last2=Owen|first2=Diana|title=New Media and American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mN5ZC-KSTaoC&amp;pg=PA81|date=30 April 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-535303-7|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During breaking news events, screeners are responsible for verifying the caller's identity, to ensure that correct information will be presented to the news anchor. A failure here can allow an embarrassing on-air prank call through. [[Richard Roeper]] blamed call screeners in 2003 for a [[phone prank]]er getting through to [[Dan Rather]] live on-air during the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], by not checking the area code of the caller, who claimed to be an eyewitness in Texas.&lt;ref name="Roeper03"&gt;[[Richard Roeper|Roeper, Richard]] (February 4, 2003). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1476914.html "If only we'd all shut up when we've little to say"]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}} p. 11.

''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''New York Post'' article about phone prankers describes call screeners as "overburdened and generally young producers assigned to act as gate-keepers", whose tools include "simply to ask would-be callers for their phone number and make sure the area code matches up with where they say they're calling from." An [[ABC News]] spokeswoman stated, "With breaking news we make every effort to ensure the credibility of the witness before we put them on the air, but in live events, screening processes are not 100 percent effective." An "industry vet" stated, "At the very least you can catch 90 percent of them by getting their number and calling them back, generally they freak or give you a phony phone number." Other techniques described "include grilling the caller on little known facts about the situation or organization they claim to represent."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Don (August 19, 2003).

==Notable call screeners==
Although the names of most call screeners never make it on the air, there are a few notable screeners that are major characters on their shows.

* Joe Ardinger of the [[Don and Mike]] Show (said to be the oldest call screener in the world)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/97015/joe-ardinger-rejoining-don-geronimo-at-khtk |title=Joe Ardinger Rejoining Don Geronimo At KHTK |work= AllAccess.com |publisher=All Access Music Group |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable talk shows that do not use a call screeners==
Many live call-in radio shows do not like alternative or adverse opinions to be aired, going through great lengths to screen out such calls. Because of that, it is rare that a live call-in talk show does not use call screeners. 
*The Love Doctors [https://wzzr.iheart.com/featured/the-love-doctors/] is a radio show broadcast in South Florida that has not used a call screener since its inception in 1989.

'''Christian Vander''' (born 21 February 1948 in [[Nogent-sur-Marne]], Val-de-Marne) is a French drummer, musician, and founder of the band [[Magma (band)|Magma]]. Besides his work with Magma, he has also performed solo, with the [[Christian Vander Trio]] and [[Christian Vander Quartet]], and in [[Offering (band)|Offering]].

Vander is known for his extended compositions, virtuosic drumming, and shrill falsetto improvisational/scat singing. His music fuses jazz, rock, classical and operatic influences, and draws on the work of musicians as diverse as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Carl Orff]]. Vander's music is broadly classified as [[progressive rock]], but the style is so unusual that it falls under its own category – an idiosyncratic style of music often referred to by fans as [[Zeuhl]] (which means "celestial" in [[Kobaïan]], a [[constructed language]] devised by Vander and used exclusively by Magma). There have been several other bands who have incorporated Zeuhl stylings into their compositions, many of which are composed of ex-Magma members. Some of the more notable groups of this variety include Japanese duo [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]], Magma offshoots [[Weidorje]] and [[Zao (French band)|Zao]], and Belgian chamber rock outfit [[Univers Zero]].

Christian Vander is the stepson of famous French jazz piano player [[Maurice Vander]] (who was a long time sideman of the French singer [[Claude Nougaro]]).

Most of Vander and Magma's recorded work is still available through Vander's own record label, [[Seventh Records]].

He was married to singer [[Stella Vander]] who released many [[Extended play|EP]]s herself in the 1960s and has performed vocal duties for Magma since 1972.

== Style of drumming ==

Vander uses specific rhythms - 5/8, 9/8, 7/8 with combination of 4/4 and 2/4 rhythms (inspired by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Béla Bartók|Bártók]], [[Carl Orff|Orff]]).

'''Chunking''' is a method of presenting [[information]] which splits [[concept]]s into small pieces or "chunks" of information to make [[reading (activity)|reading]] and understanding faster and easier. Chunking is especially useful for material presented on [[the web]] because readers tend to [[wikt:scan|scan]] for specific information on a [[web page]] rather than read the page sequentially.

Chunked content usually contains:
* [[bullet (typography)|bullet]]ed lists
* short sub[[wikt:heading|heading]]s
* short [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s with one or two ideas per sentence
* short [[paragraph]]s, even one-sentence paragraphs
* easily scannable [[character (computer)|text]], with [[bold]]ing of key [[phrases]]
* inline graphics to [[guide]] the [[Human eyes|eyes]] or illustrate points which would normally require more words

==Advantages of chunking==
* Chunking helps [[Technology|technical]] [[wikt:communicator|communicators]] or [[marketer]]s convey information more efficiently
* Chunking helps readers find what they are looking for quickly
* Chunking allows material to be presented consistently from page to page, so users can apply previous [[knowledge]] of [[page layout]] and [[navigation]] and focus on the content rather than the [[presentation]]

The [[bite, snack and meal]] is a popular phrase for a specific means of chunking content.

==Disadvantages of chunking==

* [[Do Not Call Register]] (Australia)
* [[National Do Not Call List]] (Canada)
* [[Do Not Disturb Registry|National Customer Preference Register]] (India)
* [[New Zealand Name Removal Service]]
* [[Telephone Preference Service]] (United Kingdom)

==History of the Do-Not-Call Registry==
Consistent consumer complaints spurred Congress to sign the Telephone Consumer Protection ACT (TCPA) in 1991. The TCPA outlined new restrictions on sales calls and the use of automated dialers and voicemail recordings. It also suggested the creation of a database of consumer phone numbers that shouldn’t receive unsolicited sales calls.

While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) adopted the TCPA guidelines, they chose not to move forward with the establishment of the phone number database.

That changed on June 27, 2003, when the FTC finally set up the Do-Not-Call Registry. Consumers could now register their phone number, and after 31 days unsolicited calls to that number were prohibited and punishable with a fine.

Within just 4 days, over 10 million phone numbers had been registered. By the registry’s seventh birthday (2010) that number had topped 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoneburner.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-do-not-call-registry/ |title=A Comprehensive Guide to the Do-Not-Call Registry |date= |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal Do-Not-Call Lists==

Do not call lists also exist internally.  Entities making calls must honor requests from residential telephone subscribers not to receive calls, and must record the request, and the subscriber's name and telephone number, on its internal "do-not-call" list. The request must be honored within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days of the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compliancepoint.com/rc-articles-what-needs-to-be-in-your-internal-do-not-call-policy-and-when-must-you-provide-it/ |title=What Needs to be in Your Internal Do Not Call Policy and When Must You Provide It? |date= |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This die was held in place by a handle with an obliteration marker, often oval shaped, off to the right side that was applied over the postage stamp to prevent its reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linnsstampnews.com/howto/refresher/postmarks_20020401/refreshercourse.aspx |title=Postmarks, cancels offer challenge and fun |publisher=[[Linn's Stamp News]]|last=Klug |first=Janet }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ink came from an ink pad.

In many countries the [[Coded postal obliterators|obliterator part of the canceller]] was coded, in various ways, to identify the post office.

In the United States, they were first used in the 1860s and use continued into the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usstamps.org/glossary-term/duplex/ |title=Glossary of Terms for the Collector of United States Stamps |publisher=[[United States Stamp Society]] |accessdate=2017-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some machine cancelling devices like the French [[Daguin machine]] or the Italian [[Dani Machine]] also applied both the "killer" and the date stamp simultaneously. Especially in the Italian literature (and in German literature about Italian cancels) these cancelling devices are referred as '''duplex cancel'''.

'''Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma''' ([[West Frisian language|Frisian]] form: Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma, pron. [ˈeːlʧǝ ˈhɪdəs ˈhɔlbǝtsma] (the r is silent); [[Dutch language|Dutch]] form: '''Eeltje Hiddes Halbertsma''', pron. [ˈeːlcǝ ˈhɪdəs ˈhalbǝrtsma]) ([[Grou]], October 8, 1797 – there, March 22, 1858),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Dutch [[West Frisians|Frisian]] writer, poet and physician,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 592–594.&lt;/ref&gt; and the youngest of the [[Halbertsma Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; He became well known when he and his elder brother [[Justus Hiddes Halbertsma|Justus]] published the [[poetry collection|poetry]] and [[short story collection]] ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'' in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, this work was continually expanded, and also came to include contributions by a third brother, [[Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma|Tsjalling]],&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; until all the Halbertsma Brothers' [[prose]] and poetry was posthumously collected in 1871 to become the famous work ''[[Rimen en Teltsjes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 603–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; This book played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a [[spoken language]] for three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three Brothers Halbertsma, Eeltsje was probably the most talented, en especially his poetry is still very much admired.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 592–594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Work of art|oeuvre]] included the poem ''[[De Alde Friezen]]'', which later became the [[national anthem]] of the [[West Frisians|Western Frisian people]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fryslân Sjongt'', pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Youth and background===
Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma was born on October 8, 1797,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; in his parents' house on Kowemerk ("Cow Market") street&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; in the village of [[Grou]], in the central part of the Dutch province of [[Friesland]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth son of the baker and small-time [[merchant]]&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756–1809)&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk)&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsjallings Binnerts (1767–1809).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He had three elder brothers: [[Justus Hiddes Halbertsma|Justus ("Joast")]] (1789–1869),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma|Tsjalling]] (1792–1852),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and Binnert (1795–1847).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Two children who were born later died in early childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; the little boy in 1803,&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the little girl in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Eeltsje was only eleven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the [[Brothers Halbertsma]] later in life,&lt;ref&gt;Hemminga, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

This mother, Ruerdtsje Binnerts, was a scion of a prominent family in Grou.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Her people were [[Mennonites]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and although her husband had been raised a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], he converted after marrying her.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; From the letters of Eeltsje's brother Justus Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a [[mariner]] before his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, he published a long [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] poem under the title ''Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland'' ("Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in [[Gelderland]]").&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents ran in the family.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Like his elder brother Justus, Eeltsje Halbertsma was sent to the French school in the provincial capital of [[Leeuwarden]] for a year by his mother,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; and after that, he was enrolled in the [[Latin school]], also in Leeuwarden.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; There, he started following lessons probably just before Ruerdtsje Binnerts' death in December 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; As their father, Hidde Halbertsma, hat died in January of that same year, the brothers became [[orphan]]s because of this unfortunate event.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Justus, the eldest brother, was studying in [[Amsterdam]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Eeltsje could continue his education in the Latin school because the middle brothers, Tsjalling and Binnert, kept their father's bakery running with the help of their father's baker's mates.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[commuter|commuting]] from Grou to Leeuwarden and back again on a daily basis was out of the question with roads and transportation being what they were at that time, Eeltjse [[boarding house|boarded]] in the city with one Hawerdink, an acquaintance of his brother Justus, who apparently introduced him to the most vulgar form of [[Stadsfries dialects|City Frisian]], a Dutch (not Frisian) dialect which is spoken in the cities in Friesland.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he had finished his training in the Latin school, towards the end of 1814,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Eeltsje Halbertsma left for [[Holland]], where he started a study of medicine at the [[University of Leiden]] which lasted until April 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the student city of [[Leiden]], however, he became caught up in the rough night life,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; and that was why, by way of reorientation, he left for [[Heidelberg]], in Germany, for half a year in the spring of 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, pp. 296–297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; There he enjoyed himself tremendously at the [[Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg|Ruprecht-Karls-Universität]], and later in his life he always looked back on his Heidelberg period with a sense of whistfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The lessons he followed in Heidelberg for the most part had to do with [[obstetrics]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; After the summer, he returned to Leiden, where he ended his study by obtaining his doctorate in medicine on October 13, 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Halbertsma became physician in [[Purmerend]], in [[North Holland|northern Holland]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; where he lived for a year and a half,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; and also became involved with a local girl whom he referred to as "the Little Peacock" in his letters to his brother Justus.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, though, he became ill, and was brought back to his family in Grou, probably towards the end of 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; When he had recovered, he did not go back to Holland, but instead started a practice in the village where he was born. He would spend the rest of his life there,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; because, he wrote to his brother Justus, "Grou is alway lovely to me."&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his good education, but also because of his compassionate bedside manner, Halbertsma had a very spread-out practice, with patients not only in Grou, but also scattered around the [[countryside]] and in neighbouring villages. This required him to travel a lot, for which he often had to depend on boats in the marshy lake country of Central Friesland.&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and views===
From stories of people who knew him, Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma emerges as a man who was quickly moved, but could also have a lot of fun.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff, who was acquainted with him for many years, Halbertsma was big-hearted and generous, and a droll story-teller.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Halbertsma's biographers described him as "a fine-feeling spirit, an idealistic dreamer, an independent and courageous man, afflicted by periods of [[depression (mood)|melancholy]] and [[doubt]]; a ''[[bohémien]]'' and a rascal, such as there has been no second of in all of Western Frisian literature."&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Halbertsma's letters to his brother Justus are lively and open-hearted, and also quite entertaining still.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; As for his views, Halbertsma had become influenced by [[Deism]] in his student days, but according to himself he had changed his opinion after reading the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics Halbertsma tried to stay away from. In the company of others he was sometimes seduced into speaking on that subject, but he was always afraid to say too much; his father had been a supporter of the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriot movement]], and Halbertsma could never forget how badly that had ended.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; For all that, he did not just stand by when his sense of justice was violated, as is shown by his poems ''De Grytman'' ("The [[Grietman]]"; about corruption in the political upper classes in Friesland) and ''Batthyany's Dea'' ("Batthyany's Death"; about the execution of [[Lajos Batthyány]], the leader of the [[Hungarians]] in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848–49|Hungarian Rebellion of 1848–1849]]).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote, in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a poem in which he rages against the fact that Frisian members of the [[Tweede Kamer]] voted against the proposal to abolish [[slavery]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he was not so progressive that he felt himself in any way connected with those he called, in 1855, "red democrats" (that is to say socialists and other political [[political radicalism|radicals]]), whom he separated from "the decent-minded", with which he meant the progressive, liberal section of the settled middle class, to which he himself belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, Halbertsma became a member of the Provinciaal Friesch Genootschap ter Beoefening van Friesche Geschied-, Oudheid- en Taalkunde ("Provincial Frisian Society for the Study of Frisian History, Antiquities and Linguistics"), but in 1834, he cancelled his membership because he felt this club was full to the rafters with silly people.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Schaaf, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He could not stomach the affected poshness of the middle class gentlemen, and neither could he reconcile such graveness of bearing with the 'gluttony and wine-guzzling' which followed the gatherings. "''Es gibt Narren aller Art''" ("It takes fools of all kinds"), he wrote to his brother Justus.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Schaaf, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Justus did stay a member of the society, but because he was a [[Mennonites|Mennonite]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] in [[Deventer]], in the province of [[Overijssel]], and was therefore mostly a member by correspondence, it was somewhat easier for him to look at things with a certain detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Schaaf, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Eeltsje Halbertsma became a member of the Selskip foar Fryske Taal en Skriftekennisse ("Society for Knowledge of Frisian Language and Literature"), where he felt much more at home.&lt;sup&gt;[source needed]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Family===
In June 1823, Halbertsma married Baukje Fockens (1795–1877),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; a woman from a well-to-do family from [[Bolsward]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had met in the autumn of 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of Livius (Liuwe) Regnerus Fockens, a mayor of Bolsward who had died not long before.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Halbertsma and his wife had four children: two sons and two daughters. Only their son Hidde would survive his father, as the other son, Liuwe, died in 1854, and both of the girls, Ruerdtsje and Anna, were laid to rest yn 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Anna (1832–1851), with whom he was exceptionally close, hit Halbertsma especially hard; about this loss he wrote the touching poem ''Op Anna's Dea'' ("On Anna's Death"),&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in 1854, in the poetry and short story collection ''Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen'' ("Grief and Pleasure and Down Upon the Lee Shore").&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1958, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halbertsma's marriage was, after the first few years,&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; not very happy,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; as he was much too fond of alcohol,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; while his wife nagged constantly, was distrustful and reproached him continuously for living off her money.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore probably not coincidental that in several of Halbertsma's stories the main characters are a drunken man and his angry wife.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, when both marriage partners had neglected their household for years, the parents were placed under [[guardianship]] by both of their sons, which was done especially on the initiative of Liuwe.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Halbertsma managed to become his own master again in 1857, this was a humiliation for which it was not easy for him to forgive his son, and there is no [[elegy]] for Liuwe's passing in 1854, as Halbertsma did make for both of his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing career===
Halbertsma felt the drive to write for the first time, as his brother [[Justus Hiddes Halbertsma|Justus]] would later tell it, when he came back from his half-year in [[Heidelberg]], and noticed that the [[song|street song]]s in the [[Netherlands]] were of a very low quality compared to those in Germany. According to Justus, Eeltsje Halbertsma set out writing poetry to replace the existing songs with better ones of his own making.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[linguist]] Philippus H. Breuker, who added an extensive and penetrating [[afterword]] to the [[reprint]] of ''[[Rimen en Teltsjes]]'' of 1993, observed, however, that this assertion could "never be more than half the truth," as Halbertsma's early poetry was not of a high literary value; quite the opposite, in fact. According to Breuker, it seems more likely that Halbertsma wanted to emulate these Dutch street songs.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, he must have come under the influence of Justus' ideas, who wanted to preserve the [[Western Frisian language]] by reintroducing it for writing after it had been used almost exclusively as a [[spoken language]] for three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Boelens et al., p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; From that it followed that Justus had to get the Frisians to read in their own language (otherwise, writing it would not be of much use), and to achieve that aim, he set out writing the sort of [[folk literature]] which dovetailed nicely with Eeltsje Halbertsma's work.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; As Justus remained the editor of Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and [[short fiction]] were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; Although writing short stories and poems was something which Eeltsje Halbertsma could not do without, from approximately 1830 onwards the social prestige he won with it also started to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, the best of the early works of Eeltsje and Justus were collected under the title ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'' ("Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket"; original, archaic [[spelling]]: ''De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor''), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt; Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; A second, expanded edition of ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'', consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 5, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (''De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar''), 1840 (''Twigen út in Alde Stamme''), 1854 (''Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen''), and 1858 (''De Jonkerboer'' and ''Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonstêd'').&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1958, p. 589-594.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eeltsje Halbertsma was almost certainly the most talented of the three writing [[Halbertsma Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 592–594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; While Tsjalling's works were purely intended for entertainment, and Justus composed his stories and poetry in a somewhat distant, cerebral way, which keeps the reader a little detached from what is read, Eeltsje put his soul and heart into his poems and stories.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this [[emotion]] which brings his work closer to the reader. Furthermore, Eeltsje's prose and poetry are in proportion to each other, qualitatively, while in Justus' works the poetry is generally quite clearly not of the same high standing as his prose.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 20th century the author and [[literary critic]] Anne Wadman stated that Eeltsje was the greatest poet of his time in the Netherlands; as neither [[Willem Bilderdijk]] nor [[Isaäc da Costa]] were fit to hold a candle to him (he wrote), one would look invain for someone of the same stature in the [[Dutch literature]] of that period.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of [[Romanticism]], which he had acquired in [[Heidelberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Eeltsje Halbertsma often needed a first impulse for his works, an existing text or melody that he could, as he himself put it, [[Western Frisian language|frisify]] "in such a way that no one could recognise the original anymore."&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this it is thought that the masterful ''Jonker Pyt en Sibbel'' ("Squire Pete and Sibylle") could possibly be a much improved version of the Dutch-language poem ''Steedsche Jonker en een Friessche Boerin'' ("City Squire and a Frisian Farmer's Wife"), from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It is beyond dispute that Halbertsma based some of his poetry on earlier works by such poets as [[Johann Peter Hebel]] and [[Ludwig Hölty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''De Boalserter Merke'' ("The Bolsward Fair"), still one of his most well-known works, is a ''Nachdichtung'' of Hebel's lovesong ''Hans und Verene'', in which the main characters were renamed Hoatse and Wobbel, the background was shifted from a German well to a [[fair]] in the Frisian city of [[Bolsward]], and quite a few smaller changes were made.&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a poem based on Hölty's work is the somewhat morbid ''Deagraverssankje'' ("Grave-digger's Song").&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Halbertsma often wrote [[idyll]]ic poems in his early years, such as ''It Marke'' ("The Little Lake") and ''Geale' Sliepke'' ("Geale's Nap"), and, to a lesser degree, ''It Famke'' ("The Girl"), later the circumstances of his family life and professional difficulties so depressed him that he wrote, "you [will] find in my last works nothing of that [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]]."&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In its place came moving [[elegy|elegies]], such as ''De Likeblommen'' ("The [[Leek, Netherlands|Leek]] Flowers"), ''Op Anna's Dea'' ("On Anna's Death"), and ''It Tsjerkhôf by Jûntiid'' ("The Churchyard in the Evening"), and also poems such as ''It Libbensein'' ("Life's End"), and ''Deagraverssankje'' ("Grave-digger's Song"), which reflect upon the transitory nature of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Halbertsma was, however, also the author of the mildly humorous ''Ald Jan-om'' ("Old Uncle John"), in which a farm-hand of advanced years complains of the farmer's daughter's constant stream of suitors, who are always getting in his way,&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1958, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the love poem ''Skipperssankje'' ("Skipper's Song"), an entreaty of a [[mariner]] to his beloved to not forget him, even if his ship should sink and he should drown.&lt;ref&gt;''Fryslân Sjongt'', p. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; The appreciation for Halbertsma's strongly [[retorics|retorical]] [[hymn|freedom hymns]] has eroded in the course of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt; but even so, the [[nationalism|nationalistic]] song ''[[De Alde Friezen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Fryslân Sjongt'', p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 17, 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; is still the [[national anthem]] of the [[Western Frisian people]], which it was proclaimed to be yn 1875 (in a thoroughly revised version by Jacobus van Loon).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fryslân Sjongt'', p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroor, p. 2831.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[prose]] Halbertsma shows himself to be a smooth story-teller, occasionally using a poetic-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] approach, such as in the story ''Utfanhûs by de Boer'' ("Staying the Night on the Farm"), at other times becoming [[irony|ironic]], such as in ''De Klúnskonk fan Us Ald Dominy'' ("The Skate-walking Leg of Our Old Minister").&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar'' ("The [[Norg]] Gelding to Gabe Tailor"), which has the form of a letter from the afterlife to Gabe Tailor, written by his dead horse, is a satire, while in ''De Reis nei de Jichtmasters'' ("The Journey to the Gout Masters") Halbertsma uses mild humour and a little mockery to poke fun at his own medical profession.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer story ''De Jonkerboer'' ("The Gentleman Farmer"), which some [[literary critic|critics]] call a novella,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt; the main [[motif (literature)|motif]] is a longing for a peaceful and diligent existence in the country-side.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; That same feeling is also embodied by ''De Quickborn'' ("The Quickborn"), a choice of poems Halbertsma translated very freely from the poetry collection of the same name which was originally written in the [[Low German language|Low German]] [[dialect]] of the northern German region of [[Dithmarschen]] by [[Klaus Groth]].&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Grou, Dr. Eeltsje Halbertsma Earebyld.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The statue of Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma in [[Grou]].]]

Striking things about Eeltsje Halbertsma's literary works are the wonderful sound patterns in some of his poems, especially ''Geale' Sliepke'' ("Geale's Nap"),&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and his playful additions of phrases in other languages or dialects, which occur mostly in his stories, but also in some poems, like ''Jonker Pyt and Sibbel'' ("Squire Pete and Sibylle"), where the [[squire]] has just returned from fashionable France, and now believes it shows his breeding and social status to throw around French words and phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1993, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Gibberish]], odd names, strange types of people, [[filler (linguistics)|stopgap word]]s, [...] the most surprising [[metaphor]]s, and the most unexpected jumps in a [[train of thought]],"&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; all of this occurs regularly in Halbertsma's prose.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt; In his works he is guided by the ideal image he had in his mind of the Western Frisians as simple but genuine people, which he contrasts against the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], who were in his eyes refined but insincere.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
In his last years there was not much which connected Halbertsma to the village of [[Grou]]. Because of his unhappy marriage, he could not find solace at home,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; and the death of his daughter Anna, in 1851, had made him lose his cheerfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year his brother [[Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma|Tsjalling]] also died, who had been the steadfast centre of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; That is why Eeltsje, after he had transferred his medical practice to his son Hidde in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; started a wandering life visiting family members who lived far away.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he lived for little while by himself in [[Leeuwarden]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; but a few weeks before his death he arranged to be brought back to Grou.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; He died there on March 22, 1858, when he was sixty years old.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in a double-deep grave which later came to lie outside of the churchyard boundaries, and is now marked by three red stones in an otherwise yellow-paved pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After the death of all three [[Brothers Halbertsma]], their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in [[Deventer]], under the title of ''[[Rimen en Teltsjes]]'' ("Rhymes and Tales").&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 603–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature,&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and although the [[literature|literary]] value of this collection was later disputed by some [[literary critic|critcs]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, pp. 594–596.&lt;/ref&gt; it is undeniable that ''Rimen en Teltsjes'' and its predecessor ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'' played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave "the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected."&lt;ref&gt;Wadman, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As of today ''Rimen en Teltsjes'' still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the tenth [[reprint]] of the book was published, including for the first time some (earlier, lower-quality) work of Eeltsje Halbertsma which had until then remained outside of ''Rimen en Teltsjes''.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 1993, p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; This reprint had a (for Western Frisian literature) ambitious printing of 3,000 copies, but was sold out within two months.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker 2016, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Selskip foar Fryske Taal en Skriftekennisse hired the sculptor Willem Molkenboer in 1875, to make a [[stone tablet]] in which the likeness of Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma was chiselled out. This was placed as a [[gable stone]] in the front wall of the house where the Halbertsma Brothers were born, on what later was renamed Halbertsmaplein ("Halbertsma Square").&lt;ref&gt;Koopmans, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, another stone tablet by the same artist was added to the left with the likeness of [[Justus Hiddes Halbertsma]].&lt;ref&gt;Koopmans, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1903 the Selskip ordered a [[statue]] of Eeltsje Halbertsma to be made and placed on Parkstrjitte ("Park Street") in Grou,&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] on a more than man-high [[limestone]] [[column]] resting on a [[pedestal]] of [[granite]], made by Johan Schröder.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription reads: "TO D&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; EELTSJE HIDDES HALBERTSMA", with on the back of the column: "''Ljeaf bliuwe ús Fryske tael en liet.''" ("Beloved to us remain the Western Frisian language and its songs.")&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European quadriga''' is the designation of the quadrumvirate representing the [[European Union]] in its foreign relations, in particular with [[Greece]] concerning its common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The formerly known [[European troika|Troika]] is now being renamed as "Quadriga", to note the inclusion of the [[European Stability Mechanism]] (ESM) in the talks specially with the new Greek project of a third aid program amounting to 86 billion euros due to start on 20 August 2015.
 
"Quadriga" is the name inspired by Commission President, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] for the new Greek project and creditors have now added the ESM to their collective and rebranded themselves "The Quadriga."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-27/goodbye-troika-germany-rides-its-greek-colony-quadriga |title=Goodbye Troika: Germany Rides Into Its Greek Colony On The "Quadriga" |publisher=Zero Hedge |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While talking about the quadriga (especially in the media) one refers to a decision group formed by the [[European Commission]] (EC), the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the newly added European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

[[Image:Sample Floorplan.jpg|thumb|320px|Sample floor plan for a [[single-family detached home]]]]{{views}}
In [[architecture]] and [[building engineering]], a '''floor plan''' is a drawing to [[Scale (ratio)|scale]], showing a view from above, of the relationships between rooms,  spaces, traffic patterns, and other physical features at one level of a structure.

Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans may also include details of fixtures like sinks, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans may include notes for construction to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items.

It is also called a ''[[Plan view|plan]]'' which is a measured plane typically projected at the floor height of {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}}, as opposed to an ''[[Elevation (view)|elevation]]'' which is a measured plane projected from the side of a building, along its height, or a section or ''[[cross section (geometry)|cross section]]'' where a [[building]] is cut along an axis to reveal the interior structure.

==Overview==
Similar to a [[map]] the orientation of the view is downward from above, but unlike a conventional [[map]], a plan is drawn at a particular vertical position (commonly at about 4 feet above the floor). Objects below this level are seen, objects at this level are shown 'cut' in plan-section, and objects above this vertical position within the structure are omitted or shown dashed. [[Plan view]] or planform is defined as a vertical [[orthographic projection]] of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.

The term may be used in general to describe any drawing showing the physical layout of objects. For example, it may denote the arrangement of the displayed objects at an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]], or the arrangement of exhibitor booths at a [[Convention (meeting)|convention]]. Drawings are now reproduced using [[Plotter|plotters]] and large format [[xerographic]] copiers.

A ''reflected ceiling plan'' (RCP) shows a view of the room as if looking from above, through the ceiling, at a mirror installed one foot below the ceiling level, which shows the ''reflected'' image of the ceiling above. This convention maintains the same orientation of the floor and ceilings plans - looking down from above.  RCPs are used by designers and architects to demonstrate lighting, visible mechanical features, and ceiling forms as part of the documents provided for construction.

A floor plan is not a top view or [[birds eye view]].  It is a measured drawing to scale of the layout of a floor in a building.  A ''top view'' or ''bird's eye view'' does not show an orthogonally projected plane cut at the typical four foot height above the floor level.  A floor plan could show:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanjoseca.gov/planning/counter/planning_sanjose/Planning_in_San_Jose_pt3.pdf Site Plans, Elevations and Floor Plans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607213549/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/planning/counter/planning_sanjose/Planning_in_San_Jose_pt3.pdf |date=2010-06-07 }} ''A Community Guide San Jose''.

* Interior features such as fireplaces, saunas and whirlpools
* The use of all rooms

===Plan view===
A [[plan view]] is an [[orthographic projection]] of a three-dimensional object from the position of a horizontal plane through the object. In other words, a plan is a [[Cross section (geometry)|section]] viewed from the top. In such views, the portion of the object above the plane (section) is omitted to reveal what lies beyond. In the case of a floor plan, the roof and upper portion of the walls may typically be omitted. Whenever an interior design project is being approached, a floor plan is the typical starting point for any further design considerations and decisions.

Roof plans are orthographic projections, but they are not sections as their viewing plane is outside of the object.

A plan is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a three-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is often used in [[technical drawing]] and is traditionally crosshatched. The style of crosshatching indicates the type of material the section passes through. 

===3D floor plans===
A [[3D floor plan]] can be defined as a virtual model of a building floor plan. It is often used to better convey architectural plans to individuals not familiar with floor plans. Despite the purpose of floor plans originally being to depict 3D layouts in a 2D manner, technological expansion has made rendering 3D models much more cost effective. 3D plans show a better depth of image and are often complimented by 3D furniture in the room. This allows a greater appreciation of scale than with traditional 2D floor plans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8927">In [[grammar]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], '''government''' or '''rection''' refers to the relationship between a word and its dependents. One can discern between at least three concepts of government: the traditional notion of [[case government]], the highly specialized definition of government in some [[Generative grammar|generative]] models of [[syntax]], and a much broader notion in [[dependency grammar]]s.

==Traditional case government==
{{main|Case government}}
In traditional Latin and Greek (and other) grammars, government is the control by [[verb]]s and [[preposition]]s of the selection of grammatical features of other words. Most commonly, a verb or preposition is said to "govern" a specific [[grammatical case]] if its complement must take that case in a grammatically correct structure (see: [[case government]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Allerton (1979:150f) and Lockwood (2002:75ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Latin]], most [[transitive verb]]s require their [[direct object]] to appear in the [[accusative case]], while the [[dative case]] is reserved for [[indirect object]]s. Thus, the phrase ''I see you'' would be rendered as '''''Te''' video'' in Latin, using the accusative form ''te'' for the second person pronoun, and ''I give a present to you'' would be rendered as '''''Tibi donum''' do'', using both an accusative (''donum'') for the direct  and a dative (''tibi''; the dative of the second person pronoun) for the indirect object; the phrase ''I help you'', however, would be rendered as '''''Tibi''' faveo'', using only the dative form ''tibi''. The verb ''favere'' (to help), like many others, is an exception to this default government pattern: its one and only object must be in the dative. Although no direct object in the accusative is controlled by the specific verb, this object is traditionally considered to be an indirect one, mainly because [[passive voice|passivization]] is unavailiable except perhaps in an impersonal manner and for certain verbs of this type. A semantic alternation may also be achieved when different case constructions are available with a verb: '''''Id''' credo'' (''id'' is an accusative) means ''I believe this, I have this opinion'' and '''''Ei''' credo'' (''ei'' is a dative) means ''I trust this, I confide in this''.

Prepositions (and postpositions and circumpositions, i.e. [[adposition]]s) are like verbs in their ability to govern the case of their complement, and like many verbs, many adpositions can govern more than one case, with distinct interpretations. For example ''in Italy'' would be ''in '''Italia''''', ''Italia'' being an [[ablative (Latin)|ablative]] case form, but ''towards Italy'' would be ''in '''Italiam''''', ''Italiam'' being an accusative case form.

==In government and binding theory==
The abstract syntactic relation of government in [[government and binding theory]], a [[phrase structure grammar]], is an extension of the traditional notion of case government.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart (1976), Aoun and Sportiche (1983), and Chomsky (1986) are three prominent sources that established important concepts in generative grammar such as [[c-command]], m-command, and government.&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs govern their objects, and more generally, [[head (linguistics)|head]]s govern their dependents. ''A'' governs ''B'' if and only if:&lt;ref&gt;For definitions of government along the lines given here, see for instance van Riemsdijk and Williams (1987:231, 291) and Ouhalla (1994:169).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A'' is a governor (a lexical head),
* ''A'' [[m-command]]s ''B'', and
* no barrier intervenes between ''A'' and ''B''.

This definition is explained in more detail in the [[Government and binding theory#Government|government]] section of the article on government and binding theory.

==Government broadly construed==
One sometimes encounters definitions of government that are much broader than the one just produced. Government is understood  the property that regulates which words can or must appear with the referenced word.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of government construed in this broad sense, see for instance Burton-Roberts (1986:41) and Wardbaugh (2003:84).&lt;/ref&gt; This broader understanding of government is part of many [[dependency grammar]]s. The notion is that many individual words in a given sentence can appear only by virtue of the fact that some other word appears in that sentence. 

According to this definition, government occurs between any two words connected by a dependency, the dominant word opening slots for subordinate words. The dominant word is the ''governor'', and the subordinates are its ''governees''. The following dependency tree illustrates governors and governees:

:::[[File:Fred has ordered a really spicy dish for his father.jpg|Tree for illustrating government in DG]]

The word ''has'' governs ''Fred'' and ''ordered''; in other words, ''has'' is governor over its governees ''Fred'' and ''ordered''. Similarly, ''ordered'' governs ''dish'' and ''for'', that is, ''ordered'' is governor over its governees ''dish'' and ''for''; Etc. This understanding of government is widespread among dependency grammars.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Tesnière (1959), Starosta (1988:21), Engel (1994), Groß and Osborne (2009), among many others.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governors vs. heads==
The distinction between the terms ''governor'' and ''[[Head (linguistics)|head]]'' is a source of confusion, given the definitions of government produced above. Indeed, ''governor'' and ''head'' are overlapping concepts. The governor and the head of a given word will often be one and the same other word. The understanding of these concepts becomes difficult, however,  when [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]] are involved. The following example of a [[wh-movement|''w''-fronting]] discontinuity from German illustrates the difficulty:

:{|cellspacing="10"
|Wem|||denkst||du||haben||sie||geholfen?
|-
|who-DAT|||think||you||have||they||helped?||'Who do you think they helped?'
|}
Two of the criteria mentioned above for identifying governors (and governees) are applicable to the interrogative pronoun ''wem'' 'whom'. This pronoun receives dative case from the verb ''geholfen'' 'helped' (= case government) and it can appear by virtue of the fact that ''geholfen'' appears (= licensing). Given these observations, one can make a strong argument that ''geholfen'' is the governor of ''wem'', even though the two words are separated from each other by the rest of the sentence. In such constellations, one sometimes distinguishes between ''head'' and ''governor''.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the distinction between heads and governors, see Groß and Osborne (2009: 51-56).&lt;/ref&gt; So while the governor of ''wem'' is ''geholfen'', the head of ''wem'' is taken to be the finite verb ''denkst'' 'think'. In other words, when a discontinuity occurs, one assumes that the governor and the head (of the relevant word) are distinct, otherwise they are the same word. Exactly how the terms ''head'' and ''governor'' are used can depend on the particular theory of syntax that is employed.

In [[linguistics]] or any variety of [[language usage]], '''hypercorrection''' is [[Standard language|non-standard language use]] that results from the over-application of a perceived rule of [[Prescriptive grammar|language-usage prescription]]. A speaker or writer who produces a hypercorrection generally believes through a misunderstanding of these rules that the form is more correct, often combined with a desire to appear formal or educated.&lt;ref name="KGW"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilson | first =Kenneth G. | authorlink = | title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | year=1993 | location= | pages= | url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/62/3062.html | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sociolinguistic Patterns'', William Labov, [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 1972, p 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic hypercorrection occurs when a real or imagined grammatical rule is applied in an inappropriate context, so that an attempt to be "correct" leads to an incorrect result. It does not occur when a speaker follows "a natural speech instinct", according to [[Otto Jespersen]] and Robert J. Menner.&lt;ref name=menner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menner|first1=Robert J.|title=Hypercorrect forms in American English|journal=[[American Speech]]|date=1937|volume=12|issue=3|pages=167–78|jstor=452423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypercorrection is sometimes found among speakers of less [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestigious]] [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] who attempt to produce forms associated with high-prestige varieties, even in situations where speakers of those varieties would not. Some commentators call such production ''hyperurbanism''.&lt;ref name="MWDEU"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=hypercorrection |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage |year=1994 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield, Massachusetts, US]] |isbn=978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypercorrection can occur in many languages and wherever multiple languages or language varieties are in contact.

==Types of over-applied rules==
Studies in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[applied linguistics]] have noted the over-application of rules of [[phonology]], [[syntax]], or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], resulting either from different rules in varieties of the same language or [[second language learning|second-language learning]]. An example of a common hypercorrection based on application of the rules of a second (aka new, foreign) language is the use of ''octopi'' for the [[plural of octopus]] in English; this is based on the faulty assumption that octopus is a [[Latin declension#Second declension (o stems)|second declension]] word of [[Latin in English|Latin origin]] when in fact it is [[Ancient_Greek_nouns#Third_declension|third declension]] and comes from [[Greek and Latin words found in species names|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= Kory Stamper |title= Ask the editor: octopus |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0015-octopus.htm |accessdate= 26 June 2013 |publisher= Merriam-Webster }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociolinguists often note hypercorrection in terms of pronunciation ([[phonology]]). For example, [[William Labov]] noted that all of the English speakers he studied in [[New York City]] in the 1960s tended to pronounce words such as ''hard'' as [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] (pronouncing the "R" as {{IPAc-en|h|ɑr|d}} rather than {{IPAc-en|h|ɑː|d}}) more often when speaking carefully. Furthermore, [[middle class]] speakers had more rhotic pronunciation than [[working class]] speakers did. 

However, lower-middle class speakers had more rhotic pronunciation than upper-middle class speakers. Labov suggested that these lower-middle class speakers were attempting to emulate the pronunciation of upper-middle class speakers, but were actually over-producing the very noticeable R-sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Social Stratification of English in New York City |year=2006 |origyear=1966 |edition=2nd |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-52805-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common source of hypercorrection in English speakers' use of the language's morphology and syntax happens in the use of pronouns; see the section {{section link|#Personal pronouns}} below.&lt;ref name="MWDEU"/&gt;

Hypercorrection can also occur when learners of a new-to-them (aka second, foreign) language try to avoid applying grammatical rules from their [[native language]] to the new language (a situation known as [[language transfer]]). The effect can occur, for example, when a student of a new language has learned that certain sounds of his or her original language must usually be replaced by another in the studied language, but has not learned when ''not'' to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonology/interlanguage/pronerrors.html Interlanguage Phonology Sources of L2 Pronunciation "Errors"], by Michael Carey&lt;/ref&gt;

==English==
[[English language|English]] has no authoritative body governing correct usage of the standard language, unlike some other [[language]]s, such as [[Arabic]] ([[Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus|مجمع اللغة العربية]]), [[French language|French]] ([[Académie française]] and [[Office québécois de la langue française]]), [[Italian language|Italian]] ([[Accademia della Crusca]]), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ([[Icelandic Language Institute|Íslensk málstöð]]), and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Real Academia Española]]). Nonetheless, within groups of users of English, certain usages are considered unduly elaborate adherences to "formal" rules.

Such speech or writing is sometimes called ''hyperurbanism'', defined by [[Kingsley Amis]] as an "indulged desire to be posher than posh".

===Personal pronouns===
In 2004, Jack Lynch, [[assistant professor]] of English at [[Rutgers University]], wrote that the correction of the subject-positioned "me and you" to "you and I" leads people to "internalize the rule that 'you and I' is somehow more proper, and they end up using it in places where they should not – such as 'he gave it to you and I' when it should be 'he gave it to you and me.'"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.voanews.com/learningenglish/home/a-23-2007-07-23-voa3-83133807.html March 11, 2004 – Hypercorrection]", www.voanews.com, 12 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the linguists [[Rodney Huddleston]] and [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]] claim that [[utterances]] such as "They invited Sandy and I" are "heard constantly in the conversation of people whose status as speakers of Standard English is clear" and that "Those who condemn it simply assume that the case of a pronoun in a coordination must be the same as when it stands alone. Actual usage is in conflict with this assumption."&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005; {{ISBN|0-521-61288-8}}), 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===H-adding===
Some British accents, such as [[Cockney#Cockney speech|Cockney]], drop the initial "h" from words; e.g. ''have'' becomes ''{{'}}ave''. A hypercorrection associated with this is [[H-dropping#H-insertion|H-adding]], adding an "h" to a word which would not normally have an initial "h". An example of this can be found in the speech of the character [[Aloysius Parker|Parker]] in ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', e.g. "We'll 'ave the h'aristocrats 'ere soon" (from the episode "Vault of Death").  Parker's speech was based on a real person the creators encountered at a restaurant in Cookham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidgraham.co/blog/?page_id=27 |title=David Graham site |access-date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperforeignism===
{{main article|Hyperforeignism}}
Hyperforeignism arises from speakers misidentifying the distribution of a pattern found in loanwords and extending it to other environments.  The result of this process does not reflect the rules of either language.&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;{{cite book|title=Accents of English: An Introduction|first=John Christopher|last=Wells|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=978-0-521-29719-6|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJQwf05yzqYC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Accents+of+English:+An+Introduction#v=onepage&amp;q=Accents%20of%20English%3A%20An%20Introduction&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[habanero chili|habanero]]'' is sometimes pronounced as though it were spelled {{angbr|habañero}}, in imitation of other Spanish words like ''jalapeño'' and ''piñata''.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habanero www.merriam-webster.com: habanero (variant spelling)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[machismo]]'' is sometimes pronounced 'makizmo', apparently as if it were Italian, rather than the phonetic English pronunciation which resembles the original Spanish word.

===English as a second language===
Some English-Spanish cognates primarily differ by beginning with "s" vs. "es", such as the English word "spectacular" and the Spanish word "espectacular". A native Spanish speaker may conscientiously hypercorrect for the word "establish" by writing or saying "stablish", which is archaic, or an informal pronunciation in some dialects.&lt;ref name="HuebnerFerguson1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thom Huebner|author2=Charles A. Ferguson|title=Crosscurrents in Second Language Acquisition and Linguistic Theories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6BGdnKa2zcUC&amp;pg=PA124|date=1 January 1991|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-2463-7|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
In [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], some speakers omit the [[initial (linguistics)|initial]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}}.  For instance, the [[Han character|character]] [[wikt:牙#Cantonese|牙]] ({{zh|j=ngaa4}}, meaning "tooth"), ends up being pronounced "aa4".  [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptivists]] tend to consider these changes as substandard and denounce them for being "lazy sounds" ({{zh|c=懶音|j=laan5 jam1}}). However, in a case of hypercorrection, some speakers have started pronouncing words that should have a null initial using an initial {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, even though according to [[historical Chinese phonology]], only words with [[four tones|''light'' tone]]s (which correspond to tones 4, 5, and 6 in [[Jyutping]]) had [[voiced consonant|voiced]] initials (which includes {{IPA|[ŋ]}}). Because of this hypercorrection, words such as [[wikt:愛#Cantonese|愛]] ({{zh|j=oi3}}, meaning "love"), which has a ''dark'' tone, are pronounced by speakers with an {{IPA|[ŋ]}} initial, "ngoi3".

Idiomatically, some words such as 溝 ({{IPA|/kɐu˥/}} 'communication') have evolved to the sound {{IPA|/kʰɐu˥/}} to avoid embarrassment, because 㞗 {{IPA|/kɐu˥/}} is a vulgar word in Cantonese, but some speakers insist on pronouncing {{IPA|/kɐu˥/}} and it may cause ridicule.

Speakers of some [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialects, particularly in the south of [[China]] and in [[Taiwan]], pronounce the [[retroflex]] initials {{IPA|[tʂ]}}, {{IPA|[tʂʰ]}} and {{IPA|[ʂ]}} as the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] initials {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[tsʰ]}}, and {{IPA|[s]}}. Such speakers may hypercorrect by pronouncing words that should start with {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[tsʰ]}} and {{IPA|[s]}} as if they started with their retroflex counterparts.

In Taiwan, under the influence of [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]] ([[Min Nan]]), many people pronounce the initial {{IPA|[f]}} as {{IPA|[xw]}}, and often hypercorrect by pronouncing the initial {{IPA|[xw]}} as {{IPA|[f]}}. This is also noticeable in the [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] population, where many words that begin in {{IPA|[x]}} in Mandarin and Taiwanese begin in {{IPA|[f]}} in Hakka. (Examples: [[wikt:火|火]], [[wikt:花|花]])

[[Erhua]] hypercorrection may occur among non-native speakers of rhotic Chinese.

==Bulgarian==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
In standard [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and in the eastern dialects, the old [[Yat#Bulgarian|yat]] letter is pronounced as я ("ya") when stressed and the following syllable does not contain the vowels и ("i") or е ("e"), and pronounced as е in all other cases. But in the western dialects it is always pronounced as е. Attempting to speak the standard Bulgarian dialect, some speakers from Western Bulgaria mispronounce many words containing the yat letter – голями ("golyami"), желязни ("zhelyazni"), бяли ("byali"), видяли ("vidyali"), спряни ("spryani"), живяли ("zhivyali") instead of големи ("golemi"), железни ("zhelezni"), бели ("beli"), видели ("videli"), спрени ("spreni"), живели ("zhiveli"). This trend is especially common with past participles such as видяли.

==Russian palatalization==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}

Russian speakers sometimes [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalize]] consonants in loanwords that had never been palatized (as {{IPA-ru|mɐˈdʲern|}} instead of {{IPA-ru|mɐˈdɛrn|}} for [[wikt:модерн|модерн]]) under the influence of the spelling. Russian has five so-called hard vowels (а, э, ы, у, о), which follow hard or unpalatized consonants, each with a corresponding soft vowel (я, е, и, ю, ё respectively), which follow soft or palatized consonants. However, the hard vowel [[э]] has [[orthography|orthographic]] limits allowing it to be written only at the beginning of a word or after a vowel (as in the Cyrillic spelling of [[Aeroflot]]). So in many loanwords, the soft vowel [[Ye (Cyrillic)|e]] is written but read as if it were [[э]].

==Serbo-Croatian==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
The syllables ''je'' and ''ije'' appear in the [[Shtokavian#Yat reflexes|Ijekavian]] variant of [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] [[Serbo-Croatian]] (spoken in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and south-western parts of [[Serbia]]), while the [[Shtokavian#Yat reflexes|Ekavian]] variant (spoken in most of Serbia) has only variation in quantity (length of the vowel) of ''e''.  Not every Ekavian ''e'' becomes ''je'' or ''ije'' like in Ijekavian. Speakers of Ijekavian may hypercorrect their dialect by either undersupplying or oversupplying the ''je''s and the ''ije''s.

Another example of hypercorrection appears with word "faliti" meaning "to be missing". As "hvala" ("thank you") used to be converted to "fala" in many vernacular varieties, formal education heavily emphasized the correct word "hvala" in standard language. Many speakers also started to hypercorrect the unrelated word "faliti" into "hvaliti", which is a non-standard form.

===Accusative vs. locative===
As locative case is rarely used in colloquial usage in southern and eastern dialects of Serbia, and accusative is used instead, speakers tend to overcorrect when using the language in more formal occasions, thus using locative even when accusative should be used (typically, when indicating direction rather than location): "Izlazim na kolovozu" instead of "izlazim na kolovoz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | people= Boban Arsenijević |title= Burek koji se može poneti |url= https://www.pismenica.rs/jezicke-nedoumice/boban-arsenijevic-burek-koji-se-moze-poneti/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}

===Dialect versus Standard German===
In [[German language|German]], the accent spoken in the cities of [[Düsseldorf]], [[Cologne]] and its surroundings heavily features the front 'ch' sound (aka the "ich sound", {{IPA|[ç]}}) where [[standard German]] calls for the 'sch' {{IPA|[ʃ]}} sound. Speakers with this accent would sometimes say 'Fich' {{IPA|[fɪç]}} instead of '[[wikt:Fisch|Fisch]]' {{IPA|[fɪʃ]}} (fish), and 'Tich' {{IPA|[tɪç]}} instead of '[[wikt:Tisch|Tisch]]' {{IPA|[tɪʃ]}} (table). This is due to a hypercorrection of the [[Rhineland]] [[dialect]] prevalent in that area of Germany, an accent that often has a 'sch' {{IPA|[ʃ]}} sound where Standard German has a front 'ch' {{IPA|[ç]}} (as in "isch" [ʔɪʃ] versus "ich" [ʔɪç]). Attempting to avoid this perceived error, speakers of the [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] accent hypercorrect it to an abundance of 'ch' {{IPA|[ç]}}. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}
&lt;!-- It would be nice if a reader more familiar with this accent would state whether the mispronunciation of 'sch' sounds as 'ch' sounds is also done when the 'sch' sound comes after such a vowel sound as that of 'a', where the 'ch' phoneme would be [x] rather than [ç]. --&gt;

===Genitive versus dative===
Another example is use of the [[genitive case]] where the [[dative case]] is required. Colloquially, the genitive is often dropped in favor of the dative even if correct grammatical usage demands the genitive. Because language critics deride such substitution, some German speakers use the genitive even with prepositions that actually demand the dative (e.g., ''[[wikt:entgegen|entgegen]]'', ''[[wikt:gegenüber|gegenüber]]''), seemingly under the false impression that the genitive is always right and the dative is always wrong, or at least that the genitive is a better form than the dative.

==Norwegian==
As the /w/-sound does not exist in Norwegian, Norwegians speaking English often produce [v] for /w/. Sometimes such speakers hypercorrect by pronouncing [w] for /v/ as well as /w/, pronouncing a word such as "vexed" as {{IPA|[wɛkst]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Andreassen|first1=Helene N.|last2=Herry-Bénit|first2=Nadine|last3=Kamiyama|first3=Takeki|last4=Lacoste|first4=Véronique|title=The ICE-IPAC project: Testing the protocol on Norwegian and French learners of English|date=12 August 2015|conference=Workshop on Phonetic Learner Corpora: Satellite workshop of the XVIIIth ICPhS|url=https://hal-univ-paris8.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01200809/file/Andreassen_final.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutch versus West Flemish==

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
The [[West Flemish]] dialects do not use the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] "ch" {{IPA|/x/}} (Northern Dutch pronunciation) or {{IPA|/ç/}} (Southern Dutch pronunciation). Instead they pronounce both 'g' and 'ch' as a soft 'h', whereas the Standard Dutch way to pronounce them would respectively  in /ç/ and /ʝ/ in Southern Dutch or both /x/ in Northern Dutch. For example, a West-Fleming would pronounce the phrase 'een gouden hart' (a golden heart) as 'een '''H'''ouden hart'. Some older people, who grew up speaking nothing but their dialect, are unaware that there is a difference between 'g', 'ch' and 'h' altogether and trying to 'mimic' Dutch, they often overcompensate and pronounce ''every'' word they would normally pronounce with a 'h'-sound  as a 'g'. This includes words actually pronounced 'h'. In the example above, they would go overboard and pronounce the phrase 'een gouden hart' as 'een gouden '''G'''art'.

A popular joke illustrates this phenomenon. It concerns a pastor of a West Flemish church, who wants to impress his flock by celebrating mass in flawless, 'civilized' [[Dutch Language Union#History|AN]] Dutch. His 'civilized' Dutch consists of pronouncing a 'ch' and 'g' as the Northern Dutch {{IPA|/ç/}} (instead of the 'h' as the West Flemish dialect does). However to be absolutely sure, he also pronounces the 'h' as {{IPA|/ç/}} even though he should continue pronouncing it as a 'h'. The results are as follows; instead of praying for "De '''h'''ele kerk" (the whole church) he ends up praying for "de '''g'''ele kerk" (the yellow church) and "de '''h'''eilige maagd" (the holy virgin) becomes "de '''g'''eilige maagd" (the horny virgin). Finally, he ends his sermon in asking what should be "de goede '''h'''ulp van de '''H'''eer" (the good help of the Lord). Instead he asks for "de goede '''g'''ulp van de '''g'''eer" (the good zip of the gusset).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;!--According to &lt;http://kinderen-van-god.blogspot.com/2016/02/de-stilte-van-god.html&gt;, this story is told in ''De stilte van God'' by Reinier Sonneveld, but I have not been able to get a copy to check this.--&gt;

==Latin==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], the spelling of [[Latin]] was simplified in various respects: for example, ''æ'' and ''oe'' became ''e'', and ''ch'' became ''c''. Occasionally these changes were reversed, and ''e'' and ''c'' were sometimes expanded to ''æ'' (or ''oe'') and ''ch'', even when such spelling contradicted [[Classical Latin]]. For example, ''[[wikt:caelum|caelum]]'' was contracted to ''celum'' and re-expanded to ''coelum''.  These spellings are often preserved in English derivatives, including ''[[wikt:et cætera|et cætera]]'' and ''[[wikt:et coetera|et coetera]]'' (occasionally found as variants for ''[[et cetera]]''); the British and international English ''[[wikt:foetus|foetus]]'' (originally ''[[fetus]]'', as it is currently spelled in American English).

==Hebrew and Yiddish==
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that the following hypercorrect pronunciations in [[Israeli Hebrew]] are [[snobbative]]s (from ''[[snob]]'' + ''-ative'', modelled upon [[Comparison (grammar)|comparatives and superlatives]]):&lt;ref&gt;See p. 77 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]. [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

*  the hypercorrect pronunciation ''khupím'' instead of ''khofím'' for חופים "beaches".
*  the hypercorrect pronunciation ''tsorfát'' instead of ''tsarfát'' for צרפת "France".
*  the hypercorrect pronunciation ''amán'' instead of ''omán'' for אמן "artist".

The last two hypercorrection examples derive from a confusion related to the [[Kamatz|Qamatz Gadol]] Hebrew vowel, which in the accepted [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation is rendered as {{IPA|/aː/}} but which is pronounced {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], and in Hebrew words that also occur in [[Yiddish]]. On the other hand, the [[Kamatz|Qamatz Qaṭan]] vowel, which is visually indistinguishable from the Qamatz Gadol vowl, is rendered as {{IPA|/o/}} in both pronunciations. This leads to hypercorrections in both directions.

#The consistent pronunciation of all forms of ''qamatz'' as {{IPA|/a/}}, disregarding ''qatan'' and ''hataf'' forms, could be seen as a hypercorrection when Hebrew speakers of Ashkenazic origin attempt to pronounce Sephardic Hebrew, for example, [[wikt:צהרים|צָהֳרָיִם]], "midday" as "''tzaharayim''", rather than "''tzohorayim''" as in [[Standard Hebrew|standard Israeli pronunciation]]; the traditional Sephardi pronunciation is "''tzahorayim''". This may, however, be an example of oversimplification rather than of hypercorrection.
#Conversely, many older [[British Jews]] consider it more colloquial and "down-home" to say "Shobbes", "cholla" and "motza", though the vowel in these words is in fact a ''[[patach]]'', which is rendered as {{IPA|/a/}} in both Sephardi and Ashkenazi Hebrew. 
Other hypercorrections occur when speakers of Israeli Hebrew (which is based on Sephardic) attempt to pronounce Ashkenazi Hebrew, for example for religious purposes. The month of [[Shevat]] ([[wikt:שבט|שבט]]) is mistakenly pronounced "Shvas", as if it were spelled *שְׁבַת. In an attempt to imitate [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] dialects, ''qamatz'' (both ''gadol'' and ''qatan''), which would normally be pronounced {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, is hypercorrected to the pronunciation of ''holam'', {{IPA|[ɔj]}}, rendering [[wikt:גדול|גדול]] ("large") as ''goydl'' and [[wikt:ברוך|ברוך]] ("blessed") as ''boyrukh''.

==Spanish==
In some Spanish dialects, final intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} ({{IPA|[ð]}}) is dropped, such as in ''[[wikt:pescado|pescado]]'' (fish), which would typically be pronounced {{IPA|[pesˈkaðo]}} but can be manifested as {{IPA|[pesˈkao]}} dialectically. Speakers sensitive to this variation may insert a {{IPA|/d/}} intervocalically into a word without such a consonant, such as in the case of ''[[wikt:bacalao|bacalao]]'' (cod), correctly pronounced {{IPA|[bakaˈlao]}} but occasionally hypercorrected to {{IPA|[bakaˈlaðo]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Penny |first=Ralph |title=Variation and Change in Spanish |year=2000 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-78045-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same holds true for speakers with [[seseo]], who pronounce the letters "z" and soft "c" as {{IPA|[s]}}, who find themselves in parts of [[Spain]] that pronounce them as {{IPA|[θ]}} (distinción), sometimes hypercorrect all instances of "s" as {{IPA|[θ]}} (ceceo).

In some Spanish dialects, especially in the [[Caribbean]], {{IPA|/s/}} is [[Debuccalization|debuccalized]] at the end of syllables to {{IPA|[h]}}, or sometimes elided completely, so ''pescado'' is {{IPA|[pehˈkaðo]}} or {{IPA|[peˈkaðo]}}. As a result, speakers from these areas may add the {{IPA|[s]}} sound to words which do not contain the letter s.

==Swedish==
Because the infinitive marker "att" ("to") is often pronounced "å" (which is phonotactically correct—the conjuction "att" ("that") is never pronounced "å" on the other hand. "Det är sant att jag älskar å segla"), it's sometimes hypercorrected to "och", "jag älskar och segla"*.

==Hungarian==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
In Hungarian the suffix -ban/ben indicates location, such as "házban" (in the house), while -ba/be indicates direction, such as "házba" (in(to) the house). Speakers of regional dialects often use the latter, shorter forms for both cases: "a házba vagyok" (non-standard: I'm in(to) the house). This is often perceived as lower quality or uneducated speech. To avoid this perception, some people make the opposite mistake, using the first form everywhere, such as in the incorrect sentence "a házban megyek" (I go in the house). This effect can be observed most often in public speeches of politicians, religious figures, etc.

A similar mistake affects old intransitive verbs, which in old Hungarian had a distinct system of conjugation (the so-called "ikes" conjugation, referring to the "-ik" suffix in third-person singular). Among others, this system requires the use of a suffix "-m" instead of "-k" in first person (e.g. "eszem" instead of "*eszek", for "I eat"). This conjugation is now only preserved in parts, most of which are rapidly fading out of use. However, due to prescriptivist pressure, some Hungarian speakers mistakenly use -m suffixes on all verbs ending in "-ik", not just old intransitive ones (e.g. "*kapaszkodom" instead of "kapaszkodok", for "I hold on"). The "-ik" suffix is also sometimes mistakenly applied to verbs that normally do not end in it, causing the verb ''robban'' "to explode" to turn into ''*robbanik''.

==Finnish==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
As the voiced consonants "b", "d" and "g" are very rare in native Finnish words, some Finns tend to emphasise them in foreign words, more than should be necessary. For example, Finns might say *''bedagogiikka'' instead of ''pedagogiikka'' ("pedagogy"), *''brobleema'' instead of ''probleema'' ("problem"), or *''psygologia'' instead of ''psykologia'' ("psychology"). Another form of hypercorrection is emphasised avoidance of pronouncing the diphthong "ie" as "ia", which occurs in some Finnish dialects, leading to mispronouncing the word ''piano'' ("piano") as *''pieno''.

==Polish==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}One example of hypercorrection in the Polish language is the "adoption" of [[coleslaw]] (itself stemming from a Dutch term) as ''[[wikt:kolesław|kolesław]]'', adding an accent that seems to be simulating the Polish name [[Bolesław (disambiguation)|Bolesław]]. This can be explained by only some English sounds in foreign names entering the Polish mass lingual consciousness: for example, [[cola]] is almost never pronounced with a [ts] sound, as would Polish language rules dictate the letter "c" to be pronounced.

Other common examples of hypercorrection in Polish include nasal pronunciation of terminal ''ę'', as in ''rękę'' (correctly [-ɛ] and hypercorrectly [-ɛ᷉]) or hypercorrect pronunciation of voiced consonants instead of voiceless ones (''jabłko'' pronounced as [ʝabʊwko] instead of [ʝapwko] or [ʝapko]).

The '''Jabo language''' is a [[Kru languages|Kru language]] spoken by the [[Jabo people]] of [[Liberia]]. They have also been known in the past as the '''Gweabo'''.

==Classification==
Jabo is part of the Grebo [[language continuum]], encoded by ''Ethnologue'' more specifically as a dialect of the [[Southern Grebo language]].&lt;ref name="GRJ"&gt;In a working-group draft of ISO-639-3 written in 2001 (URL accessed 2006-4-24 [http://xml.coverpages.org/ISO-WG1-N074R.html]), the code '''GRJ''' was assigned to the "Jabo language", while the code '''GEU''' was applied to the coordinate [[taxon]] "Glebo".&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jabo satisfies the ISO 639-3 criteria for an individual language:&lt;ref&gt;ISO 639-3 "Scope of denotation for language identifiers"[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp#I].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The shared core-vocabulary score for Jabo and Seaside Grebo is reported as being as low as 75%.&lt;ref&gt;Ingemann &amp; Duitsmann, 1976. Quoted in Hasselbring &amp; Johnson, 2002, p. 14. This last source made its own determination of 85%, (p. 45) but acknowledged methodologically dubious techniques&amp;mdash;such as coaching for cognates in multilingual groups. This number is probably the main basis of the current proposed ISO 639-3 classification. The mutual intelligibility scores reported are difficult to interpret, since even Jabo-Jabo scores considerably less than 100%&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Jabo and Grebo political territories have been distinct at least since the time of the founding of "Maryland in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;"Map of Liberia / compiled from data on file in the office of the American Colonization Society, under the direction of the Revd. W. McLain, secy., by R. Coyle."
 1845. Library of Congress, URL accessed on 2006-04-24 at [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/map_item.pl?data=/home/www/data/gmd/gmd8/g8880/g8880/lm000010.sid&amp;style=lmmap&amp;itemLink=D?gmd:11:./temp/~ammem_6ZSB::&amp;title=].&lt;/ref&gt; The two peoples are currently in different counties (Grand Kru County and Maryland County), and the Jabo claim a greater affinity for the [[Kru people|Kru]] (Krao) than for the Grebo.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;Ethnologue.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The physical separation of the Jabo and Grebo areas by the Deeah (Decoris) river is also an effective barrier to social intercourse and commerce.
*The Jabo and the Grebo have different origin legends, and thus have no shared identity.&lt;ref&gt;Jabo origins as related by Blooah to a WPA interviewer. See Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grebo origins as related by 19th century Reverend John Payne, quoted in Hasselbring &amp; Johnson, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Jabo are highly ethnocentric, and consider themselves to be a nation with its own language.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

On the other hand, the commercial interaction of the [[Grebo people]]s, together with [[exogamy]], produces widespread [[multilingualism]], magnifying the impression of homogeneity of the varieties of Grebo. Additionally, the goal of [[literacy]] is facilitated by a unificationalist approach to the varieties.

==Sources==
The Jabo language is known to scientific linguistics in some level of detail because it was analysed by the respected linguist [[Edward Sapir]],&lt;ref name="Sapir"&gt;Sapir, 1929; 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively transcribed by his doctoral student [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]].&lt;ref name="Herzog"&gt;Herzog &amp; Blooah, 1936; Herzog, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sapir and Herzog relied upon the cooperation of Charles G. Blooah as their native informant. Most of the material was recorded on site in Liberia by Herzog, who was primarily a [[Folklore|folklorist]] and [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]]. His interest in the Jabo language centered on its use in the [[oral literature]] of [[proverb]]s and [[saying]]s, and also in the Jabo [[Drum (communication)|drum-signalling]] system. This became focus of the corpus he collected. There is a natural overlap between these areas, since many of the drum signals are formulaic in nature and are based on elements of the oral literature.

This may also have entailed that much of the material recorded was originally uttered in a declamatory, rhetorical, or performance style. It has not been established the degree to which such style might depart from more informal styles of Jabo speech. However, this material is the basis of what is presented below.

==Phonology==

===Tone===
As analyzed by Sapir,&lt;ref name="Sapir"/&gt; Jabo was represented as possessing four [[Phoneme|phonemically]] distinct pitch levels (or [[Tone (linguistics)#Register and contour tones|registers]]),&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with social speech "[[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]."&lt;/ref&gt; independent of [[phonation]] type or [[Vocal folds|supraglottal]] articulation. Furthermore, mono-[[Mora (linguistics)|moraic]] (short [[syllable]]) glides from any register to any other register were [[phonotactics|phonotactically]] possible. This meant that there could possibly be sixteen distinct, [[Segment (linguistics)|segmentally]]-identical short monosyllables with significative pitch contours—more if long syllables were admitted. The not-uncommon word types {{IPA|CVː}} (CVV) and CVCV could potentially have 256 possible [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] contours, each with a different dictionary meaning for the same three or four segments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}{{fix|text=but are all these combinations actually allowed and contrastive?}}

Sapir devised a system of "tone letters" for specifying tone, but they are inconvenient to typeset and not included in the [[Unicode]] inventory. The common convention for Kru languages is to mark tone with subscript or superscript [[tone number]]s following the vowel, with 1 denoting the highest register. They may also be transcribed in the IPA with [[tone letter]]s or diacritics. The default tone of the language, in Jabo tone 2, is generally left unmarked in a diacritic system. As an example, take the word {{IPA|[ɟʱɑbo]}} "Jabo people", which is tone 2. For literacy purposes some system of diacritics would likely be preferable.

Falling contour tones (parentheses) are very rare. Where they occur, they seem to be in imitation of other languages or dialects.&lt;ref name="Herzog"/&gt;

=== Vowels ===
The vowels marked with a subscript dot are said to be "dark" or "turbid".&amp;nbsp; This is usually understood as being due to an articulation with [[Pharyngealization|pharyngeal]]&lt;ref name="phar"&gt;Since the "emphatic" consonants in languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] may also be described as [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]], it would be easy to misinterpret the use of the term "emphatic" by Sapir for the Jabo consonants which have breathy voice. In Jabo "dark" and "emphatic" are apparently unrelated, although the possibility remains.&lt;/ref&gt; constriction.&amp;nbsp; [[Advanced tongue root]] position or [[Faucalized voice|faucalization]] may also be involved.&amp;nbsp; This last possibility may make it simpler to rationalize the apparent [[markedness]] of the extreme vowels {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[i]}}, which are said always to be "turbid".

[[Nasalization|Nasalized]] versions of {{IPA|[ɛ̣], [ɔ̣]}}, and {{IPA|[ạ]}} were reported, but it is doubtful whether they have [[Phoneme|phonemic]] status. Since the articulations involved are probably to a degree mutually exclusive ([[Soft palate|velic]] and pharyngeal), and since they seem to contribute similar auditory components (nasalization and "turbidity"), they are more likely to be allophones resulting from [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]. Sapir was an excellent phonetician, so his transcriptions may be narrowly accurate, whatever their phonological implication. In the case of Herzog or Blooah, one suspects that there may have been a normalization attempt by the transcriber. This nonetheless gives an appearance of vowel harmony to Jabo phonology.

Syllabic nasals {{IPA|[m̩]}} and {{IPA|[n̩]}} also occur. Related to this is a phenomenon of [[prenasalized stop|prenasalization]], termed "[[anacrusis]]" by Sapir by analogy with the metrical term. It is probably best accounted for systematically by an underlying [[syllabic nasal]], since it occurs with some [[Approximant consonant|approximants]], as well as with voiced [[plosives]].

The forms enclosed in brackets show the orthography used by Sapir/Herzog; other forms are the same.

Segments {{IPA|[ʃ], [ʒ], [l]}} and {{IPA|[n̪]}} probably have only allophonic status. Word initial {{IPA|[l]}} occurs only in loans from English. The fronted or "dental" nasal occurs in only a single word, but that word {{IPA|[n̪a]}} meaning "possessive" is very common.

Consonants here called "breathy" are those termed "emphatic" by Sapir.&lt;ref name="phar"/&gt; The plosives are here marked with a superscript hooked '''h''' ({{IPA|[ʱ]}}), while the continuants are marked with a subscript diaeresis. The contrastive use of this feature defines a major isogloss separating Jabo from Glebo.&lt;ref&gt;Hasselbring &amp; Johnson, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications of the Jabo evidence for linguistic theory ==
The [[metalinguistic]] import of the Jabo tonemic repertory becomes apparent when the attempt is made to select phonological [[distinctive feature]]s to represent the tonemes, whether binary or ''n''-ary features. This in turn has implications for [[linguistic universals]]. However, the possibility exists that Sapir's analysis is overdifferentiated (i.e., the transcription is too "narrow" to claim [[Toneme|tonemic]] status).

This tonal system implies an extremely high level of significative [[functional load]] to borne by pitch in the language. As such it has been cited over the years by a number influential theorists in the [[Phonology|phonological]] field, such as [[Trubetskoy]]&lt;ref&gt;Trubetzkoy, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

A similar situation exists in the vowel space postulated by the Sapirean analysis. Since tongue and jaw position, nasalization and pharyngealization are all significative in this model, the vowel space is crowded indeed, with from 19 to 22 possible vowels, not counting diphthongs or long vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Hasselbring and Johnson claim nine vowels for most "Kru" languages (p. 48).&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphatic consonants of Jabo were once thought to be an example of the emergence of an implosive consonant series. There currently does not seem to be any evidence to suggest this.

== Literacy and educational proposals==
Glebo (Seaside Grebo) had possibly the earliest literary history of any speech variety in the Cape Palmas area, dating to the time of the missionary efforts associated with [[Colonial Heads of Maryland|Maryland in Africa]]. Nonetheless, Jabo, rather than Glebo, has been proposed by the [[SIL International|SIL]] survey &lt;ref&gt;Hasselbring and Johnson, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of a unification [[orthography]] or [[Ausbausprache]] for the speech varieties of the Southern Grebo group, despite the prestige and precedence of Glebo.

This choice may be due to Jabo's preserving a number of "archaic" features from the proto-language, if it is indeed the case that its highly differentiated phonology reflects a common stage of development. The [[Pedagogy|pedagogic]] principle would be that it is easier to teach across heterogeneous groups from a differentiated writing system (to a variety in which the contrast has been merged), than the reverse. Students speaking the less differentiated variety need only learn to ignore the "superfluous" distinctions as [[Homonym|heterographic homonyms]], rather than memorizing numerous, seemingly random [[Homonym|heterophonic homographs]].

In [[computer jargon]], a '''killer poke''' is a method of inducing physical [[computer hardware|hardware]] damage on a machine or its [[peripheral]]s by the insertion of invalid values, via, for example, [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]'s [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] command, into a [[memory-mapped I/O|memory-mapped]] control [[hardware register|register]]. The term is typically used to describe a family of fairly well known tricks that can overload the [[analog electronics]] in the [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[computer display|monitor]]s of computers lacking hardware [[sanity testing|sanity checking]] (notable examples being the [[IBM 5100|IBM Portable]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trixter.oldskool.org/2006/02/02/computing-myth-1-software-cannot-damage-hardware/|title=Computing Myth #1: Software cannot damage hardware|publisher=Oldskooler Ramblings|date=2 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Commodore PET]].)

==Specific examples==

===Commodore PET===
The [[Commodore PET|PET]]-specific killer poke is connected to the architecture of that machine's video rasterizer circuits. In early PETs, writing a certain value to the memory address of a certain [[memory-mapped I/O|I/O]] register (&lt;code&gt;POKE 59458,62&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/pet2001.html|title=Commodore PET 2001 computer|publisher=oldcomputers.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;) made the machine able to display text on the screen much faster.&lt;!--Stay tuned: detailed info will be given soon, in the PET article, and linked to from here. The specifics are: setting bit 5 of the 6522 VIA at $E840/59456 to zero. Wernher--&gt; When the PET range was revamped with updated hardware, it was discovered that performing the old trick on the new hardware led to strange behavior by the new video chip, which could possibly damage the PET's integrated [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.6502.org/users/andre/petindex/poke/index.html |title=Killer Poke |work=PET index |first=André |last=Fachat |publisher=6502.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{circular reference|date=January 2018}}

===Commodore 1541 Disk Drive===
The [[Commodore 64]] had an optional external 5-1/4" floppy drive.  The [[Commodore 1541]] contained a 6502 microprocessor which was used to run [[Commodore DOS]] and also to manage the drive mechanism. The drives stored data on 40 tracks (#0–39), and the stepper motor could be manually controlled through BASIC by PRINT#-ing "MEMORY-WRITE" commands to the drive (which correspond to the POKE command of BASIC, but write to the drive's internal memory and I/O registers, not those of the computer itself).  If the drive was at either end of its range (track 0 or track 39) and it was commanded to continue moving, there was no software or firmware method to prevent drive damage. Continued "knocking" of the drive head against the stop would throw the mechanism out of alignment. The problem was exacerbated by [[copy protection]] techniques that used non-standard disk formats with unusual track counts. The [[Commodore 1571]] had an optical head stop instead of a mechanical one.

===TRS-80 Model III===
The [[TRS-80 Model III]] had the ability to switch between a 32-character-wide display and a 64-character display. Doing so actuated a relay in the video hardware, accomplished by writing to a specific memory-mapped control register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vintagecomputer.net/fjkraan/comp/trs80/grafix80/80grafix.html|title = 80-GRAFIX Manual|date = 1980|accessdate = June 8, 2015|website = Vintagecomputer.net|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that repeatedly switched between 32- and 64-character modes at high speed (either on purpose or accidentally) could permanently damage the video hardware.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}} While this is not a single "killer poke", it demonstrates a software [[failure mode]] that could permanently damage the hardware.

===Cassette tape relay===
The [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], [[IBM PC]], [[IBM PCjr]], [[Nascom]], [[MSX]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[BBC Micro]] from [[Acorn Computers]] all contained a built-in [[relay]] for controlling an external tape recorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n6/58_Computerized_security_ala.php|title=Computerized security alarms |work=Creative Computing Magazine |first=Forrest M. |last=Mims |authorlink=Forrest Mims |volume=11 |number=6 |date=June 1985 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toggling the motor control relay in a tight loop would reduce the relay's longevity.

===Commodore Amiga===
The floppy drive of the Commodore Amiga personal computer could be made to produce noises of various pitches by making the drive heads move back and forth. A program existed which could play [[El Cóndor Pasa (song)|El Cóndor Pasa]], more or less correctly, on the Amiga's floppy drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minimalvideo.com/weblog/minimalvideo/2008/09/post-17.html |title=El Condor Pasa |publisher=minimal video |date=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some sounds relied on the head assembly hitting the stop, this gradually sent the head out of alignment.

===LG CD-ROM drives===
Certain models of LG CD-ROM drives with specific firmware used an abnormal command for "update firmware": the "clear buffer" command usually used on CD-RW drives. Linux uses this command to tell the difference between CD-ROM and CD-RW drives. Most CD-ROM drives dependably return an error for the unsupported CD-RW command, but the faulty drives interpreted it as "update firmware", causing them to stop working (or, in casual parlance, to be "[[bricked]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/newbie@linux-mandrake.com/msg142409.html |title=Re: LG CDRoms |work=newbie@linux-mandrake.com |publisher=The Mail Archive |date=29 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSi Laptops UEFI===
[[Systemd]] mounts variables used by [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] on [[Linux]] system's [[sysfs]] as writable by the root user of a system. As a result, it is possible for the [[root user]] of a system to completely brick a system with a non-conforming UEFI implementation (specifically some [[Micro-Star International|MSi]] laptops) by using the &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt; command to delete the &lt;code&gt;/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/&lt;/code&gt; directory, or recursively delete the [[root directory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/2402|title=Mount efivarfs read-only · Issue #2402 · systemd/systemd|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game Boy===
The [[Game Boy]]'s LCD screen can be turned off by game software. Doing so outside of the [[vertical blanking interval]] can damage the hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm#lcdcontrolregister|title=LCD Control Register|work=Pan Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laven''' is a [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] [[dialect cluster]] of southern [[Laos]]. Laven is the exonym given by the Laotian government, while the autonym of many of those speakers is '''Jru' '''{{IPA-xx|ɟruʔ|}}. Varieties are:

*'''[[Jru' language|Jru']]''' (also spelled ''Jruq)''
*'''[[Juk language|Juk]]'''
*'''[[Su' language|Su']]''' (also spelled ''Suq)''

Laven varieties are described in detail by Therapan L-Thongkum and Paul Sidwell (2003).

'''Machine translation in China''' is the history of [[machine translation]] systems developed in [[China]]. China became the fourth country that began machine translation (MT) research following [[United States|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1957, the Language Institute of [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] took the initiative in Russian-Chinese MT research program and set up an MT research group. From then on the research activities were directed and applied for academic purposes in Universities. The turning point of MT systems launching initiatives in market began from 1990s. MT systems went into blossom into the market. Among these systems, there were commercialized MT systems. To be more specific, Transtar was the first commercialized MT system and has been constantly upgraded. What’s more, IMC/EC MT system which was developed by Computer Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences has further made great advancement. Meanwhile, the practical MT system MT-IT-EC specific to communication domain was also striking to notice, for it has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity in the issue of publications.  

Government funding is a critical component and support in the development of market-oriented machine translation in China. It is evident to see that since Chinese opened up to the outside world and joined the WTO, the vigorous import and export trade generate opportunities for machine translation to transfer technical terms of products into the readable target  information. Facing the increasing demand of sophisticated state-of -the -art translation technology, the academic area including research institute and universities are even launching [[Bachelor's degree|bachelors’]] and [[Master's degree|masters’]] programs regarding machine translation. Thus, strong evidence illustrates the promising field of machine translation in the future market of China.

'''Macushi''' is the most populous of the [[Cariban languages]], spoken by 30,000 in [[Brazil]] and [[Guyana]]. It is also spelled ''Makushi'', ''Makusi'', ''Makuxi'', ''Macusi'' and ''Macussi'' and it also known as ''Teweya'' or ''Teueia''. Abbot (1991) describes Macushi as having [[OVS word order]], with [[SOV word order]] being used to highlight the subject.&lt;ref name=hdbkAmazonian&gt;

'''The Metagame''', or '''game about the game''', is any approach to a [[game]] that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game; uses external factors to affect the game; or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. 

''Metagaming'' might also refer to a game which functions to create or modify the rules of a sub-game. Thus, we might play a metagame selecting which rules will apply during the play of the game itself.

==Examples==
* A special set of moves in [[chess]] can allow a player to [[scholar's mate|win in four moves]].  Competitor A has been watching Competitor B play chess, and the past five games in a row Competitor B has attempted to use this four-move win.  When Competitor A sits down to play against Competitor B, Competitor A will be metagaming if they play in a way that will give them an advantage if Competitor B repeats this line.
* In modern computer games, particularly in casual, mobile and tablet games, the out-of-game play achievements which give you bonuses in the game itself are considered metagame elements as they are games outside of the real game. Also known as [[Reward system]]s, [[Achievement game]]s, [[augmented reality game]]s and [[gamification]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{Citation 
  | last =Kim
  | first =Amy Jo
  | title =Meta-Game Design: Reward Systems that Drive Engagement
  | year =2010
  | url = http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012242/Meta-Game-Design-Reward-Systems
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any game with a spectator team that does not participate in gameplay could be prone to metagaming. If a spectator were to reveal information to a team or individual that they could not have gained otherwise, he/she would be metagaming.
* In popular [[trading card games]], such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'', or [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' Trading Card Game]] players compete with decks they have created in advance and the "metagame" consists of the deck types that are currently popular and expected to show up in large numbers in a tournament. The knowledge of metagame trends can give players an edge against other participants, both while they are playing by quickly recognizing what kind of deck opponents have and guessing their likely cards or moves, and during the deck building process, by selecting cards that do well against current popular deck types at the possible expense of performance against rarer ones. Another example of metagaming would be bluffing opponents into expecting cards that you do not have, or surprising the competition with novel decks that they may not be prepared for. The secondary market of cards is heavily influenced by metagame trends: cards become more valuable when they are popular, often to the point of scarcity.&lt;ref name="MILLER"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Miller | first =John Jackson | title =Scrye Collectible Card Game Checklist &amp; Gaylord| year =2003 | pages =17 | postscript =. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[fighting game]]s, metagaming may occur at the character select screen. The opposing character has various strengths that can be avoided and weaknesses that can be exploited more easily depending on the character you choose provided you are aware of those strengths and weaknesses (called a "match up"). For a basic example, a character with a projectile attack has the advantage over a grappler who must be close to the opponent to be effective. Match up metagaming is very important in tournament settings. In recent fighting games, blind select has been implemented for online modes. This makes it so that neither player can see what character the other player chose. In tournaments, players have the option to opt for a blind select where they tell a judge in confidence the character they intend to select in the match, making their character choice mandatory. A newer trend in more recently released titles is to allow the selection of multiple characters at once which the player can then switch between on the fly, rendering match-up picking excessively hard and virtually impractical.
* In [[space simulation]] action games like ''[[Star Conflict]]'' or ''[[Star Citizen]]'', metagaming occurs in selecting the ship class, weapons, shields and active ship modules in regard to game mode or the kind of team play. Metagaming in the player vs player mode (PvP) plans and realizes ship builds and teamplay mechanics according to the most damaging weapons, the escapes available to ships, the duration of crowd control effects, etc. The abbreviation ''meta'' may refer to a term in gamer slang for what works currently on the highest competitive level and what is the leading type of ships or multiplayer strategy, for example. 
* Many [[logic puzzles]] allow an analogue of metagaming.  By convention, logic puzzles are only considered well-constructed if they have a unique solution.  When solving a puzzle, one might notice that if a certain candidate symbol were placed in one square, there would be multiple ways to complete another part of the puzzle, and no extra information could possibly decide between them.  Ruling out that candidate on these grounds might be classed as metagaming if the existence of a single solution were merely a convention rather than a rule.
* In the cooperative card game [[Hanabi (card game)|Hanabi]] virtually all the strategy is dependent on metagame, such as the widespread convention that players discard unclued cards from a fixed side of their hand and add new cards from the opposite side. The metagame can go several levels deep. For instance, one may indicate that an unclued card just added to a hand is a playable 3-White by cluing the 4-White in a different player's hand (this is known as "finesse"). But if a player is aware that everyone in the game is familiar with finesse, they may merely ''pretend'' to finesse in order to get some other card played: perhaps it was not a 3-White, but some other card that was nonetheless also playable.
*In repeated, competitive, multiplayer games in which players can team up to gain an advantage, gamers who betray their allies too often may be mistrusted, making it difficult to form partnerships in subsequent games.&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nigel Howard defines metagame as a decision-making process that derives from the analysis of possible outcomes depending on external variables that alter a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Paradoxes of Rationality: Games, Metagames, and Political Behavior - Nigel Howard [https://www.worldcat.org/title/paradoxes-of-rationality-theory-of-metagames-and-political-behavior/oclc/277215]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/paradoxes-of-rationality-theory-of-metagames-and-political-behavior/oclc/277215] Rationality: Games, Metagames, and Political Behavior - Nigel Howard.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games==

===Adaptation to a specific gaming environment===
Another game-related use of the term "metagaming" refers to operation on knowledge of the current strategic trends within a game. This usage is common in games that have large, organized play systems or tournament circuits and which feature customized decks of cards, sets of miniatures or other playing pieces for each player. Some examples of this kind of environment are tournament scenes for tabletop or computer collectible card games like ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' or ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]]'', tabletop war-gaming such as ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' or ''[[Flames of War]]'', or team-based multiplayer games such as ''[[Star Conflict]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. 

The metagame in these environments is often affected by new elements added by the game's developers and publishers, such as new card expansions in card games, or adjustments to character abilities in online games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/18285891/2017-dota-2-pro-reactions-dota-2-patch-700 | title = Pros react to Dota 2 Patch 7.00 | first = Eric | last = Von Allen | date = December 15, 2016 | accessdate = December 29, 2016 | work = [[ESPN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The metagame may also come within player communities as reactions to win over currently-popular strategies, creating ebbs and flows of strategy types over time.

===Computer games===
Recently the term metagame has come to be used{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} by PC Gaming shoutcasters to describe an emergent methodology that is a subset of the basic strategy necessary to play the game at a high level.  The definitions of this term are varied but can include "pre-game" theory, behavior prediction, or "''ad hoc'' strategy" depending on the game being played.  An example of this would be in [[StarCraft]] where a player's previous matches with the same opponent have given them insight into that player's playstyle and may cause them to make certain decisions which would otherwise seem inferior.

===Role-playing games===
{{Main|Metagaming (role-playing games)}}
In [[role-playing game]]s, metagaming is a term often used to describe players' use of assumed characteristics of the game. In particular, metagaming often refers to having an in-game character act on knowledge that the player has access to but the character should not.  For example, tricking [[Medusa]] to stare at a mirror when the character has never heard of Medusa and would not be aware of her petrifying stare. 

For instance, a player might adjust his character's actions if the player has some foreknowledge of the long-term intentions of the [[gamemaster]], or, more commonly, the gamemaster's tendency to have (or lack) mercy on players whose characters do things that would cause them to fail at their objectives. A player changing how they play the game based on their knowledge of the gamemaster would be metagaming.

'''Mimi of Decorse''', also known as '''Mimi of Gaudefroy-Demombynes''' and '''Mimi-D''', is a language of [[Chad]] that is attested only in a word list labelled "[[Mimi language (disambiguation)|Mimi]]" that was collected ca. 1900 by G. J. Decorse and published by Gaudefroy-Demombynes. Joseph Greenberg (1960) classified it as a [[Maban language]], like the rather remote Maban relative [[Mimi of Nachtigal]]. However, George Starostin (2011) rejects this classification, arguing that similarities to Maban are due to contact with locally dominant [[Maba language|Maba]] (the similarities are with that language specifically, not with the entire Maban family), and provisionally regards it as a language isolate, though it is suggestive of [[Central Sudanic]].&lt;ref&gt;Starostin, George.

[[File:Teatr San Carlo Neapol.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Teatro di San Carlo]] in [[Naples]], the world’s oldest working opera house.]]

An '''opera house''' is a [[theater (structure)|theatre]] building used for [[opera]] performances that consists of a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], an [[orchestra pit]], audience seating, and backstage facilities for [[costumes]] and set building.

While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger [[performing arts]] centers. Indeed the term ''opera house'' itself is often used as a term of prestige for any large performing-arts center.

== History ==
[[File:Metz Theatre nuit.jpg|thumb|[[Opéra-Théâtre de Metz Métropole|Opera-Theatre]] of [[Metz]], built by [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] [[Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet|Duke de Belle-Isle]] during the 18th century, it is the oldest opera house working in France]]
The first public opera house was the [[Teatro San Cassiano]] in [[Venice]], opened in 1637. Italy is a country where opera has been popular through the centuries among ordinary people as well as wealthy patrons and it continues to have a large number of working opera houses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A567362 BBC website]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Teatro Massimo]] in [[Palermo]] (the biggest in [[Italy]]), [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in [[Naples]] (the world's oldest working opera house) and [[La Scala|Teatro La Scala]] in [[Milan]]. In contrast, there was no opera house in London when [[Henry Purcell]] was composing and the first opera house in Germany was built in [[Hamburg]] in 1678.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, opera houses were often financed by rulers, nobles, and wealthy people who used [[patronage]] of the arts to endorse their political ambition and social position.  With the rise of [[bourgeois]] and [[capitalism|capitalist]] social forms in the 19th century, European culture moved away from its patronage system to a publicly supported system.

Early United States opera houses served a variety of functions in towns and cities, hosting community dances, fairs, plays, and vaudeville shows as well as operas and other musical events. In the 2000s, most opera and theatre companies are supported by funds from a combination of government and institutional [[Grant (money)|grants]], ticket sales, and private donations.

== Features ==

The [[Teatro San Carlo]] in [[Naples]], opened in 1737, introduced the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, the oldest in the world, a model for the Italian theater. On this model were built subsequent theaters in Italy and Europe, among others, the court theater of the [[Palace of Caserta]], which became the model for other theaters.
Given the popularity of opera in 18th and 19th century Europe, opera houses are usually large, often containing more than 1,000 seats. Traditionally, Europe's major opera houses built in the 19th century contained between about 1,500 to 3,000 seats, examples being [[Brussels]]' [[La Monnaie]] (after renovations, 1,700 seats), [[Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater]] (with 1,636), [[Warsaw]]'s [[Grand Theatre, Warsaw|Grand Theatre]] (the main auditorium with 1,841), [[Paris]]' [[Palais Garnier]] (with 2,200), the [[Royal Opera House]] in London (with 2,268) and the [[Vienna State Opera]] (the new auditorium with 2,280). Modern opera houses of the 20th century such as [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] (with 3,800) and the [[War Memorial Opera House]] in [[San Francisco]] (with 3,146) are larger. Many operas are better suited to being presented in smaller theaters, such as [[Venice]]'s [[La Fenice]] with about 1,000 seats.

In a traditional opera house, the auditorium is U-shaped, with the length of the sides determining the audience capacity.  Around this are tiers of balconies, and often, nearer to the stage, are boxes (small partitioned sections of a balcony).

Since the latter part of the 19th century, opera houses often have an [[orchestra pit]], where a large number of orchestra players may be seated at a level below the audience, so that they can play without overwhelming the singing voices. This is especially true of [[Wagner]]'s [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] where the pit is partially covered.

The size of an opera orchestra varies, but for some operas, [[oratorio]]s and other works, it may be very large; for some romantic period works (or for many of the operas of [[Richard Strauss]]), it can be more than 100 players.  Similarly, an opera may have a large cast of characters, chorus, dancers and [[supernumeraries]].  Therefore, a major opera house will have extensive dressing room facilities.  Opera houses often have on-premises set and costume building shops and facilities for storage of costumes, make-up, masks, and stage properties, and may also have rehearsal spaces.

Major opera houses throughout the world often have highly mechanized [[Stage (theatre)|stages]], with large stage elevators permitting heavy sets to be changed rapidly.  At the [[Metropolitan Opera]], for instance, sets are often changed during the action, as the audience watches, with singers rising or descending as they sing. This occurs in the Met's productions of operas such as ''[[Aida]]'' and ''[[Tales of Hoffman]]''. [[London]]'s [[Royal Opera House]], which was remodeled in the late 1990s, retained the original 1858 auditorium at its core, but added completely new backstage and wing spaces as well as an additional performance space and public areas.  Much the same happened in the remodeling of Milan's [[La Scala]] opera house between 2002 and 2004.

Although stage, lighting and other production aspects of opera houses often make use of the latest technology, traditional opera houses have not used [[sound reinforcement system]]s with microphones and loudspeakers to amplify the singers, since trained opera singers are normally able to project their unamplified voices in the hall. Since the 1990s, however, some opera houses have begun using a subtle form of sound reinforcement called [[acoustic enhancement]] (see below).

Often, operas are presented in their original languages, which may be different from the first language of the audience.  For example, a Wagnerian opera presented in London may be in German.  Therefore, since the 1980s modern opera houses have assisted the audience by providing translated [[supertitles]], projections of the words above or near to the stage. More recently, [[electronic libretto]] systems have begun to be used in some opera houses, including New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]], Milan's [[La Scala]], and the Crosby Theatre of [[The Santa Fe Opera]], which provide two lines of text on individual screens attached to the backs of the seats so as to not interfere with the visual aspects of the performance.

=== Acoustic enhancement with loudspeakers ===
A subtle type of sound reinforcement called [[acoustic enhancement]] is used in some opera houses. Acoustic enhancement systems help give a more even sound in the hall and prevent "dead spots" in the audience seating area by "...augment[ing] a hall's intrinsic acoustic characteristics." The systems use "...an array of microphones connected to a computer [which is] connected to an array of loudspeakers." However, as concertgoers have become aware of the use of these systems, debates have arisen, because "...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://harada-sound.com/sound/handbook/intro2.html Kai Harada, "Why do you need a Sound System?", 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kai Harada
&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030509141457/http://entertainmentdesignmag.com/ar/show_business_operas_dirty_little/index.htm Kai Harada, "Opera's Dirty Little Secret"], ''Entertainment Design website'', Mar 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; states that opera houses have begun using electronic acoustic enhancement systems "...to compensate for flaws in a venue's acoustical architecture." Despite the uproar that has arisen amongst operagoers, Harada points out that none of the opera houses using acoustic enhancement systems "...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre." Instead, most opera houses use the sound reinforcement system for acoustic enhancement, and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in ''[[Tosca]] '' or thunder in Wagnerian operas).

One example of the use of this kind of enhancement is the [[David H. Koch Theater|New York State Theater]] when it was used by the [[New York City Opera]] company.

== Other uses of the term ==
In the 19th-century United States, many theaters were given the name "opera house," even ones where opera was seldom if ever performed. Opera was viewed as a more respectable art form than theater; calling a local theater an "opera house" therefore served to elevate it and overcome objections from those who found the theater morally objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coal and Culture: Opera Houses in Appalachia|last=Condee|first=William Faricy|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8214-1588-3|location=Athens, Ohio|pages=6|quote=The term 'opera house' is indeed misleading, and intentionally so; it provides a veneer of social and cultural respectability and avoids the stigma of the title 'theater.'|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Name Opera House|last=|first=|date=March 7, 1885|work=Dramatic Mirror|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perkele''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈperkele|lang|Fi-perkele.ogg}}) means ''[[devil]]'' in modern Finnish and is a popular [[Finnish profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kielitoimiston sanakirja|publisher=Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus |year=2006|ISBN=952-5446-20-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
The name is of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin; [[Perkwunos]] is the reconstructed name of the god of thunder. Other gods from cultures hypothecised from the same origin include [[Perkūnas]] ([[Lithuania]]), [[Pērkons]] ([[Latvia]]), [[Percunis]] ([[Prussia]]), [[Piarun]] ([[Belarus]]), [[Peko]] or Pekolasõ ([[Estonia]]), [[Parjanya]] ([[India]]) and [[Perun]] or Piorun ([[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]]).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Some researchers consider ''Perkele'' to be an original name of the thunder god [[Ukko]], the chief god of the [[Finnish paganism|Finnish pagan]] pantheon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siikala|first=Anna-Leena|title=Itämerensuomalaisten mytologia|publisher=SKS|year=2013|location=Helsinki}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this view is not shared by all researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salo|first=Unto|title=Agricola's Ukko in the light of archeology.

==Use==
It has a history of being used as a curse:  a cry for the god for strength. It still is a common curse word in vernacular Finnish. To a Finn, the word entails seriousness and potency that more lightly used curses lack. Also, when the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland held a popular contest to nominate the "most energizing" word in the Finnish language, one of the suggestions was Perkele because "it is the curse word that gave the most strength for the reconstruction of Finland after the wars."
For comparison, "Parom" a corrupted form of the name "Perun", is used as a mild curse in Slovak language - "Do Paroma!" is roughly equivalent to perkele in Finnish.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As Finland was [[Christianization|Christianized]], the [[Catholic Church]] started to demonise the old Finnish deities. This led to the use of "''Perkele''" as a translation for "Devil" in the Finnish translation of the Bible. Later, in a 1992 translation, the word was rendered as ''paholainen'' (the evil one).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Uses in popular culture==

Many Finnish [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands like [[Impaled Nazarene]], [[Norther]] and [[Pepe Deluxe]] use the word ''perkele'' for emphasis and to reference Finnishness, while another Finnish metal band, [[Amorphis]], have a song titled "Perkele (The God of Fire)", the sixth track on their album ''[[Eclipse (Amorphis album)|Eclipse]]''.

The Swedish [[Oi!]] band Perkele were formed in 1993 in [[Gothenburg]] and are currently signed to [[Oi! the Boat Records]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23783">'''Proto-Uralic''' is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] language ancestral to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] [[language family]]. The language was originally spoken in a small area in about 7000–2000 BCE (estimates vary), and expanded to give differentiated [[protolanguage]]s. The exact location of the area or [[Urheimat]] is not known, and [[Proto-Uralic homeland hypotheses|various strongly differing proposals]] have been advocated, but the vicinity of the [[Ural Mountains]] is usually assumed.

According to the traditional binary tree model, Proto-Uralic diverged into [[Proto-Samoyedic]] and [[Proto-Finno-Ugric]]. However, reconstructed Proto-Finno-Ugric differs little from Proto-Uralic, and many apparent differences follow from the methods used. Thus Proto-Finno-Ugric may not be separate from Proto-Uralic. Another reconstruction of the split of Proto-Uralic has three branches (Finno-Permic, Ugric and Samoyedic) from the start. Recently these tree-like models have been challenged by the hypothesis of larger number of protolanguages giving a "comb" rather than a tree. The protolanguages would be Sami, (Baltic&amp;#8209;)Finnic, Mordva, Mari, Permic, Magyar, Khanti, Mansi, and Samoyedic. This order is both the order of geographical positions as well as linguistic similarity, with neighboring languages being more similar than distant ones.

== Phonology ==

Similarly to the situation for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], reconstructions of Proto-Uralic are traditionally not written in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] but in [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet|UPA]]. UPA is used here, followed by the IPA equivalents between slashes (because it is a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] reconstruction).

===Vowels===
Proto-Uralic had [[vowel harmony]] and a rather large inventory of vowels in initial syllables, much like the modern Finnish or Estonian system:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!
! colspan=2 | [[front vowel|Front]]
! colspan=2 | [[back vowel|Back]]
|-
!
! [[unrounded vowel|Unrounded]]
! [[rounded vowel|Rounded]]

|-

| i {{IPA|/i/}}
| ü {{IPA|/y/}}
| ï {{IPA|/ɯ/}}
| u {{IPA|/u/}}
|-
! [[mid vowel|Mid]]
| e {{IPA|/e/}}
|
|
| o {{IPA|/o/}}
|-
! [[open vowel|Open]]
| ä {{IPA|/æ/}}
|
| a {{IPA|/ɑ/}}
|
|}

Sometimes a mid vowel *''ë'' {{IPA|/ɤ/}} is reconstructed in place of *''ï'', or a low back rounded *''å'' {{IPA|/ɒ/}} in place of *''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Janhunen 1981a pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no monophonemic long vowels nor diphthongs, though sequences of vowel and semivowel within a single syllable (such as *äj) could exist.

====Unstressed vowels====
Vowel inventory in non-initial syllables was restricted: only a two-way contrast of open and non-open vowels is incontestably reconstructible.{{sfn|Helimski|1984|p=248}} The actual realization of this contrast is a question of debate: one view considers this two [[Archiphoneme|archiphonemic]] vowels {{IPA|//a//}} and {{IPA|//i//}}, realized as four allophones {{IPA|[æ ɑ]}}, {{IPA|[i ɯ]}} as per [[vowel harmony]].

For the non-open vowel(s), most branches reflect a reduced vowel {{IPA|[ə]}}; only two branches give evidence for a specific value:
* The [[Finnic languages]] show {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/ɤ/}} depending on harmony, word-finally {{IPA|/i/}}.
* The [[Samic languages]] show a variety of reflexes, but these reflexes can be traced back to a [[Proto-Samic]] phoneme ''*ë'', which is also the reflex of Proto-Uralic ''*i'' and ''*ü'' in stressed syllables.

While [[vowel reduction]] is a common sound change, Finnic is known to have [[adstrate]] influence from language groups that would not have known reduced vowels (namely the [[Baltic languages]] and the early [[Germanic languages]]), so a value of {{IPA|[ə]}} already in Proto-Uralic remains a possibility.&lt;ref name=PK12&gt;

|journal=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia
|volume=264
|issn=0355-0230
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these three or four stem types were certainly the most prominent ones in Proto-Uralic, it is possible that other, rarer types may have existed as well.{{sfn|Helimski|1984|p=249}} These include for example kinship terms such as "sister-in-law", found as *kälü in both Proto-Finnic and Proto-Samoyedic. Janhunen (1981) and Sammallahti (1988) reconstruct here instead a word-final labial glide: *käliw.

A general difficulty in reconstructing unstressed vowels for Proto-Uralic lies in their heavy reduction and loss in many of the Uralic languages. Especially in the [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] and [[Permic languages|Permic]] languages, almost no trace of unstressed vowels appears in basic word roots. The original bisyllabic root structure has been well preserved in only the more peripheral groups: Samic and Finnic in the northwest, Samoyedic in the east. The main correspondences of unstressed vowels between these are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Reflexes of Proto-Uralic unstressed vowels

|}
Developments in Mordvinic and Mari are rather more complicated. In the former, Proto-Uralic *-a and *-ä are usually reduced to *-ə; *-a is however regularly retained whenever the first syllable of the word contained *u. Proto-Uralic *-ə is regularly lost after open syllables, as well as in some other positions.&lt;ref name="Ravila 29"&gt;{{citation|last=Ravila|author-link=Paavo Ravila|first=Paavo|title=Über eine doppelte vertretung des urfinnischwolgaischen ''*a'' der nichtersten silbe im mordwinischen|year=1929|journal=Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen|volume=20|issn=0355-1253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conditional vowel shifts====
A number of roots appear to diverge from the main picture of unstressed syllables in a different way: while Finnic, Samic and Samoyedic languages all have one of the "typical" stem shapes, they may not quite match. Words in these classes often feature discrepancies in the vowels of the first syllable as well, e.g. Finnic *a or *oo (suggesting Proto-Uralic *a or *ë) against Samic *ā (suggesting Proto-Uralic *ä) or *oa (suggesting Proto-Uralic *o).&lt;ref name=PK12/&gt;

A number of such cases may result simply from conditional vowel shifts in unstressed syllables.  In fact, multiple vowel shifts are reconstructed in branches of Uralic sensitive to a particular combination of stem vowel and following reduced vowel, in which both change at once.  A shift *a-ə &gt; *o-a can be posited for Samic as well as the [[Mordvinic languages]]. E.g.:&lt;ref name=AA13&gt;{{citation|last=Aikio|first=Ante|title=Uralilaisen kantakielen vokaalistosta|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
The change is, however, masked by the shift of *ë to *a (which later develops to Proto-Samic *uo) in words such as:
{| class="wikitable"

===Consonants===
In the consonant system, [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], or palatal-laminal instead of apical articulation, was a phonemic feature, as it is in many modern Uralic languages. Only one series of stops (unvoiced unaspirated) existed:

The phonetic nature of the segment symbolized by *x is uncertain, though it is usually considered a back consonant;&lt;ref name=JJ07/&gt; {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, and {{IPA|[h]}} have been suggested among others. Janhunen (1981, 2007) takes no explicit stance, leaving open the option for even a vocalic value. The segment has some similarity to the Indo-European [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] (to which it can correspond in loanwords): it is reconstructed by certain scholars in syllable-final position in word-stems where a contrastive long vowel later developed (similar to [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ğ), best preserved in the Finnic languages, and where Samoyedic features a vowel sequence such as *åə. The correlation between these two stem classes is however not perfect, and alternate possibilities exist for explaining both vowel length in Finnic and vowel sequences in Samoyedic.&lt;ref name=AA12&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; *x is also reconstructed word-medially, and in this position it also develops to a Finnic long vowel, but has clear consonantal reflexes elsewhere: *k in Samic, *j in Mordvinic and *ɣ in Ugric. If a consonant, it probably derives from lenition of *k at a pre-Uralic stage; it is only found in words ending in a non-open vowel, while *k is infrequent or nonexistent in similar positions.&lt;ref name=JJ07&gt;{{citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonetical identity of the consonant {{UPA|*δ´}} is also subject to some doubt. It is traditionally analyzed as the palatalized counterpart of the [[voiced dental fricative]] {{UPA|*δ}}, that is, as {{IPA|[ðʲ]}}; however, this a [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] rare sound value for which no direct evidence is found in any Uralic language, and a pure palatal fricative {{IPA|[ʝ]}} is another option; a third option is a palatal liquid like, e.&amp;nbsp;g., Czech ''ř''.&lt;ref name=JJ07/&gt;  Ugricist [[László Honti]] has advanced a reconstruction with [[lateral fricative]]s: {{IPA|[ɬ]}}, {{IPA|[ɬʲ]}} for {{UPA|*δ, *δ´}}.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dubious segments====

The phonemes in parentheses—*ć, *š, *ĺ—are supported by only limited evidence, and are not assumed by all scholars. Sammallahti (1988) notes that while instances of *ć are found in all three of Permic, Hungarian and Ob-Ugric, there are "very few satisfactory etymologies" showing any correlation between the branches in whether *ć or *ś appears. In the other languages, no consistent distinction between these consonants is found. The evidence for the postalveolar sibilant *š however is "scarce but probably conclusive" (ibid): it is treated distinctly from *s only in the more western ([[Finno-Permic languages|Finno-Permic]]) languages, but certain loans from as far back as the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] have reflexes traceable to a postalveolar fricative (including *piši- or *peši- "to cook"). The possibility of *ĺ is not considered by him at all. In contrast, Janhunen,&lt;ref name=JJ07/&gt; who considers Samoyedic evidence necessary for conclusions about Proto-Uralic, doubts that *š can be reconstructed, preferring to consider it a secondary, post-Proto-Uralic innovation (p.&amp;nbsp;210). He agrees with Sammallahti in omitting *ĺ and in only  considering a single palatal obstruent as necessary to reconstruct; for the latter he suggests the sound value of a palatal stop, {{IPA|[c]}} (p.&amp;nbsp;211).

===Phonotactics===

No initial or final [[consonant cluster]]s were allowed, so words could begin and end with a maximum of one consonant only. The single consonants {{UPA|*δ *r *x *ŋ}} also could not occur word-initially, though at least for the first of these, this may be an coincidental omission in the data. A reconstruction {{UPA|*δäpδä}} "spleen" exists but is not found in Samoyedic and the most stringent criteria for a Proto-Uralic root thus exclude it. A similar case is {{UPA|*repä}} "fox", a loanword from Indo-Iranian.

Inside word roots, only clusters of two consonants were permitted. Since ''*j'' and ''*w'' were consonants even between a vowel and another consonant, there were no sequences of a "diphthong" followed by two consonants, like in e.g. Finnish ''veitsi''. While [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] was not a phonemic feature, double (i.e. [[Consonant length|geminate]]) stops probably existed ({{UPA|*ïppi}} "father-in-law", {{UPA|*witti}} "five", {{UPA|*lükkä-}} "to push"), and the singleton–geminate contrast in most descendant languages developed into a voiced–voiceless distinction (Finnic is a notable exception, e.g. Finnish ''appi'', ''lykkää'').

When, due to suffixation, consonant clusters arose that were not permitted, the non-low vowel was inserted as a prop vowel. This process was obscured in the Finnic languages by an opposing process which syncopated unstressed ''*e'' in many cases.

===Prosody===

Proto-Uralic did not have tones, which contrasts with Yeniseian and some Siberian languages. Neither was there contrastive stress as in Indo-European; in Proto-Uralic the first syllable was invariably stressed.

===Phonological processes===

[[Consonant gradation]] may have occurred already in Proto-Uralic: if it did, it was probably a phonetical alternation involving allophonic voicing of the stop consonants: [p] ~ [b], [t] ~ [d], [k] ~ [g].&lt;ref&gt;Helimski, Eugene. Proto-Uralic gradation: Continuation and traces

==Grammar==

Grammatically Proto-Uralic was an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[nominative–accusative]] language.

===Nouns===

Proto-Uralic nouns are reconstructed with at least six noun cases and three numbers, singular, dual and plural. Grammatical gender was not recognized and no Uralic language does so even today. Noun articles were unknown.

The plural marker of nouns was *''-t'' in final position and *''-j-'' in non-final position, as seen in Finnish ''talot'' and ''talojen'' ("house" Pl.Nom and Pl.Gen). The [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] marker has been reconstructed as *''-k-'', but the dual number has been lost in many of the contemporary Uralic languages.

The cases were:
* [[nominative case|nominative]] (no suffix)
* [[accusative case|accusative]] *-m
* [[dative case|dative]]/[[genitive case|genitive]] *-n
* [[locative case|locative]] *-na / *-nä
* [[ablative case|ablative]]/[[instrumentative]] *-ta / *-tä
* [[lative case|lative]] *-ŋ

The cases had only one three-way locative contrast of entering, residing and exiting (lative, locative and ablative respectively). This is the origin of the three-way systems as the three different ones in Karelian [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (illative/inessive/elative, allative/adessive/ablative, translative/essive/excessive). The [[partitive case]], developed from the ablative, was a later innovation in the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Samic languages|Samic]] languages. Further cases are occasionally mentioned, e.g. [[Robert Austerlitz]]'s reconstruction of Proto-Finno-Ugric{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} includes a seventh, [[adverbial case|adverbial]].

The nouns also had [[possessive suffix]]es, one for each combination of number and person. These took the place of possessive pronouns, which did not exist.

===Verbs===

Verbs were conjugated at least according to number, person and tense. The reconstructions of mood markers are controversial. Some scholars argue that there were separate subjective and objective conjugations, but this is disputed; clear reflexes of the objective conjugation are found in only the easternmost branches, and hence it may also represent an areal innovation. Negation was expressed with the means of a [[negative verb]] ''*e-'', found as such in e.g. Finnish ''e+mme'' "we don't".

== Vocabulary ==

Only some 200 word roots can be reconstructed for Proto-Uralic, if it is required that every word reconstructed for the proto-language should be present in [[Samoyedic languages]] (related to the hypothesis that Samoyedic was the first group to split off: see discussion at [[Finno-Ugric languages]]). With a laxer criterion of reconstructing words which are attested in most branches of the language family, a number in the range of 300–400 roots can be reached.

The following examples of reconstructed items are considered to fulfill the strictest criteria and are thus accepted as Proto-Uralic words by practically all scholars in the field:
* Body parts and bodily functions: *''ïpti'' hair on the head, *''ojwa'' head, *''śilmä'' eye, *''poski'' cheek, *''kä(x)li'' tongue/language, *''mïksa'' liver, *''elä-'' to live, *''ka(x)li-'' to die, *''wajŋi'' breath, *''kosi'' cough, *''kunśi'' urine, *''küńili'' tear, *''se(x)ji'' pus.
* Kinship terms: *''emä'' mother, *''čečä'' uncle, *''koska'' aunt, *''mińä'' daughter-in-law, *''wäŋiw'' son-in-law.
* Verbs for universally known actions: *''meni-'' to go, *''toli-'' to come, *''aśkili-'' to step, *''imi-'' to suck, *''soski-'' to chew, *''pala-'' to eat up, *''uji-'' to swim, *''sala-'' to steal, *''kupsa-'' to extinguish, *''tumti-'' to know.
* Basic objects and concepts of the natural world: *''juka'' river, *''toxi'' lake, *''weti'' water, *''päjwä'' sun/warmth, *''kala'' fish, *''suŋi'' summer, *''śala-'' lightning, *''wanča'' root, *''ko(x)ji'' [[birch]], *''ka(x)si'' [[spruce]], *''sïksi'' [[Siberian pine]], *''δ´ï(x)mi'' [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]], *''muna'' egg.
* Elementary technology: *''tuli'' fire, *''śüδi'' coal, *''äjmä'' needle, *''pura'' drill/to bore, *''jïŋsi'' bow, *''jänti'' bow string, *''ńï(x)li'' arrow, *''δ´ümä'' glue, *''lïpśi'' cradle, *''piksi'' rope, *''suksi'' ski, *''woča'' fence.
* Basic spatial concepts: *''ïla'' below, *''üli'' above, *''wasa'' left, *''pälä'' "half", *''pe(x)li'' side.
* [[Pronouns]]: *''mun'' I, *''tun'' you, *''ke-'' who, *''mi-'' what.

A reconstruction of a word *''wäśkä'', meaning 'reddish metal' (copper, bronze or iron), has also been proposed. However, this word shows irregularities in sound correspondence, and some scholars believe it to be a [[Wanderwort]] instead.

The reconstructed vocabulary is compatible with a [[Mesolithic]] culture (bow, arrow, needle, sinew, but also rope, fence, cradle, ski), a north Eurasian landscape (spruce, birch, Siberian pine), and contains interesting hints on [[kinship terminology|kinship structure]].

Examples of vocabulary correspondences between the modern Uralic languages are provided in the [[:fi:Uralilainen sanasto|list of comparisons]] at the Finnish Wikipedia.

'''Quantitative linguistics''' ('''QL''') is a sub-discipline of [[general linguistics]] and, more specifically, of [[mathematical linguistics]]. Quantitative linguistics deals with language learning, language change, and application as well as structure of natural languages. QL investigates languages using statistical methods; its most demanding objective is the formulation of language laws and, ultimately, of a general theory of language in the sense of a set of interrelated languages laws.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Köhler: ''Gegenstand und Arbeitsweise der Quantitativen Linguistik''. In: Reinhard Köhler, Gabriel Altmann, Rajmund G. Piotrowski (Hrsg.): ''Quantitative Linguistik - Quantitative Linguistics. Ein internationales Handbuch.'' de Gruyter, Berlin/ New York 2005, pp. 1–16. {{ISBN|3-11-015578-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synergetic linguistics]] was from its very beginning specifically designed for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Köhler: ''Synergetic linguistics''. In: Reinhard Köhler, Gabriel Altmann, Rajmund G. Piotrowski (Hrsg.): ''Quantitative Linguistik - Quantitative Linguistics. Ein internationales Handbuch.'' de Gruyter, Berlin/ New York 2005, pp. 760–774. {{ISBN|3-11-015578-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
QL is empirically based on the results of language statistics, a field which can be interpreted as statistics of languages or as statistics of any linguistic object. This field is not necessarily connected to substantial theoretical ambitions. [[Corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]] are other fields which contribute important [[empirical evidence]].

==History==
The earliest QL approaches date back in the ancient Greek and Indian world. One of the historical sources consists of applications of combinatorics to linguistic matters,&lt;ref&gt;N.L. Biggs: ''The Roots of Combinatorics.'' In: ''Historia Mathematica'' 6, 1979, pp. 109–136.&lt;/ref&gt; another one is based on elementary statistical studies, which can be found under the header [[colometry]] and [[stichometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Pawłowski: ''Prolegomena to the History of Corpus and Quantitative Linguistics. Greek Antiquity.'' In: ''Glottotheory'' 1, 2008, pp. 48–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language laws==
In QL, the concept of law is understood as the class of law hypotheses which have been deduced from theoretical assumptions, are mathematically formulated, are interrelated with other laws in the field, and have sufficiently and successfully been tested on empirical data, i.e. which could not be refuted in spite of much effort to do so. Köhler writes about QL laws: "Moreover, it can be shown that these properties of linguistic elements and of the relations among them abide by universal laws which can be formulated strictly mathematically in the same way as common in the natural sciences. One has to bear in mind in this context that these laws are of stochastic nature; they are not observed in every single case (this would be neither necessary nor possible); they rather determine the probabilities of the events or proportions under study. It is easy to find counterexamples to each of the above-mentioned examples; nevertheless, these cases do not violate the corresponding laws as variations around the statistical mean are not only admissible but even essential; they are themselves quantitatively exactly determined by the corresponding laws. This situation does not differ from that in the natural sciences, which have since long abandoned the old deterministic and causal views of the world and replaced them by statistical/probabilistic models."&lt;ref&gt;cf. note 1, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some linguistic laws==
There exist quite a number of proposed language laws, among them are:&lt;ref&gt;cf. references: Köhler, Altmann, Piotrowski (eds.) (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Law of diversification: If linguistic categories such as parts-of-speech or inflectional endings appear in various forms it can be shown that the frequencies of their occurrences in texts are controlled by laws.
* Length (or more generally, complexity) distributions. The investigation of text or dictionary frequencies of units of any kind with regard to their lengths yields regularly a number of distributions, depending on the given kind of the unit under study. By now, the following units have been studied:
** Law of the distribution of morph lengths;
** Law of the distribution of the lengths of rhythmical units;
** Law of the distribution of sentence lengths;
** Law of the distribution of syllable lengths;
** Law of the distribution of word lengths;
Other linguistic units which also abide by this law are e.g., letters (characters) of different complexities, the lengths of the so-called hrebs and of speech acts. The same holds for the distributions of sounds (phones) of different durations.
* Martin's law: This law concerns lexical chains which are obtained by looking up the definition of a word in a dictionary, then looking up the definition of the definition just obtained etc. Finally, all these definitions form a hierarchy of more and more general meanings, whereby the number of definitions decreases with increasing generality. Among the levels of this kind of hierarchy, there exists a number of lawful relations.
* [[Menzerath's law]] (also, in particular in linguistics, Menzerath-Altmann law): This law states that the sizes of the constituents of a construction decrease with increasing size of the construction under study. The longer, e.g. a sentence (measured in terms of the number of clauses) the shorter the clauses (measured in terms of the number of words), or: the longer a word (in syllables or morphs) the shorter the syllables or words in sounds).
* Rank-frequency laws: Virtually any kind of linguistic units abides by these relations. We will give here only a few illustrative examples:
** The words of a text are arranged according to their text frequency and assigned a rank number and the corresponding frequency. Since George Kingsley Zipf (the well-known “Zipf’s Law”), a large number of mathematical models of the relation between rank and frequency has been proposed.
** A similar distribution between rank and frequency of sounds, phonemes, and letters can be observed.
** Word associations: Rank and frequency of associations subjects react with on a (word) stimulus.
* Law of language change: Growth processes in language such as vocabulary growth, the dispersion of foreign or loan words, changes in the inflectional system etc. abide by a law known in QL as Piotrowski law, and corresponds to growth models in other scientific disciplines. The Piotrowski law is a case of the so-called logistic model (cf. logistic equation). It was shown that it covers also language acquisition processes (cf. language acquisition law).
* Text block law: Linguistic units (e.g. words, letters, syntactic functions and constructions) show a specific frequency distribution in equally large text blocks.
* [[Zipf's law]]: The frequency of words is inversely proportional to their rank in frequency lists.&lt;ref&gt;H. Guiter, M. V. Arapov (eds.): ''Studies on Zipf's Law.'' Bochum: Brockmeyer 1982. {{ISBN|3-88339-244-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylistics==
The study of poetic and also non-poetic styles can be based on statistical methods; moreover, it is possible to conduct corresponding investigations on the basis of the specific forms (parameters) language laws take in texts of different styles. In such cases, QL supports research into stylistics: One of the overall aims is evidence as objective as possible also in at least part of the domain of stylistic phenomena by referring to language laws. One of the central assumptions of QL is that some laws (e.g. the distribution of word lengths) require different models, at least different parameter values of the laws (distributions or functions) depending on the text sort a text belongs to. If poetic texts are under study QL methods form a sub-discipline of Quantitative Study of Literature ([[stylometrics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Mehler: ''Eigenschaften der textuellen Einheiten und Systeme''.

{{wiktionary|sacred cow}}
'''Sacred cow''' is an [[idiom]], a figurative reference to [[Cattle in religion and mythology|sacred cows]] in some [[religion]]s.  This idiom is thought to originate in [[American English]],&lt;ref name=UK1&gt;{{cite web
  |title = Sacred cow
  |publisher = The Phrase Finder
  |url = http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/309250.html
  |accessdate = 9 September 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; although similar or even identical idioms occur in many other languages. In the political realm, it is a term with reference to issues that a politician would rather not touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicaldictionary.com/words/sacred-cow/|title=sacred cow|date=15 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idiom is based on the popular understanding of the elevated place of cows in [[Hinduism]] and appears to have emerged in America in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=UK1/&gt;  A literal sacred cow or [[sacred bull]] is an actual cow or bull that is treated with sincere respect. A figurative sacred cow is a [[figure of speech]] for something considered immune from question or criticism, especially unreasonably so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sacred+cow|title=the definition of sacred cow|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/309250.html|title='Sacred cow' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|first=Gary|last=Martin|website=Phrasefinder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradox==
One writer has suggested that there is an element of [[paradox]] in the concept of respect for a sacred cow, as illustrated in a comment about the novelist [[V. S. Naipaul]]: "V. S. Naipaul ... has the ability to distinguish the death of an ordinary ox, which, being of concern to no one, may be put quickly out of its agony, from that of a sacred cow, which must be solicitously guarded so that it can die its agonizing death without any interference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYDzjGVWs0gC&amp;pg=PA185|title=Reading against culture: ideology and narrative in the Japanese novel|last=Pollack|first=David|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|page=185|year=1992|isbn=978-0-8014-8035-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[motto]] of the [[Satire|satirical]] magazine ''[[The Realist]]'' was "Irreverence is our only sacred cow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Shripad Raghunath Joshi''' (1920 – 2002) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] author from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. 

Joshi was born in the [[Kolhapur]] district of [[Maharashtra]].

Under the leadership of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], he participated in the Indian struggle for freedom from the [[British Raj]]. For his freedom activities, the British rulers had imprisoned him during 1942 - 1944 at ''Yerawada'' prison. 

Joshi wrote mostly in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] or [[Hindi]] 194 books on different topics, including one on various facets of Mahatma Gandhi's life, a seven-volume travelogue, and a book on [[Muslim]] culture. He translated some [[Urdu]] poetry into [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

Maharashtra state government honored Joshi with ''Santwan'' award in 1980.

It is usually a mixture of English, Mandarin, Tamil, Malay, and other local dialects like Hokkien, Cantonese or Teochew. There are a few loan words from these languages i.e. 'pek chek' is often taken as being annoyed or frustrated and originate from Hokkien dialect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160919-the-language-the-government-tried-to-suppress|title=The language the government tried to suppress|last=Harbeck|first=James|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is used in casual contexts between Singaporeans, but is avoided in formal events when certain Singlish phrases may be considered unedifying. Singapore English can be broken into two subcategories. Standard Singapore English (SSE) and Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) or Singlish as many locals call it. The relationship between SSE and Singlish are viewed as a diglossia, in which SSE is restricted to be used in situations of formality where Singlish/ CSEi s used in most other circumstances.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.

Some of the most popular Singlish terms have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) since 2000, including ''wah'', ''sabo'', ''lepak'', ''shiok'', and ''hawker centre''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/march-2016-update/new-singapore-english-words/ New Singapore English words - OED] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918052829/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/march-2016-update/new-singapore-english-words/ |date=2016-09-18 }}, March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 Feb 2015, ''kiasu'' was chosen as OED's Word of the Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36275640 Singapore terms join Oxford English Dictionary - BBC], 12 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word origins==
Singlish vocabulary formally takes after [[British English]] (in terms of spelling and abbreviations), although naming conventions are in a mix of American and British ones (with American ones on the rise). For instance, local media have "sports pages" (''sport'' in British English) and "[[soccer]] coverage" (soccer&amp;mdash;originally slang for ''as'''soc'''iation football''&amp;mdash;while used in Britain, is more usually called just ''football''). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the [[Chinese in Singapore]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. It is also taken from Indian words such as ''dai'' meaning 'hey', ''goondu'' meaning 'stupid', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as ''borrow''/''lend'', which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, 借 (''jiè''), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: "Oi, can I borrow your calculator?" / "Hey, can you lend me your calculator?"

==Singlish dictionaries and word lists==
[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a light-hearted lexicon of Singlish published in 2002]]
There have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]]'s ''Eh, Goondu!'' (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  | last = Toh

Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.

2002 saw the publication of the ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  | title = The Coxford Singlish Dictionary
  | publisher = Angsana Books
  |year=2002
  | location = Singapore
  | isbn = 978-981-3056-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php Talkingcock.com]. In 2004 a website, [http://www.singlishdictionary.com ''A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English''], was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur lexicographer, the ''Dictionary'' appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.

The [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.

The lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the [[Speak Good English Movement]] over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.

Letters contributed to the forum of ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named "Speak Good Singlish Movement". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.

A list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.

===Food and beverages===
{{See also|Cuisine of Singapore}}

Singlish is prominently used in local coffee shops, or ''[[Kopi tiam|kopitiams]]'' (the word is obtained by combining the Malay word for coffee and the Hokkien word for shop), and other eateries. Local names of many food and drink items have become Singlish and consist of words from different languages and are indicative of the multi-racial society in Singapore. For example, ''teh'' is the Malay word for ''tea'' which itself originated from [[Hokkien (dialect)|Hokkien]], ''peng'' is the Hokkien word for ''ice'', ''kosong'' is the Malay word for ''zero'' to indicate no sugar, and ''C'' refers to ''[[Carnation (trademark)|Carnation]]'', a brand of [[evaporated milk]].

====Food====
Names of common local dishes in Singapore hawker centres are usually referred to in local dialect or language. However, as there are no English words for certain food items, the dialect terms used for them have slowly evolved into part of the Singlish vocabulary. Ordering in Singlish is widely understood by the hawkers. Some examples of food items which have become part of Singlish:

{{Original research|date=May 2011}}
'''Temperature play''' is a form of [[BDSM]] [[sensual play]] where objects and substances are used to stimulate the body's [[neuroreceptors]] for heat and cold for sensual effect.

==Temperature play in general==
Substances can include water, oil, [[wax play|molten wax]], ice, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, melted butter, chilled fresh fruit and steamed vegetables.

Objects can include cutlery, ball chains, necklaces and many others, often pre-heated in hot water or chilled in ice water. 
Space heaters, radiators, and other sources of heat can also be used for stimulating sensory arousal with heat.

Blindfolds are often used to intensify the effects, and [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] can also amplify the experience.

General scenarios are placing the person in a situation where they are exposed to heat and cold conditions more directly.

Safety precautions should be used which are appropriate for the materials, techniques and body parts involved.

==Variants of temperature play==
===Fire play===
Fire play is a form of temperature play that involves using flame on or very close to, the skin. The flame is typically on or applied with a fire wand (essentially a small torch), and frequently utilizes 70% [[isopropyl alcohol]] as fuel. Other common fire play toys include flaming gloves and flaming floggers; other common varieties of fuel include 91% [[isopropyl alcohol]], mousse, hand sanitizer, super-proof rum, grain alcohol, and [[Nitrocellulose|flash cotton]]. As with many forms of BDSM play, the proper tools, fuels, and safety guidelines are often in hot contention between players.

Fire play is usually considered a form of [[edge play]] -  frequently exciting, but with significant dangers. Unlike other forms of edge play (extreme rough body play, blood play, interrogations, abductions, etc.), fire play scenes tend to look kinder and gentler; although it can be dramatic, the sensations inflicted in most fire play scenes aren't actually painful (much like hot wax play or sensation play). Fire play also rarely leaves marks on the skin - though some people deliberately burn the skin slightly to leave it red and irritated.

====Bouncing/Streaking====
The two most common fire play techniques are bouncing and streaking. In bouncing, lit fire wands (sometimes called batons; essentially a small torch) are bounced along the skin. This may or may not involve transfer of burning fuel.

In streaking, fuel is applied directly to the skin (commonly in straight lines, though sometimes in more elaborate patterns), lit, and then extinguished before the skin begins to burn. Frequently the fuel is applied to the skin with unlit fire wands, then ignited with a lit fire wand (sometimes double-headed wands or two wands are used to streamline the procedure).

====Fire cupping====
[[Fire cupping]] is where the air inside a cup (almost always glass) is heated then placed on the skin - the cooling air creates a low-pressure pocket that pulls the skin partially into the cup. Experienced cuppers can create varying strengths of suction by controlling the heat of the cup.

Fire cupping was appropriated from traditional and holistic medicine communities. Cupping was used in Western medicine to encourage blood movement as recently as the [[American Civil War]]. It is still used (often with the same name) by masseurs and in Chinese medicine (where it is said to have predated traditional needle acupuncture) as well as in traditional Arab medicine. For this reason, cupping sets can be found in some Asian stores. Some merchants will only sell sets to licensed massage therapists.

Methods include:
* Wiping alcohol directly on the skin, igniting it, and then quickly placing the cup over the area (frequently criticized as having a higher risk of burning the skin and greater difficulty creating/controlling suction);
* Holding the cup over an open flame until it is warm and then applying it to cool skin (some people feel this is the safest - though some feel that heating the glass (rather than the air) causes room for additional danger. This is also the hardest method to beginners wishing to create a strong suction);
* Placing small disks with cotton balls soaked in alcohol on them onto the skin. The cotton is then ignited and a cup is placed over the disk. (In theory the leather shield protects the skin, but the method is sometimes criticized as too complicated and more likely to burn the skin when performed inexpertly.)
* Applying fuel directly inside the cup - the cup is then usually put on the skin with the fuel still burning (the flame will quickly extinguish from want of oxygen).

Fire cupping typically leaves small, round marks on the body that may last for hours or for days. If a single area is cupped again and again, a deep bruise may form and not disappear for some time.

Fire cupping is often combined with blood play, and is then usually termed blood- or wet-cupping. (This variant also comes from traditional medicine). The skin is pierced (commonly with needles or scalpels) before the cups are applied; the suction then draws blood out of the wound.

===Ice play===
Ice play is a form of temperature play that usually involves running pieces of [[ice]] across a person's naked skin. In popular culture this form of cold temperature play is frequently shown as [[foreplay]] to suggest sex with a flair of kink/interest but which may not be classed as BDSM - see movies such as [[Do the Right Thing]], and [[9½ Weeks]]. In BDSM, it's not uncommon for ice play to be used more elaborately.  Ice is sometimes used as an insertable (for the vagina, anus, and occasionally for the male urethra), but this is risky because ice, as it melts, can form edges sharp enough to cut skin or tender tissues.  Part or all of the body may be immersed in ice or ice water for short periods of time (longer periods of time run the risk of hypothermia and frostbite).  Ice may be used to provide contrast in a scene that also involves warm or hot stimuli.

===Cold and Heat exposure===
Exposure to heat and cold conditions is often employed. These are usually extremes of either of these not usually experienced on an everyday basis.

A common and easily employed type of cold torture is to make subjects stand or lay naked in snow. This can be either freely or tied up. Where a subject is tied it may be in a stretched or splayed out position to expose as much of the body to the extreme condition. A variant of cold exposure is to water down a subject with cold water in cold or windy conditions or employing fans. The risks of cold exposure are hypothermia and frostbite.

Common methods of heat torture are to wrap a subject in plastic wrap, blankets, or leather or pvc bodysuits, usually with their legs together and their arms next to their body. Other methods include physical activity in severe heat or sun exposure. Lesser used methods employ heaters, fire or coals (known as roasting) for direct exposure to extreme heat. Other physical tortures such as electric shock are sometimes applied at the same time to make the subject exert themselves in order to generate more body heat. The main risk of heat exposure is dehydration but under extreme conditions heatstroke can also occur.

With both heat and cold exposure other torture methods are sometimes applied at the same time. General heat and cold exposure may be used as foreplay where during which intercourse occurs or orgasm is induced.

A '''warrant''' is generally an order that serves as a specific type of [[authorization]], that is, a [[writ]] issued by a competent officer, usually a [[judge]] or [[magistrate]], which permits an otherwise illegal act that would violate [[individual rights]] and affords the person executing the writ protection from [[damages]] if the act is performed.

A warrant is usually issued by a [[court]] and is directed to a [[sheriff]], a [[constable]], or a [[police]] officer. Warrants normally issued by a court include [[search warrant]]s, [[arrest warrant]]s, and [[execution warrant]]s.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], senior public appointments are made by warrant under the ''[[royal sign-manual]]'', the personal [[signature]] of the [[British monarchy|monarch]], on the recommendation of the government. In an interesting survival from medieval times, these warrants abate (lose their force) on the death of the sovereign if they have not already been executed. This particularly applied to death warrants in the days when [[England]] authorized [[capital punishment]]. Perhaps the most celebrated example of this occurred on 17 November 1558, when several [[Protestant]] [[heresy|heretics]] were tied to their stakes in [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], and the firewood bundles were about to be lit when a royal messenger rode up to announce that [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] had died and that the warrants had lost their force. The first formal act of Mary's successor, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], was to decline to re-issue the warrants, and the heretics were released a few weeks later.

==United States==
===History===

For many years, the English, later British, government had used a "general warrant" to enforce its laws. These warrants were broad in nature and did not have specifics as to why they were issued or what the arrest was being made for. A general warrant placed almost no limitations on the search or arresting authority of a soldier or sheriff. This concept had become a serious problem when those in power issued general warrants to have their enemies arrested when no wrongdoing had been done. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of [[Great Britain]],&lt;ref name=name&gt;[http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/union.html The Treaty (act) of the Union of Parliament 1706], ''Scots History Online''&lt;/ref&gt; passed the Revenue Act of 1767,&lt;ref&gt; The Revenue Act of 1767 was 7 Geo. III ch. 46; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 270n12. It is also known as the Townshend Revenue Act, the Townshend Duties Act, and the Tariff Act of 1767.&lt;/ref&gt; which reaffirmed the legality of [[writs of assistance]], or general [[search warrant]]s, and gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 29, 135n24.&lt;/ref&gt; This law was one of the key acts of the United Kingdom which led to the [[American Revolution]], and is the direct reason that the [[United States|American]] Founding Fathers ensured that general warrants would be illegal in the United States by ratifying the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution in 1791.

===Practice===
Under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] a warrant is broadly required which particularly describes the place to be searched, and the persons, or things, to be seized; and no warrants shall be issued, but upon probable cause, supported by testimony before a judge.

The courts have recognized many [[Warrantless searches in the United States|exceptions to the warrant requirement]], including exceptions for routine administrative or inventory searches, searches made under exigent circumstances, and searches made with consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Your Fourth Amendment Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/fires/fourth_amendment.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical arrest warrant in the [[United States]] will take the approximate form of: "This Court orders the [[Sheriff]] or Constable to find the named person, wherever he may be found, and deliver said person to the custody of the Court."  Generally, a U.S. arrest warrant must contain the [[caption (law)|caption]] of the court issuing the warrant, the name (if known) of the person to be arrested, the offense charged, the date of issue, the officer(s) to whom the warrant is directed, and the signature of the magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Procedure for the Criminal Justice Professional''; John N. Ferdico, Henry Fradella, Christopher Totten;
Cengage Learning; 2015; [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TB-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=%22an+arrest+warrant+is+a+written+order+directing+the+arrest+of+a+particular+person%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAGoVChMI2Jj94q-6xwIVAiA-Ch0GCw8W#v=onepage&amp;q=%22an%20arrest%20warrant%20is%20a%20written%20order%20directing%20the%20arrest%20of%20a%20particular%20person%22&amp;f=false page 246].&lt;/ref&gt;
Warrants may also be issued by other [[government]] entities, including [[legislature]]s, since most have the [[political power|power]] to compel the attendance of their members.  When a legislature issues a warrant, it is called a [[call of the house]].

The person being investigated, arrested, or having their property seized, pursuant to a warrant is given a copy of the warrant at the time of its execution.

==Types of warrant==
* [[Arrest warrant]], issued by a judge to detain someone
* [[Warrant of committal]], issued by a judge ordering enforcement of a previous order against an uncooperative person or corporation
* [[Warrant of delivery]], civil writ issued by a judge ordering property delivered to a named person
* [[Warrant of execution]], writ issued by a judge allowing law enforcement officers to seize property
* [[Execution warrant]], writ issued by a judge authorizing the death of someone
* [[Warrant of possession]], Australian judge order to terminate a residential real estate tenancy
* [[Possessory warrant]], civil writ issued by a judge ordering property delivered to a named person
* [[Search warrant]], writ issued by a judge allowing law enforcement officers to look inside a property

'''Wirö''' (also called '''Itoto''', '''Wotuja''', '''Jojod''', or various forms of '''[[Maku people (disambiguation)|Maku]]''') is an indigenous language of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]. It is attested only by a list of 38 words collected ca. 1900, but this is enough to show it is closely related to [[Piaroa language|Piaroa]], perhaps even a dialect. Speakers of the two understand each other, but not reliably, and consider them to be distinct languages.

''Maco'' is not a proper name but a label applied by Arawakan speakers for unintelligible languages. In the case of Wirö, the following forms are found in the literature: ''Maco, Mako, Maku, Makú, Sáliba-Maco,'' and ''Maco-Piaroa'', the latter also for the combination of Wirö and Piaroa.

'''WordQ®''' is [[assistive technology]] software developed by Quillsoft Ltd. and Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, represented by goQSoftware and distributed in the United States by ST4Learning and in Canada by Quillsoft Ltd. WordQ's main purpose is helping individuals who struggle with writing. WordQ uses [[word prediction]] to suggest words that the user is typing into documents and emails, helping with spelling. It also uses high-quality Acapela text-to-speech voices to read back text that the user has entered, allowing for proofreading and editing. WordQ is sold alongside a companion product, SpeakQ®, which combines [[speech recognition]] with the features of WordQ to allow users to switch between speaking and typing while writing. The combined program works with [[Windows]]. WordQ also works with [[Mac OS X]].

== Development ==
WordQ was first developed in the late 90’s by a research team led by Dr. Fraser Shein at the [[Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital]] [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. Shein and the hospital established a co-owned company, called Quillsoft Ltd, to commercialize WordQ and support further research at the hospital. WordQ’s development followed previous software products also developed at Holland Bloorview, KeyREP® and WiVox®, which were tools to assist students who had physical writing difficulties. WordQ’s application and functionality was expanded to help those who struggled in writing as a result of learning disabilities and put to use in larger context in [[Ontario]] schools.&lt;ref name="morrison"&gt;{{cite web|author=Morrison, Eric|title=Fraser Shein, President and CEO, Quillsoft Ltd.|url=http://www.nationaltechcenter.org/index.php/2007/05/29/ipro-17fraser-shein/|accessdate=January 16, 2011|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use then widely expanded in schools in Canada and elsewhere around the world after further development, as the team added features and released the SpeakQ add-on. SpeakQ was developed in collaboration with the Education Development Center (Newton, MA) with support from the US Department of Education. Today, WordQ is used by a broad population of students, not just those with learning difficulties, e.g., second-language learners and average students and workers.

== Features ==
WordQ has a small interface window that appears on top of whatever window is being run and functions with any application where the user types. As an assistive technology, this is called transparent accessibility. As the user types in letters, the software attempts to suggest the word being used, based upon the first letters and words previously written by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | first1 = T. | last1 = Nantais | first2 = F. | last2 = Shein | first3 = M. | last3 = Johansson | title = Efficacy of the word prediction algorithm in WordQ | booktitle = Proceedings of the RESNA 2001 Annual Conference | pages = 77–79 | publisher = RESNA Press |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are writing, the user may use the directional keys or the number keys to select the desired word. The user may also have the program read their typed speech aloud to them as they write, allowing for spelling and grammar changes to be caught while writing. The program can be turned on and off by the user as they write, and it works with all commonly used programs. WordQ currently can be used in English, French, Spanish &amp; German.

== SpeakQ ==
A companion program, SpeakQ, adds speech recognition capability to WordQ. SpeakQ uses [[Windows Speech Recognition]] to allow the user to dictate into a microphone and have the text appear in the word processor. The user can switch between typing and speaking at will, and the program will suggest words that are hard to pronounce or spell. The user may also train the software to recognize more of their voice, although no initial training is necessary. Like WordQ, SpeakQ may be used with additional languages. SpeakQ has several unique functions: a simple training interface where training words are spoken aloud; speech feedback of recognized words; speech-enabled word prediction; and no verbal commands to learn. SpeakQ was specifically designed to make it easier for people who struggle with the mechanics of writing to express their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Alphonso | first = Caroline | title = Speak and the computer listens | newspaper = The Globe and Mail | location = Toronto | date = October 24, 2005 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/speak-and-the-computer-listens/article916917/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
WordQ &amp; SpeakQ is used in many schools throughout the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="WordQcust"&gt;{{cite web|author=WordQ|title=Customers|url=http://www.wordq.com/customers_us.html|accessdate=January 16, 2011|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software has been marketed in Canada for several years, but is only beginning to emerge on the US market. In Canada, many schools have adopted it for use throughout their systems. In 2010, [[OSAPAC]], the organization responsible for buying software for schools in Ontario, bought a license to use WordQ in all the schools in the entire province.&lt;ref name="osapac"&gt;{{cite web | title=WordQ | url=http://www.osapac.org/cms/content/word-q |author=OSAPAC| accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software has been primarily used as a tool for struggling writers and those with learning disabilities which hurts their ability to write. Third-party research suggests that WordQ does as well, if not better, than other similar software at helping these struggling writers.&lt;ref name="behrmann"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Evmenova | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Graff | first2 = H.J. | last3 = Jerome | first3 = M.K. | last4 = Behrman | first4 = M.M. | title = Word prediction programs with phonetic spelling support: Performance comparisons and impact on journal writing for students with writing difficulties | journal = Learning Disabilities Resesarch &amp; Practice | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 170–182 | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another independent research study suggests that WordQ's word prediction and text-to-speech capabilities could have a positive impact on the writing skills of elementary school students with specific learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = A.P.M. | last = Barbetta | first2 = M. | last2 = Silio | editor-last = Meddex-Vilas | editor-first = A. | editor2-last = Solano-Martin | editor2-first = A. | editor3-last = Mesa-Gonzalez | editor3-first = J.A.

== Reviews ==
PC Magazine reviewed this software in early 2011, giving it four stars out of five, and calling it "one of the simplest, most useful, and least expensive options" for helping with the mechanical processes of writing. The review found that WordQ was most useful for students and struggling writers, and noted goQ Software's targeted licensing towards the education market, in particular the free home copies that are given to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=William | last=Fenton | title=WordQ v3 | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2375159,00.asp | newspaper=PC Magazine | date=January 28, 2011 | accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
