The book's 100 chapters each cover in a couple of pages one of the 100 things that the author suggests successful people do. A reviewer writes: "the book, subtitled Little Exercises For Successful Living, is easily digestible (perhaps even as a tip a day), with each spread over two pages – the first explaining the concept and the second featuring practical exercises and activities to apply it to your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/the-life/book-review-unlearn-it-all-to-move-ahead |title=Book review: Unlearn it all to move ahead &amp;#124; The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2016-09-06 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adds: "each secret to success is a powerful reminder of the ways you can make your life – and other's – more satisfied, at work, at home and in your relationships, with your health, wealth and in retirement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/successful-leaders-little-secrets-659239.html |title=Successful leaders' little secrets - Business - Arabian- Business -.com |publisher=Arabianbusiness.com |date=2017-01-17 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''10 East 40th Street''' or the '''Mercantile Building''' is a skyscraper located in the [[Murray Hill, Manhattan|Murray Hill]] section of [[New York City]], between [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[Madison Avenue]], taking the width of the block between [[39th Street (Manhattan)|39th]] and [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th street]]s. Designed by [[Ludlow and Peabody]] and built by [[Jesse H. Jones]], it was finished in 1929 and is an example of [[Renaissance Revival architecture]].&lt;ref name =emporis/&gt; When it was built, it was the fourth-tallest tower in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=World's tallest buildings in 1930|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Tallest/CTBUH_Tallest_1930.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226042600/http://www.ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Tallest/CTBUH_Tallest_1930.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was previously known as the Chase Tower, after its first tenant, [[Chase Brass and Copper Company|Chase Brass &amp; Copper]]. Its owner until his death in 1938 was [[Frederick William Vanderbilt]]. 

It is {{Convert|632|ft|m|0}} high, with 48 floors, and contains {{convert|350000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office or mixed-use space.&lt;ref name=emporis&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mercantile Building|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=mercantilebuilding-newyorkcity-ny-usa|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2002, the building's lobby was renovated, restoring the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} ceilings.

Current tenants include the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] consulate.
==Last building on the direct current grid==
On November 14, 2007, the building became the final site to be removed from [[Thomas Edison|Thomas Edison's]] original [[direct current]] grid in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lee | first = Jennifer 8. | authorlink = Jennifer 8. Lee | title = Off Goes the Power Current Started by Thomas Edison | work = New York Times | date = 2007-11-14 | url = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/off-goes-the-power-current-started-by-thomas-edison/ | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was completed in 1929 when 90 percent of the electricity in lower Manhattan was direct current.&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.ieee-pes.org/mayjune-2013/history-8/&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year New York Edison announced plans that it was going to convert the entire system to [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.ieee-pes.org/mayjune-2013/history-8/&lt;/ref&gt; The last 2 [[rotary converter]] substations generating direct current (at West 26th and West 39th Street) were retired in 1977 and the DC conversions were handled by solid-state [[rectifier]] units.  The 2007 event shifted the responsibility for providing the conversion from Con Edison to the building via a local converter.  Many of the buildings built in 1929 and before still use direct current with the local converter -- most notably for elevators. New York City's subway system which uses a [[third rail]] electric system is still direct current (with the MTA providing the local converters from AC to DC.&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.ieee-pes.org/novemberdecember-2013/history-10/&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine included articles about the world of commercial aircraft and air carriers, including new [[low cost airlines]], changes at legacy companies, jetliners such as the [[Airbus A380]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]], trips around the world, historical airlines, adventurous flights, airliner crashes and pictures of airliner liveries.

Featured authors include John Adlard, Sebastian Schmitz, Dave Nichols, Ben Wang, Bill Hough, [[Joel Chusid]], Royal King, Robbie Shaw, and Cody Diamond. Photographers contributed images of airlines, aircraft, personnel, facilities and operations.

The magazine's first editor was John Wegg, who left Airliners to found [[Airways Magazine]] in 1994. Subsequent editors were Bryant Pettit, Nick Veronico, Jon Proctor, David Kaufman and Jay Selman. Starting with the November/December 2007 issue, the editor was Dwayne Darnell. On December 11, 2009, Darnell announced that he was leaving, and that designer/Creative Director Robert Christensen would lead the magazine.

In 2010, Robert Christensen announced plans for a series of online initiatives, releasing e-book formats of the print magazine and establishing a social media presence. The magazine was re-titled "Airliners &amp; Airports. Popular components of past issues such as the Air Photo News section were being returned to the magazine's pages, but around the end of 2012 the magazine abruptly ceased publishing and the website is no longer active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nycaviation.com/forum/threads/43049-Anybody-Know-Whether-Airliners-magazine-is-still-being-Published |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817204336/http://nycaviation.com/forum/threads/43049-Anybody-Know-Whether-Airliners-magazine-is-still-being-Published |archive-date=2016-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[Chemistry &amp; Industry|chemistry industry]] – manufactures products on the basis of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[wood]], [[rubber]], [[fat]]s and other [[organic substance]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie |title = Analiza sytuacji rynkowej dla działalności gospodarczej na obszarze województwa zachodniopomorskiego dla branży chemicznej |location = Gdańsk |date = 2011|page= 11 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|non-organic]] chemistry industry – products manufactured on the basis of non-organic substances, e.g. [[mineral]]s and [[ore]]s.

Chemical industry in terms of tons of production can be divided into:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie |title = Analiza sytuacji rynkowej dla działalności gospodarczej na obszarze województwa zachodniopomorskiego dla branży chemicznej |location = Gdańsk |date = 2011|page= 4 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* small chemistry - production on a smaller scale - dozens of tons; this sector includes mainly chemistry with high added value and more expensive production, e.g. medicaments,cosmetics, [[cleaning agent]]s;
* chemical processing - processing finished half-products: by mixing, packing, thermal treatment and other methods.

Chemical industry is characteristic of the high capital intensity and low labour consumption, for this reason, the most of operations are automated.

The {{nihongo|'''''Derby Stallion'''''|ダービースタリオン}} - also known in Japan by the [[Portmanteau#Japanese|portmanteau abbreviation]] {{nihongo|'''DerbyStal'''|ダビスタ}} - video games are a series of genre-merging [[Racing video game|horse-racing]] and [[business simulation game]]s originally created by [[ASCII Entertainment]], and released by [[Nintendo]]. The series comprises 21 games, spans more than 10 console platforms, and is the best-selling horse racing series of all time with total sales topping more than 4 million in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-JPPlatinum.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The ultimate goal of the player in the ''Derby Stallion'' games is to win the title of GI ([[Group One|Group I]]) Racer. To do this, the player must attempt to develop the greatest stock of horses that he can in order to have the greatest chance at each of the weekday and holiday races that compose the 1-year racing schedule of the fictitious "SRA" (an abbreviation of [[Sonobe, Kyoto|Sonobe]] Racing Association) group. Between races, the player engages in numerous business simulation, farm simulation, and role-playing activities.

''Derby Stallion'' games have evolved as newer members of the series have been added, allowing players greater and greater control over every aspect of the horse-raising business. As such, the player must now [[horse racing|race horses]] and place racing bets, manage the working of a [[stable]]s and/or [[ranch]], select different studs and broodmares for [[Horse breeding|breeding]], learn to [[Horse breaking|break]] and [[Horse training|train]] horses, and set up advantageous [[horse trading|horse trades]] or sales, among other duties. Players must also make critical decisions about appropriate ages to race horses, [[Horse breed|breeds]] to pursue, and the timing of events to coincide with race dates. As the player improves the stock of his horses, his racing statistics, and his position in the world of the horse business, his Group Ranking increases until he reaches the goal of Group I at which point he has won the game. The games also allow the player to continue playing after the top goal has been met.

''Derby Stallion'' games all feature a single-player mode, however much effort has been put into making the games as versatile as possible for multiplayer capabilities. Multiplayer functions allow players to trade or complete sales between themselves, to set up breeders' agreements, and to race against opponents. To accomplish this, various methods have been used to exchange data from the earliest password code exchange to online connectivity with PCs, [[Satellaview]] exchange (via 8MB memory packs and [[Satellaview#Compatible application cartridges|slotted application cartridge]]), and [[Randnet|RANDnetDD]] service.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ign64.ign.com/articles/067/067393p1.html GDC: Miyamoto Unveils Camera Connection]''. IGN. 18 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of data exchange that have been developed include various Game Boy-Link connections&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.videogames.yahoo.com/news-1097130 Derby Stallion Lives]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' IGN. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and telephone satellite connections (for players using DoCoMo phones).

The '''Design Institute of Australia''' ('''DIA''') is an [[Australian]] organisation that represents [[designers]] in Australia.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dia.org.au/index.cfm?id=10 | title=The DIA | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIA acts as a professional body representing all disciplines of design, and undertakes work such as the promotion of ethical standards for the design industry, as well as promoting co-operation between individual designers.&lt;ref name="StrategicPlan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design.org.au/index.cfm?id=12 | title=The DIA Strategic Plan | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The organisation was founded as the Society of Designers for Industry in 1947, and first incorporated as the Industrial Design Institute of Australia on 15 August 1958, with chapters in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. The institute joined the [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design|ICSID]]&lt;ref name="ICSID"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design.org.au/index.cfm?id=78 | title=ICSID | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967. They joined [[International Council of Design]] in 1980 and then, on 20 December 1982, the organisation was again renamed to the Design Institute of Australia, as it is today. On 1 July 1998, the organisation merged with the Society of Interior Designers of Australia, and the Australian Textile Design Association; becoming a National rather than Federal body.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design.org.au/index.cfm?id=204 | title=History of the DIA | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dockmaster''' is a person in charge of a [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] used for [[freight]], [[logistics]], and repair or maintenance of [[ship]]s (a [[shipyard]] or [[drydock]]).  This title is distinct from [[harbourmaster]], which is sometimes a higher rank than dockmaster.  A dockmaster is assisted by a deputy dockmaster and an assistant dockmaster.

For example, in the [[Port of London]] in the [[United Kingdom]], shipping movements in dock complexes, and within a short distance of the [[Locks and weirs on the River Thames|outer lock gates]] (i.e. in the [[Tideway|tidal river]]), are under the jurisdiction of a dockmaster and staff. Each assistant dockmaster has a marine staff of about 70. In all, each dock complex employed about 360 marine staff.  The Port of London consists of all the tidal portion of the [[River Thames]] from [[Margate]] on the south coast, [[Clacton-on-Sea]] on the north, through to [[Teddington]] – a total of around {{convert|95|mi|km}}.  Up until the 1980s the [[Port of London Authority]] (PLA) dockmasters were responsible for five large enclosed dock systems and miles of [[quayside]] isolated from the tides by locks. These systems were [[London Docks|London]] and [[St Katharine Docks]], [[Surrey Commercial Docks]], [[West India Docks|West India]] and [[Millwall Dock|Millwall]] Docks, [[Royal Docks]], and Tilbury Docks. Of these only Tilbury is operational, along with [[DP World]]'s [[London Gateway]].  Eventually Tilbury Docks were privatized and became the [[Port of Tilbury]], with their dockmaster being redesignated as harbourmaster; this led to the PLA harbourmaster being redesignated ''chief harbourmaster''.

'''Edinburgh Park''' is a [[business park]] in [[South Gyle]],  [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].  It is west of the city, near [[Edinburgh Airport]] and the [[Edinburgh City Bypass]]. It was opened in 1995.  The layout of the park was masterplanned by [[United States|American]] architect [[Richard Meier]].  [[Edinburgh Park railway station]], which is on the [[Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line]], opened in December 2003.

[[Edinburgh Trams]] began serving the park on 31 May 2014 with stops at Edinburgh Park Station, Edinburgh Park Central and The Gyle.

It is not to be confused with [[South Gyle|Gyle Park]] nearby, site of the former [[Gogarloch]].

The park has a bar/grill, nursery, and several sculptures, including busts of famous Scottish poets, many of them [[Socialism|socialists]].&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|title=Literary Corstorphine: A reader's guide to West Edinburgh|date=2017|last=Bell|first=Raymond MacKean|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Leamington Books|isbn=9780244644406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10229">An '''electric utility''' is a company in the [[electric power industry]] (often a [[public utility]]) that engages in [[electricity generation]] and [[Electricity retailing|distribution of electricity]] for sale generally in a [[regulated market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric|url=http://snavely-king.com/page/regulated-electric|website=snavely-king.com|publisher=Snavely King Majoros &amp; Associates|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrical utility industry is a major provider of energy in most countries.

Electric utilities include [[Investor-owned utility|investor owned]], [[Public ownership|publicly owned]], [[cooperatives]], and [[nationalized]] entities. They may be engaged in all or only some aspects of the industry. [[Electricity market]]s are also considered electric utilities—these entities buy and sell electricity, acting as brokers, but usually do not own or operate generation, transmission, or distribution facilities. Utilities are regulated by local and national authorities.

Electric utilities are facing increasing demands &lt;ref name=one&gt;By Candace Lombardi, CNET. “[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10458148-54.html Utilities: Green tech good for planet, bad for business].” February 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Electrical grid#aging infrastructure|aging infrastructure]], reliability, and regulation.

==Organization==

===Power transactions===
An electric power system is a group of generation, transmission, distribution, communication, and other facilities that are physically connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity Basics|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/~jcardell/Readings/uGrid/ElecPwrSys%20Operations/EPS_Overview_EIA.pdf|website=science.smith.edu|publisher=Smith College|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flow of electricity within the system is maintained and controlled by dispatch centers which can buy and sell electricity based on system requirements.

===Executive compensation===
{{Globalize|date=February 2016}}

The [[executive compensation]] received by the executives in utility companies often receives the most scrutiny in the review of [[operating expenses]]. Just as regulated utilities and their governing bodies struggle to maintain a balance between keeping consumer costs reasonable and being profitable enough to attract investors, they must also compete with private companies for talented executives and then be able to retain those executives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joskow|first1=Paul|last2=Rose|first2=Nancy|last3=Wolfram|first3=Catherine|title=Political Constraints on Executive Compensation: Evidence From the Electric Utility Industry|journal=RAND Journal of Economics|date=1996|volume=27|issue=1|pages=165–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulated companies are less likely to use incentive-based [[remuneration]] in addition to base salaries. Executives in regulated electric utilities are less likely to be paid for their performance in bonuses or [[stock options]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They are less likely to approve compensation policies that include incentive-based pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The compensation for electric utility executives will be the lowest in regulated utilities that have an unfavorable regulatory environment. These companies have more political constraints than those in a favorable regulatory environment and are less likely to have a positive response to requests for rate increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryan|first1=Stephen|last2=Hwang|first2=Leeseok|title=CEO Compensation In A Regulatory Environment: An Analysis Of The Electric Utility Industry|journal=Journal of Accounting, Auditing &amp; Finance|date=1997|volume=12|issue=3|pages=223–251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as increased constraints from regulation drive compensation down for executives in electric utilities, [[deregulation]] has been shown to increase remuneration. The need to encourage risk-taking behavior in seeking new investment opportunities while keeping costs under control requires deregulated companies to offer performance-based incentives to their executives. It has been found that increased compensation is also more likely to attract executives experienced in working in competitive environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryan|first1=Stephen|last2=Lee-Seok|first2=Hwang|last3=Lilien|first3=Steven|title=CEO Compensation After Deregulation: The Case Of Electric Utilities|journal=Journal of Business|date=2005|volume=78|issue=5|pages=1709–1752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] removed previous barriers to wholesale competition in the electric utility industry. Currently 24 states allow for deregulated electric utilities: Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deregulated States|url=http://www.alliedpowerservices.com/deregulated-states.shtml|website=alliedpowerservices.com|publisher=Allied Power Services|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As electric utility monopolies have been increasingly broken up into deregulated businesses, executive compensation has risen; particularly incentive compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arya|first1=Avinash|last2=Sun|first2=Huey-Lian|title=Impact of Deregulation in CEO Compensation: The Case of Electric Utilities|journal=American Business Review|date=2004|volume=22|issue=1|pages=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oversight'''

Oversight is typically carried out at the national level, however it varies depending on financial support and external influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gala.gre.ac.uk/3754/1/PSIRU_9253_-_2004-09-E-WEC.pdf|title=Electricity liberalisation: The beginning of the end|last=Thomas|first=Steve|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no existence of any influential international energy oversight organization. There does exist a World Energy Council, but its mission is mostly to advise and share new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldenergy.org/about-wec/mission-and-vision/|title=Mission|website=www.worldenergy.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not hold any kind of legislative or executive power. In the western hemisphere, many electric utility companies were under oversight from the United States and although the United States has, in the early 21st century, withdrawn from many of these countries. Several major energy utility companies are still under oversight from the United States.

'''[[Alternative energy]] promotion'''

Alternative energy has become more and more prevalent in recent times and as it is inherently independent of more traditional sources of energy, the market seems to have a very different structure. In the United States, to promote the production and development of alternative energies, there are many subsidies, rewards, and incentives that encourage companies to take up the challenge themselves. There is precedent for such a system working in countries like Nicaragua. In 2005, Nicaragua gave renewable energy companies tax and duty exemptions, which spurred a great deal of private investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24772123.html|title=Nicaragua’s latest revolution: Becoming a green energy powerhouse|newspaper=mcclatchydc|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success in Nicaragua may not be an easily replicated situation however. The movement was known as Energiewende and it is generally considered a failure for many reasons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/renewable-energys-global-growing-pains/|title=Renewable energy’s global growing pains|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary reason was the fact that it was improperly timed and was proposed during a period in which their energy economy was under more competition.

'''Nuclear Energy'''

Nuclear energy may or may not be classified as a green source depending on the country. Although there used to be much more privatization in this energy sector, after the 2011 Fukushima district nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, there has been a move away from nuclear energy itself, especially for privately owned nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/nuclear-state-private-japan/|title=Nuclear power: private vs state|newspaper=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism being that privatization of companies tend to have the companies themselves cutting corners and costs for profits which has proven to be disastrous in the worst-case scenarios. This placed a strain on many other countries as many foreign governments felt pressured to close nuclear power plants in response to public concerns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nuclear energy however still holds a major part in many communities around the world.

== Customer expectations ==
Utilities have found that it isn't simple to meet the unique needs of individual customers, whether residential, corporate, industrial, government, military, or otherwise. Customers in the twenty-first century have new and urgent expectations that demand a transformation of the electric grid. They want a system that increases a utility's capacity to use solar and wind to produce electricity. Customers also want a system that gives them new tools, better data to help manage energy usage, advanced protections against cyberattacks, and a system that minimizes outage times and quickens power restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/source/11146-iei-event-emphasizes-efforts-utilities-serve-diverse-mix-customers/|title=IEI event emphasizes efforts by utilities to serve diverse mix of customers|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-03-08|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Electronics''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[trade journal]] that covered the radio industry and its later spin-offs in the mid-to-late 20th century. Its first issue was dated in April 1930.&lt;ref&gt;"Introducing: The New, Biweekly Electronics", ''Electronics'', May 1992, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  The periodical was published under the title ''Electronics'' until 1984, when it changed temporarily to the new title ''ElectronicsWeek'', but then reverted to the original title ''Electronics'' in 1985.  The ISSN for the corresponding periods are: {{ISSN|0013-5070}} for the 1930–1984 issues, {{ISSN|0748-3252}} for the 1984–1985 issues with title ''ElectronicsWeek'', and {{ISSN|0883-4989}} for the 1985–1995 issues. It was published by [[McGraw-Hill]] until 1988, when it was sold to the Dutch company [[Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen|VNU]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/22/business/sale-by-mcgraw-hill.html Sale By McGraw-Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; VNU sold its American electronics magazines to [[Penton Media|Penton Publishing]] the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/penton-media-inc-history/ Penton Media, Inc. History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally a bimonthly magazine, its frequency and page count varied with the state of the industry, until its end in 1995. More than its principal rival ''[[Electronic News]]'', it balanced its appeal to managerial and technical interests (at the time of its 1992 makeover, it described itself as a magazine for managers). The magazine was best known for publishing the April 19, 1965 article by [[Intel]] co-founder [[Gordon Moore]], in which he outlined what came to be known as [[Moore's Law]].

==Intel's hunt for Moore's original article==
On April 11, 2005, Intel posted a $10,000 reward for an original, pristine copy of the ''Electronics Magazine'' where Moore's article was first published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=technologyNews&amp;storyID=8148789 |work=Reuters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413085535/https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type%3DtechnologyNews%26storyID%3D8148789 |archivedate=April 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hunt was started in part because Moore lost his personal copy after loaning it out. It soon became apparent to librarians that their copies of the article were in danger of being stolen, so many libraries (including [[Duke University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]) located and secured the articles. The [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] was not so lucky, however, as the day after Intel announced the reward, they found that one of the two copies they owned was missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://networks.silicon.com/webwatch/0,39024667,39129574,00.htm silicon.com]'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Intel has stated that they will only purchase library copies of the article from the libraries themselves, and that it would be easy to determine as most libraries [[book binding|bind]] their old magazines, requiring to cut the article from the bound book if a thief were to sell the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsobserver.com/news/ncwire_news/story/2332707p-8710798c.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824034043/http://newsobserver.com/news/ncwire_news/story/2332707p-8710798c.html |archivedate=2005-08-24 |df= }} NC News Wire&lt;/ref&gt; Intel ultimately awarded the prize to David Clark, an engineer living in [[Surrey]], [[England]] who had decades of old issues of ''Electronics Magazine'' stored under his floorboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moore's Law original issue found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4472549.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-22 |accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ethisphere Institute''' is a [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]-based organization that defines and measures corporate ethical standards, recognizes companies that excel, and promotes best practices in [[business ethics|corporate ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethisphere.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Ethisphere Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company publishes ''Ethisphere Magazine'' and announces its World's Most Ethical Companies awards once a year. The company also offers verification services for corporate ethics under such names as "Ethics Inside Certification" and "Compliance Leader Verification". It hosts the Global Ethics Summit every March in [[New York City]] and manages a community of compliance, ethics and legal professionals known as BELA, the Business Ethics Leadership Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiPietro|first1=Ben|title=What Matters More: Focusing on Rules or Creating Ethical Culture?|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2016/03/15/what-matters-more-following-rules-or-creating-ethical-culture/|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History==
The Executive Chairman of Ethisphere, Alex Brigham, created the institute in 2007, as part of Corpedia, a compliance training company. In 2010, Corpedia was sold but Ethisphere's ownership was retained by Brigham. Tim Erblich is Ethisphere's  CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ethisphere.com/who-we-are/leadership/|website=Ethisphere|publisher=Ethisphere |title=Who We Are}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 Slate article, raised the issue of the difficult balance between granting ethics awards while operating as a for-profit business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2010/03/its_all_good.html |title=It's All Good |publisher=slate.com |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Ethisphere's framework for measuring standards is known as the Ethics Quotient (EQ). In 2016, the EQ consists of over 160 questions in 5 major categories. Companies are measured not only absolutely but also in relation to others in their industry. The EQ is updated annually and informed by a Methodology Advisory Panel whose members are publicly listed.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==History==
The company was founded as a joint-venture between [[Reuters]] and [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] in May 1999 under the Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=17964
|title=Dow Jones Interactive, Reuters Business Briefing Merged into Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive  
|accessdate=15 May 2010
|publisher=Information Today, Inc
|date=17 May 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed Factiva six months later.  Timothy M. Andrews, a longtime Dow Jones executive, was founding president and chief executive of the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=17879
|title=Factiva: The New Name for Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive 
|accessdate=15 May 2010
|publisher=Information Today, Inc
|date=8 November 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Andrews was succeeded by Clare Hart in January 2000, another longtime Dow Jones executive, who was serving as Factiva’s vice president and director of global sales.

It developed modules with [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle Corp.]], [[IBM]] and [[Yahoo!]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20051001063212/http://search.yahoo.com/subscriptions]. Factiva has also partnered with EuroSpider, [[Comintelli]], [[PeopleSoft]], MediaMap, Biz360, ChoicePoint, [[BTRadianz]], AtHoc, and Reuters.  Factiva has also been included as of March 2003 in [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft's Office 2003]] program as one of the News research options within the Research Pane.

In 2005, Factiva acquired two private companies: [[London]]-based 2B Reputation Intelligence Ltd. and [[Denver, Colorado]]-based [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] services and software firm, [[Synapse, the Knowledge Link Corporation]]. 2B was a technology and consulting business, specializing in media monitoring and reputation management. Synapse provided taxonomy management software, pre-built taxonomies and taxonomy-building and indexing services.

This acquisition brought with it Synaptica, the taxonomy management software tool developed by Synapse, and Taxonomy Warehouse, a website developed by Synapse. Both Synaptica and Taxonomy Warehouse were developed by Factiva after the acquisition and are now owned by Dow Jones.

A '''fence''', also known as a '''receiver''', '''mover''', or '''moving man''', is an individual who [[mens rea|knowingly]] buys [[stolen goods]] in order to later resell them for profit. The fence acts as a [[wikt:middleman|middleman]] between [[thieves]] and the eventual buyers of stolen goods who may not be aware that the goods are stolen. As a verb, the word describes the behaviour of the thief in the transaction: ''The burglar fenced the stolen radio''. This sense of the term came from [[Thieves' cant|thieves' slang]], first attested c. 1700, from the notion of such transactions providing a ''defence'' against being caught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.word-detective.com/2013/09/fence/ "Fence"] in the Word Detective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fence |title='&amp;#39;Online Etymology Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term remains in common use in all major dialects of modern English, all of which spell it with a "c" even though the source word in some dialects (particularly [[American English]]) is now spelled ''defense.''

The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he/she is able to secretly pay thieves a very low price for "hot" goods that cannot be easily sold on the open markets. The thieves who patronize the fence are willing to accept a low [[profit margin]] in order to reduce their risks by instantly "washing their hands" of the [[black market]] loot and disassociating themselves from the criminal act that procured it. After the sale, the fence recoups their investment by disguising the stolen nature of the goods (via methods such as repackaging and altering/effacing [[serial numbers]]) and reselling the goods as near to the [[white market]] price as possible without drawing suspicion. This process often relies on a legal business (such as a [[pawnshop]], [[flea market]] or [[street vendor]]) in order to "launder" the stolen goods by intermixing them with legally-purchased items of the same type. &lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |last= Wilber |first= Del Quentin |authorlink= Del Quentin Wilber |title= D.C.

==Approach==

[[File:Car window burglary.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Car stereo thieves typically want to sell stolen items quickly. By selling to fences, they avoid the hassle and suspicion of selling directly to the final buyers.]]
The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he is able to pay thieves a very low price for stolen goods. Thieves agree to this because their alternatives may present a greater risk of the thief being caught. As well, selling stolen goods takes a great deal of time and effort ([[transaction costs]]), as the thief would have to try to contact a number of potential buyers and show them the merchandise. Some habitual thieves are so well known to police that if the thief were to attempt to sell any [[used good]]s, this would quickly draw the attention of law enforcement.

The fence then disguises the stolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer to the market price. Depending on the stolen item, the fence may attempt to remove, deface, or replace [[serial number]]s on the stolen item before reselling it. In some cases, fences will transport the stolen items to a different city to sell them, because this lessens the likelihood that the items will be recognized. For some types of stolen goods, fences disassemble the good and sell the individual parts, because the sale of parts is less risky. For example, a stolen car or bicycle [[chop shop|may be disassembled]] so that the parts can be sold individually. Another tactic used by some fences is to retain stolen items for some time before selling them, which lessens the likelihood that the burglary victims or police will be actively looking for the items in auctions and pawnshops.

Fencing is often conducted through legal businesses.&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt; Some fences maintain a legitimate-seeming "front" through which they can sell stolen merchandise. Depending on the type of stolen merchandise a fence deals in, "front" businesses might be discount stores, [[used goods]] stores, a coin and gem store, [[auction house]], [[flea market]], or auto salvage yards. The degree of illicit activity in each "front" business may differ from fence to fence. While one fence's [[Wrecking yard|salvage yard]] may consist mainly of stolen auto parts, another fence's used goods store might consist mainly of legitimately purchased used goods, with the stolen merchandise acting as a minor, but profitable, sideline.

The prices fences pay thieves typically depend both on norms and on legitimate market rates for the items in question.  Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an item's value.  Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an item's value in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items.  At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them about the value of an individual item and the relevant market conditions.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt; For example, a fence may falsely tell a petty thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price.

Research on fences shows that they view themselves as entrepreneurs, relying on networking with and patronage by prominent criminals to become successful in their word-of-mouth-based "wheeling and dealing".  They occupy the middle ground between the criminal world (thieves, burglars and shoplifters) and the legitimate world (e.g., everyday people who purchase used goods).  Some active fences go farther in their business, maintaining longstanding contacts and even teaching thieves how to practice their craft, whether by identifying specific products or by teaching them tools of the trade.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

There are a number of different types of fences. One way of categorizing fences is by the type of good in which they trade, such as jewels, power tools, or electronics. Another way of categorizing fences is by their level of involvement in buying and selling stolen goods; for some, fencing is an occasional "sideline" activity, while it is an economic mainstay for others. At the lowest level, a hustler or drug dealer may occasionally accept stolen goods. At the highest level would be a fence whose main criminal income comes from buying and selling stolen items. At the broadest level, two tiers of fences can be distinguished. The lower level of fences are those who directly buy stolen goods from thieves and burglars. At a higher level are the "master fences", who do not deal with street-level thieves, but only with other fences.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

The degree to which the purchasers of the stolen goods know or suspect that the items are stolen varies. If a purchaser buys a high-quality item for a low price, in cash, from a stranger at a bar or from the back of a van, there is a higher likelihood that the items may be stolen. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys the same high-quality item for the standard retail price from a used goods store, and obtains a proper receipt, the purchaser may reasonably believe that the item is not stolen (even if, in fact, it is a stolen item).

== History of receiving ==

The fence, or receiver, is an old kind of criminal, historically attested in many countries and with deep and complex dynamics within society.
 
=== Early modern England ===

Receiving was a widespread crime in Modern England and an increasingly crucial concern for the English government of that period. It involved many other kinds of activities and crimes, and it saw its peak in the early 18th century with the notorious [[Jonathan Wild]]. Receiving is intrinsically connected to theft, as receivers, by definition, buy previously stolen goods in order to make profit out of them later. When organised theft grew increasingly important in London thanks to largely supportive receivers,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the establishment started to fight it off with new laws, often aimed at receivers: receiving was acknowledged as the very core of property crime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Receiving was not considered as a felony (crime) in common law until 1691, when fences became potential targets of charges as accessories to theft. This meant that in order to judge a suspected receiver, it was necessary to condemn the related thief first. Later laws further focused on receivers, especially the [[Transportation Act 1717|1718 Transportation Act]], which, together with other measures, made fences main felons and not simply accessories to other felonies. Nonetheless, it was not easy to prove that a dealer knowingly accepted stolen goods, especially without the related theft event being fully cleared out.&lt;ref name="B189"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.189-90.&lt;/ref&gt;
Proceedings stored in the [http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/ Old Bailey Online] archive where the offence category is receiving are 5664. Of these, 1973 have a verdict category of guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/stats.jsp?y=&amp;x=&amp;countBy=&amp;render=&amp;_offences_offenceCategory_offenceSubcategory=theft_receiving&amp;_verdicts_verdictCategory_verdictSubcategory=guilty&amp;_punishments_punishmentCategory_punishmentSubcategory=&amp;_defendantNames_defendantGender=&amp;defendantAgeFrom=&amp;defendantAgeTo=&amp;_victimNames_victimGender=&amp;victimAgeFrom=&amp;victimAgeTo=&amp;_divs_fulltext=&amp;kwparse=and&amp;fromMonth=&amp;fromYear=&amp;toMonth=&amp;toYear= Old Bailey Proceedings Online] (www.oldbaileyonline.org, 22 November 2015), Searched Old Bailey Proceedings for all offences where offence category is receiving and verdict category is guilty.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1718 Transportation Act also made a felony of returning goods for a fee, revealing that by then, receiving had already been widely taken to the next stage: returning goods to their owner, for a fee, instead of selling them in the second-hand market. Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a safety layer against effective prosecution. A victim of theft was often willing to pay in order to get his goods back, in order to spare himself further troubles and/or if the items taken had the potential to reveal unflattering details about his personal affairs. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.41-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually proving receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it. This gave a considerable advantage to receivers.
[[File:Ticket to the hanging of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|Ticket to the hanging of [[Jonathan Wild]]. ]]
In order to effectively act as go-betweens for compounding, or brokers, fences needed to personally know thieves or have ways to easily interact and bargain with them for a common benefit about compounding: nobody was in a better position to do so than [[thief-takers]]. Thief-takers grew increasingly notorious in England as a reward was introduced by the Crown for each successfully condemned criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, such as Anthony Dunn, publicly referred to as "pretended Thiefe-taker" in a 1707 document,&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; used their social power as thief-takers as an advantage for receiving. Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Beattie, , J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.159-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business.

Confirmation of how thief-taking and receiving were tightly connected could be seen in the career of [[Charles Hitchen]], who was known as a thief-taker. He bought off the position of Under City Marshal through his wife's money in order to have one of the best positions amongst the thief-takers of the City. However, a vast part of his income actually came from the receiving activity related to the network of connections with London's underworld. Hitchen controlled this network through his official (that is to say, legal) position as a thief-taker.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, pp.253-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synergy between receiving, theft and corruption, as well as official activities such as thief-taking or pawnbroking was a huge dynamic bond where each element enhanced the others in a vicious circle.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The master of this powerful synergy of London underworld was [[Jonathan Wild]], who rapidly replaced his previous master, Charles Hitchen, in 1713, and rapidly gained control of London's crime and the title of "thief-taker general". His power was due to his ruthless thief-taking and intimidation activities as well as a complex web of intelligence also built around the diffusion of newspapers. However, overly bold receiving was his undoing,&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.381.&lt;/ref&gt; as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as "Jonathan Wild Act",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock and Schoemaker. Tales from the Hanging Court. London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the goods returned (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from £40 to £140).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;

==== Women and receiving ====
There is no registered case of female fences of the same fame of Wild or Hitchen. However, women had active roles in both receiving and theft.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, and Walker. Women, Crime and the Courts in Early Modern England. Chapel Hill London: U of North Carolina, 1994, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Hitchen, Hitchen's wife, gave her inheritance money to her husband in order to buy the Under City Marshal office for his plans. Moreover, women could also be active fences. For example, Elizabeth Fisher managed her own receiving business in her husband's alehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, and Walker.

=== Early modern English literature ===

Receiving grew increasingly important in Early Modern society, and combined with the increasing interest of society on reading, it became the source for many writers, such as [[Daniel Defoe]], with [[Moll Flanders]] and [[John Gay]], with [[The Beggar's Opera]]. 
These works reflect how receiving was conceived and portrayed by authors.

==== Moll Flanders ====

''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is a novel intended to narrate the whole life of its protagonist, referred to as Moll Flanders, but a relevant part of it is about her becoming a master thief. Moll's activity as a thief largely relied on the protection and support of her governess, who acted also as a receiver for the goods stolen by her affiliates. She is the one who buys Moll's stolen goods the first time, as Moll narrates "I was now at a loss for a market for my goods,[...] At last I resolved to go to my old governess." Therefore, the governess character sealed Moll's fate as a thief, and eventually taught her the basics of thievery redirecting Moll to work with other senior thieves.&lt;ref name="gut"/&gt; With these events, Defoe shows how crucial as well as subtle receiving was in building the whole of crime activity in London.

The Governess is officially a pawnbroker, and she uses this legal business to recycle stolen goods into the secondary market. Sometimes, such as in the case of a silver inscribed mug stolen by Moll, she smelts metals, in order to avoid getting caught while re-selling. Along with receiving activity, she actively protects and support many criminals and thieves in order to secure a steady income to her activity.

The same governess goes on in protecting and offering refuge to her affiliates whenever possible, or recruiting thieves into small groups, always via middlemen, in order to protect their thieves' identities in case some of them were caught and willing to confess.

She is also a main intelligence source and often a direct instigator to theft such as in a case of fire in a well-off house in the neighbourhood (more vulnerable to theft because of the sudden emergency), and finally becomes a broker for goods stolen by Moll to a drunken gentleman. In that case, the amount gained is allegedly greater than what she would have gained by standard re-selling in the secondary market.&lt;ref name="gut"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/370/370-h/370-h.htm The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders &amp;c. on Project Gutenberg], accessed on November 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governess embodies female social cunning in London's underworld, from Defoe's point of view. She is a typical receiver of her time, and whereas many male receivers used thief-taking as an official business, she relies on pawnbroking.

==Legal aspects==
Fencing is illegal almost everywhere, usually under a similar rationale as in the United States, where [[receipt of stolen property]] is a crime in every state, as well as a [[federal crime]] if the property crossed a state line. Occasionally federal agents will temporarily set up a false fence [[sting operation]].  Fencing is a common source of income for organized crime.  In [[England and Wales]], as in many U.S. states, the crime requires three elements: stolen property, the receiver's act of receiving or hiding it, and his knowledge of its stolen status.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

[[Pawnbroker]]s have often been associated with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While pawnbrokers do not like this characterization of their business, police efforts have indicated that some pawnbrokers are involved in fencing.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Bill.

== E-fencing ==

[[File:US Army 51805 Post, AAFES combat increases in juvenile shoplifting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stores have complained that increasingly, shoplifters are stealing goods with the intent of selling them anonymously online. In this photo, a store loss-prevention officer scans the security cameras for shoplifters.]]
E-fencing is the sale of items on the Internet that have been obtained illegally. It is an activity that criminals often mix with sales to pawnbrokers. The auction website [[eBay]], being easy to reach for the average thief, is a popular location for e-fencing; customers reported more than eight thousand crimes from the website in 2008, many of which involved the sale of stolen property.&lt;ref name="Ebay"&gt;April 11, 2009. EBay: brisk bidding in stolen goods. business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article6074448.ece&lt;/ref&gt;   Classified websites like [[Craigslist]], [[AutoTrader.com]], [[Pennysaver]] online, etc. are some of the Internet sources used for fencing goods online and circumventing the middleman fencer, in addition to a number of illegal [[darknet market]]s.

E-fenced items may be shoplifted or otherwise stolen, alternatively they may be purchased using stolen [[credit card]]s or similar banking information. The latter practice is often intertwined with [[Carding (fraud)|carding]], which is the trafficking of thousands or even millions of stolen credit card numbers. The sale of stolen credit cards, which usually takes place on the darknet markets, is generally considered to be a form of e-fencing in its own right, and often plays a role in supplying the data used to purchase physical goods that may be either e-fenced themselves or fenced through more traditional means.

Crime rings steal and/or use stolen financial information to pay for in-demand items from retailers and then sell them online, relying on the Internet's ability to reach buyers around the world and its anonymity; some theft rings even take pre-orders, confident that they can steal and/or fraudulently pay for whatever is currently in demand.  In the United States, major retailers such as [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] have advocated for federal legislation to combat Internet fencing.  Proposals for such legislation have often proposed requiring major sales websites (e.g. eBay and [[Amazon.com]]) to retain some items' serial numbers and to release information to retailers about major sellers whom the retailers believe to be relying on stolen property.  Such proposals have been opposed by the online retailers who would be required to maintain these records and take these actions.&lt;ref name ="seattletimes"&gt;Spencer, Jim. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2014975231_storetheft06.html?syndication=rss "Target, other stores battle theft rings fencing stolen goods on Web"]. [[Minneapolis]] ''[[Star Tribune]]''.  Accessed June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[eBay]] spokesman has stated, "Perhaps the dumbest place to try to fence stolen materials is on eBay," and news agencies have reported incidents of the police purchasing stolen property directly from thieves, leading to their capture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm Online auctions are the newest place to hawk stolen goods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225090233/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm |date=February 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early 2007, e-fencing had become a $37 billion business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierce |first=Tarik |url= http://www.investortrip.com/how-to-solve-ebays-efencing-problem/ |title=Efencing Theft Problems on eBay |publisher=Investortrip.com |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4977">'''Four Corners Rule''' is the meaning of a written document such as a [[contract]], [[Will (law)|will]], or [[deed]] as represented solely by its textual content. This term may also be applicable to other legal instruments.

==Contract interpretation==
In [[contract]] interpretation, the Four Corners Rule refers to a [[common law]] doctrine dating back to old English courts that requires the court to resolve contractual disputes based on the words contained in the disputed contract.  The four corners doctrine is similar to the [[parole evidence rule|Parole Evidence Rule]], which prohibits a contracting party from introducing evidence separate from the contract that would change fundamentally the intended understanding as written in the contract. However, the Four Corners Doctrine prohibits a party from introducing evidence to interpret an unambiguous term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thelawdictionary.org/four-corners/ Four Corners Rule definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine also requires a court to discern what the contracting parties intended by using the whole document; no cherry picking.  Most commercial contracts contain a clause entitled either "Merger", "Integration", or "Entire Agreement". In this clause, there would usually be language indicating that the parties' understanding of the other provisions of the contract are contained within the four corners of the same.  Many modern contracts have taken it further to state that the entire agreement is contained within the agreement and that the agreement supersedes all prior understandings.  

==Examples==
* "There are no extraneous agreements or other understandings between the parties.  The entire agreement is contained within the four corners of this document and any dispute to the meaning contained therein will be governed by this document."
* "The parties intend that this Agreement, together with all attachments, schedules, exhibits, and other documents that both are referenced in this Agreement and refer to this Agreement, represent the final expression of the parties' intent relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, contain all the terms the parties agreed to relating to the subject matter, and replace all of the parties' previous discussions, understandings, negotiations, representations and agreements relating to the subject matter of this Agreement regardless whether written or oral."
* "This Agreement contains the entire and integrated agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral."

==Case law==
The following is an incomplete list of examples where courts used the Four Corners Doctrine while interpreting the disputed-document:
# ''From the four corners of the document'': as derived from the text of the agreement itself, without relying upon other resources or witnesses.
#* "Absent ambiguity, the parties’ intentions must be discerned ''from the four corners of the document'', and extrinsic evidence may not be considered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/2007-CA-000498.pdf KY Supreme Court 2007-CA-000498]&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "Construction of a deed is a matter of law, and the intention of the parties is to be gathered ''from the four corners of the instrument''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/1995-CA-001813.pdf KY Supreme Court 1995-CA-001813]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Looking at the four corners of the will'': examining and analyzing the will.
#* "It is evident to us, from ''looking at the four corners of the will'', ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/1996-CA-000833.pdf KY Supreme Court 1996-CA-000833]&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Determining whether to suppress evidence recovered and whether it was covered in the warrant.
#* "This Court has interpreted the above constitutional and statutory provisions of this State to mean just what they clearly state, and by doing so has characterized its interpretation by calling it the "four corners" rule or doctrine of law."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/1986/1064-84-4.html ''Adkins v. State'', 717 S.W.2d 363 (1986) Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "We granted defendant's application for certiorari, 600 So. 2d 617 (La.1992), primarily to consider the rulings of the lower courts in the light of the "four corners" doctrine pronounced by this court in ''State v.

# Deed interpretation.
#* "This case involves construction of a deed through which a mineral interest was conveyed. The language within the deed's "four corners" was construed by the chancery court as unambiguous, and this Court affirms."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/mississippi/supreme-court/1990/07-ca-58744-1.html ''Pursue Energy Corp. v.

The '''Fremont Street Experience''' (FSE) is a [[pedestrian mall]] and attraction in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  The FSE occupies the westernmost five blocks of [[Fremont Street]], including the area known for years as "'''''Glitter Gulch'''''," and portions of some other adjacent streets.

The central attraction is a [[barrel vault]] [[canopy (building)|canopy]], {{convert|90|ft|abbr=on}} high at the peak and four blocks, or approximately {{convert|1500|ft|abbr=on}}, in length.

While Las Vegas is known for never turning the outside casino lights off, each show begins by turning off the lights on all of the buildings, including the casinos, under the canopy.  Before each show, one bidirectional street that crosses the Experience is blocked off for safety reasons.

Concerts, usually free, are also held on three stages.  The venue has become a major tourist attraction for downtown Las Vegas, and is also the location of the SlotZilla zip line attraction and the city's annual [[New Year's Eve]] party, complete with fireworks on the display screen.

==History==

[[Binion's Horseshoe|The Horseshoe]] was the first casino to install carpeting, while the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]] was the first structure designed from the ground up to be a casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegasexperience.com/about3.cfm |title=Facts About the Fremont Street Experience |accessdate=2007-07-05 |format= |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703102905/http://www.vegasexperience.com/about3.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the western end of Fremont Street was the area most commonly portrayed whenever producers wanted to display the lights of Las Vegas.  The large number of [[neon]] signs earned the area the nickname "'''''Glitter Gulch'''''."

By 1992, 80 percent of the Las Vegas casino market was on [[Las Vegas Strip|the Strip]]. Downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos sought to build an attraction that would lure more visitors to their businesses. After [[Paramount Pictures]] head [[Stanley Jaffe]] refused to approve a proposal to build a life-sized [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|Starship ''Enterprise'']], the Fremont Street Experience was chosen as the project.&lt;ref name="garygoddard20120405"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegoddardgroup.com/blog/index.php/now-it-can-be-told-the-star-trek-attraction-that-almost-came-to-life-in-1992/ | title=NOW IT CAN BE TOLD: THE "STAR TREK" ATTRACTION THAT ALMOST CAME TO LIFE in 1992. | publisher=The Goddard Group | work=The Goddard Group Blog | date=2012-04-05 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSE, LLC is a cooperative venture, owned and operated by a [[#FSE casino/hotel companies|group of downtown hotel/casino companies]] (comprising eight hotel/casinos) as a separate corporation, responsible for financing, developing, and managing the Fremont Street Experience.

It was the second Las Vegas project of architect [[Jon Jerde]], whose firm was paid approximately $900,000 by the City of Las Vegas to create a show concept for the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;City of Las Vegas Public Records 1991-92&lt;/ref&gt; Jerde's design included a floating sky parade which was to be suspended from the canopy. The concept was accepted by the Fremont Street Experience as well as the City of Las Vegas. Ultimately Jon Jerde's sky parade concept was scrapped, but the architectural design for the canopy was carried through. &lt;ref name=PR94&gt;City of Las Vegas Public Records 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The local architect of record, Mary Kozlowski Architect Inc., cited the following as problems with Jon Jerde's sky parade concept:

# Perspective: The view of the parade from below made the concept unworkable &amp;mdash; to properly view the project would require that visitors stand at a raised elevation such as a third or fourth floor vantage point.
# Wind: The addition of the canopy over Fremont Street would create a wind tunnel causing a dangerous condition for people on the floats who would be trapped.  Also the potential for harmonic motion as the floats swung back and forth in the wind potentially resulting in massive structural failure of the canopy and fatalities.
# Sand: The combination of desert sand and the mechanical systems of the sky parade would make the attraction difficult to maintain.

A new concept for the show was necessary quickly as funds were already available and the overall schedule was set. The concept for the show as it now exists was conceived by architect Mary Kozlowski who had grown up in Las Vegas and knew and loved Fremont Street. It was a light show on the underside of the canopy &amp;mdash; the world's largest and most spectacular. Peter Smith, executive vice-president of Atlandia Design, recognized the beauty and practicality of the concept. Jon Jerde, FSE and the City of Las Vegas embraced the show concept.&lt;ref name=PR94&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kozlowski's concept was to use a combination of four colored light bulbs per "light" which allowed a full spectrum of colors. The [[Young Electric Sign Company]] assisted in creating the test panels and in the final installation. After the Fremont Street Experience opened, the light bulbs were checked nightly to ensure that all were functioning properly. To accomplish this massive undertaking, the length of the canopy was divided into panels. Each panel was checked by separately turning on each of the four colored light bulbs. A maintenance worker on a lift would then replace any bulbs that were out. The most expensive bulb cost nearly $15 to replace.

On September 7, 1994, a five-block section of Fremont Street was closed to automobile traffic for good, and [[groundbreaking]] was held on September 16. After that, the digging up of the street and the installation of the support poles continued into December. On February 15, 1995, the space frames were brought in and the roof began to take shape. The last piece was installed in July 1995.
[[Image:Fremont Street Experience canopy of lights.jpg|right|thumb|Fremont Street light canopy during the day]]
The official public preview was held in conjunction with the [[Nevada Symphony]]. The light show was opened on December 14, 1995. The first New Year's party was held on December 31, 1995.

The Neon Museum at the Fremont Street Experience opened in November 1996 with the ''[[Hacienda (resort)|Hacienda Horse &amp; Rider]]'' sign being lit at the intersection of [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] and Fremont Street. The museum features [[Signage|sign]]s from old casinos and other businesses displayed outdoors. For many years, the [[Young Electric Sign Company]] stored many of these signs in their bone yard. The signs were slowly being destroyed by exposure to the elements. The museum is slowly restoring the signs and placing them around the FSE.

Permanent stages were added in the early 2000s, eliminating the need to bring in temporary stages for every event. The sound system was upgraded in June 2001.

On June 14, 2004, a $17 million upgrade was unveiled that would feature a 12.5-million [[LED]] display and more color combinations than the original display, which was composed of [[incandescent light]]ing.

The initial $70 million investment and the continued improvements have resulted in successful and ongoing downtown redevelopment. The City of Las Vegas and the downtown casinos have benefited as more than 60% of visitors to Downtown are lured by the Fremont Street Experience overhead light show and stage shows and stay to enjoy the attractions of some of the most famous casinos in the world.

==Major features==

=== Viva Vision ===
The LED display "canopy," runs along the Fremont Street Experience promenade from Main Street to Fourth Street. Holding the canopy aloft are 16 columns, each weighing 26,000 pounds and can hold up 400,000 pounds, and 43,000 struts.

A section comprising one fiftieth of the total canopy equals the size of the world’s current largest electric sign. Originally, nearly 2.1 million incandescent lights were housed in the canopy. With the completion of the $17 million upgrade, more than 12 million [[LED]] lamps illuminate the overhead canopy. The new LED upgrade was designed and engineered by LG Electronics, who is also the primary corporate sponsor of the canopy. Within the canopy itself are 220 speakers powered by 550,000 [[watt]]s of amplification.

Light and sound shows are presented nightly beginning at dusk on the Viva Vision video screen.

=== SlotZilla Zip Line ===
SlotZilla at Fremont Street Experience is a 12-story, slot machine-inspired zip line attraction. SlotZilla offers "flyers" two levels of lines, the lower "Zipline" (77 feet up) and upper "Zoomline" (114 feet up). The lower lines travel halfway down the Fremont Street Experience pedestrian mall. The upper lines go the entire length of the mall (1,750 feet). Guests on the upper "Zoomline" travel prone, or "superhero-style." SlotZilla cost $17 million to construct and features a launch tower with over-sized dice, a martini glass, a pink flamingo, simulated video reels, a giant arm and two 37-foot-tall showgirls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SlotZilla Zipline Las Vegas Gets Lit at the Fremont Street Experience {{!}} Vital Vegas Blog|url=https://vitalvegas.com/slotzilla-zipline-las-vegas-gets-lit-fremont-street-experience/|website=Vital Vegas Blog|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the towers also bears a [[Welcome_to_Fabulous_Las_Vegas_sign#Replica_signs|"Welcome to Fabulous Downtown Las Vegas" sign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slotzilla - 10 Coolest Things You Didn't Know You Could Do In Las Vegas - Forbes|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409021404/https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkj45jlfl/slotzilla/|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pedestrian Mall ===
Created when Fremont Street was closed permanently to vehicular traffic in September 1994. When the light and sound shows are not being presented, music is played throughout the mall. Nightly free entertainment is also provided, on three stages throughout the mall.

=== The Parking Plaza ===
The parking plaza is located at the eastern end of Fremont Street, owned and operated by Fremont Street Experience. The parking structure has roughly 1,430 spaces.

=== Neonopolis ===
[[Neonopolis]] is a shopping complex which operates independently from Fremont Street Experience. It is located at the end of the FSE pedestrian mall, where Las Vegas Boulevard South meets Fremont Street.

==Technical details==
[[Image:Fremont Street 03.JPG|thumb|left|Fremont Street by night]]
The initial display contained about 2.1 million [[lightbulb]]s controlled by 32 computers located in [[kiosk]]s on the mall. The sound system, using speakers suspended over the mall, was rated at 350,000 [[watt]]s.

Displaying images that looked "real" took some innovation. New techniques were developed to make these curved, low-resolution images viewable from the ground. One adjustment was to move images slowly across the display to prevent blurring.

The 2001 upgrade to the sound system raised the power to 555,000 watts.

The 2004 upgrade features a 12.5-million [[LED]] display and more color combinations than the original display. The old control system was replaced by a central control room using 10 computers.

'''Hari Kostov''' ({{lang-mk|Хари Костов}}) (born November 13, 1959 in s.Pishica [[Probištip Municipality|Probištip]]) was the [[Prime Minister of Macedonia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3986189.stm|title=Greek press slams US-Macedonia ties|date=5 November 2004|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from May 2004 to November 2004. He was appointed to the position of Prime Minister by the parliament on May 31, 2004, two weeks after being nominated by President [[Branko Crvenkovski]]. Kostov was an economic advisor to the Macedonian government and the [[World Bank]] during the 1980s and 1990s. He was the interior minister in the previous government, which was led by Crvenkovski and lasted from 2002 until 2004, and ended when Crvenkovski was elected president. Kostov retained most officials from the Crvenkovski government.

Kostov announced his resignation on November 15, 2004, following disputes within the coalition government, particularly between ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian ministers. He left office on November 18, 2004, when his resignation was accepted, and was succeeded by the defence minister, [[Vlado Bučkovski]].

Currently, he is chief executive&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.com.mk/Default.aspx?sel=1220&amp;lang=2&amp;uc=1 Board of directors] Retrieved 21.01.2017&lt;/ref&gt; of the Komercijalna Bank Skopje (Комерцијална Банка Скопје), a position which he also had before entering the Macedonian government.

'''Intermediate goods''' or '''producer goods''' or '''semi-finished products''' are goods which are under process[[Good (economics)|goods]], such as partly finished goods, used as inputs in the production of other goods including [[final good]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the production process, intermediate goods either become part of the final product, or are changed beyond recognition in the process.&lt;ref name="Hardy1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Colburn Hardy|title=The Investor's Guide to Technical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WvXQIwHC48C&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=14 August 2017|date=1 January 1978|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-026365-9|pages=439–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means Intermediate goods are sold among industries for resale. 


Intermediate goods are not counted in a country's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], as that would mean [[double counting (accounting)|double counting]], as the final product only should be counted, and the value of the intermediate good is included in the value of the final good.&lt;ref name="Tucker2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irvin Tucker|title=Survey of Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY0nphIDDugC&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=14 August 2017|date=25 February 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-324-57961-6|pages=219–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If intermediate goods are included in GDP, these goods will be counted in the calculation of GDP, which leads to the imprecise result. Therefore, the value-added method can be used to calculate intermediate goods in GDP. This approach counts every phase of processing included in production of final goods.

Characterization of intermediate goods as physical goods can be misleading, since, in advanced economies, about half of the value of intermediate inputs consist of [[Service (economics)|services]].&lt;ref name="Ghosh2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandana Ghosh|title=Macroeconomics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mvKKTq-OekC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=14 August 2017|year=2011|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-4306-1|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermediate goods generally can be used in three different ways. The first way, a company makes and uses its own intermediate goods. The second way, a company manufactures internediate goods and sell them to others. The last way, a company buys intermediate goods to produce either secondary intermediate goods or final goods.

* An interesting example is the use of [[chlorine]] in the production of [[polyurethane]], which contains no chlorine. Rock salt is electrolyzed to produce chlorine, which is reacted with [[carbon monoxide]] to give [[phosgene]]. Phosgene, a chlorine compound, and a [[diamine]] are then reacted to produce a [[diisocyanate]] and hydrochloric acid that is neutralized ''in situ''. The chlorine is removed as chloride salt waste. The diisocyanate reacts with a diol to produce polyurethane, which contains no chlorine. Chlorine is used because chlorine is electronegative enough to produce an [[isocyanate]], but does not become a part of the product; it lowers the [[atom economy]].

[[File:Jogging Along - geograph.org.uk - 1475387.jpg|right|350px|thumb|The Clyde Walkway on Broomielaw in the IFSD]]

The '''International Financial Services District''' (IFSD) is a ten-year [[Public-private partnership|public-private]] project in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Based at [[Scottish Enterprise]], the [[Pound sterling|£]]1 billion venture aims to create an attractive [[inward investment]] location for leading international financial services companies and a re-location option for existing Glasgow-based companies, seeking to expand their operations.

==History==
Prior to the launch of the IFSD in 2001, the long-term decline of the old Port of Glasgow and its associated wharves and warehousing had resulted in a neglected infrastructure in Glasgow’s city centre area fronting the [[River Clyde]], otherwise known as the Broomielaw.  The result was a small number of isolated modern offices, standing adjacent to derelict land and vacant dilapidated buildings, loosely connected to Glasgow's traditional core business district centred on [[Blythswood Square]] at the western end of the city centre.

Planning led by [[Scottish Enterprise]] and [[Glasgow City Council]], aimed to create a new, dynamic focus for the area’s regeneration, through the establishment of the IFSD.  This was an important development of Glasgow’s financial services sector, which, with 28,000 employees, was recognised as vital to the city’s economic fortunes. In order to develop a fully serviced financial services district and exploit its long term potential, significant investment was required to create the right environment.

==Definition==

No official boundary of the IFSD exists; notionally the term refers to the approximately 1 square [[kilometer]] area of the city centre bounded by the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]] to the west, the [[River Clyde]] the south, Hope Street to the east, and [[Sauchiehall Street]] to the north - taking in most of [[Blythswood Hill]], the south eastern fringe of [[Anderston]] and part of [[Charing Cross, Glasgow|Charing Cross]].  This has given rise to the area's nicknames in the popular press the ''Square Kilometre'' (in reference to the "square mile" of the [[City of London]]), and more the popular and widely used ''Wall Street On Clyde''.

==Economic Impact==

Since the start of the project, over 15,000 jobs have been created in the area, with several of the world's leading financial companies having a presence in the district.

A constant stream of new buildings has appeared in the IFSD since 2001, with more in the pipeline.  The Aurora building in the IFSD for example has won several UK wide awards as large scale speculative office building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="778">'''Manager without portfolio''' is a manager in title only, that is, one who manages a ''function'', but does not manage a ''staff''.

The term often applies to those holding managerial titles in small companies.  ''E.g.,'' the [[marketing manager]] or [[human resources]] manager in a small enterprise may be wholly responsible for the marketing or human resources functions respectively, but may not in fact manage any staff.  It may also be applied to one granted a title for purposes of prestige, or for a [[wikt:lame duck|lame duck]] or "short-timer" (one whose tenure is scheduled to end soon, and whose authority is consequently in transition to someone else).

Derived by analogy from the British term [[Minister without Portfolio]].

According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], on May 8, 2006, Chimirri attacked reporter Octavio Carvajal, an action Carvajal attributed to embarrassing questions and criticism he had made about Chimirri. Chimirri reportedly grabbed Carvajal by the throat and said "I am not intimidating you because I am not someone who makes threats - I act and I execute... the president’s office is irritated by all the questions you have been asking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/Radio-journalist-flees-to-US-after.html |title=Radio journalist flees to US after being threatened by state phone company official |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=2006-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marketing Research Association''' ('''MRA''') was a [[501(c)(6)]] [[non-profit]], membership trade association, incorporated in New York state. Members were companies that specialized in, or had departments that specialized in, [[market research]], consumer opinion and related marketing intelligence. Individuals who were marketing research practitioners could also become members. 

Located in [[Washington D.C.]] the Marketing Research Association was founded in 1957.  The MRA's chief product was membership. It was also active in advocating industry positions on legislative and regulatory issues. In January, 2017, the Marketing Research Association merged with [[Council of American Survey Research Organizations|CASRO]] to form the Insights Association.

==Membership==
Membership principally included access to a common [[code of conduct]] and set of [[best practices]]; industry-related news briefs and publications, including its trade-oriented magazine, Alert; invitation to MRA's annual conference and to meetings of its regional chapters; access to market research videos, online training seminars, papers and directories; access to professional certification; legislative updates; governmental advocacy; and access to an online jobs board. Annual membership dues are dependent on the applicant's company size and relationship to the marketing research industry. Some membership-only products are sold separately (i.e., not included in the annual membership fee). The organization said it has approximately 3,000 members.

==Conferences==
MRA held three annual conferences, the Corporate Researchers Conference CRC St. Louis, The Insights &amp; Strategies Conference ISC San Diego and The CEO Summit Napa Valley.

==Governmental Affairs==
MRA's Governmental Affairs section monitored statutory and legislative issues that affected market researchers, such as consumer [[information privacy|data privacy]] legislation and court rulings in each of the 50 United States and in other countries, including [[social media]] legislation, legal issues pertaining to [[consumer privacy]] for medical care and prescriptions (such as [[HIPAA]]-related rulings), [[anti-spam]] legislation, telephone surveys, political polling, and similar issues. On topics such as the [[Telephone Consumer Protection Act]] (TCPA) of 1991, the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s (FTC) and [[Department of Commerce]]'s support of rules restricting access to consumer data, and various Congressional consumer privacy acts, the MRA publicly advocated (i.e., lobbies legislators and other governmental officials to adopt) positions that support the organization's goals. Opposition to these positions generally cames from [[consumer rights]] organizations and their lobbyists.

'''Max Ilgner''' (born 28 June 1899 in [[Biebesheim am Rhein]] – died 28 March 1966 in [[Schwetzingen]]) was a [[Germany|German]] industrialist. He was a member of the board of [[IG Farben]] and held the title ''Wehrwirtschaftsführer'' or war economy leader under the [[Nazi regime]]. After the war, he was convicted by the Allies of "spoilation and plunder", but released almost immediately, and continued his career as a political lobbyist and business executive, becoming chairman of a Swiss chemical company.

==Early life==
Ilgner came from an established military family, with his father and grandfather both officers, and followed in their footsteps by entering cadet school. He briefly served as a junior officer on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] at the very end of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Jeff154"&gt;Jeffreys, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined the [[Freikorps]] for a spell before being discharged from the new [[Reichswehr]] after its numbers were substantially reduced by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt;

The demobbed Ilgner took a doctorate in political science at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], having also studied [[metallurgy]] and [[chemistry]] at the Technical College of Charlottenburg.&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/max_ilgner_18991966 Wollheim Memorial Max Ilgner (1899–1966)]&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly worked in [[Stockholm]] following completion of his studies and whilst there he met Erna Hällström. The two were later married and had three children.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

==Rise in IG Farben==
Despite his extensive qualifications Ilgner found work hard to get in depressed post-war Germany, and so he called on his uncle [[Hermann Schmitz (industrialist)|Hermann Schmitz]], the financial chief at [[BASF]], who secured for Ilgner a position as a salesman at the chemical company.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt; In 1926, having worked for BASF for two years, Ilgner was given a new role working with Schmitz at a newly established central finance unit for IG Farben on [[Berlin]]'s [[Unter den Linden]]. Although little more than a messenger boy Ilgner built up a strong network of contacts and, with his uncle's support, advanced through the ranks at the company.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt;

By 1934 Ilgner had been appointed as a deputy member of the ''[[Vorstand]]'' of IG Farben and had a remit that gave him some control over not only financial and public relations decisions but also the company's dealings with central government.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt; He led two important subsections of the central finance unit, namely the Department of Economic Research (known as ''Vowi'') which was established in 1929 and dealt with overseas investment opportunities and the Department of Economic Policy (''Wipo'') which was set up in 1932, under [[Heinrich Gattineau]] and then Ilgner, to keep an eye on legal, foreign policy and taxation issues that might impact on the relationship between the company and the government.&lt;ref name="Jeff154"/&gt;

Ilgner's rapid rise, his naked ambition and the feeling that he was being pushed only because of his family connections made him unpopular with many of his fellow executives but Schmitz held too much power in the company for such objections to be raised publicly.&lt;ref name="Jeff155"&gt;Jeffreys, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working with the Nazis==
Ilgner was offered membership of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 but refused on the grounds that he wished to retain his membership of [[Rotary International]], an organisation that [[Joseph Goebbels]] had declared incompatible with [[Nazism]]. Nevertheless, Ilgner was happy to work closely with the fledgling Nazi regime and encouraged public support for Nazism by the company's factory workers.&lt;ref name="Jeff155"/&gt; He also worked with Goebbels in an attempt to get the Minister of Propaganda to tone down some of his rhetoric, which Ilgner believed was damaging Germany's reputation internationally, an initiative which initially enjoyed some success until Goebells became angry at Ilgner telling him what to do and broke off communication.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; Undeterred Ilgner hired the services of the [[United States|American]] public relations expert [[Ivy Lee]] to improve the reputation of [[Adolf Hitler]] on the world stage. After Lee's initial suggestion, the dropping of [[anti-Semitism]], was rejected out of turn by Hitler, they agreed on a programme of presenting Germany as a welcoming, historical destination to American investors whilst also plotting a policy of arranging for pro-Hitler articles to be added to American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Ilgner's work was criticised by other ''Vorstand'' members, who felt that he was undertaking too much government propaganda and not enough work for IG Farben, but his initiatives won Hitler's approval and increasingly IG Farben's overseas offices also became centres of Nazi Party propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In return Ilgner was able to boost IG Farben's contracts with the government, notably their fading [[Leuna]] arm which was rejuvenated considerably when Ilgner was able to use contacts in the Reichswehr's Weapons Office to secure for this branch of the company the contract to produce fuel for the [[Luftwaffe]], which was being covertly built up in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles but which would have been discovered had they been forced to import large quantities of aircraft fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 161-162&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ilgner's much later claims his influence amongst the Nazi hierarchy even saved the life of Gattineau on [[Night of the Long Knives]] after his fellow executive had been arrested due to his membership of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' and his friendship with [[Ernst Röhm]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Ilgner would finally join the Nazi Party in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Weiß (ed.): ''Biographisches Lexikon zum Dritten Reich''. Fischer-Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1998, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ilgner's direction IG Farben would also play a role in the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] and the dismemberment of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Along with fellow executive [[Georg von Schnitzler]] Ilgner developed a scheme whereby IG Farben would fund pro-German newspapers in Czechoslovakia. The large scale publication of propaganda stories that accompanied the negotiations between Hitler and [[Neville Chamberlain]] helped to whip up strong support for the Nazis amongst the country's German community and the company continued to pour money into Sudeten German Relief Fund and the [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]]. When the fate of the country was sealed and the Nazis took over IG Farben were rewarded for their part in events by being allowed to take control of Aussiger Verein, a [[Prague]]-based chemical company that was the fourth largest in Europe, at a low price.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 205-207&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Immediately after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Ilgner handed over the company's extensive collection of geological maps to the government, informing them of the locations across Europe where chemicals might be extracted.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; As head of ''Vowi'' he had also built up extensive knowledge of IG Farben's main overseas competitors and he was able to supply the government with full details of the operations of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]], a British chemical company that Ilgner had one eye on in the event of [[Operation Sea Lion]] being launched.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war dragged on a Nazi defeat began to look inevitable Ilgner took steps to safeguard his own future. After a bomb struck the Unter den Linten offices in January 1945 Ilgner announced that he could not work under such conditions and, taking all sensitive documented material with him, relocated his office to [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In fact Ilgner was simply trying to avoid falling into the hands of the [[Soviet Union]] and so moved westwards and whilst in Frankfurt ensured the disappearance of the incriminating documents he had taken with him.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
Ilgner was one of 24 executives of the company indicted for "spoilation and plunder" by the Americans on 4 May 1947 in what became known as the [[IG Farben Trial]]. Ilgner in particular was singled out for the leading role he played in German rearmament&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; and at the trial it was noted that he was the only executive who continued to fraternise openly with [[Carl Krauch]] who was bearing the bulk of the guilt due to his close relationship to [[Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Ilgner was one of nine defendants found guilty of "spoilation and plunder" in 1948, which was defined as the taking of property without the owner's full and non-coerced consent and was sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 337-338&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was released already in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/max_ilgner_18991966#cite_a Wollheim Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilgner announced his conversion to [[Christianity]] in prison and vowed to follow a missionary path following his release.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; For a time he followed this path, undertaking work on behalf of the [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945'', Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prove to be long-lived however and instead he became a professional political lobbyist.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he was appointed the chairman of the board at a chemical company in [[Zug]].&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

'''Michael Tositsas''' is one of the Great Benefactors of Greece. He was born in [[Metsovo]] in 1787, and in 1806 he took over his father’s fur shop in [[Thessaloniki]], together with his brothers. After developing his business significantly, he sent his brothers to Egypt to open a branch there while he opened branches in [[Livorno]] and [[Malta]].

In 1820 he moved to Malta himself. His acquaintance with Egypt’s [[Mohammed Ali Tewfik|Prince Regent Mohammed Ali]] resulted in the Prince taking high esteem in him and appointing him his personal advisor as well as at the helm of the first state bank, the head of the Nile Riverboat company and administrator of his land.

Tositsas, who became one of Egypt’s most powerful landowners, also served as Greece’s first General Consul in [[Alexandria]] and is generally regarded as the father of [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenism]] of Egypt. He contributed to the establishment of the Greek Community and, together with his brothers, he helped the community develop significant educational and religious infrastructure. In 1854 he moved to Athens where he died in 1856. His charitable work was not limited to Alexandria but was equally important in Athens, Thessaloniki and his birthplace Metsovo. In his will he left vast amounts for aid for the poor and the support of hospitals, churches and schools. Among them the most notable ones are his contributions to the [[University of Athens]], the Arsakio School and the [[National Technical University of Athens]]. After his death, his wife Eleni continued his charity work by donating large amounts to educational and charity organizations as well as for the construction and completion of the National Technical University of Athens. His younger brother, Theodore, who also became very wealthy in Egypt, returned to Greece after the liberation from the Ottomans and donated the largest part of his wealth to foundations.

[[File:Mick Beddoes 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Mick Beddoes]]
'''Mick Malcolm Millis Beddoes''', widely known as '''Mick Beddoes''', is a Fijian politician and businessman from [[Nadi]], who led the [[United Peoples Party (Fiji)|United Peoples Party]] (formerly the '''United General Party''') from 2000 to 2013, and was the [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Leader of the Opposition]] at the time of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] of 5 December 2006.  He was also the Chief Executive of the [[World Netball Company]], and was Chairman of the organising committee for the 2007 [[World Netball Championships]], but announced his resignation on 24 January 2006, citing a possible conflict of interest, as his company would be working as a ground operator during the championships.

== First term as Leader of the Opposition ==

Beddoes won the [[West Central (General Electors Communal Constituency, Fiji)|West Central]] [[General electors|General Electors]] [[Communal constituencies|Communal constituency]], one of three reserved for ethnic minorities, for the United General Party in the 2001 [[Fijian general election, 2001|parliamentary election]].  Despite being the sole [[House of Representatives of Fiji|parliamentary]] representative of his [[List of political parties in Fiji|party]], he served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2002 to 2004, because [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], leader of the [[Fiji Labour Party]] (the main opposition party) refused the position, demanding inclusion in the [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] instead.  Beddoes relinquished the role of Opposition Leader late in 2004, when Chaudhry finally gave up his quest for a Cabinet role and agreed to assume the leadership of the Opposition.

Beddoes's first stint as Opposition Leader gave him and his tiny party a national platform.  In mid-2003, Beddoes responded to rising interest among [[Fijians|indigenous]] and [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-]] Fijians by announcing that membership of his party, which had been confined to [[General electors|minority groups]] like Europeans, Chinese, and [[Banaba Island|Banaban Islanders]], would now be open to all races, and that the party would contest all 71 seats in the House of Representatives in the next [[Fijian general election, 2006|parliamentary election]], scheduled for 2006.

Beddoes criticised the ethnic faultlines that characterise Fijian politics; communal voting was a factor in this, he said on 28 August 2005, but could be mitigated if only voters would judge a candidate according to his or her personal merits, rather than on the basis of whether the candidate's political party was [[Fijians|indigenous]]-led or [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]]-led.  He also called for changes to the electoral system, under which almost two-thirds of the House of Representatives are elected from [[communal constituencies]], whose electors are registered members of a particular ethnic group.

== Second term as Leader of the Opposition ==
Beddoes retained his constituency, with a slightly reduced majority, in the [[Fijian general election, 2006|parliamentary election]] held on 6–13 May 2006, and was appointed Leader of the Opposition for the second time on 3 June &lt;small&gt;([http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0606/S00088.htm source]).&lt;/small&gt; His second appointment came after weeks of disputes with his erstwhile ally, Mahendra Chaudhry, who had insisted that the position should be his, despite the decision of the Labour Party to enter a [[grand coalition]] with the [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] Party (SDL).  After obtaining legal advice, [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] appointed Beddoes.

As of 19 September, Beddoes was still performing his duties only on a part-time basis, [[Fiji Television]] reported.  To assume the position full-time, he would be [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitutionally]] required to divest himself of his private business interests.

== Campaign against controversial bill ==
Throughout much of 2005, Beddoes was at the forefront of a public campaign against the government's controversial [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill]], which provided for the establishment of a Commission empowered to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|coup d'état]] which deposed the [[People's Coalition (Fiji)|People's Coalition]] government in May 2000.  Beddoes travelled throughout Fiji, speaking against the bill, which was, he claimed, nothing other than a legal mechanism for releasing from prison persons convicted of involvement in the coup, who were supporters of or in some way linked to the present government. The bill was temporarily shelved during the election and its aftermath.  An amended version was pending, but the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] of 5 December 2006 put an end to it.

== 2006 coup d'état ==
{{Main|2006 Fijian coup d'état}}

Long considered an ally of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]] in their long-running dispute with the Qarase government, Beddoes began criticising the Military towards the end of 2006, as tensions escalated to unprecedented levels.  On 20 October, [[Fiji Television]] quoted him as calling for an end to the Military's attempts to intimidate the government. On the other hand, he called on the government on 28 November to placate the Military by dropping investigations into insubordination on the part of the Commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]]. ''"All it is doing is putting a red rag in front of a bull and the bull has 4,000 guns,"'' he told Australia's [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]]. On 1 December, as it became apparent that a coup was imminent, he branded the Military a bunch of bullies, and issued a strong warning to persons who might be considering accepting office in an interim government, saying that they would be taken to task when the storm had passed. On 4 December, Beddoes called on Fijians to rally in support of the rule of law.

Beddoes condemned the coup of 5 December, and spoke out strongly against what he saw as violations of constitutional and human rights.

Beddoes welcomed the decision of the Military to restore [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] to the [[President of Fiji|Presidency]] on 4 January 2007, but condemned the appointment of Bainimarama as interim [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] on 5 January and criticised the President's endorsement of the coup, the [[Fiji Times]] reported. He expressed disappointment when his deputy, [[Bernadette Ganilau|Bernadette Rounds-Ganilau]], accepted office in Bainimarama's interim government, and asked her to resign from the UPP. He was particularly disappointed, he said, that Ganilau's decision came less than twenty-four hours after he had been visited by soldiers conveying a message from [[Land Force Commander (Fiji)|Land Force Commander]] [[Pita Driti]] threatening him to stop speaking against the Military.  On 10 January, he accused the [[Fiji Labour Party]], some of whose leading figures, were included in the interim government, of having been privy to the coup plot.[http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_34995.shtml]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

== Social views ==
On 27 August 2005, Beddoes spoke out against calls by some for the closure of loopholes in the [[Penal Code]] which had allowed the release of two men, one a Fijian citizen and the other a foreigner, who had been sentenced to a prison term on 5 April for homosexual acts.  This sentence was overturned on 26 August by Justice [[Gerald Winter (judge)|Gerald Winter]], who said that the Penal Code was not applicable to what adults did in private.

The same day, Beddoes condemned [[Senate of Fiji|Senator]] [[Mitieli Bulanauca]] for speaking against homosexuality and attacking Justice Winter in the Senate. ''"Senator Bulanauca is among a very small percentage of misfits and clowns who live off the lies they try to spin to try and intimidate others, while sheltering behind [[parliamentary privilege]],"'' Beddoes said. ''"These expressions of hate come from a man who claims he is a Christian and quotes endlessly from the Bible."''

== Retirement ==
On 20 January 2007, Beddoes announced that he would retire from the presidency of the UPP at the Annual General Meeting of his party, on 31 March.

After the winding up of the UPP in January 2013, Beddoes announced that he would join the new [[Social Democratic Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=73723 |title=Fiji's Beddoes to join budding SDL |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium''' (NCOIC) is an international not-for-profit, chartered in the United States, whose goal is to facilitate the adoption of [[cross-domain interoperability]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, H. [http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/09/30/interoperability-efforts-bear-fruit.aspx "NCOIC's efforts toward product interoperability are showing promise"], ''Washington Technology'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Formed in September 2004, the organization is composed of more than 50 members and advisors representing business,  government organizations and academic institutions in 12 countries.&lt;ref&gt;ASDNews, [http://www.asdnews.com/news-1619/Network_Centric_Operations_Industry_Consortium_-NCOIC-_Launch.htm "Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium -NCOIC- Launch"], ''Aerospace &amp; Defense News'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

NCO is the application of the fundamental tenets of network-centric warfare to aspects of national security, especially industry support for the missions of both the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). NCOIC does not only subscribe to the military use of this theory, but also works to apply NCO and interoperability across nations and industries, including emergency response, health care, [[aerospace]], [[information technology]] cyber security &amp; [[cloud computing]], energy and financial services.

NCOIC’s technical teams have developed resources to further the use of network-centric systems and interoperability in both the public and private sectors. These resources – including processes, tools, frameworks, patterns, principles and databases—are available free of charge on the NCOIC website. They are aimed at helping an organization lower engineering costs, speed program implementation, increase capability and reduce risk. The consortium also provides training and services such as interoperability demonstrations, acquisition strategies, evaluations and verification.

NCOIC focuses on four interdependent areas in identifying solutions that will enable cross-domain interoperability: business, culture, governance and technical. The interaction, influence and impact of factors—such as financial objectives, business goals, laws and regulations, and cultural considerations – are all taken into account when planning and/or implementing technology change.

==Key Technical Resources==

''Systems, Capabilities, Operations, Programs, &amp; Enterprises (SCOPE) Model''
•	The SCOPE interoperability assessment model is designed to characterize interoperability-relevant aspects or capabilities of a system or set of systems over a network in terms of a set of dimensions and values along those dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Creps, Et Al. [https://www.ncoic.org/images/technology/SCOPE_MODEL_VER1.0.pdf "SCOPE"], ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC)'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''NCOIC Interoperability Framework (NIF)''
•	The NIF is a development framework that helps system architects and system engineers to embed interoperability elements throughout the life cycle of programs, beginning with requirements. Whenever possible, those resources are based upon standards.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bowler. [https://www.ncoic.org/technology/educational-resources/nif-and-net-centric-pattern-overview "NIF"], ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC)'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
''

Net Centric Patterns''
•	NCOIC Net Centric Patterns contain prescriptive recommendations on approaches and standards in specific interoperability domains.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Legrand. [https://www.ncoic.org/technology/technical-resources/net-centric-patterns "Netcentric Patterns"], ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC)'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''Network Centric Analysis Tool (NCAT)''
•	NCAT is a collaborative, web-enabled questionnaire-based tool developed to assist NCOIC teams and member companies to enhance the likelihood and reduce the time and effort of member companies developing interoperable systems consistent with customers’ policies and guidelines, reference models and architectures. It is also available in an excel format.
&lt;ref&gt;NCOIC. [https://www.ncoic.org/technology/educational-resources/ncat-overview "NCAT"], ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC)'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''NCOIC QuadTrangle''
•	The QuadTrangle™ developed by the Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium shows the four, interdependent areas that must be considered when developing a reliable and trusted interoperable environment: business, culture, governance and technical.
&lt;ref&gt;NCOIC. [https://www.ncoic.org/about-us/ncoic-difference/ncoic-quadtrangle "NCOIC QuadTrangle"], ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC)'', 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Race Wong''' is a Singaporean actress, singer and businesswoman. She was one of the former Hong Kong [[cantopop]] duo singer group [[2R (group)|2R]] alongside with her elder sister [[Rosanne Wong]].

==Professional background==
Born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore, she pursued her career in the entertainment industry in Hong Kong with her sister [[Rosanne Wong]] which won her various awards for her singing career as the [[cantopop]] group [[2R (group)|2R]], including Most Promising Newcomer and Most Popular Group Award in the Annual Top 10 Song of the Year Awards (2003), [[Metro Broadcast Corporation|Metro Broadcasting Music awards]] (2004), [[TVB Anniversary Awards|TVB Top 10 Songs of the Year]] (2004) and Hong Kong Commercial Radio Music Awards’ (2003).

Race Wong became a spotlight when she was chosen to star alongside [[Stephen Chow]] in his famous annual San Miguel TV advertisement. Following that, she rose to fame for her leading role in a TVB youth series ''[[Hearts of Fencing]]''. Which jumpstarted both her singing and acting career.

Race Wong hoped to focus her acting on roles beyond her youthful and sweet appearance. Her outstanding performance in her first leading role in movie Abnormal Beauty [[Ab-normal Beauty|Abnormal Beauty]] won her a nomination for the Best New Actor in the [[Hong Kong Film Award|24th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards]] (2005) and the 42nd [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Golden Horse Film Awards]]' (2005) in Taiwan. Race Wong continued to experiment with different roles both on-screen and off-screen. In 2006, together with her sister [[Rosanne Wong]], they took on groundbreaking leading roles in a musical adaption of [[The Smiling, Proud Wanderer#Stage productions|The Smiling Proud Wanderer]] stage performance by the Hong Kong Dance Company (2006) where Rosanne famously shaved bald for the role. The musical enjoyed a success which brought them to perform in Shanghai the following year.

Later in 2008, Race Wong's starring role as a pregnant new immigrant from China was a break away from her usual youthful image in the movie [[True Women for Sale]] which earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards (2009). Race is one of the very rare few Singaporeans to have been nominated in the Hong Kong Film Awards.

In 2010, Race Wong decided to step out of the limelight for a break. She took on a Masters of Business course to further her education and graduated with a Masters of Business majoring in Marketing from the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] (Australia) in 2013. Concurrently in 2011, she made an unexpected career change into finance, taking on the role of Marketing Manager at [[Maybank Kim Eng|Maybank Kim Eng Securities]] (Hong Kong). She was licensed with the [[Securities and Futures Commission]] to conduct equities trading.

The year she turned 30, Race Wong made a surprising move to relocate back to Singapore where her family is based. Together with her younger sister Rhonda Wong, she set up Anthill Realtors Pte. Ltd.  in 2013 a real estate agency licensed with CEA. She then co-founded Ohmyhome Pte Ltd in 2015, a tech company focused on connecting buyers to sellers, landlords to tenants in real estate. When asked about her career move, Race said that she wanted to focus her attention on something that will provide more value to people, something on the opposite spectrum of her celebrity lifestyle.

She speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin, and English.

==Ideas and theories==
Choudary is best known for his work on the transition of business models from pipelines to platforms. He first proposed this idea in a 2013 article for [[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/10/why-business-models-fail-pipes-vs-platforms/|title=Why Business Models Fail: Pipes vs. Platforms|last=Choudary|first=Sangeet Paul|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea, gained widespread adoption&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; after his 2016 article on this topic was selected by Harvard Business Review among its top 10 ideas of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2016/04/pipelines-platforms-and-the-new-rules-of-strategy|title=Pipelines, Platforms, and the New Rules of Strategy|date=2016-04-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Choudary is also credited with proposing the idea of the core interaction as the central focus of value creation on platform business models, presented in his books Platform Scale and Platform Revolution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Choudary's work on the transformation of incumbent businesses to platform business models has been widely quoted in media.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfresco/2016/11/29/the-platform-business-model-why-it-works-and-how-to-get-there-an-interview-with-sangeet-paul-choudary/#19a067e717c3|title=AlfrescoVoice: The Platform Business Model: Why It Works And How to Get There: An Interview With Sangeet Paul Choudary|last=Newton|first=John|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recent work explains the importance of platform economics in manufacturing, heavy industry, healthcare, and financial services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afr.com/brand/business-summit/sangeet-choudary-on-amazons-wakeup-call-for-business-20180305-h0x1yq|title=Sangeet Choudary on Amazon's wake-up call for business|date=2018-03-06|work=Financial Review|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choudary credits game design theory as one of the inspirations for his work on platform design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/features/how-platforms-will-become-critical-for-businesses/story/218895.html#|title=How platforms will become critical for businesses- Business News|website=www.businesstoday.in|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choudary has been a sought after expert for research outlets including the International Labor Organization,&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; the MIT Technology Review,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the World Economic Forum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/wp-content/blogs.dir/94/mp/files/pages/files/white-paper-dti-2017-mm.pdf|title=World Economic Forum - Digital Transformation Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR2016/WEF_GITR_Full_Report.pdf|title=World Economic Forum - Global Information Technology Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Economist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21678774-europes-biggest-economy-rightly-worried-digitisation-threat-its-industrial|title=Does Deutschland do digital?|website=The Economist|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinsey &amp; Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-tech/online-giants-get-personal|title=Online Giants Get Personal|date=2017-12-06|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/558777/EPRS_STU(2016)558777_EN.pdf|title=European Parliament - The cost of Non-Europe in the Sharing Economy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espas.eu/orbis/sites/default/files/generated/document/en/EPRS_STU%282017%29603263_EN.pdf|title=European Parliament - Global Trends to 2035|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For his work on platform economics, Choudary has been hailed as a 'global thought leader on the platform business model' by Forbes&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and a 'top global thinker' by the Huffington Post.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/interview-with-sangeet-choudary-lessons-from-airbnb_us_5962fd55e4b08f5c97d06b05|title=Top Global Thinker Applies Lessons from Airbnb and Uber to Open Government as a Platform|last=Cabrera|first=Marquis|date=2017-07-10|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Impact on public policy==
Choudary has worked with several governments and policy makers in Europe to help them develop competitive and regulatory responses to global platforms entering Europe.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/brand/business-summit/why-amazon-and-uber-are-working-on-the-dark-side-and-need-to-be-regulated-20180303-h0wydb|title=Amazon and Uber, and the dark side of platforms|date=2018-03-04|work=Financial Review|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fd.nl/morgen/1248528/europa-kan-platforms-als-amazon-reguleren|title=Cookiewall {{!}} Het Financieele Dagblad|website=fd.nl|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Choudary has been a prominent advocate of individual rights in the platform economy and has worked extensively with several international bodies, including the United Nations, on this topic. His research on worker exploitation by labor platforms was released by the [[International Labour Organization|International Labor Organization]]&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; as part of their Future of Work Research Paper Series.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/future-of-work/publications/research-papers/WCMS_630603/lang--en/index.htm|title=The architecture of digital labour platforms: Policy recommendations on platform design for worker well-being|date=2018-05-15|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Choudary addressed a high-level seminar by the Permanent Mission of Belgium in Geneva, highlighting the factors that lead to exploitation of workers on digital platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/future-of-work/news/WCMS_583490/lang--en/index.htm|title=High-level seminar on the “Sharing Economy and its Social Challenges”|date=2017-10-16|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Choudary addressed the [[Folketing|Parliament of Denmark]] on labor policy for the platform economy, stressing on the need for a new data-driven regulation paradigm for platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://borsen.dk/opinion/blogs/view/17/5033/derfor_skader_digitale_arbejdsplatforme_kun_de_dovne.html|title=Er den danske model klar til fremtidens digitale arbejdsmarked?|website=borsen.dk|language=da|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recommendations for regulating platforms through open data sharing were instrumental in informing the Danish government's decision to implement open data regulation for Airbnb in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44166174|title=Airbnb tax evaders targeted in landmark deal|date=2018-05-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Choudary's research on the adverse impact of platforms on the creative economy was featured as a keynote at the annual conference of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/2018/global_digital_conference.html|title=WIPO Conference on the Global Digital Content Market: Focus on Asia-Pacific|website=www.wipo.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recommendations advocated the role of the WIPO as a standards setting organization in a platform economy, for protection of creator interests.  

Choudary's work on digital trade includes a future positioning paper for countries like Singapore that is widely considered a blueprint for Singapore's strategy for digital trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/spore-must-think-like-a-platform-to-thrive-as-a-digital-hub|title=Singapore must think like a platform to thrive as a digital hub|last=hermes|date=2018-02-14|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper suggests that countries can adopt a platform strategy and establish free data ports to harness digital trade flows.

{{marketing}}
'''Social marketing''' is the use of marketing theory, skills and practices to achieve social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/social-marketing.html|title=What is social marketing? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the primary goal of achieving "[[Common good|social good]]". Traditional [[commercial marketing]] aims are primarily financial, though they can have positive social affects as well. In the context of public health, social marketing would promote general health, raise awareness and induce changes in behaviour. To see social marketing as only the use of standard commercial marketing practices to achieve non-commercial goals is an [[oversimplification|oversimplified view]].  

Social marketing seeks to develop and integrate [[marketing]] concepts with other approaches to [[social change]]. Social marketing aims to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. The goal is to deliver competition-sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=International Social Marketing Association, European Social Marketing Association &amp; Australian Association of Social Marketing|year=2013|title=Consensus Definition of Social Marketing|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Increasingly, social marketing is described as having "two parents." The "social parent" uses [[social science]] and [[social policy]] approaches. The "marketing parent" uses commercial and public sector [[marketing]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=Aiden|title=Social Marketing and Public Health: Theory and practice|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsEijRnC8GYC|editor=Jeff French |editor2=Clive Blair-Stevens |editor3=Dominic McVey |editor4=Rowena Merritt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have also witnessed a broader focus.  Social marketing now goes beyond influencing individual behaviour. It promotes socio-cultural and structural change relevant to social issues.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Jeff|last2=Gordon|first2=Ross|title=Strategic Social Marketing|date=2015|publisher=Sage|isbn=9781446248621|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/strategic-social-marketing/book237965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, social marketing scholars are beginning to advocate for a broader definition of social marketing: "social marketing is the application of marketing principles to enable individual and collective ideas and actions in the pursuit of effective, efficient, equitable, fair and sustained social transformation".
The new emphasis gives equal weight to the effects (efficiency and effectiveness) and the process (equity, fairness and sustainability) of social marketing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saunders, S. G.|author2=Barrington, D. J.|author3=Sridharan, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2015|title=Redefining social marketing: beyond behavioural change|journal=Journal of Social Marketing|volume=5|issue=2|pages=160–168|doi=10.1108/JSOCM-03-2014-0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications ==
The first documented evidence of the deliberate use of marketing to address a social issue comes from a 1963 [[reproductive health]] program led by [[K. T. Chandy]] at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta, India.  Chandy and colleagues proposed, and subsequently implemented, a national [[family planning]] program with high quality, government brand condoms distributed and sold throughout the country at low cost. The program included an integrated consumer marketing campaign run with active point of sale promotion. Retailers were trained to sell the product aggressively, and a new organization was created to implement the program.&lt;ref&gt;Chandy, K.T., Balakrishman, T.R., Kantawalla, J.M., Mohan, K., Sen, N.P., Gupta, S.S. &amp; Srivastva, S. (1965). Proposals for family planning promotion: A marketing plan. Studies in Family Planning;1(6):7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Developing country|developing countries]], the use of social marketing expanded to [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV prevention]], control of childhood [[diarrhea]] (through the use of [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral re-hydration therapies]]), [[malaria]] control and treatment, [[Portable water purification|point-of-use water treatment]], [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|on-site sanitation]] methods and the provision of basic health services.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R. C. (2011). An integrative model for social marketing. Journal of Social Marketing;1:54–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health promotion campaigns began applying social marketing in practice in the 1980s. In the United States, The National High Blood Pressure Education Program&lt;ref&gt;Roccella, E.J. &amp; Ward, G.W. (1984). The National High Blood Pressure Education Program: A description of its utility as a generic program model. Health Education Quarterly, 11(3): 225-242&lt;/ref&gt; and the community heart disease prevention studies in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and at Stanford University&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1988). Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention (Portable Document Format). Health Education Quarterly; 15 (3): 300, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach to address population-based risk factor behaviour change. Notable early developments also took place in Australia. These included the Victoria Cancer Council developing its [[smoking cessation|anti-tobacco]] campaign "Quit" (1988) and "SunSmart" (1988), its campaign against [[skin cancer]] which had the slogan "[[Slip-Slop-Slap|Slip! Slop! Slap!]]"&lt;ref name="VicHealth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |title=VicHealth History: Major Events and Milestones |work=VicHealth |publisher=Victorian Health Promotion Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719032451/http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the field has rapidly expanded around the world to include active living communities, disaster preparedness and response, [[ecosystem]] and species conservation, environmental issues, development of volunteer or indigenous workforces, financial literacy, global threats of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]], government corruption, improving the quality of health care, injury prevention, landowner education, [[marine conservation]] and ocean sustainability, patient-centered health care, reducing health disparities, [[sustainable consumption]], transportation demand management, [[water treatment]] and [[sanitation]] systems and youth gambling problems, among other social needs (See&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013) Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (Ed). Social marketing: Six volume set. London: SAGE Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;).

On a wider front, by 2007, government in the United Kingdom announced the development of its first social marketing strategy for all aspects of health.&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"&gt;UK Department of Health, ''[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094550 Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier]'', Cmd.6374 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US national health objectives&lt;ref name="HealthyPeople2020"&gt;US Department of Health and Human Services, ''[http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=18 Health Communication and Health Information Technology]''&lt;/ref&gt; included increasing the number of state health departments that report using social marketing in health promotion and disease prevention programs and increasing the number of schools of public health that offer courses and workforce development activities in social marketing.

Two other public health applications include the CDC's CDCynergy training and software application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthmarketing/cdcynergy/ |title=CDC - CDCynergy (NCHM) |accessdate=2007-10-19 |date=2006-06-27 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SMART (Social Marketing and Assessment Response Tool) in the U.S.&lt;ref name="SMART"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CTG/is_2-3_18/ai_108194963/ |title=Positioning Social Marketing as a Planning Process for Health Education |accessdate=2012-01-13 |last= Neiger |first=Brad L. |author2=Rosemary Thackeray |author3=Michael D. Barnes |author4= James F. McKenzie  |year=2003 |journal=American Journal of Health Studies |volume=18 |issue=2/3 |pages=75–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social marketing theory and practice has been progressed in several countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and in the latter a number of key government policy papers have adopted a strategic social marketing approach. Publications such as "Choosing Health" in 2004,&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"/&gt; "[http://www.nsmcentre.org.uk/component/remository/NSMC-Publications/Its-Our-Health-%28Summary-Report%29/ It's our health!]" in 2006 and "[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4139514 Health Challenge England]" in 2006, represent steps to achieve a strategic and operational use of social marketing. In India, [[AIDS]] controlling programs are largely using social marketing and social workers are largely working for it. Most of the social workers are professionally trained for this task.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A variation of social marketing has emerged as a systematic way to foster more sustainable behavior. Referred to as community-based social marketing (CBSM) by Canadian environmental psychologist Doug McKenzie-Mohr, CBSM strives to change the behavior of communities to reduce their impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie-Mohr, D. (2000). Fostering sustainable behavior through community-based social marketing. American Psychologist, 55(5), 531-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that simply providing information is usually not sufficient to initiate behavior change, CBSM uses tools and findings from social psychology to discover the perceived barriers to behavior change and ways of overcoming these barriers. Among the tools and techniques used by CBSM are focus groups and surveys (to discover barriers) and commitments, prompts, social norms, social diffusion, feedback and incentives (to change behavior). The tools of CBSM have been used to foster sustainable behavior in many areas, including energy conservation,&lt;ref&gt;Schultz P. W., Nolan J. M., Cialdini R. B., Goldstein N. J., Griskevicius Vladas (2007). The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms. ''Psychological Science'', 18(5), 429-434.&lt;/ref&gt; environmental regulation&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, A. (2010). Using Community-Based Social Marketing Techniques to Enhance Environmental Regulation. ''Sustainability'', 2(4), 1138-1160&lt;/ref&gt; and recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Haldeman, T. &amp; Turner, J. (2009). Implementing a community-based social marketing program to increase recycling. ''Social Marketing Quarterly'', 15(3), 114-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the concept of strategic social marketing has emerged, which identifies that social change requires action at the individual, community, socio-cultural, political and environmental level, and that social marketing can and should influence policy, strategy and operational tactics to achieve pro-social outcomes.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"/&gt;

Other social marketing can be aimed at products deemed, at least by proponents, as socially unacceptable. One of the most notable is [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) which for many years has waged social marketing campaigns against the use of natural fur products. The campaigns' efficacy has been subject to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peek|first=Liz|title=Warm Weather Torments City Furriers|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/warm-weather-torments-city-furriers/43889/|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=New York Sun|date=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all social marketing campaigns are effective everywhere. For example, anti-smoking campaigns such as [[World No Tobacco Day]] while being successful (in concert with government tobacco controls) in curbing the demand for tobacco products in North America and in parts of Europe, have been less effective in other parts of the world such as China, India and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Fedyashin, [Opinion &amp; Analysis: World No Tobacco Day, Futile Attempt to Curb Smoking. http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090529/155119204.html], RiaNovosti (Russia), May 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Prevalence of tobacco consumption]])

Social marketing uses the benefits of doing social good to secure and maintain [[customer engagement]]. In social marketing the distinguishing feature is therefore its "primary focus on social good, and it is not a secondary outcome.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Not all public sector and not-for-profit marketing is social marketing.

Public sector bodies can use standard marketing approaches to improve the promotion of their relevant services and organizational aims. This can be very important but should not be confused with social marketing where the focus is on achieving specific behavioral goals with specific audiences in relation to topics relevant to social good (e.g., health, sustainability, recycling, etc.). For example, a 3-month marketing campaign to encourage people to get a H1N1 vaccine is more tactical in nature and should not be considered social marketing. A campaign that promotes and reminds people to get regular check-ups and all of their vaccinations when they're supposed to encourages a long-term behavior change that benefits society. It can therefore be considered social marketing.

Social marketing can be confused with commercial marketing. A commercial marketer may only seek to influence a buyer to purchase a product. Social marketers have more difficult goals.  They want to make potentially difficult and long-term behavior changes in target populations, which may or may not involve purchasing a product.  For example, reducing cigarette smoking or encouraging use of condoms have difficult challenges to overcome that go beyond purchasing decisions.

Social marketing is sometimes seen as being restricted to a client base of non-profit organizations, health services groups, the government agency. However, the goal of inducing social change is not restricted to this narrow spectrum of organizations. Corporations, for example, can be clients.  Public relations or social responsibility departments may champion social causes such funding for the arts, which would involve social marketing.

Social marketing should not be confused with the societal marketing concept which was a forerunner of [[sustainable marketing]] in integrating issues of [[corporate social responsibility|social responsibility]] into commercial marketing strategies. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to social issues.

Social marketing applies a "customer oriented" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like anti-smoking campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

Social marketers must create competitive advantage by constantly adapting to and instigating change. With climate change in mind, adaptations to market changes are likely to be more successful if actions are guided by knowledge of the forces shaping market behaviours and insights that enable the development of sustainable competitive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;Shocker, Allan D., Rajendra K. Srivastava, and Robert W. Ruekert. "Challenges and Opportunities Facing Brand Management: An Introduction to the Special Issue." Journal of Marketing Research 31.2 (1994): 149. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Jupitermedia]] announced its "Social Marketing" service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/r_craiig_lefebvres_social/2006/08/hello_jupiter_a.html |title=Hello Jupiter? Anyone Home? |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |date=2006-08-30 |work=On Marketing and Social Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; with which it aims to enable website owners to profit from [[social media]]. Despite protests from the social marketing communities over the perceived hijacking of the term, Jupiter stuck with the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |title=Social Marketing vs. Social Marketing |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Schatsky |first=David |date=2006-09-01 |work=Jupiterresearch Analyst Weblogs |publisher=Jupitermedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303050738/http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jupiter's approach is more correctly (and commonly) referred to as [[social media optimization]].

==History ==

Many scholars ascribe the beginning of the field of social marketing to an article published by G.D. Wiebe in the Winter 1951-1952 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiebe|first=G.D.|title=Merchandising Commodities and Citizenship on Television|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951–1952|volume=15|issue=Winter|pages=679|doi=10.1086/266353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Wiebe posed a rhetorical question: "Why can’t you sell brotherhood and rational thinking like you can sell soap?” He then went on to discuss what he saw as the challenges of attempting to sell a social good as if it were a commodity, thus identifying social marketing (though he did not label it as such) as a discipline unique from c
mmodity marketing. Yet, Wilkie &amp; Moore (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L., &amp; Moore, E. S. (2003). Scholarly research in marketing: Exploring the “4 eras” of thought development. Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing; 22(2):116–146.&lt;/ref&gt; note that the marketing discipline has been involved with questions about the intersection of marketing and society since its earliest days as a discipline.

A decade later, organizations such as the [[KfW Entwicklungsbank]] in Germany, the Canadian International Development Agency, the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs in The Netherlands, UK Department for International Development, [[US Agency for International Development]], [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]] began sponsoring social marketing interventions to improve family planning and achieve other social goals in Africa, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Michael|title=The Marketing Book|year=2012|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=R. Craig|title=Social Marketing and Social Change: Strategies and Tools to Improve Health, Well-Being and the Environment\year=2013|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next milestone in the evolution of social marketing was the publication of "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change" in the ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'' by [[Philip Kotler]] and [[Gerald Zaltman]].&lt;ref name="Kotler 1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kotler|first=Philip|author2=Gerald Zaltman |title=Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=July 1971|volume=35|pages=3–12|url=https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/faculty/laba_m/425/07-fall/documents/Kotler-Zaltman.PDF|doi=10.2307/1249783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler and Zaltman coined the term 'social marketing' and defined it as "the design, implementation, and control of programs calculated to influence the acceptability of social ideas and involving considerations of product planning, pricing, communication, distribution, and marketing research." They conclude that "social marketing appears to represent a bridging mechanism which links the behavior scientist's knowledge of human behavior with the socially useful implementation of what that knowledge allows."

Craig Lefebvre and June Flora introduced social marketing to the public health community in 1988,&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"/&gt; where it has been most widely used and explored. They noted that there was a need for "large scale, broad-based, behavior change focused programs" to improve public health (the community wide prevention of cardiovascular diseases in their respective projects) and outlined eight essential components of social marketing that still hold today:
#A consumer orientation to realize organizational (social) goals
#An emphasis on the voluntary exchanges of goods and services between providers and consumers
#Research in audience analysis and segmentation strategies
#The use of formative research in product and message design and the pretesting of these materials
#An analysis of distribution (or communication) channels
#Use of the [[marketing mix]]—using and blending product, price, place and promotion characteristics in intervention planning and implementation
#A process tracking system with both integrative and control functions
#A management process that involves problem analysis, planning, implementation and feedback functions&lt;ref name="Lefebvre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |author2=June A. Flora  |year=1988 |title=Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention |journal=Health Education Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=300, 301 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/Publications/Social_Marketing_and_Public_Health_Intervention.pdf |format=Portable Document Format |accessdate=2008-04-30 |doi=10.1177/109019818801500305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of what they termed "social change campaigns", Kotler and [[Ned Roberto]] introduced the subject by writing, "A social change campaign is an organized effort conducted by one group (the change agent) which attempts to persuade others (the target adopters) to accept, modify, or abandon certain ideas, attitudes, practices or behavior." Their 1989 text was updated in 2002 by [[Philip Kotler]], [[Ned Roberto]] and Nancy Lee.&lt;ref name="Kotler2002"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Ned Roberto and Nancy Lee. ''Social Marketing: Improving the Quality of Life'', SAGE, 2002. ({{ISBN|0-7619-2434-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[University of Stirling]] was the first university to open a dedicated research institute to Social Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ism.stir.ac.uk/|title=Institute for Social Marketing – University of Stirling|author=|date=|website=www.ism.stir.ac.uk|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2007, [[Middlesex University]] became the first university to offer a specialized [[postgraduate]] programme in Health &amp; Social Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524003618/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been an important development to distinguish between "strategic social marketing" and "operational social marketing".

Much of the literature and case examples focus on operational social marketing, using it to achieve specific behavioral goals in relation to different audiences and topics. However, there has been increasing efforts to ensure social marketing goes "upstream" and is used much more strategically to inform policy formulation and strategy development. Here the focus is less on specific audience and topic work but uses strong customer understanding and insight to inform and guide effective policy and strategy development.

Social marketing is also being explored as a method for social innovation, a framework to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices among professionals and organizations, and as a core skill for public sector managers and social entrepreneurs. It is being viewed as an approach to design more effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable approaches to enhance social well-being that extends beyond individual behavior change to include creating positive shifts in social networks and social norms, businesses, markets and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013). Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of social marketing research, with over 120 papers compiled in a six volume set.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"/&gt;). For example, research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S., Christina K.C. Lee, Clinton Weeks and Maria Kaya (2013), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf "How to stop binge drinking and speeding motorists: Effects of relational-interdependent self-construable and self-referencing on attitudes toward social marketing "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160914/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf |date=2015-04-27 }}, ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', 12, 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS)''' is the key administrative service of the [[Government of Sri Lanka]], with civil servants working for both in the Central Government as well as in the provincial councils... It was formed as the ''Ceylon Administrative Service'' (CAS) in 1963 as the successor to the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] which was abolished on May 1, 1963. It is the senior of the [[Public Services of Sri Lanka|public service]]s.

Based on the [[British Civil Service]] the SLAS is the permanent [[bureaucracy]] that helps the elected officials on day-to-day functions of government. They are selected, promoted by the [[Civil service commission|Public Service Commission]]. But top positions in the government such as Permanent Secretaries are appointed by the President, in theory on the recommendations of the Public Service Commission.

A Permanent Secretary is the top bureaucrat of the government ministry and is responsible for the day-to-day functions of the ministry whereas in theory the [[Minister (government)|minister]] is responsible only for drafting policy. The head of the SLAS is the [[Presidential Secretariat|Secretary to the President]].

A Chief Secretary is a Special Grade officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service in the provinces which is equivalent to a Permanent Secretary of the central government known as Chief Secretary. There are nine Chief Secretaries, one for each of the [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|nine provinces]].

==Grading schemes==
Until 2005, broader term officers are classed into SLAS class 1 officers, SLAS class 2 grade 1, and SLAS class 2 grade 2. All grades from SLAS class 1 and above (see table) are part of the "Senior officers ". The [[Secretary to the Treasury (Sri lanka)|Secretary to the Treasury]] was the traditional head of the Civil Service during the time of the old [[Ceylon Civil Service]], but in years after the establishment of the SLAS the Presidents Secretary is the de facto head of the SLAS.

After 1 January 2005 Sri Lanka Administrative service introduced four grades, such as:
* Special Grade offices (present cadre is 200)
* Class I officers (present cadre is 507)
* Class II officers (present cadre is 639)
* Class III officers (present cadre is 1059)

Below the "Senior officers "(Special Grade offices, Class I officers and ), each individual department can put in place its own grading.

The traditional titles for each grade of the civil service are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Traditional Title                !! Alternative Title                              !! Grade
|-
|  [[Presidential Secretariat|Secretary to the President]]     ||   [[Secretary to the Treasury (Sri lanka)|Secretary to the Treasury]]                         ||Special Grade offices
|-
|  [[Permanent Secretary]]        || Chief Secretary                                                ||Special Grade officers
|-
|  Additional Secretary           || [[Commissioner-General]], [[Director-General]]  ||Special Grade officers
|-
|  Senior Assistant Secretary     || [[Commissioner]], Director                      ||Class I officers
|-
|  Assistant Secretary            || Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Director            ||Class II officers
|-
|  Titles vary widely             || Assistant Commissioner, Assistant Director      ||Class II officers
|}

* The post of Deputy Secretary is only used in the Ministry of Finance is ranked just below the post of Permanent Secretary.

'''''The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)''''' (2007) is the tenth published book by [[Seth Godin]].&lt;ref&gt;The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 76 page book that illustrates the concept of "the dip"—a temporary setback that can be overcome with persistence—and how to recognize if you are within one worth pushing through or one where you should quit.

==Background==
The rough idea for ''The Dip'' first materialized on Godin's blog.&lt;ref name=800CEO&gt;[http://800ceoread.com/blog/archives/006719.html The Dip: A New Book Coming From Seth Godin] on ''800-CEO-READ''. January 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On an entry titled "The four curves of want and get," Godin shows four curves representing patterns of adoption.&lt;ref name=fourcurves&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/06/the_four_curves.html The four curves of want and get] ''Seth's Blog''. June 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He ends the post with "How do you avoid killing something too early, or celebrating too early. And last, how do you know when to kill a dud," a theme that would reappear in ''The Dip''. Five months later, Godin posted another entry titled "Understanding Local Max," in which he presented another success curve—this time nearly identical to the one that appears in his book—and analyzed the hypothetical conversation that would occur at four points on the curve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/11/understanding_l.html Understanding Local Max] ''Seth's Blog''. November 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the basis behind ''The Dip'', the entry was also included in ''Small is the new Big'', a collection of short pieces from his blog.

==Synopsis==
Godin introduces the book with a quote from [[Vince Lombardi]]: "Quitters never win and winners never quit." He follows this with "Bad advice. Winners quit all the time. ''They just quit the right stuff at the right time.''"

Godin first makes the assertion that "being the best in the world is seriously underrated," although he defines the term 'best' as "best for them based on what they believe and what they know," and 'world' as "the world they have access to." He supports this by illustrating that [[vanilla]] [[ice cream]] is almost four times as popular as the next-most popular ice cream, further stating that this is seen in [[Zipf's Law]]. Godin's central thesis is that in order to be the best in the world, one must quit the wrong stuff and stick with the right stuff. In illustrating this, Godin introduces several curves: 'the dip,' 'the cul-de-sac,' and 'the cliff.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/2007/05/images_from_the.html Images from the book] ''The Dip Blog''. May 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Godin gives examples of the dip, ways to recognize when an apparent dip is really a cul-de-sac, and presents strategies of when to quit, amongst other things.

The book is also accompanied with cartoons from Hugh MacLeod, who publishes his cartoons on his blog ''gapingvoid'' and is the author of "How To Be Creative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gapingvoid.com/ gapingvoid] cartoons drawn on the back of business cards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Hugh [http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html How To Be Creative] ''gapingvoid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and Reception==
In early March, Godin launched a companion [[blog]] to ''The Dip'' titled "The Dip Blog," in which he released details about the book and gave illustrative examples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/ The Dip Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; On his subsequent book tour, Godin agreed to go to any place where people had bought 2,500 copies of his book.&lt;ref&gt;Windley, Phil [http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/05/seth_godin_the_dip.shtml Seth Godin: The Dip]&lt;/ref&gt; Godin made stops in 15 cities, totaling 37,500 books. ''The Dip'' peaked at #5 on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]] and sold 100,000 copies in its first month of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestsellerinterviews.com/10-questions-with-seth-godin-author-of-permission-marketing-purple-cow-and-the-dip.html 10 Questions with Seth Godin] ''Bestseller Interviews''. June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was met with positive reviews, receiving profiles in [[USA Today]], [[The Miami Herald]], [[National Post]], [[South China Morning Post]], [[Brandweek]], and [[Entrepreneur Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Diane [http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/francis/archive/2007/12/26/seth-godin-dig.aspx Seth Godin's the dip is a great little read] ''[[National Post]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">'''William C. Goggin''' (August 26, 1911 – December 14, 1988) was an American chemist, business manager and business theorist, noted for developing the concept of [[Multidimensional organization]] at [[Dow Corning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Galbraith, Jay R.]], and Daniel A. Nathanson. ''Strategy implementation: The role of structure and process.'' St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Company, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Lincoln Ackoff]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Alma, Michigan]], Goggin obtained his BS in chemistry, Physics and Mathematics at [[Alma College]] in 1933, and at the [[University of Michigan]] his BS in Electrical Engineering in 1935 and his MS in Electrical Engineering in 1936.&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= William C.

Goggin spend his most of his career at [[Dow Chemical Company]], where he started after graduation in 1936 in the Student Training Program. He got further acquainted with the company as Engineer in the Physics Research Laboratory from 1937 to 1939, and as Salesman in the Special Products Division from 1939 to 1941. In 1941 he started in management as Assistant Manager in the Plastics Sales Division, where he became manager in 1942 and manager in the Plastics Development Division in 1943. In 1947 he moved to the Plastics Technical Service, and in 1959 became General Manager of the Plastics Department. In 1967 he moved to the [[Dow Corning Corporation]], where he was President and Director until 1971, and then became its Chairman of the Board until 1976.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

In 1954 Goggin was awarded an Honorary D.Sc. from Alma College, and in 1976 he was listed unto the Plastics Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

== Work ==

=== Multidimensional organization ===
As CEO of [[Dow Corning]] from 1967 to 1971 Goggin developed a type of organization structure, which became known as the [[Multidimensional organization]]. In the 1974 article "How the multidimensional structure works at Dow Corning"  in the ''Harvard Business Review,'' Goggin described the occasion and motivation of his innovation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although [[Dow Corning]] was a healthy corporation in 1967, it showed symptoms of difficulty that troubled many of us in top management. These symptoms were, and still are, common ones in U.S. business and have been described countless times in reports, audits, articles, and speeches. Our symptoms took such form as: 
# Executives did not have adequate financial information and control of their operations. Marketing managers, for example, did not know how much it cost to produce a product. Prices and margins were set by the division managers. 
# Cumbersome communications channels existed between key functions, especially manufacturing and marketing. 
# In the face of stiffening competition, the corporation remained too internalized in its thinking and organizational structure. It was insufficiently oriented to the outside world. 
# Lack of communication between divisions not only created the antithesis of a corporate team effort but also was wasteful of a precious resource-people.
# Long-range corporate planning was sporadic and superficial; this was leading to overstaffing, duplicated effort, and inefficiency. 
Fearing that our problems would become worse instead of better in the future, we undertook major changes in our organizational structure. We turned to a matrix concept of organization-what we later came to call the ''[[multidimensional organization]].''&lt;ref&gt;Goggin (1974, 54)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Goggin had joined Dow Corning, the organization was structured as [[matrix organization]]. As main building blocks were seen the [[profit center]] and [[cost centre (business)|cost center]]. Goggin explained, that in the concept of the multidimensional organization, two extra dimensions were added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we first thought of it, the matrix organization was to be two-dimensional... the different businesses in Dow Corning were seen as:
# '''''Profit centers.''''' These were the different businesses the company was in. Businesses were defined along product lines-for instance, rubber, encapsulants and sealants; resins and chemicals; fluids, emulsions, and compounds; specialty lubricants; and consumer, medical, and semi-conductor products. In most of the cases each business's product line served a related group of industries, markets, or customers. 
# '''''Cost centers.''''' These were functional activities and included marketing, manufacturing, technical service and development, and research, as well as a number of supportive activities, such as corporate communications, legal and administrative services, economic evaluation, the controller's office, the treasurer's office, and industrial relations.&lt;br&gt;But soon we came to see further dimensions of the system:
# '''''Geographical areas.''''' Business development varied widely horn area to area, and the profit-center and cost-center dimensions could not be carried out everywhere in the same manner... 
# '''''Space and time.''''' A fourth dimension of the organization denotes fluidity and movement through time (see Part D). The multidimensional organization is far from rigid; it is constantly changing. Unlike centralized or decentralized systems that too often are rooted deep in the past, the multidimensional organization is geared toward the future. Long-term planning is an inherent part of its operation.&lt;ref name="G 74 55"&gt;Goggin (1974, 55)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About Geographical areas Goggin further explained "that each area is considered to be both a profit and a cost center. Dow Coming area organizations are patterned after our major U.S. organization. Although somewhat autonomous in their operation, they subscribe to the overall corporate objectives, operating guidelines, and planning criteria. During the annual planning cycle, for example, there is a mutual exchange of sales, expense, and profit projections between the functional and business managers headquartered in the United States and the area managers around the world."&lt;ref name="G 74 55"/&gt;

==Biography==
Yossi Dina, the  entrepreneur and TV personality, was born in Israel on August 21, 1954. He spent time on a [[kibbutz]], a communal settlement, and then served in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel army]]. At the age of 27, in 1981, Dina arrived in the United States. After a brief stint in New York, he hitched a ride to Los Angeles and found his niche in the jewelry business selling diamonds door-to-door. Soon he began to extend loans to people who needed money but were reluctant to sell off their beloved items. Eventually Dina saved enough money to open his own shop and went into business as South Beverly Wilshire Jewelry and Loan.

He became known as the "jeweler and pawnbroker to the rich and famous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew C. Stone|date=|url=http://gotham-magazine.com/living/articles/yossi-dina-pawnbroker-to-the-rich-and-famous|title=Yossi Dina: Pawnbroker to the Rich and Famous

'''Yousef Beidas''' ({{lang-ar|'''يوسف بيدس'''}}, also transliterated '''Yusif Bedas''', '''Yusef Baydas''', '''Yousif Beydas''') (December 1912 - 28 November 1968) was a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] banker. Known as "The Genius from Jerusalem"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the founder and Chairman of [[Intra Bank]] he was the central figure in one of the Middle East's greatest financial success stories and later one of its most disastrous financial collapses. To his dying day, Beidas claimed he was victim of 'a well-planned conspiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Jerusalem]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, Beidas was the son of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] author and scholar [[Khalil Beidas]]. In Mandatory Palestine he enjoyed a brilliant and precocious career. He was appointed the director of the exchange section of the Palestinian branch of [[Barclay's Bank]] at 21&amp;nbsp;years of age, and rose to be manager of the [[Arab Bank]] by the end of World War 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malsagne|2011|p=352}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Having fled Palestine in 1948 with his pregnant wife, Wedas Salameh,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mardelli|2010|p=326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whom he married in 1946, he took up Lebanese nationality on account of his Beirut-born mother. One of the outcomes of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Israeli-Arab war in Palestine in 1948]], and the concomitant [[1948 Palestinian exodus|flight of huge numbers of Palestinians]], was that [[Haifa]] lost its status as the commercial centre of the [[Mashriq]] or Arab countries east of Egypt, and the role was picked up by Beirut. Lebanese traders were happy to lay out the red carpet for people they otherwise regarded as "two -bit Palestinians" for the capital and talent that could bring to the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackey|2009|pp=83–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beidas set himself up as a money-changer in Beirut with a personal capital of $4,000. On one occasion he even rented all of his office furniture, leaving only a sitting area on the floor for himself to conduct his business, and eventually managed to put 100 competitors out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beidas established his Intra (International traders) Bank in 1951, together with three partners, Mounir Abu-Fadel, Emile Mousallam and Mounir Haddad,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mardelli|2010|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a capital of £12,000 Lebanese pounds, according to one source, or £100,000 sterling based on borrowings from his old clients at the Arab Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malsagne|2011|p=333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Beirut's financial importance was enhanced in the wake of the [[Suez Crisis|Tripartite Aggression against Egypt]] in 1956, which weakened Cairo's function as a beachhead for European investment in the Arab world,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the tight [[bank secrecy]] rules and absence of [[exchange controls]] in the Lebanese banking system made the country a refuge for [[capital flight]],  [[petrodollars]] and [[hot money]] from [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. Intra was soon to become the dominant player in the Lebanese economy, and by 1966 it had between 13 and 17 percent of the country's bank deposits&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Owen|Pamuk|1998|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and assets which included the [[Casino du Liban]], the largest casino in the world, through which drug money was reportedly recycled,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2010|p=315 n.23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle East Airlines]] and the [[Port of Beirut|Port Authority of Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He turned Middle east Airlines, floundering at the time, into one of the most profitable airlines in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he owned a steel mill and a [[Mutual organization|mutual fund society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His group also had anextensive repository of real estate holdings in major cities, 40 branches across the globe, prime property investments in a 27-story skyscraper on [[Fifth Avenue]] in New York near the [[Rockefeller Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beidas's bank also controlled a shipyard in Marseilles,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Valentine|2004|p=406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Londonderry Hotel in [[Park Lane]] and a section of the [[Champs-Élysées]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2013|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also opened up a cinema production company "Studio Baalbek" in 1956, hoping to make Lebanon the "Hollywood of the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mardelli|2010|p=328}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beidas' rise to a key player in Lebanon's economy aroused notable enmities and deep jealousy among the country's traditional elites, for whom banking was a traditional and closed family-based monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They resented the fact that a Palestinian interloper had assumed control over central parts of the national infrastructure. Beidas used part of his capital, furthermore, to finance the [[PLO]]'s [[Fatah]], which was becoming the political and military arm of the [[Palestinian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2012|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1962 (16 April) the then President of Lebanon, the [[Maronite]] [[Fuad Chehab]], concerned about what he perceived to be the 'obscure powers' of international finance extending, though Beidas's companies, their tentacles into the Lebanese economy, sounded out [[Philippe Rondot|General Pierre Rondot]] about the possibility of fighting against Beidas's interests in order to weaken his influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malsagne|2011|p=333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]]'s [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] in particular was discontented by the radicalism of the cause Beidas supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese rumours claimed he was a British agent promoting British over French interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mardelli|2010|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the jargon of the streets the Bank's name was spelt backwards to yield ''artni'', a slang expression for "He cheated me".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mardelli|2010|p=328}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 60s, the Emir of Kuwait, [[Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah]], who was holidaying at the time in the mountain resort of [[Aley]] demanded to see the 5&amp;nbsp;million dollars he had deposited with Intra. Beidas managed to put together the sum, and drove out to the Emir's villa, where he proceeded to slowly count the money out. Before he had finished, the Emir expressed his satisfaction that all was right, but Beidas, outraged by the lack of trust, told him to keep his cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Randall|2012|p=317}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The collapse of his empire occurred when Intra Bank, short of liquidity but rich in assets, was denied a bridging loan by the Lebanese government, in what many regard as a refusal motivated by jealousy than by economic fundamentals. The Lebanese government contacted [[Interpol]] to have him arrested and extradited. Beidas, who had been active in Europe trying to raise loans to refloat Intra, fled to Brazil with his wife and three children&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|pp=87–89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid legal charges, given the precarious legal situation for Palestinians in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2012|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was indicted [[Trial in absentia|in absentia]] for fraudulent bankruptcy and the prosecutor asked for a sentence of 7&amp;nbsp;years hard labour. Though Brazil had no extradition agreements with Lebanon, Lebanese authorities requested a courtesy deportment to make him stand trial. He was placed under house arrest when Lebanese authorities circulated stories that he had financed Brazil's enemies. Beidas faked a heart attack and was recovered in a clinic to sidestep any extradition moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Beidas died two years later, at the age of 56 of pancreatic cancer in [[Lucerne]], destitute and nursed by Nabiha, Edward Said's aunt on his father's side,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Said|2013 pp.96-97|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; rumours nonetheless circulated that his decease was 'mysterious'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Valentine|2004|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Vesco]] tried, but failed to take over what was left of his bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2012|p.315 n23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collapse of Intra Bank==
At the time Intra bank faced the crisis that led to its bankruptcy, it and the empire Beidas formed around it has a value estimated at between $350&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Obituary|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to $500&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beidas told [[Januario Antonio de Carvalho|George de Carvalho]] that on the eve of the crisis, Intra was 60% of all domestically controlled banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of [[Intra Bank]] in October 1966 brought the Lebanese economy to a halt and sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East. The circumstances which surrounded Intra's fall remain to this day controversial issues. The surprisingly weak support from the Lebanese government and the very public allegations over [[Charles Helou]]'s role in the affair have been attributed to such issues as Beidas' Palestinian origin and envy over Beidas' almost complete control of the Lebanese economy.

The bank had incurred losses in gold, copper and American [[Equity (finance)|equities]]. Much of Beidas' Intra Bank money was tied up in non-liquid real estate properties, and, with a sudden jump in [[Eurobanks|Eurobank]] interest rates on [[Eurodollar|dollar deposits]] when the US government took measures to curb domestic inflation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a crisis ensued. Furthermore, Beidas had, reportedly, bet all of his available liquid capital against the American dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackey|2009|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A rush began, on Thursday 13, and Intra paid out %70&amp;nbsp;million, which by nightfall left only $330,000 in the Bank's coffers. The acting head of the bank, worth personally some $50&amp;nbsp;million, informed the Lebanese cabinet that he would personally guarantee his bank's balance sheet, but they refused to budge from their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|pp=88–89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregularities were later discovered, -none of them abnormal within Lebanon's banking system&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; -such as loans to directors exceeding what was legally permissible, and dividend payments to Intra companies that were losing money. Beidas had also used funds held in trust to secure personal loans from Chase Manhattan and the [[Banco di Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Checks on Intra documents indicated false account statements, and an understating of liabilities to the tune of $40&amp;nbsp;million. In addition, Beidas has undercut the local norm advising that 25% of deposits be retained in liquid cash. Intra reduced this margin to 5% in its business practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One observer in his recollections states that, nonetheless, the value of Intra's fixed assets, with extensive foreign property abroad, exceeded its financial liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mardelli|2010|p=330}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this critical juncture, Saudi Arabia decided to withdraw its deposits from Beirut, causing a panic and a run on Intra's capital, beginning on 9 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackey|2009|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lebanese élites, perhaps sensing a unique opportunity to cut Beidas down and strip him off his key infrastructural investments in Lebanon, refused to budge, or consider Beidas request for a $30&amp;nbsp;million bridging loan to tide Intra over the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; aside from a minor loan mortgaged on the casino, the Port Authority and the Airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Oghourlian, deputy governor of Lebanon's central bank, asked him: "Why did you invest in Lebanon? You are not Lebanese, and Lebanon does not want you to control its economy". before turning his plea for a bridging loan down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackey|2009|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Beidas's recollection, [[Raymond Eddé]], president of the Lebanese Bankers Association, had a personal hatred for him,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betts|1979|p=132}}:'As scion of one of the great Maronite Catholic families in Lebanon, Idda was bound to resent the phenomenal success of Baydas, a Palestinian-born Greek Orthodox (with his) English, Protestant education (Saint George's Anglican School, Jerusalem),'&lt;/ref&gt; shared by the President of Lebanon himself, [[Abdallah El-Yafi]], who was annoyed that Beidas had denied him a personal loan, also pressured the Central Bank to turn down his loan request.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan]] also stepped in by freezing Intra's New York deposits until its own loans to the company were repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though ranked 425th among the world's banks, the subsequent collapse of Intra became, 'the world's greatest bank catastrophe since World War 2.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naylor|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese bankers stated at the time that the crack was simply due to the fact that Beidas was overextended. Many European bankers and the [[International Monetary Fund]] were to disagree, saying that a small loan from [[Banque du Liban|Lebanon’s Central Bank]] would have enabled Intra to ride out the crisis without strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision not to intervene was to have drastically averse collateral impact on Lebanon's other banks, as local depositors withdrew their money to open up accounts in US banks. In addition, El-Yafi was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Carvalho|1967|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arab trust in the Lebanese banking system vanished, and investors thereafter preferred to place their funds in Zürich, London and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2013|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership was turned over to the bank's largest depositors and it was to remain the largest financial institution in Lebanon for the following two and a half decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackey|2009|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Anthony Sampson]] many of Beidas' business investments turned out in the long term to be very shrewd.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2013|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about the collapse==
It was widely believed at the time of the crash that the fall of Beidas and his banking empire was politically inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Owen|Pamuk|1998|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many conspiracy theories circulate about the basic reasons for the bank's collapse and the destruction of Baydas's empire. Some pinpoint its cause on a coalition of Western powers, oil-rich Arab countries, the Israeli Defense establishment, and Lebanese oligarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kumar|2012|p=222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others cite the Corsican connection, noting that the FBI believed that [[Marcel Francisci]] used the gaming tables at the casino to launder profits from drug-running, and attributing a significant role in the unplugging of the Bank to [[Paul-Louis Weiller]], claiming that the financier had connections with the heroin smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Valentine|2004|p=406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian reporter and author [[Said Aburish]] claims that jealous Lebanese business people, bankers and reporters were behind the demise of the bank. He writes that the rumors that doomed the bank started in the St. George hotel by, among others, a Lebanese whom Beidas refused to appoint to the bank's board and another Lebanese man who owed the bank a big loan. Aburish claims that, when the news of the failure of the bank became known, Lebanese reporters and business people celebrated its failure by drinking champagne in the [[St. Georges Hotel, Beirut|St. George Hotel]].

As to the role of the Kuwaitis in the failure of the bank, Aburish claims that Beidas treated the [[Emir of Kuwait]] disrespectfully which made Kuwaitis and other Arab countries in the [[Persian Gulf]] area remove their money from the bank. [[Wilbur Crane Eveland]] in his book ''Ropes of Sand'' claimed that Kuwait caused the failure of the bank in an effort to induce Lebanon to accept more Palestinian refugees: "When Kuwait made huge withdrawals from Lebanon's Intra bank (to induce the country to accept more Palestinian refugees) the bank failed, and the collapse of the Lebanese economy was barely forestalled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eveland|1980|p=328}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Najib Alamuddin wrote in his autobiography ''The Flying Sheikh'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am convinced the affair was the beginning of the disintegration of Lebanon and its old type of Lebanese government - a system corrupt in style and morals that had plagued Lebanon since independence and finally plunged the nation into a civil war that threatened its very survival as an independent state."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alamuddin|1989|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edward Said]] had a slightly different take on the events in his autobiography ''Out of Place'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Beidas' astounding rise and fall was considered by some to presage the terrible Lebanese-Palestinian disputes of the seventies, but it seemed to me to symbolize the broken trajectory imposed on so many of [the Palestinians] by the events of 1948"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Said|2013|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
