      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5458">The '''1835 Paterson textile strike''' took place in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], involved more than 2,000 workers from 20 textile mills across the city. The strikers, many of whom were children and of [[Ireland|Irish]] descent, were seeking a reduction in daily working hours from thirteen and a half hours to eleven hours. Support from other workers in Paterson and nearby cities allowed the strikers to sustain their efforts for two weeks. Employers refused to negotiate with the workers, and were able to break the strike by unilaterally declaring a reduction in work hours to twelve hours daily during the week and nine hours on Saturdays. Many leaders of the strike and their family were blacklisted by employers in Paterson after it ended.

==Background==
As the [[Industrial Revolution]] got under way, the 1830s were a time of significant labor unrest in the [[United States]]. Workers throughout the country had over the previous decade sought to secure shorter working days and higher wages, but many of these efforts and strikes failed. The famous but unsuccessful 1834 [[Lowell Mill Girls#Strikes of 1834 and 1836|Lowell Mill strikes]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], had garnered widespread public attention and were followed closely by workers in other mill towns. In 1835, construction workers in [[Boston]] struck seeking shorter hours. This strike failed as well, despite support from unionists in a number of other cities including [[Philadelphia]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. Inspired by Boston, workers in a number of trades in Philadelphia began a campaign to secure a ten-hour day, and after receiving support from professionals in the city, were almost universally successful.&lt;ref name="perlman"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Perlman | first = Selig | title = A History of Trade Unionism in the United States | publisher = Echo Library | year = 2006 | pages = 16–17 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5vLxycFvEQYC&amp;dq=1835+paterson+strike+%22new+jersey%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 1-84702-443-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike==
Workers in Paterson hoped to achieve similar success to those in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="perlman"/&gt; Just before [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], they began a strike demanding shorter hours. They also demanded an end to the use of fines to enforce discipline in the mills, wage withholding, and the [[company store]] system in the town. In support of the strikers, an organization called the Paterson Association for the Protection of the Working Class was established. They also received monetary support from workers in Newark and [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="roed"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Roediger, David R.  |author2=Foner, Philip Sheldon | title = Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the Working Day | publisher = Verso | year = 1989 | pages = 35–36 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h8P-uuyYe_YC&amp;dq=1835+paterson+strike+%22new+jersey%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 0-86091-963-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strikers were mainly children, mainly female,&lt;ref name="roed"/&gt; and many of them were of Irish descent. Due to this last fact, debate around the strike quickly became infused with nativist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, especially from the ''Lowell Intelligencer'', a pro-management newspaper.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Quinn | first = Dermott | title = The Irish in New Jersey | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XPrxLlLBdkYC&amp;dq=1835+paterson+strike+%22new+jersey%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 0-8135-3421-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management refused to meet with the strikers, and as a result workers at other mills began to walk out and join in.&lt;ref name="roed"/&gt; At its peak, 2000 workers from 20 mills were participating in the strike. In response, employers reduced hours, not to eleven as the strikers wanted, but to twelve on weekdays and nine on Saturday. This reduction broke the strike, and most of the workers returned to the mills.&lt;ref name="perlman"/&gt; A few strikers continued to hold out for an eleven-hour day, but unsuccessfully. Strike leaders and their families were permanently barred from employment in Paterson, having been blacklisted by the mill owners. Although the strike was broken, it achieved a significant reduction in work hours. According to historians David Roediger and Philip Foner, "...the strike, which added a dozen hours to each worker's weekly leisure, must have been counted a success by the children initiating it."&lt;ref name="roed"/&gt;

'''A/S Københavns Telefonkiosker''' (old spelling: A/S Kjøbenhavns Telefonkiosker), often referred to as '''KTK''', was an operator of staffed telephone kiosks in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The '''first telephone kiosks''' were installed in 1896 to an [[Art Nouveau]]-influenced [[Romantic Nationalism|National Romantic]] design by [[Fritz Koch]]. A new and somewhat larger model was introduced in 1913 but Koch's original design was again used when a number of new telephone kiosks were installed in 1929.

Eight of the telephone kiosks have survived and most of them are now used as café pavilions. One of Koch's telephone kiosks, located at [[Poul Henningsens Plads]] in [[Østerbro]], was [[Listed buildings in Copenhagen|listed]] in 1996. Another one has been moved to Gabels Torv in [[Aalborg]].

==History==

===The first 10 kiosks===
[[File:Fritz Koch - telefonkiosk opstalt 1895.png|thumb|150px|Fritz Koch rendering from 1895]]
The first telephone company in Copenhagen was established in 1877 and came and [[TDC A/S|Københavns Telefonselskab]] (KTAS) was founded in 1882. In 1989, it still only had 1,487 out of a population of more than 250,000 in the city. The need for public telephones was therefore evident.&lt;ref name="PT-Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptt-museum.dk/museumsposten/tidligere_artikler/telefoni/?id=92/|title=Telefonkiosken - og telefonens folkelige gennembrud|language=Danish|publisher=Post &amp; Tele Museum Danmark|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On 3 September 1895, A/S Kjøbenhavns Telefonkiosker obtained a concession from the city magistrate on the installation and operation of up to 15 telephone kiosks in a 15-year period in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frederiksbergshistorie.dk/frederiksbergeren/telefonkioske
|title=Frederiksbergs telefonkioskerlanguage=Danish|publisher=Historisk-Topografisk Selskab for Frederiksberg|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbas.net/arkivskaber.php?id=3171|title=A/S Københavns Telefonkiosker |language=Danish|publisher=SelKøbenhavns Stadsarkiv|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plakat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danskplakatkunst.dk/plakater/reklamer/festtelegrammer|title=Festtelegrammer (1926)|language=Danish|publisher=Dansk Plakatkunst|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kjøbenhavns Telefonkiosker - vejledning (1898).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Instructions from one of the telephone kiosks]]
Fritz Koch, an assistant for city architect [[Ludvig Fenger]], was charged with the design of the new kiosks. The first four kiosks opened at [[Kongens Nytorv]], [[Gammeltorv]], [[Nørre Voldgade|Nørre Boulevard]] (now Nørre Voldgade) and the City Hall Square on 1 June 1906. They were followed by kiosks at Gyldenløvesgade, [[Grønningen, Copenhagen|Grønningen]], [[Vesterbros Torv]], [[Sølvgade|Sølvtorvet]], [[Dronning Louises Bro]] and [[Sankt Annæ Plads]] later that same year. bringing the total number of telephone kiosks up to 10. Another one, located at Lille Triangel in

[[Østerbro]], opened in 1897 but then the construction stopped. 
[[File:Festtelegrammer (1926).jpg|thumb|150px|Advertisement poster by [[Sven Henriksen]] for [[telegraphy|greeting telegram]]s from A/S Københavns Telefonkiosker by way of bicycle messenger]]
The inspiration for the kiosks came from Paris. They were open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and each kiosk contained two telephones. The kiosk lady also sold a wide selection of kiosk items such as newspapers and magazines, stamps, theatre tickets and even insurance policies. It was also possible to call the telephone kiosk to leave a message with the kiosk lady which she would then send to the recipient by bicycle messenger.

===More kiosks and a new design===
Fritz Koch died in 1905. Another architect, Martin Jensen, created a design for new and somewhat larger telephone kiosks in 1913. They replaced many of Koch's kiosks and were also built in a number of new locations. The new design was criticized and in 1929m when the company once again wanted to install new telephone kiosks, the city required them to be built to the old design. In 1932, Curt Bie from the city architect's office created a Functionalist design for new kiosks. A total of 30 telephone kiosks were built.

The telephone kiosks gradually lost their raison d'être as private telephones became common. Many of the kiosks were removed in connection with road expansions or redesign of public spaces.

KTK was for many years based at the City Hall Square. It later moved to the Enghave Center at Mathæusgade in Vesterbro. It was dissolved in 1980.

==Design==
Koch's original telephone kiosks are nine metres tall, hexagonal and with a floor area of approximately nine square metres. They are constructed in pine wood on a granite plinth. The copper roof is topped by a triangular [[flèche]] with clock faces on all sides.&lt;ref name=Plakat/&gt; Just below the roof are six teak tree reliefs, one on each side, featuring the 12 [[astrological sign]]. Above the reliefs is a frieze with symbolic representations of shipping (ships), industry (tools), (then) modern technology (telephoning gentlemen) and agriculture (animals and plants).

Jensen's telephone kiosks from 1913 are designed in the [[Baroque Revival style|Neo-Baroque]] style. They are also hexagonal and topped by a copper roof but somewhat larger.

==Legacy==
Most of the surviving telephone kiosks are now used as café pavilions. The telephone kiosk at Jagtvej/Poul Henningsens Plads is the only one of Koch's ten original kiosks that still stands in its original location. The kiosk from Sølvtorvet was moved to the "museum street" next to [[Museum of Copenhagen]] in Absalonsgade. The one from Lille Triangel was acquired by [[Nordjullands Kunstmuseum]] and was in 2010 rebuilt in Gabels Torv in [[Aalborg]]. The kiosks from Enghave Plads and Gammeltorv were acquired by [[Tivoli Gardens]] and at least one of them have been rebuilt in the historic gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/kko/t/kko_t-4.html|title=Telefonkiosker|language=Danish|publisher=Selskabet for Københavns Historie|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1929 version of Koch telephone kiosks have survived in [[Kultorvet]] [[Christianshavns Torv]] and [[Sankt Hans Torv]].

Jensen's telephone kiosks from 1913 are still seen in [[Nytorv]], [[Kongens Nytorv]] and [[Nørre Voldgade]] but the two latter have been moved a little in connection with a redesign of the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teknologihistorie.dk/2010/04/telefonkiosk-fra-lille-triangel-til-gabels-torv-i-aalborg/|title=Telefonkiosk fra Lille Triangel til Gabels Torv i Aalborg|language=Danish|publisher=Dansk teknologihistorisk Selskab|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Affranchi''' ({{IPA-fr|afʁɑ̃ʃi|lang}}) is a former [[French language|French]] legal term denoting a [[freedman]] or [[Abolitionism|emancipated]] [[slave]], but was a term used to refer pejoratively to [[mulatto]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BN_49ho6AKkC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=haitian+contredanse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=esqV1hG-WK&amp;sig=mpNZrcVHPOM0on10M5LGqklzWEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NcYoU83wJMvHkAem9IH4CQ&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=haitian%20contredanse&amp;f=false |title=Caribbean and Atlantic Diaspora Dance: Igniting Citizenship |accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in English to describe the class of freedmen in [[Saint-Domingue]] and other slave-holding French territories, who held legal rights intermediate between those of free whites and enslaved Africans. In Saint-Domingue, roughly half of the ''affranchis'' were ''[[gens de couleur libres]]'' (free people of color; ''Mulatto'') and the other half African slaves.

The term is derived from the French word for emancipation — ''affranchissement'', or enfranchisement in terms of political rights. But, the ''affranchis'' were barred from the franchise (voting) prior to a 1791 court case following the [[French Revolution]]. The decision in their favor prompted a backlash from the French white [[planter class]] on Saint-Domingue, who also exerted power in France. These elements contributed to the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]].

The ''affranchis'' had legal and social advantages over [[Slavery|enslaved]] Africans. They became a distinct class in the society between whites and slaves.  They could get some education, were able to own land, and could attend some French colonial entertainments. Planters who took slave women or free women of color as concubines often sent their sons to France for education and, in some cases, to enter the military. They were more likely to settle property on them as well. Because of such property and class issues, some free men of color considered themselves to have status above that of the ''petits blancs'', shopkeepers and workers. Nonetheless, the latter had more political rights in the colony until after the Revolution.

The colonists passed so many restrictions that the ''affranchis'' were limited as a separate caste: they could not vote or hold colonial administrative posts, or work in professional careers as doctors or lawyers. There were sumptuary laws: the free people of color were forbidden to wear the style of clothes favored by the wealthy white colonists. In spite of the disadvantages, many educated ''affranchis'' identified culturally with France rather than with the enslaved population.  A class in between, the free people of color sometimes had tensions with both whites and enslaved Africans.

Ambitious mulattoes worked to gain acceptance from the white colonists who held power in that society. As they advanced in society, ''affranchis'' often also held land and slaves. Some acted as creditors for planters.  One of their leaders in the late 18th century, [[Julien Raimond]], an [[indigofera|indigo]] planter, claimed that ''affranchis'' owned a third of all the slaves in the [[colony]] at that time.  In the early years of the [[French Revolution]] and [[Haitian Revolution]], many gens de couleur were committed to maintaining the institution of slavery. They wanted political equality based on class - that is, extended for men of property, regardless of skin color.

'''Afro-Romanians''' are [[black people]] and people of African descent, who have migrated to and settled in [[Romania]]. Population of Afro-Romanians is rather insignificant and mostly concentrated in major cities of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/special/studenti-straini-in-romania-508497.html|title=Studenţi străini în România|publisher=[[Jurnalul Național]]|date=22 May 2009|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africans have been immigrating to Romania since the [[National Communism in Romania|Communist Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarulfinanciar.ro/articol/epoca-de-aur-a-prieteniei-romano-arabe-cati-bani-avea-de-recuperat-ceausescu-din-orientul-mijlociu/|title=Epoca de Aur a prieteniei româno-arabe: Câți bani avea de recuperat Ceaușescu din Orientul Mijlociu|publisher=Adevărul Financiar|date=25 September 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of African-Romanians are not purely black, but they are [[mulatto]]es. They are usually the children of a Romanian parent that mixed with a former student in Romania that came from Africa.

{{Aztecbox}}
The ancient [[Aztecs]] employed a variety of [[entheogen]]ic plants and animals within their society. The various species have been identified through their depiction on murals, vases, and other objects. The plants used include [[ololiuqui]] (''[[Rivea corymbosa]]''), [[teonanácatl]] (''[[Psilocybe]] spp.''), [[sinicuichi]] (''[[Heimia salicifolia]]''), [[toloatzin]] (''[[Datura]] spp.''), [[Peyote|peyotl]] (''[[Lophophora williamsii]]'') and many others.

== History ==
There are many pieces of archaeological evidence in reference to the use of entheogens early in the history of [[Mesoamerica]]. [[Olmec]] burial sites with remains of the Bufo toad (''[[Bufo marinus]]''), [[Maya civilization|Maya]] mushroom effigies,{{Dubious|date=March 2009}} and [[Spain|Spanish]] writings all point to a heavy involvement with [[psychoactive]] substances in the [[Aztec]] lifestyle.

The [[Florentine codex]] contains multiple references to the use of psychoactive plants among the [[Aztecs]].  The 11th book of the series contains identifications of five plant [[entheogen]]s.  [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Richard Evans Schultes]], and [[Albert Hofmann]] have suggested that the statue of [[Xochipilli]], the Aztec 'Prince of Flowers,' contains effigies of a number of plant based [[entheogens]].

The plants were primarily used by the priests, or ''tlamacazqui'', other nobility, and visiting dignitaries.  They would use them for [[divination]] much as the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] groups of central [[Mexico]] do today.  The priests would also ingest the entheogens to engage in [[prophecy]], interpret [[Vision (religion)|visions]], and heal.

== Ololiuqui and Tlitliltzin ==
[[Ololiuqui]] (Coatl xoxouhqui) was identified as [[Rivea corymbosa]] in 1941 by [[Richard Evans Schultes]]. The name [[Ololiuqui]] refers to the brown seeds of the [[Rivea corymbosa]] (Morning Glory) plant.
[[Tlitliltzin]] was identified later as being [[Ipomoea violacea]] by [[R. Gordon Wasson]]. This variation contains black seeds and usually has bluish hued flowers.

The seeds of these plants contain the psychoactive [[Lysergic acid amide|d-lysergic acid amide]], or LSA. The preparation of the seeds involved grinding them on a ''[[metate]]'', then filtering them with water to extract the alkaloids. The resulting brew was then drunk to bring forth visions.

The [[Florentine Codex]] Book 11 describes the [[Ololiuqui]] intoxication:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It makes one besotted; it deranges one, troubles one, maddens one, makes one possessed.  He who eats it, who drinks it, sees many things which greatly terrify him.  He is really frightened [by the] poisonous serpent which he sees for that reason.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[morning glory]] was also utilized in healing rituals by the ''ticitl''.  The ''ticitl'' would often take [[ololiuqui]] to determine the cause of diseases and illness.  It was also used as an [[anesthetic]] to ease pain by creating a paste from the seeds and [[tobacco]] leaf, then rubbing it on the affected body part.

== Mushrooms ==
Called "Teonanácatl" in Nahuatl (literally "god mushroom"—compound of the words ''teo(tl)'' (god) and ''nanácatl'' (mushroom))—the mushroom genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'' has a long history of use within Mesoamerica. The members of the Aztec upper class would often take ''teonanácatl'' at festivals and other large gatherings.  According to [[Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc]], it was often a difficult task to procure mushrooms.  They were quite costly as well as very difficult to locate, requiring all-night searches.

Both Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and Fray [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]] describe the use of the mushrooms.  The Aztecs would drink [[chocolate]] and eat the mushrooms with [[honey]].  Those partaking in the mushroom ceremonies would [[Fasting|fast]] before ingesting the [[sacrament]]. The act of taking mushrooms is known as ''monanacahuia,'' meaning to "mushroom oneself".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the very first, mushrooms had been served...They ate no more food; they only drank chocolate during the night. And they ate the mushrooms with honey. When the mushrooms took effect on them, then they danced, then they wept.  But some, while still in command of their senses, entered and sat there by the house on their seats; they did no more, but only sat there nodding.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some written observations under the influence of the doctrine of Catholicism account the use of the mushroom among the [[Moctezuma I|Montezumanic]] people. Allegedly - during the emperor's coronation ceremony, many prisoners were sacrificed, had their flesh eaten, and their hearts removed.  Those who were invited guests to the feast ate mushrooms, which [[Diego Durán]] describes as causing those who ate them to go insane and many to take their lives.

== Sinicuichi ==
Not much is known of the use of [[sinicuichi]] (alternate spelling sinicuiche) among the [[Aztecs]]. [[R. Gordon Wasson]] identified the flower on the statue of [[Xochipilli]] and suggested from its placement with other entheogens that it was probably used in a ritualistic context.  Multiple alkaloids have been isolated from the plant; with [[cryogenine]], [[lythrine]], and [[nesodine]] being the most important.

[[Sinicuichi]] could be the plant ''tonatiuh yxiuh'' "the herb of the sun" from the [[Aztec Herbal of 1552]]. ''tonatiuh'' means sun.  This is interesting because today in Central and South America, [[sinicuichi]] is often called ''abre-o-sol,'' or the "sun opener." ''Tonatiuh yxiuh'' is described as being a summer blooming plant, as is [[Heimia]].

The Herbal also includes a recipe for a potion to conquer fear. It reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let one who is fear-burdened take as a drink a potion made of the herb ''tonatiuh yxiuh'' which throws out the brightness of gold.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the effects of [[sinicuichi]] is that it adds a golden halo or tinge to objects when ingested.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Tlapatl and Mixitl ==
''[[Tlapatl]]'' and ''[[mixitl]]'' are both ''[[Datura]]'' species, ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and ''[[Datura innoxia]]'', with strong hallucinogenic qualities. The plants typically have large, white or purple hued, trumpet-shaped flowers and spiny seeds pods.  The active alkaloids are [[atropine]], [[scopolamine]], and [[hyoscyamine]].

The use of [[datura]] spans millennia.  It has been employed by both many indigenous groups in North, Central, and South America for a variety of uses. Called ''[[toloache]]'' today in Mexico, [[datura]] species were used among the [[Aztec]] for medicine, divination, and malevolent purposes.

For healing, ''tlapatl'' was made into an ointment which was spread over infected areas to cure [[gout]], as well as applied as a local anesthetic. The plants were also utilized to cause harm to others.  For example, it was believed that ''mixitl'' would cause a being to become paralyzed and mute, while ''tlapatl'' will cause those who take it to be disturbed and go mad.

== Peyote ==
The cactus known as ''[[peyotl]]'', or more commonly peyote (''[[Lophophora williamsii]]''), has a rich history of use in [[Mesoamerica]].  Its use in northern [[Mexico]] among the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] has been written about extensively.   It is thought that since [[peyote]] only grows in certain regions of [[Mexico]], the [[Aztecs]] would receive dried buttons through long-distance trade. Peyote was viewed as being a protective plant by the [[Aztec]]. Sahagún suggested that the plant is what allowed the [[Aztec]] warriors to fight as they did.

== Pipiltzintzintli ==
[[R. Gordon Wasson]] has posited that the plant known as ''pipiltzintzintli'' is in fact ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''.  It is not entirely known whether or not this plant was used by the [[Aztecs]] as a [[psychotropic]], but [[Jonathan Ott]] (1996) argues that although there are competing species for the identification of ''pipiltzintzintli'', ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' is probably the "best bet."  There are references to use of ''pipiltzintzintli'' in [[Spain|Spanish]] arrest records from the conquest, as well as a reference to the mixing of ''[[ololiuqui]]'' with ''pipiltzintzintli''.

Contemporaneously, the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]], meaning "people of the deer" in [[Nahuatl]], from the [[Oaxaca]] region of [[Mexico]] utilize ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' when ''[[Psilocybin mushrooms|Psilocybe]] spp.'' mushrooms are not readily available.  They chew and swallow the leaves of fresh salvia to enter into a shamanic state of consciousness.  The [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] use the plant in both divination and healing ceremonies, perhaps as the Aztecs did 500 years ago.  Modern users of Salvia have adapted the traditional method, forgoing the swallowing of juices due to [[Salvinorin A]] being readily absorbed by the mucous membranes of the mouth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10463">The '''Blue Diamond Affair''' is a series of unresolved crimes and embittered diplomatic relations triggered by the 1989 theft of gems belonging to the [[House of Saud]] by a Thai employee. The affair has soured relations between [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Thailand]] for nearly 30 years.&lt;ref name=Time_2010-03-07&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shay|first1=Christopher|title=Thailand's Blue Diamond Heist: Still a Sore Point|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1969920,00.html|accessdate=14 Feb 2015|work=Time|date=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft==
In 1989, Kriangkrai Techamong, a Thai worker, stole jewellery and other valuable gems from the palace of Prince [[Faisal bin Fahd]], where he was employed as a servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/saudi-gems-theft-leaves-deadly-trail-in-thailand-1450865.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Terry | last=Mccarthy | date=25 September 1994 | title=Saudi gems theft leaves deadly trail in Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kriangkrai had access to the prince's bedroom and hid the stolen jewellery in a vacuum cleaner bag at the palace. It included a valuable [[Diamond color|blue diamond]] and other gems, which Kriangkrai then shipped to his home in [[Lampang Province]], Thailand.

==Recovery==
A [[Royal Thai Police]] investigation by a team headed by [[Lieutenant-General]] Chalor Kerdthes led to Kriangkrai's arrest and the recovery of most of the stolen jewellery. Kriangkai was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was released after three years as he cooperated with the police and had confessed.

Lieutenant-General Chalor's team flew to Saudi Arabia to return the stolen items. However, the [[Saudi Arabian]] authorities discovered that the blue diamond was missing and that about half of the gems returned were fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Thai police: A law unto themselves|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11058580|accessdate=14 Feb 2015|work=The Economist|date=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=URoyalty&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blue Diamond Affair|url=http://www.unofficialroyalty.com/the-blue-diamond-affair/|website=Unofficial Royalty|accessdate=14 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangkok, rumors spread in the local press that charity gala photos captured a number of government wives wearing diamond necklaces resembling those stolen from the palace. This fueled Saudi suspicions that Thai police and VIPs had taken the jewels for themselves.&lt;ref name="Vice-20151002"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ramsey |first1=Adam |title=Assassinations, Curses, and Stolen Jewels: The 'Blue Diamond Affair' Is Still Darkening Saudi-Thai Relations |url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/zm74k3/assassinations-curses-and-stolen-jewels-the-blue-diamond-affair-is-still-darkening-saudi-thai-relations |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=Vice News |date=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Mohammad al-Ruwaili, a Saudi Arabian businessman close to the Saudi royal family, traveled to Bangkok to investigate on his own. He went missing on 12 February 1990 and is presumed to have been murdered.&lt;ref name="BP-20160504"&gt;{{cite news|title=Court stands by ex-policeman's acquittal|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/958289/court-stands-by-ex-policemans-acquittal|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days prior to his disappearance, three officials from the Saudi Embassy had been shot dead in Bangkok.&lt;ref name=ArabNews_2014-07-04&gt;{{cite news |last1=Al-Ruwaili |first1=Mohammed |title=Thai Blue Diamond Affair: Kingdom demands justice |url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/596436 |accessdate=14 February 2015 |work=Arab News |date=2014-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QrFOAmIh?url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/596436 |archivedate=2014-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The murders remain unsolved,&lt;ref name=McClincy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClincy|first1=Meghan A.|title=A Blue Thai Affair: The Blue Diamond Affair's Illustration of the Royal Thai Police Force's Standards of Corruption|journal=Penn State Journal of Law &amp; International Affairs|date=Apr 2012|volume=1|issue=1|page=185|url=http://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=jlia|accessdate=14 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no connection to the jewelry theft has been established, despite the Saudi government's view "...that the Thai government had not done enough to resolve the mystery surrounding Al-Ruwaili's assassination and that of three other Saudi diplomats."&lt;ref name=ArabNews_2014-07-04 /&gt;

Lieutenant-General Chalor was later charged and convicted of ordering the 1995 murder of the wife and son of a gem dealer allegedly involved in the affair, and he was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_769515"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411366/769515 |title=Thai cop convicted of Saudi gem theft |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=21 Sep 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519133121/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411366/769515 |archivedate=May 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thai Supreme Court upheld the judgement and sentenced Chalor to death on 16 October 2009. However, Chalor's sentence was reduced to fifty years imprisonment by King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] on the King's 84th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laohong|first1=King-oua|title=Saudi gem killer Chalor freed|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/lite/topstories/376533/chalor-kerdthes-leaves-prison|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=14 Feb 2015|date=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six other policemen were also convicted of involvement in the murders. One of those involved, Police Lieutenant-Colonel Pansak Mongkolsilp, was sentenced in 2002 to life in prison. The term was upheld on appeal in 2005, but he was released in 2012.&lt;ref name="BP-20181012"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ngamkham |first1=Wassayos |title=Ex-cop linked to Saudi gems case held in slaying |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1557062/ex-cop-linked-to-saudi-gems-case-held-in-slaying?utm_source=enewsletter_alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=news |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic and economic repercussions==
{{see also|Saudi Arabia–Thailand relations}}
Relations between the two countries worsened further following the murders. Saudi Arabia stopped issuing work visas for Thais and discouraged its own citizens from visiting Bangkok. Diplomatic missions were downgraded to the ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' level.&lt;ref name="NYT-19940919"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shenon |first1=Philip |title=Saudi Envoy Helps Expose a Thai Crime Group: The Police |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/world/saudi-envoy-helps-expose-a-thai-crime-group-the-police.html |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=New York Times |date=1994-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Thais working in Saudi Arabia fell from 150,000-200,000 in 1989 to just 10,000 in 2008. The cost to Thailand was about 200 billion baht in remittances, as fewer Thai workers were permitted to work in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Foreign Minister to reopen Saudi gems scandal case|url=http://mathaba.net/MNN/www.2thailand.net/x.htm?http://mathaba.net/MNN/www.2thailand.net/item/?x=584487|website=2Thailand.net|publisher=Mathaba|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=14 Feb 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214163919/http://mathaba.net/MNN/www.2thailand.net/x.htm?http%3A%2F%2Fmathaba.net%2FMNN%2Fwww.2thailand.net%2Fitem%2F%3Fx=584487|archivedate=2015-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On 17 March 2016 Kriangkrai Techamong, then 65, told reporters at his home in Lampang that he would become a monk for the remainder of his life to repent for his dishonest actions. He had spent nearly five years in Thai prisons for his theft. Kriangkrai said he believes the missing Blue Diamond is cursed and said its theft had brought a series of calamities on himself and his family.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Chalor Kerdthes was granted a royal pardon and was released in August 2015. He was present at Kriangkrai's ordination ceremony.&lt;ref name="KSE-20160317"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charuvastra|first1=Teeranai|title=Man Behind Saudi Diamond Heist Ordained ‘For Life’|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/detail.php?newsid=1458202742&amp;section=11|accessdate=27 March 2016|work=Khaosod English|date=2016-03-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407190856/http://www.khaosodenglish.com/detail.php?newsid=1458202742&amp;section=11|archivedate=2016-04-07}}&lt;!--http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2016/03/17/1458202742/--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25553">[[File:Quadracycling15Jul07.jpg|thumb|A [[quadracycle]] parked on a [[Canada|Canadian]] urban street amongst the cars]]

The '''car-free movement''' is a broad, informal, emergent network of individuals and organizations including social activists, [[urban planner]]s, [[transportation engineer]]s and others, brought together by a shared belief that large and/or high-speed [[motorized vehicle]]s (cars, trucks, tractor units, motorcycles, ...)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcarfree.net/greenpages/index.php?searchnow=1 Car free movement opposing not only cars but many motorized vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; are too dominant in most modern cities.  The goal of the movement is to create places where motorized vehicle use is greatly reduced or eliminated, to convert road and [[parking space]] to other public uses and to rebuild compact [[urban environment]]s where most destinations are within easy reach by other means, including [[walking]], [[cycling]], [[personal transporter]]s, low impact vehicles such as [[golf cart]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, [[kei car]]s and [[heavy quadricycle|quadricycle]]s, [[mobility as a service]] or [[public transport]].&lt;ref name=zehner2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=London|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
Before the twentieth century, cities and towns were normally compact, containing narrow streets busy with human activity. In the early twentieth century, many of these settlements were adapted to accommodate the car with wider roads, more car [[parking space]]s, and lower [[population densities]] with space between urban buildings reserved for automotive use.&lt;ref name=zehner2012 /&gt; Lower population densities meant [[urban sprawl]] with longer distances between places.  The low cost of use brought [[traffic congestion]] which made older transport unattractive or impractical, and created the conditions for more traffic and sprawl; the car system was "increasingly able to 'drive' out competitors, such as feet, bikes, buses and trains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/sociology/cemore/word%20docs/urry-systemofautomobility.pdf
 | title=The ‘System’ of Automobility|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-12
 | author=John Urry|publisher=University of Lancacaster}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process led to changes in urban form and living patterns that offered little opportunity for people without a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racfoundation.org/files/Transport_and_Social_Exclusion.pdf |format=PDF
 |title=Transport and Social Exclusion – a survey of the G7 nations: FIA Foundation and RAC Foundation
 |date=2004-02-01 |accessdate=2008-01-12

Some governments have responded with policies and regulations aimed at reversing [[auto dependency]] by increasing urban densities, encouraging mixed use development and [[infill]], reducing space allocated to private cars, increasing [[walkability]], supporting [[cycling]] and other alternative vehicles similar in size and speed, and [[public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/|title=Sustainable travel|publisher=UK Department for Transport|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally cities are planning to increase their public transport and non-motorized transport modal shares and shift away from private transport oriented development. Cities like Hong Kong developed a highly integrated public transportation system which effectively reduced the use of private transport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesnow.in/blog/2015/07/09/step-out-of-your-cars-to-embrace-your-city/ Step out of your cars to embrace your cities | Cities Now] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923151042/http://citiesnow.in/blog/2015/07/09/step-out-of-your-cars-to-embrace-your-city/ |date=September 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with private automotive travel, [[car sharing]], where people can easily rent a car for a few hours rather than own one, is emerging as an increasingly important element for urban transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfit.gov.uk/mf/reports/carclubs/conclusions/index.htm |title=Car Clubs / Car Sharing Research Project - Motorists' Forum Conclusions and Recommendations |publisher=UK Commission for integrated transport |accessdate=2008-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126212458/http://www.cfit.gov.uk/mf/reports/carclubs/conclusions/index.htm |archivedate=2008-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban design==
Proponents of the car-free movement focus on both [[sustainable transportation]] options and on [[urban design]], [[zoning]], school placement policies, [[urban agriculture]], [[telecommuting]] options, and housing developments that create proximity or access so that long distance transportation becomes less of a requirement of daily life.

[[New urbanism]] is an American [[urban design]] movement that arose in the early 1980s. Its goal has been to reform all aspects of [[real estate development]] and [[urban planning]], from urban retrofits to [[suburban infill]]. New urbanist [[neighborhoods]] are designed to contain a diverse range of [[houses|housing]] and [[employment|jobs]], and to be [[walkable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newurbanism.org/|title=New Urbanism|publisher=New Urbanism.org|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, more auto-oriented cities are also making incremental changes to provide transportation alternatives through [[Complete streets]] improvements.

World Squares for all is a scheme to remove much of the traffic from major squares in London, including [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Parliament Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/parliament_square/wsfa.jsp |title=World Squares for All |publisher=The Mayor of London |accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808152752/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/parliament_square/wsfa.jsp |archivedate=2007-08-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carfree city|Car-free cities]] are, as the name implies entire cities (or at least the inner parts therof) which have been made entirely car-free.

[[Car-free zone]]s are area of a city or town where use of cars is prohibited or greatly restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1525727,00.html|title=Paris bans cars to make way for central pedestrian zone|date=2005-03-15|accessdate=2008-01-13|author=Charles Bremner|work=[[The Times]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Living street]]s and [[complete streets]] provide for the needs of car drivers secondarily to the needs of users of the street as a whole. They are designed to be shared by pedestrians, playing children, bicyclists, and low-speed motor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban.nl/childstreet2005/downloads/Concept%20Development%20woonerf.pdf |title=Concept Development: ‘Woonerf’ |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |publisher=The International Institute for the Urban Environment |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011111507/http://www.urban.nl/childstreet2005/downloads/Concept%20Development%20woonerf.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amsterdam outline S-roads - S100.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[ring road]] around Amsterdam (shown in red). At exits of ring roads such as this, distribution centers can be set up.]]
[[Distribution center]]s help reduce the need to keep buildings such as warehouses in city centers accessible by [[Tractor unit]]s.  They allow the tractor units to unload their cargo in the suburban distribution center.  The products are then placed in a [[Truck|small truck]] (sometimes electrically powered&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citydepot.be/pers City depot employing a few electric trucks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912125855/http://www.citydepot.be/pers |date=September 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[freight bicycle]], ... to bridge the [[last mile (transportation)]] to the warehouse.  Besides offering advantages to the population (increased safety due to truck drivers having less [[Blind spot (vehicle)|blind spots]]), reduced noise/traffic, reduced tailpipe emissions, ...) it also offers financial advantage for the companies, as tractor units require a lot of time to bridge this last mile (they lack agility and consume much fuel in congested streets). 

At the outskirts of towns, between the exits of the rings roads, and the car-free zones in the city center themselves, additional car parking lots can be added, generally in the form of underground car parks (to avoid it taking up surface space).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150423043244/http://www.dewereldmorgen.be/artikel/2014/11/26/brusselaars-tegen-nieuw-verkeersplan-binnenstad Plan to make Brussels car-free includes new underground parking spaces]&lt;/ref&gt; Careful placement of these car-parking lots is needed though, ensuring that they are made far enough from the city centers (and closer to the ring roads) to avoid them attracting more cars to the city center. In some instances, near these car parking lotss, [[Park and ride|public transport]] (i.e. bus) stops are foreseen, or [[Park and ride#Bike and ride|bicycle-sharing services]] are present.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Community bicycle program]]s provide bicycles within an urban environment for short term use. The first successful scheme was in the 1960s in Amsterdam and can now be found in many other cities with 20,000 bicycles introduced to Paris in 2007 in the [[Vélib']] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/world/europe/16paris.html?ref=world|title=A New French Revolution’s Creed: Let Them Ride Bikes|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-07-16|accessdate=2008-01-13 | first=Katrin | last=Bennhold}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dockless bike share systems have recently appeared in the U.S. and provide more convenience for people wanting to rent a bike for a short time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carfreeamerica.net/2017/09/18/on-why-dockless-bike-share-systems-are-the-future/|title=On Why Dockless Bike Share Systems are the Future - Car Free America|date=2017-09-18|work=Car Free America|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy groups==
The [[Campaign for Better Transport (UK)|Campaign for Better Transport]] (formerly known as Transport2000) was formed in 1972 in Britain to challenge proposed cuts in the British rail network and since then has promoted public transport solutions to our transport needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Car Free Walks]] is a UK-based website encouraging walkers to use public transport to reach the start and end of walks, rather than using a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carfreewalks.org|title= Car Free Walks|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism groups==
[[Road protest (UK)|Road protest]]s rose to prominence in the UK in the early 1990s in response to a major road building program both in urban communities and also rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/7/newsid_2536000/2536089.stm|title=1993: Activists lose battle over chestnut tree|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2008-01-13 | date=1993-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reclaim the Streets]], a movement formed in 1991 in London, "invaded" major roads, highway or freeway to stage parties. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/544778.stm|title=The group reclaiming the headlines|date=1999-12-01|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Flanders, the organisation [[Fietsersbond]] has called upon the government to ban tractor units in city centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-deurne/-verbied-grote-trucks-in-dorpskern-a2045937/ Fietsersbond vraagt overheid tot verbieden van grote trucks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flanderstoday.eu/politics/government-needs-listen-cyclists-says-cyclists-union "Fietsersbond" or "cyclist union" in Flanders]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] rides emerged in 1992 in San Francisco where cyclists take to the streets en masse to dominate the traffic, using the slogan "we are traffic". The ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists.&lt;ref name=10years&gt;

The [[World Naked Bike Ride]] was born in 2001 in Spain with the first naked bike rides, which then emerged as the WNBR in 2004 a concept which rapidly spread through collaborations with many different activist groups and individuals around the world to promote bicycle transportation, renewable energy, recreation, walkable communities, and environmentally responsible, sustainable solutions to living in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnakedbikeride.org/resources/nakedwheels.html|title=A history of unabashed free wheelers!|publisher=worldnakedbikeride.org|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parking Days started in 2005 when [[Rebar art and design studio|REBAR]], a collaborative group of creators, designers and activists based in San Francisco, transformed a metered parking spot into a small park complete with turf, seating, and shade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkingday.org/background/index.html |title=Parking day - background |publisher=parkingday.org |accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808174837/http://parkingday.org/background/index.html |archivedate=2007-08-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2007 there were 180 parks in 27 cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkingday.org/|title=Park(ing) Day 2007|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official events==
[[Car Free Days]] are official events with the common goal of taking a fair number of cars off the streets of a city or some target area or neighborhood for all or part of a day, in order to give the people who live and work there a chance to consider how their city might look and work with significantly fewer cars. The first events were organised in Reykjavík (Iceland), Bath (UK) and La Rochelle (France) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoplan.org/carfreeday/general/origins.htm |title=World Car Free Days Timeline: 1961-2007 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |publisher=ecoplan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113123252/http://www.ecoplan.org/carfreeday/general/origins.htm |archivedate=2008-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ciclovía]] is a similar event in many cities that places a large emphasis on [[cycling]] as an alternative to auto travel.

[[In town without my car]]! is an EU campaign and day every autumn (Northern Hemisphere) for an increased use of other vehicles than the car. It has since spread beyond the EU, and in 2004 more than 40 countries participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/awareness/itwmc/whatisintownwithoutmycar |title=What is In Town, Without My Car? |publisher=UK Department for Transport |accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120214829/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/awareness/itwmc/whatisintownwithoutmycar |archivedate=2008-01-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards Carfree Cities is the annual conference of the [[World Carfree Network]] and provides a focal point for diverse aspects of the emerging global carfree movement. The conference is in Portland, Oregon, USA in 2008 (its first time in North America), and has also been in Istanbul, Turkey; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Berlin, Germany; Prague, Czech Republic; Timisoara, Romania; and Lyon, France. The conference series attempts to bridge the gap between many of the diverse people and organizations interested in reducing urban dependence on the automobile.

Transportation Alternative's Annual Commuter Race pits a bicyclist against both a subway rider and a cab rider in a race from Queens to Manhattan. The Fifth Annual Commuter race took place in May 2009, where bicyclist Rachel Myers beat straphanger Dan Hendrick and cab rider Willie Thompson to make it the fifth year the contestant on the bicycle won. Myers took the 2009 title with a time of 20 minutes and 15 seconds to make the 4.2 mile trek from Sunnyside, Queens to Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Hendrick showed up 15 minutes later off the subway and Thompson arrived via cab nearly a half-hour after that. Transportation Alternatives is a group that "seeks to change New York City's transportation priorities to encourage and increase non-polluting, quiet, city-friendly travel and decrease—not ban—private car use. [They] seek a rational transportation system based on a 'Green Transportation Hierarchy,' which gives preference to modes of travel based on their benefits and costs to society. To achieve our goals, T.A. works in five areas: Bicycling, Walking and Traffic Calming, Car-Free Parks, Safe Streets and Sensible Transportation." The 2009 Commuter Race came on the heels of a Times Square traffic ban in NYC that drew national media attention.&lt;ref name="CloseBroadway"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/nyregion/26broadway.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion|title = Mayor Plans to Close Parts of Broadway to Traffic|accessdate = 2011-09-15|date=February 2009|work=The New York Times|first1=William|last1=Neuman|first2=Michael|last2=Barbaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carfree development==

===Definitions and types===

There are many areas of the world where people have always lived without cars, because no road access is possible, or none has been provided.  In developed countries these include islands and some historic neighbourhoods or settlements, the largest example being the canal city of [[Venice]].  The term carfree ''development'' implies a physical change - either new building or changes to an existing built area.

Melia ''et al.'' (2010)&lt;ref name="melia"&gt;[http://www.ecoplan.org/wtpp/wtj_index.htm Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (2010) Carfree, Low Car - What's the Difference? World Transport Policy &amp; Practice 16 (2), 24-32.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112094521/http://www.ecoplan.org/wtpp/wtj_index.htm |date=2016-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  define carfree development as follows:

Carfree developments are residential or mixed use developments which:

* Normally provide a traffic free immediate environment, and:
* Offer no parking or limited parking separated from the residence, and:
* Are designed to enable residents to live without owning a car.

This definition (which they distinguish from the more common "low car development") is based mainly on experience in Northwestern Europe, where the movement for carfree development began.  Within this definition three types are identified:

* Vauban model
* Limited Access model
* Pedestrian zones with residential population

====Vauban====

[[Vauban, Freiburg]], [[Germany]] is according to this definition, the largest carfree development in Europe, with over 5,000 residents. Whether it can be considered carfree is open to debate: many local people prefer the term "stellplatzfrei" - literally "free from parking spaces" to describe the traffic management system there. Vehicles are allowed down the residential streets at walking pace to pick up and deliver but not to park, although there are frequent infractions. Residents of the stellplatzfrei areas must sign an annual declaration stating whether they own a car or not. Car owners must purchase a place in one of the [[multi-storey car park]]s on the periphery, run by a council-owned company. The cost of these spaces – €17,500 in 2006, plus a monthly fee – acts as a disincentive to car ownership.&lt;ref name = "melia"/&gt;

====Limited access type====

The more common form of car free development involves some sort of physical barrier, which prevents motor vehicles from penetrating into a carfree interior.  Melia ''et al.''&lt;ref name="melia"/&gt; describe this as the "Limited Access" type.  In some cases such as Stellwerk 60 in Cologne, there is a removable barrier, controlled by a residents' organisations. In others such as [[Waterwijk (Amsterdam)]] (article in Dutch) vehicular access is only available from the exterior.

====Pedestrian zones====
{{Main|Pedestrian zone}}

Whereas the first two models apply to [[Planned community|newly built]] car free developments, most pedestrianised areas have been retro-fitted.  Pedestrian zones may be considered carfree developments where they include a significant population and a low rate of vehicle ownership per household. The largest example in Europe is [[Groningen (city)|Groningen, Netherlands]] which had a city centre population of 16,500 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://gemeente.groningen.nl/gemeente/de-stad-in-cijfers/statistische-jaarboeken |title=Statistical Yearbook 2008 |publisher=City of Groningen |accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629041004/http://gemeente.groningen.nl/gemeente/de-stad-in-cijfers/statistische-jaarboeken/jaarboek-2008.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Benefits and problems ===

Several studies have been done on European car free developments.  The most comprehensive was conducted in 2000 by Jan Scheurer.&lt;ref name = "scheurer"&gt;Scheurer, J. (2001) Urban Ecology, Innovations in Housing Policy and the Future of Cities: Towards Sustainability in Neighbourhood CommunitiesThesis (PhD), Murdoch University Institute of Sustainable Transport.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other more recent studies have been made of specific carfree areas such as Vienna's [[Florisdorf]] carfree development.&lt;ref&gt;Ornetzeder, M., Hertwich, E.G., Hubacek, K., Korytarova, K. and Haas, W. (2008) The environmental effect of car-free housing: A case in Vienna. Ecological Economics 65 (3), 516-530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main benefits found for car free developments (summarised in Melia ''et al.'' 2010&lt;ref name = "melia"/&gt;) found in the various studies are:

* very low levels of car use, resulting in much less traffic on surrounding roads
* high rates of walking and cycling
* more independent movement and active play amongst children
* less land taken for parking and roads - more available for green or social space

The main problems related to parking management.  Where parking is not controlled in the surrounding area, this often results in complaints from neighbours about [[overspill parking]].

In general, ''climate change'' refers to statistically identifiable changes in climate properties that persist over a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report. Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Core Writing Team, R.K. Pachauri and L.A. Meyer (eds.)]. IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland, 151 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) defines it as a change in climate caused by human activity that can be observed in addition to natural climate variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/|title=UNFCCC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be described as [[anthropogenic climate change]]. Climate change poses local level impacts on the German coast and for the present and future, suitable adaptation strategies are necessary. In 2008, the Federal Cabinet of Germany decided on a German Climate Change Adaptation Strategy with the objective of creating a national action framework for reducing the risks for the population, habitats as well as the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmu.de/themen/klima-energie/klimaschutz/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/|title=BMU Adaptation Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Germany Coast adm location map.svg|thumb|Map German Coast]]''Adaptation'' is a contested, widely discussed term with no general definition. For the German Adaptation Strategy the definition of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]] is utilized, stating that adapatation is the adjustment of natural or human systems to occurring or expected changes in climate in order to reduce harm. This approach views climate change as the major source of vulnerability and does not consider any social causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassett|first=Thomas J.|last2=Fogelman|first2=Charles|date=August 2013|title=Déjà vu or something new?

The ''German Coast'' comprises 1600&amp;nbsp;km to the west at the [[North Sea]] and 2100&amp;nbsp;km to the east at the [[Baltic Sea]]. In total, five states border the German coast. [[Lower Saxony]], [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]] are part of the North Sea region; [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] border the Baltic Sea and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] is located at both seas. ''Coast'' can be defined as the zone where the land is considerably influenced by the sea and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldoceanreview.com/wor-1/|title=World Ocean Review 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Climate Change Adaptation at the German Coast ==
The coastal inhabitants in Germany have always been exposed to the forces of nature, especially to storm floods and had to adapt to changing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://germanwatch.org/klima/nord09.pdf|title=Germanwatch|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in the 11th century, people started to build dykes to protect living and usable spaces from [[sea level rise]] and storm floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bau.uni-siegen.de/fwu/wb/veranstaltungen/mustok/tag_1_beitrag_hofstede.pdf|title=Hofstede|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptation especially to the [[Anthropogenic climate change|Anthropogenic Climate Change]] started in the 21st century, although initially the focus has been on climate protection. The German Government took up climate change adaptation for the first time in 2005 in the frame of its climate protection programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/klima-energie/klimafolgen-anpassung/anpassung-auf-bundesebene|title=UBA history|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate Change Impacts on the German Coast ==
Certain and reliable predictions for impacts of [[anthropogenic climate change]] on the German coast regarding [[temperature]], [[precipitation]], [[sea level]] and storm flood heights do not exist. Different models show different results and it is assumed that all changes in the range of the results have the same likelihood to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norddeutscher-klimamonitor.de/|title=Norddeutscher Klimamonitor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the end of the 21st century, the temperature is expected to rise between +0.6&amp;nbsp;°C and +6.2&amp;nbsp;°C in comparison to 1961-1990.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For the same period of time, a change of precipitation between -47% and +73% is likely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sea level and storm floods are complex phenomena and are influenced by diverse factors, such as astronomical ([[tide]]s), meteorological ([[wind]]), and tectonic (isostatic movements) variables which makes it even more difficult to predict how they will change with climate change.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967501090|title=Klimawandel in Deutschland : Entwicklung, Folgen, Risiken und Perspektiven|others=Brasseur, Guy P.,, Jacob, Daniela,, Schuck-Zöller, Susanne,|isbn=9783662503973|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=967501090}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Baltic Sea]], sea level is expected to rise in line with the expected global average rise in sea level.

At both seas, a rise in storm flood height is expected due to climate change related [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Climate Change Adaptation Politics ==
European, national as well as regional politics play a role in [[climate change adaptation]] at the German [[North Sea]] coast and [[Baltic Sea]] coast. In 2009, the [[European Union]] presented the White Paper Adapting to Climate Change: Towards a European framework for action which was a first approach to joint climate change adaptation politics. In 2013, the European Union established the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change. National and local climate change adaptation programs for the German coast are often considered as part of the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change. In a local setting, [[urban planning]] is an important part of adaptation politics.

=== European Climate Change Adaptation Politics for the North Sea and Baltic Sea ===
The German North Sea is part of the [[North Sea Region Programme|North Sea Region]] (NSR) Program 2014 - 2020 of the European Climate Adaptation Platform (Climate-ADAPT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/|title=Home — Climate-ADAPT|website=climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.interreg.de/INTERREG2014/EN/INTERREG/SixProgrammeAreas/NorthSeaRegion/northsearegion_node.html|title=INTERREG  -  North Sea Region|website=www.interreg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regional European development fund includes [[Coast|coastal zones]] of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]]. NSR developed a cooperation program, which was adopted by the [[European Commission]] in August 2015. The cooperation program focuses on adaptation to climate change impacts and on preserving the environment, stimulating a [[green economy]], promoting green transportation and mobility as well as supporting growth in the North Sea Region. Another actor in climate change adaptation in the German North Sea Region is the Wadden Sea Secretariat, a cooperation between Denmark, The Netherlands, and Germany that has been established in 1978 to protect the [[Wadden Sea]] as an ecological entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waddensea-secretariat.org/|title=Home {{!}} The Trilateral Cooperation on the Protection of the Wadden Sea|website=www.waddensea-secretariat.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wadden Sea Secretariat addresses and communicates the impacts of climate change on the Wadden Sea. In 1998, the working group Coastal Protection and Sea Level Rise (CPSL) was founded, dealing with the impacts of climate change. Until 2010, the CPSL has published three reports, which provided information for governmental conferences.

The Baltic Sea Region Program was developed by the EU Climate Adaptation Platform (Climate-ADAPT) to strengthen development and cooperation between the abutting nations of the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.interreg-baltic.eu/home.html|title=Interreg Baltic Sea Region: Home|website=www.interreg-baltic.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the predecessor EU Project BALTADAPT (Baltic Sea Region Climate Change Adaptation Strategy) published an action plan for climate change adaptation in the Baltic Sea regions. It focused on strategies for building and sharing knowledge of climate change adaptation, mainstreaming it and on connecting the strategies of the nations in the Baltic Sea Region to adapt to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baltadapt.eu/|title=Baltadapt {{!}} Home|website=baltadapt.eu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German Climate Change Adaptation Politics for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea ===
The political framework for climate change adaptation in Germany is given by the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/climate-energy/climate-change-adaptation/adaptation-at-the-federal-level/german-adaptation-strategy|title=German Adaptation Strategy|last=Buth|first=Mareike|date=2014-01-13|work=Umweltbundesamt|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding climate change at the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], the strategy states that the expected magnitude of damage due to climate change is unclear. In 2011, the German government presented an action plan for climate change adaptation which includes resolutions from the Wadden Sea Secretariat for the North Sea Region. In behalf of the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), the project ''KüstenKlima'' (2014) by the ''Institut Raum &amp; Energie'' (...) published a strategy for climate protection and climate change adaptation at the German coast mainly due to coastal management. In the report, it was highlighted that an [[integrated coastal zone management]] (IKZM) is an important method for adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raum-energie.de/veroeffentlichungen/details/news/kuestenklima-klimaschutz-und-anpassung-an-der-kueste/|title=KüstenKlima - Klimaschutz und -anpassung an der Küste - Institut Raum &amp; Energie|first=Institut Raum &amp;|last=Energie|website=www.raum-energie.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; IKZM is an informal management approach to strengthen [[sustainable development]] by means of integration, communication, good coordination practice, and participation. The [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) facilitates the project ''KLIMZUG - Klimawandel in Regionen zukunftsfähig gestalten'' ''(2008-2014)'' which includes adaptation strategies in seven model regions in Germany. The "KLIMZUG" program aimed to integrate climate change adaptation processes into regional development. Three of this model regions are located at the German coast. The program "KLIMZUG-NORD" focuses on the metropolitan region [[Hamburg]], the program "RADOST" on adaptation strategies for the German Baltic Sea coast and "nordwest2050" is a research project for climate change adaptation and innovation processes for the metropolitan region of [[Bremen]] and [[Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://klimzug-nord.de/|title=KLIMZUG-NORD - de, aktuell, KLIMZUG-NORD: Termine|website=klimzug-nord.de|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://klimzug-radost.de/|title=Projektbeschreibung {{!}} RADOST|website=klimzug-radost.de|language=de|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.borderstep.de/projekte/nordwest2050/|title=nordwest2050 - Borderstep Institut|work=Borderstep Institut|access-date=2018-07-13|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of [[States of Germany|Länder]] there are also individual climate change adaptation programs. '''  '''

==== Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ====
The state government of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] presented a first climate protection program in the year 1997 (''Aktionsplan Klimaschutz Mecklenburg-Vorpommern'').

The Baltic Sea region of Mecklenburg Vorpommern is part of the EU BALTADAPT program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.regierung-mv.de/Landesregierung/em/Klima/Klimaschutz/|title=Klimaschutz in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - Regierungsportal M-V|website=www.regierung-mv.de|language=de|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schleswig-Holstein ====
Based on the German adaptation strategy to climate change, the state government of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] for the first time presented a strategy for climate change adaptation (''Fahrplan Anpassung an den Klimawandel'') in 2011. The program was updated in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/V/Service/Broschueren/Broschueren_V/Umwelt/pdf/Fahrplan_Klimawandel.html|title=Fahrplan Anpassung an den Klimawandel|website=Landesportal Schleswig-Holstein|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity to [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] strongly influenced the program which can be recognized in the highlighted topics water economy and protection of the sea and soil.

==== Bremen ====
Besides actions in coastal protection, there is the project ''KLAS - Klimaanpassungsstrategie an extreme Regenereignisse in der Stadtgemeinde Bremen'' promoted by the [[Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] (BMU). The program aims to develop a better risk management for strong rain events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.klas-bremen.de/|title=KLAS - KlimaAnpassungsStrategien - Startseite|website=www.klas-bremen.de|language=de|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hamburg ====
[[Hamburg]] is a model region for the national project KLIMZUG-NORD. Besides that, a strategy for climate change adaptation was developed in 2011. In 2013, an action plan for climate change adaptation was published.

==== Lower-Saxony ====
The state government of [[Lower Saxony|Lower-Saxony]] established a government commission for climate protection and adaptation in 2008 to develop a strategy for climate change adaptation and protection. In 2013, the state government enacted the ''Klimapolitische Umsetzungsstrategie Niedersache''n. This program includes coastal protection strategies.

== Adaptation Strategies in Coastal Protection ==
According to DIN 4047-2, [[Coastal management|coastal protection]] comprises measures defending the shoreline against destructive interactions with the sea. That includes the protection of the coastal lowlands against flooding to allow the use of these areas as well as the protection of the coastline against shoreline recession and coastal erosion.

When it comes to climate change adaptation, coastal protection in Germany divides into three categories of measures:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

# Defence of the existing coastline
#* “hard” solutions (e.g. heightening and fortification of levees)
#* “soft” solutions (e.g. establishment of shallow water areas for retention of floods)
# Adaptation to extreme weather events, e.g. by building on dwelling mounds or other forms of constructional preventions
# Moving away from coastal areas to less affected regions, not using or extensively using the coastal regions

=== Coastal Protection Policy ===

[[File:Küstenschutz in Hohwacht - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Groynes in Howacht (Schleswig-Holstein) at the Baltic Sea coast]]
Coastal protection in Germany is organised and structured by legal regulations. Climate change adaptation in Germany has to be integrated in coastal protection plans on all spatial levels in order to achieve effective adaptation of the coastal protection sector. German administration distinguishes between active and passive coastal protection. Active coastal protection refers to measures that support floodplain reclamation and approaches to relocate acting forces ([[Ocean current|current]], [[breaking wave]]) seawards (e.g. by [[beach nourishment]]) whereas passive coastal protestion solidifies the shoreline (so-called ''hold the line'' approaches) and supports the absorption of incoming forces to avoid harmful consequences. Passive coastal protection can include [[seawall]]s, [[groynes]], detached [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], and [[revetments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Fachinhalte/K/kuestenschutz_fachplaene/Grundlagen/5_0_glossar.html|title=Fachpläne Küstenschutz - Glossar|last=|first=|date=26 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important actors in coastal risk management are political authorities, inhabitants of the respective region (households) as well as investors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Generalplan Küstenschutz des Landes Schleswig-Holstein. Fortschreibung 2012|last=|first=|publisher=Ministerium für Energiewende, Landwirtschaft, Umwelt und ländliche Räume des Landes Schleswig-Holstein|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, coastal protection in Germany is focussed on technical protection measures (i.a. [[Levee|levees]], artificial flood barriers). This approach has already been followed in the ''Generalplan Deichverstärkung, Deichverkürzung und Küstenschutz des Landes Schleswig-Holstein'' of 1963, a specific coastal protection plan for [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Today (2017-2020), technical measures are still most probable to be funded by the state.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmel.de/DE/Landwirtschaft/Foerderung-Agrarsozialpolitik/GAK/_Texte/Kuestenschutz.html|title=Gemeinschaftsaufgabe Agrarstruktur &amp; Küstenschutz|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the German Federal agency for the environment (UBA), coastal protection currently focusses on the fortification and heightening of levees and other protective structures, including retaining structures. It is a matter of discussion if and how these types of linear “hard” protection measures can in the face of climate change be extended to planar “soft” protection measures (e.g. (re-)instalment of shallow water areas to simultaneously reach nature conservation and climate protection goals).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Facing future climate risks, coastal protection increasingly integrates landscape-based prevention measures.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The German government aims to enhance synergies between “hard” and “soft” coastal protection measures by means of the ''Integriertes Küstenzonenmanagement'' approach ([[Integrated coastal zone management|Integrated Coastal Zone Management]]'','' IKZM). Its former general principle of “defending at all cost” is currently converting towards “living with water” and is putting stronger emphasis on changing climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/klima-energie/klimafolgen-anpassung/anpassung-regional-sektoral/anpassung-handlungsfeld-wasser-hochwasser|title=Handlungsfeld Wasser, Hochwasser- und Küstenschutz|last=Kambor|first=Susanne|date=2013-09-04|work=Umweltbundesamt|access-date=2018-07-11|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means for example that in spaces where neither individuals nor material values are at risk, it is an option to partially open up dykes and thereby enable self-acting adaptation. Connected to that is the expressed ambition to coordinate adaptation measures, to fit coastal areas in an overall spatial context and to involve a wide range of relevant actors (e.g. authorities, interest groups, science). Essential weight is put on harmonising economic and social beneficiary claims with protection interests in the coastal zone by elaborating on development trajectories, conflict potentials and solutions at an early stage of planning. Another aspect of coordinated adaptation in coastal protection refers to connections between urban and rural areas. Coastal protection in [[Rural area|rural areas]] in northern Germany should be seen in connection with protection measures in big cities such as [[Hamburg]] or [[Bremen]] where discussed “soft” measures are less easily to implement. In the cities, linear protection measures like levees and flood walls will probably be further enhanced/fostered but it would be interesting for cities to participate in solutions of laminar coastal protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Adaptation in Practical Coastal Protection ===

In order to find and establish adequate measures to adapt coastal protection to climate change, responsible actors in coastal protection need to have sound and detailed local and hydromorphological knowledge. Even with that it is very difficult to predict direct and indirect consequences of climate change at the German coast.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Challenging for planning authorities is a lack of clear information on future sea level dynamics. As there are no exact prognoses for [[sea level rise]] at the German coasts, planners of coastal protection measures as well as the inhabitants of the region are facing considerable uncertainties. Related to sea level rise, coastal protection has to react to higher base levels in the event of a [[Storm surge|storm flood]]. High storm flood levels are expected to be faster reached and longer lasting and storm floods that  once only occurred every 350 years are predicted to happen once every 100 years by the middle of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Especially in winter, stronger storms and higher levels of storm floods are expected as much as changes in sea condition that cause major cases of coastal erosion and can pose more strain on [[Levee|levees]] by increased wave runup.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Existing levees have usually been constructed to protect the hinterland against floods that statistically occur once every 350 years. As a result of the expected sea level rise, storm floods become more likely and the levees have to be adapted to that in their construction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The protection level of these so-called “hard” technical coastal protection measures is currently determined on the basis of records from historic flooding events, extrapolation (updating) of the previous sea level trends. Experts demand to better include a risk oriented design of coastal protection measures and land use planning at the German coast and to integrate climate change scenarios (e.g. by respecting long term climate change scenarios and the suspected rising sea level).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Finance ===

Innovative coastal protection measures require consistent economic incentives. In Germany, these can be compensations in the case of income losses resulting from coastal protection measures or buying land for setting back [[Levee|levees]]. Further, (re-)established water areas can be interesting for [[tourism]] or [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anpassung an den Klimawandel: Küstenschutz|last=|first=|publisher=Umweltbundesamt|year=2012|isbn=|location=Dessau-Rosslau|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Federal government can fund up to 70% of the investment costs that the [[States of Germany|Länder]] spend for coastal protection measures. Within the ''Sonderrahmenplan: Maßnahmen des Küstenschutzes in Folge des Klimawandels (2009-2025)'' (''special framework for climate change related coastal protection measures''), 25 million euros are provided by the state and the Länder. Other funding can be applied from the European development funds [[EAFRD]] and [[European Regional Development Fund|ERDF]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is expected that the total costs for coastal protection will considerably rise within the next year to reach 800 to 1000 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldoceanreview.com/wor-1/kuesten/lebensraum-kueste/2/|title=Lebensraum Küste «  World Ocean Review|website=worldoceanreview.com|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptation Strategies of the Economy ==
Climate change influences the economy in German coastal regions which makes an adaptation in time necessary. This affects different economic sectors like the [[Tourism|tourism industry]], [[agriculture]], the [[fishing industry]] or shipping.

=== Tourism Industry ===

==== Impacts of Climate Change ====
[[File:Strandkörbe-langeoog.jpg|thumb|beach chairs on Langeoog]]
[[Climate change]] implies risks and opportunities for the regional tourism of the German coast.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://klimzug-radost.de/|title=RADOST|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher temperatures and less precipitation in summer can enhance the attractiveness of coastal tourist destinations in Germany and extend the bathing season. The bathing season could be up to 60 days longer in 2100 which can entail around 25-30 percent more tourists. Higher numbers of visitors can open opportunities for the tourism industry, but can also lead to an overload for the local infrastructure. It increases the utilization pressure on [[ecosystem]]s which is problematic as some places at the [[Baltic Sea]] have reached their capacity limit already.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/klima-energie/klimafolgen-anpassung/handlungsfeld-tourismus#textpart-1|title=UBA Tourismus|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative consequences are expected due to [[sea level rise]] and bigger waves which cause beach [[erosion]] and contribute to an inland shifting of the coastline. This can adversely affect the beach tourism.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.klimanavigator.eu/dossier/artikel/035880/index.php|title=Klimanavigator Tourism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of water sports|Water sports]] and other tourism activities can be limited due to heavy swell. Heavy rainfalls and floods can damage tourism institutions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

An increasing growth of [[Algae|algaes]], [[seaweed]] and bacteria can deteriorate the water quality. This can be dangerous for the health of tourists and therefore reduce the attractiveness of the affected places.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; More [[Jellyfish|jellyfishes]] can reduce the attractiveness of seaside resorts.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Thomas, K. (2017): Strategien zur Klimawandelanpassung im Tourismus an Nord- u. Ostsee. Hochschule für Nachhaltige Entwicklung Eberswalde&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adaptation Strategies ====
The climate change adaptation strategies of the German coast are usually only indirectly linked to tourism as they are mainly coastal protection strategies, but also beneficial for the tourism industry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The adaptation possibilities depend on the individual characteristics of the specific holiday destinations. A difficulty is that climate change is not the only influencing factor on the tourism industry. Other external factors like different travel behavior or demographic changes have to be considered as well.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In general, so called “no-regret-measures” are useful, which are strategies that are also beneficial without the effects of climate change as they contribute to a [[sustainable development]] of a certain region.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Most important is the preservation of the touristic potential of the regions which means the protection of nature. Second, visitors increasingly demand a climate-conscious behavior of the tourist providers. Every measure should be accompanied with information material for guests and local inhabitants.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some strategies want to strengthen offers that are independent from climate change like indoor halls or wellness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The current focus of climate change adaptation in the tourism industry is on sharing of information with all decision makers, network building and the development of strategic planning concepts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The adaptation willingness so far is rather low because of the complexity, uncertainty and the potential chances like a longer bathing season.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Fishing Industry ===
[[File:Gadus morhua (Dorsch, Kabeljau).jpg|thumb|codfish]]

==== Impacts of Climate Change ====
As a consequence of  limate  hange, the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] will warm up. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of the water will increase which makes it more acid. Together with extreme weather events and [[sea level rise]], it will threaten long exiting habitats. Fish stocks and the population of [[Marine life|marine organisms]] as well as marine food webs and rivalry situations are changing.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/klima-energie/klimafolgen-anpassung/handlungsfeld-fischerei|title=UBA fishery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North Sea, the warmer water leads to a shift of the habitats of cold loving fish stocks like [[Cod|codfish]] and [[plaice]] to lower water temperatures in the North. The population of other marine animals will decline due to warmer winters.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Favored by the warming of the sea, new species that have lived in more southern areas before like [[Anchovy|anchovies]] or the [[Pacific oyster]] will appear in the North Sea.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Baltic Sea as a [[brackish water]] is characterized by a highly sensitive ecosystem. Small changes in temperature, [[salinity]] and oxygen content lead to a significant shift in the compound of species.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Climate change can shift the walking and spawning seasons of fishes and the vulnerability to infections and parasites is increasing.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.klimascout.de/kommunen/index.php?title=Fischerei_-_Auswirkungen_des_Klimawandels|title=Klimascout|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift of habitats of fish populations to the North combines with big financial losses for the local fishing industry which is an important economic sector for some structurally weak coastal areas. It especially affects very small, financially weak fishing companies. If these losses can be compensated by new species is not known yet. Coastal production facilities are in danger of being flooded or damaged by sea level rise and storm floods. Higher swell and extreme weather events can deteriorate the fishing conditions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

It’s hard to differentiate between the consequences of climate change and other influencing stress factors like [[overfishing]], shipping or pollutants in the water.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.klimafakten.de/branchenbericht/was-der-klimawandel-fuer-die-fischereiwirtschaft-bedeutet|title=Klimafakten fishery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adaptation Strategies ====
There are different technical possibilities to make the fishing industry more sustainable.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Improved fishing techniques and mesh sizes for nets contribute to reduce by-catches.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A real-time monitoring of the catches could support the establishment of sanctuaries by justifying seasonal and territorial restrictions for the fishery.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It makes an adaptation of the catch amount and fished species possible.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Protection zones would help to recover the full reproductivity of fish stocks. It is important to explain the consumers which fish species can be bought and which not. New sources of income for fishermen, for example in the tourism industry, could be another strategy.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Shipping Industry ===
The potential climate change impacts at the German coast will pose risks and chances for the shipping industry to which especially harbours will have to adapt to. The economic eficiency of waterways, shipping routes and construction maesures depend on water conditions, current as well as sediment transport. The three KLIMZUG projects "RADOST", "nordwest2050" and "KLIMZUG-NORD" include research and adaptation strategies for harbours and the shipping industry in general.&lt;ref&gt;'''Report:''' RADOST-Verbund ( 2014 ): '''RADOST-Abschlussbericht.''' Ecologic Institut. Berlin. RADOST-Berichtsreihe, Bericht Nr. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:The new container ship MOL Tribute on the Elbe with destination port of Hamburg - 2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Container ship MOL on the river Elbe with destination to the Harbour of Hamburg|alt=]]

==== Port of Hamburg ====

===== Impacts of Climate Change  =====
It exists high uncertainty concerning the impacts of climate change on the local scale of the [[Port of Hamburg]]. A rise in sea level is expected to cause increased tidal range as well as higher flood current speed which will have effects on the water level of the [[Elbe|Elbe river]]. Higher quantities of [[precipitation]] and extreme rainfalls related to climate change can lead to increased groundwater potential. Lower precipitation which is also likely can cause higher upstream transportation of sediments.

Floods caused by storm floods, rise in water level due to climate change related [[sea level rise]], higher precipitation and extreme rainfall can lead to disruption of transportation and can have negative effects on industries that depend on harbours. Stronger winds can complicate the storage of empty containers as well as navigation in the Harbour of Hamburg. Inland water transport can be hampered by the rise in sea level as for example the passing underneath bridges might not be possible any more for bigger ships. Increased sediment deposit can lead to lower water level which will limit the size of suitable ships. In contrast, higher air temperature and ice melting can have positive effects for the Hamburg Harbour economy. Less ice and snow would cause less damage on buildings and infrastructure in general which means less costs for reparation. Furthermore, less costs for disruption would result. With the melting of ice, a new shorter waterway to [[Asia]] would be accessible. This could be a more time and cost-effective alternative to the current shipping route.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018|editor-last=von Storch|editor-first=Hans|editor2-last=Meinke|editor2-first=Insa|editor3-last=Claußen|editor3-first=Martin|title=Hamburger Klimabericht – Wissen über Klima, Klimawandel und Auswirkungen in Hamburg und Norddeutschland|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-662-55379-4|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-55379-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Adaptation Strategies =====
For the implementation of adaptation strategies, it has to be dealt with a high uncertainty concerning the changes, the assessment of their likelihood as well as the calculation of the necessary resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For the protection against increased floods and storm floods, on the one hand, technical solutions such as further dykes and the fortification of existing ones, flood barriers and on the other hand, the restoration of natural flood plains are being discussed. It might be necessary to raise existing bridges, roads and railways to ensure the crossability for bigger ships.&lt;ref&gt;Koppe, B., Schmidt, M., &amp; Strotmann, T. (2012).

In ''The 6th Chinese-German Joint Symposium on Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering (JOINT 2012) National Taiwan Ocean University Keelung'' (Vol. 23, No. 26.9, p. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Drainage systems will have to be adapted in order to deal with longer and higher storm floods as well as with higher middle Elbe water level. For the increased sediment transport, a regular maintenance of the water way in order to maintain a shippable water level will be necessary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Suffragette-that-knew-jiujitsu.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Suffragette that Knew Jiu-Jitsu. The Arrest.'' By [[Arthur Wallis Mills]], originally published in 1910 in ''[[Punch Magazine|Punch]]'' and ''The [[Wanganui Chronicle]]''.]]
'''Edith Margaret Garrud''' (1872–1971) was among the first female professional [[martial arts]] instructors in the [[Western world]]. She trained the [[Bodyguard]] unit of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in [[jujutsu]] [[self-defence]] techniques.

== Early life ==
She was born '''Edith Margaret Williams''' in 1872 in [[Bath, Somerset]]. Five years later, her family moved to [[Wales]], where she remained until circa 1893. She married William Garrud, a [[physical culture]] instructor specializing in gymnastics, [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]]. They moved to London, where William found work as a physical culture trainer for several [[universities]].

In 1899, the Garruds were introduced to the art of jiu jitsu by [[Edward William Barton-Wright]], the first jiu jitsu teacher in Europe and the founder of the eclectic martial art of [[Bartitsu]]. Five years later, they became students at the jiu jitsu school of the former Bartitsu Club instructor [[Sadakazu Uyenishi]] in [[Golden Square]], [[Soho]]. In 1907, Edith was featured as the protagonist in a short film entitled ''Jiu-jitsu Downs the Footpads'', which was produced by the [[Pathé]] Film Company.

When Uyenishi left England in 1908, William took over as the owner and manager of the Golden Square school and Edith became the instructor of the women's and children's classes.

The Garruds popularised jujutsu by performing numerous exhibitions throughout London and by writing articles for [[magazines]]. Beginning in 1908, Edith also taught classes open only to members of the Suffrage movement. From 1911, these classes were based at the Palladium Academy, a dance school in Argyll Street.

In January 1911, Edith Garrud choreographed the fight scenes for a polemic play entitled ''What Every Woman Ought to Know''. In August that year, one of her articles on women's self-defence was published in ''Health and Strength'' magazine.

== Trainer of bodyguards ==
In 1913, the Asquith government instituted the so-called [[Cat and Mouse Act]] whereby [[Suffragette]] leaders on [[hunger strikes]] could legally be released from jail in order to recover their health and then re-arrested on the original charge.  The WSPU responded by establishing a thirty-member, all-woman protection unit referred to as "the Bodyguard", the "Jiujitsuffragettes" and the "Amazons", to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-arrest. Edith Garrud became the very first trainer of the Bodyguard and taught them jujutsu and the use of [[Indian club]]s as defensive weapons. Their lessons took place in a succession of secret locations to avoid the attention of the police. The Bodyguard fought a number of well-publicised [[hand-to-hand combat]]s with police officers who were attempting to arrest their leaders.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

On several occasions they were also able to stage successful escapes and rescues, making use of [[Military tactics|tactics]] such as [[disguise]] and the use of [[decoy]]s to confuse the police.  A number of these incidents are described in the unpublished memoir of Bodyguard member Katherine "Kitty" Marshall, titled "Suffragette Escapes and Adventures".  Journalists coined the term "suffrajitsu" - a portmanteau of "suffragette" and "jiujitsu" - to describe their techniques of self-defence, sabotage and subterfuge.

The Bodyguard was disbanded shortly after the onset of the First World War. WSPU leader [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] had decided to suspend militant suffrage actions and to support the British Government during the crisis, and therefore no longer required protection.

== Later life ==
Edith and William Garrud continued to work as self-defence and jujutsu instructors until 1925, when they sold their school and appear to have retired from public life. There is some evidence to suggest that they may have been successful as investors in the property market. Edith is recorded as having made several contributions to various charitable causes during the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1966, on her 94th birthday, Edith Garrud was the subject of an extensive feature article published in ''[[Woman (UK magazine)|Woman]]'' magazine.

She died in 1971 at the age of 99.

== Portrayals in popular culture ==
Edith Garrud was portrayed by the actresses Judith Lowe and Jeanne Dorree for the [[Channel 4]] [[docudrama]] ''The Year of the Bodyguard'' (1982), with Lowe playing Garrud circa 1913 and Dorree playing the elderly Garrud circa 1967.

Her involvement with the Suffragettes is portrayed in Ann Bertram's play ''The Good Fight'' (2012), the story of the suffragette Grace Roe as performed by Theatre Unbound&lt;ref name="theatre"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/arts/theater/the-good-fight-theatre-unbound-review | title=Theatre Unbound's jujitsu suffragettes fight "The Good Fight" | publisher=Daily Planet | date=1 October 2012 | accessdate=21 November 2012 | author=Everett, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Peter Hilton's play ''Mrs Garrud's Dojo'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Peter, ''Mrs Garrud's Dojo; A play in two scenes and three songs'', 2003, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith Garrud also makes a cameo appearance in Issue #1 of the graphic novel trilogy ''[[Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons]]'' (January 2015) and appears as a supporting character in the spin-off novella ''The Second-Story Girl''.

The character of Edith Ellyn in ''[[Suffragette (film)|Suffragette]]'' was somewhat inspired by Edith Garrud. [[Helena Bonham Carter]] modeled her performance after Garrud and requested the character's name be changed from Caroline to Edith in her honour. The film includes a brief scene in which Mrs. Ellyn teaches self-defence to a group of radical suffragettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/117127-is-edith-in-suffragette-based-on-a-real-person-the-movie-took-inspiration-from-actual-fighters |author=Olivia Truffaut-Wong |title=Is Edith In 'Suffragette' Based On A Real Person?

Edith Garrud is featured two re-enactment scenes in the documentary ''No Man Shall Protect Us'' (2018), portrayed by actress Lynne Baker.

The '''Empire Club of Canada''' is a Canadian speakers forum. Established in 1903, the Empire Club has provided a forum for over 3,500 different speakers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Through a variety of presentation formats, the Empire Club invites local, national and international leaders and other change-agents to address the topical, relevant issues of the day. The club is based in [[Toronto]], with luncheon style meetings held at the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] or another venue of similar calibre.

== History ==
The Empire Club of Canada was established in 1903 as a result of a political discussion which created considerable unrest in Canada. Growing dissent against the British was influencing Toronto's political and social landscape. In an attempt to refrain from a hasty, myopic severing of ties with the British Empire, a group of men under the leadership of Brig.-Gen. [[James Mason (Canadian politician)|James Mason]] discussed the creation of an organization that would promote public discourse and discussion about key issues of the day, both at home and abroad.

With this mandate in mind, the group gathered to draft the constitution for a new club to be named The Empire Club of Canada.  Canada's "Imperial bond" with Britain was the cornerstone of the Empire Club of Canada, as its founders believed it would be beneficial to Canada to maintain strong political and economic ties with the Empire. This organization, with a plan of weekly luncheons, which would be addressed by prominent individuals who spoke with authority on the issues of the day, would also have the distinctive basis of the British connection in its work and policy. Membership was restricted to British subjects—there was no legal Canadian citizenship at the time—who would pay dues of one dollar a year, with a maximum membership of 500. Within a month, membership exceeded 300. A year or two later, the club had a waiting list of those wishing to join.

The first luncheon speaker on December 3, 1903, was a clergyman and professor, [[William Robinson Clark|William Clark]], who said: "I can quite understand that to many persons, the formation of a club of this kind will seem a very little thing, ... I have not the least doubt that this Club will become of great influence and power in this Dominion". Clark's address became the first of many, with the Empire Club's podium hosting countless great leaders of politics, business, social issues and arts &amp; culture. Notable speakers include [[Winston Churchill]], [[Stephen Leacock]], [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Billy Graham]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[A.Y. Jackson]], [[The Dalai Lama]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Mark Carney]] and nearly every Canadian Prime Minister since [[Robert Borden]].

The Empire Club of Canada continues to be recognized as one of Canada's oldest and most important speakers forums. Since its inaugural meeting in December 1903, the Empire Club of Canada has provided a forum to discuss ongoing issues of local, national and international importance. More than 3,500 addresses have been delivered from the Empire Club podium, and every address is kept on record in the Empire Club of Canada's annual Red Book. Upcoming speakers can be found alongside the historic speeches at www.empireclub.org.

== The Empire Club Foundation ==

The Empire Club Foundation was incorporated in January 1969 and serves as a vehicle for the publication and wide-distribution of the annual compilation of speeches. Copies are sent to a large distribution of schools, [[library|libraries]], [[consulate]]s and [[embassy|embassies]].

Registered as a charity, its objectives are to promote the interest in current and [[Public administration|public affairs]], and to establish a historical database of all Empire Club speeches. All of the Empire Club speeches since 1903 are available via the Empire Club's website. In 2010, John Koopman, Past President of the Empire Club of Canada, was appointed as the Chair of the Empire Club Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1858">The '''Funj''' are an ethnic group in present-day [[Sudan]]. The Funj set up the [[Funj Sultanate of Sinnar]] with [[Abdallah Jamma]] and ruled the area for several centuries. The Funj risen in southern Nubia and had overthrew the remnants of the old Christian kingdom of [[Alodia]]. In 1504 a Funj leader named [[Amara Dunqas]], founded the Black Sultanate at Sannar (the capital). The Black Sultanate soon became the keystone of the Funj Empire. 

The origins of the Funj are not clearly known. However, there are three different hypotheses regarding their origin. One source claims Funj are descendants of [[Banu Umayya]], who escaped the slaughter of the [[Abbasids]] by fleeing into [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and moving inward in to the [[Nubians|Nubian]] territory who had been known in [[Arabia]] since ancient times to protect guests and refugees. The second hypothesis comes from [[James Bruce]], who theorized in his book [[Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile]] that the Funj descend from the [[Shilluk people]]. Bruce wrote his book after 22 years of travel through [[North Africa]] and [[Ethiopia]]. The third hypothesis is that they are descents of the remnants of the Kingdom of [[Alodia]] Nubians who escaped further south to replenish their supplies and resources and returned to establish their state. The most cited source is that they are Nubians who mixed with [[Arabs]].

'''Gamo-Gofa-Dawro''' is an [[Omotic]] language of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]] spoken in the [[Dawro Zone|Dawro]], [[Gamo Gofa Zone|Gamo Gofa]] and [[Wolayita Zone]]s of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region]] in [[Ethiopia]].  Varieties are spoken by the [[Gamo people|Gamo]], [[Gofa people|Gofa]], [[Dawro people|Dawro]]; Blench (2006) and ''Ethnologue'' treat these as separate languages.  Dialects of Dawro (Kullo-Konta) are Konta and Kucha.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28432">[[Gender inequality]] can be defined as the unequal treatment of individuals based on their gender.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://makethelink.org.au/make-the-link/gender-equality/|title=What is Gender Equality?|last=Make the Link|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals can be marginalised and discriminated from society and be restricted to participate in society due to their gender.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink" /&gt; In [[Australia]], gender inequality denotes the inconsistencies between individuals due to gender. Australian women, men, and transgender and non-binary people all experience aspects of gender inequality. The sections below explain how and why women, men, and transgender and non-binary people experience gender inequality in their daily lives in Australia.  

==Legislation==
In response to the concerns, the Australian government has implemented various legislation such as the ''[[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]]''. The legislation covers the issues of discrimination in education, partnerships, marital status, sexual harassment and potential pregnancy.

The [http://www.wgea.gov.au Workplace Gender Equality Agency] is an Australian Government statutory agency charged with promoting and improving gender equality in Australian workplaces. It is responsible for administering the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (which replaced the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999). The Workplace Gender Equality Agency was formerly known as the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency. 

==Current Issues for Women==
Over half (50.7%) of the Australian population are women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/2018_Face_the_Facts_Gender_Equality.pdf|title=Face the Facts: Gender Equality 2018|last=Australian Human Rights Commission|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these women experience inequality in numerous aspects of their lives because of their gender. Women often have fewer choice and opportunities compared to men because of their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityrightsalliance.org.au/who-we-are/gender-equality-in-australia/|title=Gender Equality in Australia|last=Equality Rights Alliance|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women are disproportionate to men in their work life and economic aspects, societal roles, and in violence rates in Australia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Work Life and Economics===

==== Gender Pay Gap ====
{{Main|Gender pay gap in Australia}}
The [[gender pay gap]] is where men and women do not receive equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/gender-pay-gap-statistic.pdf|title=Australia's Gender Pay Gap Statistics|last=Workplace Gender Equality Agency|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the principle of "[[equal pay for equal work]]" was introduced in 1969. Anti-discrimination on the basis of sex was legislated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, {{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/women.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206144556/http://dfat.gov.au/facts/women.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All government statistics in this area do not compare like-for-like roles but are an average on both male and female total wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australia’s gender equality scorecard: November 2018 |url=https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/2017-18-gender-equality-scorecard.pdf |website=Workplace Gender Equality Agency |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2009, the gender pay gap remained within a narrow range of between 15 and 17%.&lt;ref name="natsem"&gt;National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. [http://www.actu.org.au/Images/Dynamic/attachments/6895/NATSEM_report.pdf ''The impact of a sustained gender wage gap on the economy''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201110158/http://www.actu.org.au/Images/Dynamic/attachments/6895/NATSEM_report.pdf |date=2010-12-01 }} Report to the Office for Women, Department of Families, Community Services, Housing and Indigenous Affairs, 2009, p. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, the Australian gender pay gap was 15.3%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/2016-17-gender-equality-scorecard.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/2016-17-gender-equality-scorecard.pdf|title=WGEA 2017 Scorecard|last=Workplace Gender Equality Agency|date=November 2017|website=www.wgea.gov.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, it was reported that Australia’s full-time gender pay gap was 14.6% and women earnt on average $244.80 per week less than men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was also reported that Western Australia had the highest pay gap by state and territory (22.4%), while the lowest pay gap was reported in Tasmania (9.7%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As well, the highest pay gap by industry in Australia was Financial and Insurance Services (26.6%) and the lowest pay gap by industry was Public Administration and Safety (5.8%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Studies show that unexplained differences in wages may be due to direct discrimination, or to other unmeasured differences between men and women, calculations do not account for education, experience or area of work so little can be known about the causes.&lt;ref name="abs.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="natsem"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Ian (2010). [http://www.business.curtin.edu.au/files/295watson1.pdf ''Decomposing the Gender Pay Gap in the Australian Managerial Labour Market''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306114914/http://www.business.curtin.edu.au/files/295watson1.pdf |date=2011-03-06 }} '''Australian Journal of Labour Economics''', Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 49-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that examine the gender pay gap across the entire wage distribution find that the gender pay gap is much greater among high wage earners than among low wage earners even after controlling for various individual and workplace related factors. These results indicate that a [[glass ceiling]] may be found in the Australian labour market.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Paul W. (2005). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8462.2005.00383.x/abstract ''The Role of Gender among Low-Paid and High-Paid Workers''.] '''Australian Economic Review''', Vol. 38, No. 4, pp. 405-417, quote p. 413-414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kee, Hiao Joo (2006).

==== Occupational segregation ====
In Australia, [[occupational segregation]] is very present in many industries. Occupations are highly segregated by gender which results in male-dominated occupations and female-dominated occupations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2016, it was reported that Construction and Mining industries had the highest representation of men.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/Gender%20composition-of-the-workforce-by-industry.pdf|title=Gender composition of the workforce: by industry|last=Workplace Gender Equality Agency|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 88.3% of workers in construction industries and 86.3% in mining industries were men.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Whereas, it was reported that Health Care and Social Assistance, and Education and Training industries had the highest representation of women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women made up 78.3% workers in Health Care and Social Assistance, and Women accounted for 70.9% of Education and Training industries in 2016.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is also important to note that in eight industries women made up less than 40% of all workers in 2016.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These industries include Information Media and Telecommunications (37.6%); Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (30.9%); Wholesale Trade (30.1%); Manufacturing (27.3%); Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services (22.4%); Transport, Postal and Warehousing (21.7%); Mining (13.7%); and Construction (11.7%).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Retirement ====
Many women have substantially lower [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation]] payouts for retirement than men in Australia.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink" /&gt; In 2015-2016, it was reported that the average super payout for an Australian man was $270,710, while the average super payout for an Australian woman was $157,050.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means, the average Australian woman had $113,660 less superannuation for retirement than the average Australian man.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result of many women having fewer superannuation funds than men, it can often lead to women having financial hardships in retirement. Women are more likely to experience poverty when retired and more likely to be reliant and dependent on the Age Pension compared to men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2018, it was reported that 55% of women aged 65 years or more were receiving the Age Pension. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/Stats_at_a_Glance.pdf|title=Gender workplace statistics at a glance|last=Workplace Gender Equality Agency|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal Roles ===

==== Carers ====
Typically, women take on roles of being carers in society. In 2018, it was reported that 68% of primary carers are women, 70% of primary unpaid carers for children are women, and 58% of primary unpaid carers for the elderly and people with a disability or long-term health conditions are women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, women spend 64.4% of their total work day performing unpaid care work, compared to men who spend 36.1% of their total work day performing unpaid care work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This equates to women spending almost twice as many hours performing unpaid care work each day compared to men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women are also spending almost three times as much time each day caring for children compared to men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Violence ===

==== Sexual Harassment and Sexual/Physical Violence ====
Many Australian women have experienced [[sexual harassment]] and/or [[Sexual violence|sexual]] or physical [[violence]] in their lifetime. In 2018, it was reported that one in two women have experienced sexual harassment and one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is also important to note that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are more likely to experience sexual harassment and violence.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink" /&gt; In 2018, it was reported that these women experience violence at around twice the rate of non-Indigenous women.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink" /&gt;

==== Domestic Violence ====
{{Main|Domestic violence in Australia}}
Numerous Australian women have experienced [[domestic violence]] in their homes. In 2018, it was reported that one in five Australian women have experienced violence by an intimate partner since the age of 15.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was also reported in 2018 that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised from domestic violence than Australian women.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink" /&gt; As a result, intimate partner violence is the largest contributor to ill health, death, and disability for many women.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink" /&gt; This is larger than any other contributor to ill health for women such as obesity, alcohol, and illicit drugs.&lt;ref name="MakeTheLink" /&gt; Due to these high rates, it was estimated in 2015-2016 that domestic violence against women and their children was costing the Australian Government $22 billion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Gender and health===
Differences in health is illustrated through the data retrieved from the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|ABS]], where it gap between men and women in terms of [[life expectancy]]. In 1998, the life expectancy of men was 75.9 compared to 81.5 for women.&lt;ref&gt;Greig, Lewins, White, “Inequality in Australia”, p.60. Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Issues for Men ==

=== Homelessness ===
{{Main|Homelessness in Australia}}
Statistics regarding homelessness within Australia have revealed distinct variances in the experiences of differing genders.

Of people who stay in boarding houses and ‘sleep rough’, statistics were largely skewed towards the male population, 74.8% and 67.6% of the homeless population, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homelessnessaustralia.org.au/sites/homelessnessaus/files/2017-07/Homelessness%20and%20men.pdf|title=Homelessness and Men|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Homelessness Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, causes of homelessness differed amongst younger and older populations of homeless males. Whilst younger men aged 15-24 reported family breakdowns, older males were more likely to cite financial crisis, or an inability to afford housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homelessnessaustralia.org.au/sites/homelessnessaus/files/2017-07/Homelessness%20and%20men.pdf|title=Homelessness and Men|last=|first=|date=|website=Homelessness Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these sub-groups of the male homeless population, recent migrants to Australia were overrepresented, making up 15% of the homeless population. Within this 15%, 60% of migrants identified as male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/PrimaryMainFeatures/2049.0|title=Census of Population and Housing: Estimating Homelessness 2016|last=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=2018-03-14|website=Australian Bureau of Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence ===

==== Male Imprisonment ====
Within prisons throughout Australia, the male population makes up the majority of those imprisoned. Specifically in New South Wales, over 9 in 10 (92%) of prisoners were male.&lt;ref name="AusStats"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4517.0|title=Prisoners in Australia, 2017|last=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=2017-12-08|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of male prisoners has continued to increase in recent years. Growing from 398 to 406 prisoners per 100,000 male adult population.&lt;ref name="AusStats" /&gt;

Among the imprisoned population of Australia, there is a vast overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, accounting for just over a quarter (27%) of the Australian prisoner population. This is despite only accounting for 2% of the Australian population. These incarceration rates regarding male Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals have increased by 22.4% between 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref name="AusStats" /&gt;

==== Male Crime ====
{{Main|Crime in Australia}}
The male population of Australia disproportionately commits violence at a much higher rate than the rest of the Australian population.

A report released in Victoria by the Crime Statistics Agency reported that around 80% of all crime in Australia was committed by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crime Statistics Agency|date=2017|title=Alleged Offender Incidents|url=https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-crime-data/alleged-offender-incidents-3|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of scholars regard male supremacy as a driving force in over-representations of men within instances of violence and crime. Psychologist Torrey Orton reiterates this need to have power recognised and acknowledged by greater society therefore contributing to astronomical rates of male crime and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/we-know-violence-crime-and-masculinity-are-linked-its-time-to-look-at-why-and-how-to-stop-it-20171019-gz3zq3.html|title=We know violence, crime and masculinity are linked. It's time to look at why, and how to stop it|last=Gilmore|first=J|date=October 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Gilmore, 2017).  

=== Mental Health Issues and Addiction ===
Male’s mental health outcomes throughout Australia are disproportionate to those experienced by a number of populations in Australia.

Whilst Australian women are more likely to experience general mental illness than men,&lt;ref name="ABS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4326.0Main%20Features32007|title=National survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing: Summary of Results|last=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; across all Australian states and territories, men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/B090F03865A7FAB9CA257C1B0079E198/$File/rep13.pdf|title=National Mental Health Report 2013: tracking progress of mental health reform in Australia 1993 – 2011|last=Department of Health and Ageing|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this high prevalence of suicide amongst the Australian male population, only 27% of men sought out professional mental health services, compared to 40% of women.&lt;ref name="YoungMen"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/health/features/stories/2013/06/13/3781044.htm|title=Boys don't cry: young men and suicide. ABC Health and Wellbeing|last=White|first=C|date=June 2013|work=ABC Health and Wellbeing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men also had twice the rate of substance abuse compared to the general population.&lt;ref name="ABS" /&gt; This rate of substance abuse is also five times more likely amongst those who have previously been incarcerated,&lt;ref name="ABS" /&gt; which has been shown to be made up of, dominantly, the male population

In attempting to explain these disproportionate figures regarding men's mental health in Australia, a qualitative study into men’s suicide rates identified substantial misinterpretation of men regarding their behaviour and thinking (Player et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Player|first=Michael|date=2015|title=What Interrupts Suicide Attempts in Men: A Qualitative Study|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=6|pages=e0128180|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0128180|pmid=26090794|pmc=4474962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia has also stated that, "There's a belief that the very idea of being a man is that you deal with stuff and you don't reach out or connect. Untreated, the problem snowballs. The combination of that and the notion of having to deal with it alone, is the reason behind high suicide rates."&lt;ref name="YoungMen" /&gt; 

== Issues for Transgender and Non-Binary People ==

=== Wor'''k Life and Economics''' ===
The economic life of the gender diverse community in Australia is distinctly inconsistent compared to other populations throughout Australia.

In study conducted by Beyond Blue into the mental health of transgender Australians, a number of participants identified difficulty in finding employment. This difficulty stemmed directly from their gender identity.&lt;ref name="BeyondBlue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beyondblue.org.au/docs/default-source/research-project-files/bw0288_the-first-australian-national-trans-mental-health-study---summary-of-results.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title=The First Australian National Trans Mental Health Study: Summary of Results|last=Hyde|first=Z|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the same study, contributors also reported instances of loss of employment following the decision to transition, or during their transition process.&lt;ref name="BeyondBlue" /&gt;

Apart from difficulty in finding and retaining employment, pay rates for gender diverse individuals differ from those of the greater Australian community. Dawn Hough, director of support program ‘Pride in Diversity’, puts forth that pay equity rates for transgender and intersex individuals may be even lower than others in the LGBTQI community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prideinclusionprograms.com.au/gay-pay-gap-the-impact-of-orientation-on-salary-earnings-growth/|title=Gay Pay Gap: The impact of orientation on salary &amp; earnings growth|last=Hough|first=D|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal Discrimination ===
Within Australian society, transgender and other gender diverse peoples have experienced dramatic occurrences of harassment and discrimination.

These examples of harassment and discrimination occur in a variety of ways. Purposely misgendering an individual who identifies as gender diverse is an act of discrimination with severe ramifications for the mental health of transgender peoples. Australia came a close second to the United States of America in stating that they would intentionally misgender a trans person as an act of disrespect.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.finchannel.com/society/71094-global-attitudes-toward-transgender-people|title=Global Attitudes Toward Transgender People|last=|first=|date=2018|website=The Financial|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering these statistics, it is unsurprising that this same survey also found that only two in five cisgender individuals were willing to use correct pronouns when referring to transgender peoples.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even smaller, only one in five would use the gender neutral term ‘they’ when referring to non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Other occurrences of discrimination include forms of verbal and physical abuse. In terms of verbal abuse, around two in three (66%) of trans and gender diverse people reported that they had experienced verbal abuse based solely on their gender identity (Smith et al., 2014). This harassment was most often expressed by strangers calling out to them on streets, yet also involved abuse delivered by immediate family members in close confines (Smith et al., 2014).

More than one in five (21%), transgender and gender diverse individuals also stated that they had experienced physical abuse (Smith et al., 2014). These occurrences most often occurred on the street, yet were also closely followed by instances of violence at school and on public transport (Smith et al., 2014).

Unsurprisingly, the same study also revealed that 43% of trans and gender non-conforming individuals felt unsafe on public streets, with 32% also feeling unsafe on public transport (Smith et al., 2014).. It was also shown that transgender and gender diverse people actively avoided some public places for their own safety. These places were most often gendered spaces, including bathrooms and public change rooms (Smith et al., 2014).

=== Mental Health ===
Transgender and gender diverse individuals have been proven to have dramatically reduced mental health outcomes than the greater Australian population.

Trans individuals have been identified as a high-risk group for suicide, with one in five respondencts reporting they had thoughts of suicidal ideation or self-harm in at least half the days of the previous fortnight. Within the same survey, over half (57.2%) of respondents reported they had been diagnosed with depression, with younger individuals more likely to report poorer mental health than older respondents (Smith et al., 2014).

Authors of the study also identified trans women as being over five times more likely to commit suicide than the general population, whilst trans men were more than double (Smith et al., 2014). Authors of the study could not pinpoint the exact reasoning for this discrepancy in mental health outcomes even among trans individuals. However, those analysing this data reported that this might be due to trans women having fewer sources of support, as they more often live alone (Smith et al., 2014).. Authors also noted that trans women might find it more difficult to transition within society, due to the powerful effects of testosterone on bone structure (Smith et al., 2014).

In regards to factors affecting a positive effect on their mental health, transgender and gender diverse peoples reported that feeling acknowledged and supported in their gender identity along with feeling free to express their identity as they wish had positive repercussions on their mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014).

Factors that had distinct negative impacts on mental health included, obviously, discrimination and harassment (Smith et al., 2014). Other negative impacts included dysmorphia, due to being unable to ‘medically’ transition. This is often a result of excessive medical costs. Feeling unaccepted by friends and family, along with the general public also had distinct negative impacts on mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014).

=== Health Disparities ===
There are clear disparities in the mental health outcomes for that of the trans and gender diverse populations. However, disparities also arise in the provision of health services, along with experiences of general health outcomes

There is a distinct underutilisation of a number of medical and clinical health services among transgender and gender diverse individuals. A small Western Australian study conducted in 2006 with 50 transgender and gender diverse adults reported significant underutilisation of cervical pap smears and mammograms (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Health and Wellbeing Ministerial Advisory Committee, 2014).

It was also discovered that whilst often utilising the services of general practitioners, trans and gender diverse individuals had experienced a breadth of harassment and discrimination when accessing these health services (Riggs &amp; Due, 2013). Feelings of having to educate practitioners on their own gender identify especially led to participants feeling less respected (Riggs &amp; Due, 2013).

=== Issues in Transgender and Non-binary the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population ===
Western terminology is often inadequate in discussions regarding the gender identity of Indigenous communities. In an Australian context, the terminology of ‘sistergirls’ and ‘brotherboys’ is used to describe gender diverse Indigenous Australians (Toone 2015). It has been proven that these aspects of Indigenous identity existed long before western colonialism (Toone 2015).
The organisation Sisters and Brothers NT also state that, “There is documented evidence and oral history of Sistergirl identity in some communities pre-dating colonisation. A number of historic and contemporary words exist to describe Sistergirls including “Kwarte Kwarte” in Arrente, “Kungka Kungka” in Pitjantjatjara and Luritja, “Yimpininni” in Tiwi, “Karnta Pia” in Warlpiri which can be interpreted as “like a girl”. Whilst “Kungka Wati” in Pintipi and “Girriji Kati” in Waramungu literally mean “woman/man.” (Toone 2015)

Due to this intersection as members of the LGBTQI community and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the discrimination experienced by these individuals is at an extremely significant level, even when compared to the harassment experienced by other members of the transgender and gender diverse community (Kerry, 2015). These additional experiences of racism, even encountered within the LGBTQI community, along with facing transphobia within their traditional communities have led to distinct experiences of oppression unique to this community (Kerry, 2015).

Because of these misconceptions, many stereotypically "masculine-acting" gay men were exempt from public suspicion about their sexuality.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Eric|title=Homophobia (psychology and society)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1758377/homophobia|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==
Homohysteria is a concept established as part of Professor [[Eric Anderson (sociologist)|Eric Anderson]]'s [[Inclusive Masculinity]] Theory. Both Eric Anderson and Mark McCormack argue that there are three social conditions that must be met for a homohysteric culture to exist: (1) widespread awareness that male [[homosexuality]] exists as an immutable sexual orientation within a significant portion of a culture's population; (2) high levels of [[homophobia]] in that culture; and (3) an association of gender [[wikt:atypical|atypicality]] with homosexuality. These varying levels of social conditions help explain various social trends concerning [[masculinities]].&lt;ref name=link.springer.com&gt;{{cite web|title=The Influence of Declining Homophobia on Men's Gender in the United States: An Argument for the Study of Homohysteria|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-014-0358-8 |doi = 10.1007/s11199-014-0358-8 | date = 2014-08-01 |author1 = Eric Anderson |author2 = Mark McCormack |publisher = Springer US |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, homohysteria helps explain how men in many Islamic countries are permitted to engage in physical and emotional intimacy (including hand-holding) without threat to their publicly perceived heterosexual identities; whereas two men holding hands in America are perceived as gay, men in Islamic countries are not considered homosexual for partaking in the same behaviours.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt; This is due to a belief that men in these societies could not be gay, with Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] claiming Iran had no gay people, and others declaring homosexuality to be the "white man's disease".&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

Likewise, homohysteria has the ability to explain nuances between male tactility over time, with the work of John Ibson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1588340554/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me= |title = Picturing Men: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography |date = 2002 |author = John Ibson |accessdate = 17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; found a decrease in social distance between men in group photographs, which can be understood through utilising homohysteria. This concept has been utilised in explaining homophobia and gender policing among females also;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Meridith G. F. Worthen|title=The Cultural Significance of Homophobia on Heterosexual Women's Gendered Experiences in the United States: A Commentary|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-014-0389-1#page-1|publisher=Springer US|accessdate=17 February 2015|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0389-1|date=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily by Rachael Bullingham in her exploration of the athletes experiences in team sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Eric|last2=Bullingham|first2=Rachael|title=Openly lesbian team sport athletes in an era of decreasing homohysteria|url=http://irs.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/06/06/1012690213490520.abstract|publisher=International Review for the Sociology of Sport|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western homohysteria is believed by Eric Anderson to have peaked in the 1980s, following the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic amongst gay men.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

== Impact ==
As a culture becomes less homophobic and there is less of a [[Social stigma|stigma]] around physical platonic affection between men, the lives of heterosexual men are improved, as they are less aggressive and physically alienated from one another.&lt;ref name="sex roles"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCormack|first1=Mark|last2=Anderson|first2=Eric|title=Homohysteria: Definitions, Context and Intersectionality|journal=Sex Roles|date=7 August 2014|volume=71|issue=3-4|pages=152–158|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-014-0401-9|accessdate=23 November 2014|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0401-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Burundi]] is a source country for children and possibly women subjected to [[trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[involuntary servitude|involuntary]] [[domestic servitude]] and [[forced prostitution]]. Children and young adults may also be coerced into [[forced labor]] on plantations or small farms in southern Burundi, or to conduct informal commerce in the streets. Some traffickers are the victims’ family members or friends who, under the pretext of assisting underprivileged children with education or with false promises of lucrative jobs, subject them to forced labor, most commonly as [[domestic servant]]s. While there is little evidence of large-scale [[child prostitution]], “benevolent” older females offer vulnerable younger girls room and board within their homes, and in some cases eventually push them into [[prostitution]] to pay for living expenses; extended family members also financially profit from the [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|commercial sexual exploitation of young relatives]] residing with them. Male tourists from Oman and the United Arab Emirates exploit Burundian girls in prostitution. Businessmen recruit Burundian girls for [[commercial sexual exploitation]] in [[Prostitution in Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[Prostitution in Kenya|Kenya]], and [[Prostitution in Uganda|Uganda]], and recruit boys and girls for [[Child exploitation|exploitation]] in various types of forced labor in [[Human trafficking in Tanzania|Tanzania]]. Unlike in past years, there were no reports of [[Forced conscription|forced]] or voluntary recruitment of children into government armed forces or [[rebel groups]] during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government made clear progress in combating trafficking during the reporting period, particularly with regard to identifying trafficking victims, investigating potential trafficking offenses, and raising public awareness. In 2009, a Bujumbura court heard a case involving [[child slavery|child domestic servitude]], the first known prosecution of a case involving elements of a human trafficking offense. Significant work remains, however, in educating government officials and local populations about the nature of human trafficking, bringing cases to trial, and providing protective services to victims.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Burundi". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. State Department]]'s [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 3"]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The [[Government of Burundi|government’s]] anti-trafficking [[law enforcement]] efforts increased during the reporting period, particularly its efforts to detect and investigate suspected human trafficking offenses. This progress continued, however, to be hampered by lack of investigative equipment and training, poor evidence gathering by [[police]], the unwillingness of victims to lodge [[criminal complaint|complaints]], and the failure of [[prosecutor]]s to vigorously pursue cases after receiving [[evidence]] from police and suspected victims. Articles 242 and 243 of Burundi’s [[criminal code]] prohibit human trafficking and [[smuggling]], and prescribe sentences of five to 20 years’ [[imprisonment]]; the code does not, however, provide a definition of human trafficking, limiting its utility. [[Sex trafficking]] offenses can also be punished using [[penal code]] statutes on [[brothel]]-keeping and [[pimping]] (penalties of one to five years’ imprisonment), as well as child prostitution (penalties of five to 10 years’ imprisonment). These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious offenses, such as [[rape]]. The criminal code prescribes no explicit penalties for forced labor, though it is prohibited by Article 2 of the labor law.

A Bujumbura court fined a woman $42 for abusing her 12-year-old domestic servant by burning her with melted plastic bags. Upon her [[arrest]], police located the child’s aunt, who returned the child to her parents in Bururi province. In August 2009, police arrested a Burundian man for [[kidnapping]] six boys between the ages of 12 and 13 and transporting them to Tanzania for forced labor in tobacco fields. The suspect’s provisional release was revoked after an appeal from the prosecutor’s office, and he remains in pre-trial detention in Rutana Province prison. Throughout 2009, the Women and Children’s Brigade, a specialized police unit, successfully identified and rescued 10 of 17 child victims exploited by an international [[prostitution ring]] and returned them to their families; the alleged traffickers have not been arrested due to a lack of concrete evidence. In January 2010, police charged three men and their landlord with [[corruption of minors]] and incitement to [[Lust|debauchery]] after the former were found pimping underage girls from a rental house; the [[prosecution]] remained in the pre-trial stage at the end of the reporting period. During a December 2009 meeting with high-ranking police officials, [[Pierre Nkurunziza|President Nkurunziza]] instructed the police force to increase efforts to fight human trafficking. As a result of this mandate, police initiated a crackdown on clandestine brothels that housed potential trafficking victims in January 2010, shutting down three small hotels in the industrial quarter of Bujumbura. The government did not provide trafficking-specific training for law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
Despite its notable efforts to return trafficked children to their families, the government did not adequately ensure that trafficking victims received access to necessary protective services during the reporting period. The few care centers that exist in Burundi are operated by [[NGO]]'s, religious organizations, and women’s or children’s associations. Police provided limited shelter and food assistance to victims in temporary [[police custody]] while authorities attempted to locate their families; these children were housed in a holding area separate from adult [[detainee]]s. In some instances, the police, especially members of the Women and Children’s Brigade, provided counseling to children in prostitution and mediated between these victims and their parents. In January 2010, police rescued three [[Child sex trade|child sex trafficking]] victims from a brothel in Bujumbura, documented their [[testimony|testimonies]], and returned them to their families. In 2009, government officials identified 18 trafficking victims, 10 of whom were victims of forced prostitution and eight of whom were victims of forced labor. In January 2010, Burundi’s [[Interpol]] office assisted the government in repatriating a 15-year-old Burundian boy from Rwanda where he was forced to work as a domestic servant. In cooperation with Tanzanian police, the government repatriated six Burundian child trafficking victims from [[prostitution in Tanzania|Tanzania]] in July 2009. Between April and June, the National Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration oversaw the demobilization and short-term care of the final 380 [[child soldier]]s from the [[National Forces of Liberation|Forces Nationale de Libération]] (FNL) rebel group and from among alleged FNL dissidents in the Randa and Buramata sites. With outside funding, the Commission’s staff provided medical screening, [[psychological counseling|psychosocial counseling]], and sensitization on peaceful [[cohabitation]], while conducting family tracing; the children were reunited with their families in July 2009.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

In October 2009, the government established a Municipal Council for Children and Youth (CMEJ) to assist at-risk youth and develop a transit center for victims of human trafficking, demobilized child soldiers, and [[street children]]. The CMEJ began drafting an action plan in March 2010 and sought the necessary international funding to become fully operational. The government has not developed a system for proactively identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations or a referral process to transfer such trafficking victims to organizations providing services. While police interviewed child victims during the investigations of their abusers, the prosecutor’s office did not pursue the possibility of child victims' participation in prosecutions of trafficking offenders. The government did not inappropriately incarcerate or otherwise penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Burundian law did not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their [[deportation|removal]] to a country where they may face hardship or [[Revenge|retribution]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made clear progress in its efforts to prevent trafficking during the year. In February 2010, the Commander of the Women and Children’s Brigade began a tour of the country to sensitize local government officials and inform local populations on the danger of human trafficking. In 2009, the Ministry of Labor sponsored eight workshops for teachers, magistrates, communal administrators, and agricultural workers to raise awareness of the dangers of [[child labor]] and [[child trafficking|trafficking]]. In partnerships with the ILO and UNICEF, it also conducted a sensitization campaign in several provinces to warn against child trafficking for forced labor and abusing former child soldiers, centered on the [[World Day Against Child Labour]] in June. The Ministry of Labor’s 12 inspectors conducted no child labor inspections in 2009. The government did not undertake efforts to reduce demand for [[commercial sex acts]] during the reporting period. The pre-deployment anti-trafficking training for Burundian [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]], provided by a foreign government, included a curriculum that created awareness and discouraged acts of trafficking and [[sexual exploitation]]. Burundi is not a party to the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|2000 UN TIP Protocol]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1637">The  '''[[Indo-Portuguese]] Creole of [[Bombay]]''' was a [[creole language|creole]] language based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which grew out of the long contact between the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and local languages. Currently this language is extinct. It was spoken in [[Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]) and northern [[India]]: [[Pathein|Bassein]], [[Salsette]], [[Thane|Thana]], [[Chevai]], [[Mahim]], [[Tecelaria]], [[Dadar]], [[Parel]], [[Cavel]], [[Bandora, Goa|Bandora]]-[[Badra, India|Badra]], Govai, Marol, [[Andheri]], [[Versova, Mumbai|Versova]], [[Malvan]], [[Manori]], [[Mazagaon]]. This language was, after the [[Ceylon]] creole dialect of Indo-Portuguese, the most important. In 1906 there were still close to 5,000 people who spoke [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] Creole as their mother tongue, 2,000 in [[Mumbai]] and [[Mahim]], 1000 in [[Bandora, Goa|Bandora]], 500 in [[Thane|Thana]], 100 in Curla (now [[Kurla]]), 50 in [[Pathein|Bassein]] and 1,000 in other towns.

'''Irú''' or Eware (Edo) is a type of fermented and processed [[Parkia biglobosa|locust beans]] (''Parkia biglobosa'') used as a condiment in cooking. It is similar to [[ogiri]] and [[douchi]].  It is very popular among the [[Yoruba people]] and [[Edo people]] of [[Nigeria]]. It is used in cooking traditional [[soup]]s like [[egusi soup]], okro soup, [[Corchorus|Ewedu soup]] and [[ogbono soup]].
Among the [[Manding languages|Manding]]-speaking people of West Africa irú is known as [[sumbala]].The Yorubas classify iru into two types: '''Iru Woro''' which is commonly use in making stew and '''Iru Pete''' which is used in making [[ewedu]] and [[egusi]] soup.

It can be found fresh or dried. The fresh variety is usually wrapped in [[Moin moin|moimoi]] [[Thaumatococcus daniellii|leaves]] , which are similar in appearance and texture to [[banana]] leaves. It has a very pungent smell.

The dried variety is flattened into discs or cakes for sale. Dried iru is weaker in flavor and pungency than fresh (though frying dried iru in cooking oil will restore much of the flavor). The dried variety stores very well in [[freezers]].

The most valuable part of the locust beans are high in lipid(29%), protein(35%), and carbohydrate(16%). It is a good source of calcium and fat for rural dwellers.

During fermentation, the reducing sugar content increases, and the total free amino acid content initially decreases; in the end, however, there is a large increase in free amino acid content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/q747434442605863/ | doi=10.1007/BF01577698 | volume=6 | title=Biochemical changes in fermented melon (egusi) seeds (Citrullis vulgaris) | year=1990 | journal=Journal of Industrial Microbiology | pages=211–214

[[File:Jim Fyffe.jpg|thumb|Jim Fyffe]]

'''James William Fyffe''' (November 20, 1945 – May 15, 2003) was a United States sportscaster and radio talk-show host best known as the play-by-play announcer for [[Auburn Tigers football]] and [[Auburn Tigers basketball|basketball]].

==Career==
A native of [[Paintsville, Kentucky]], Fyffe became [[Auburn Tigers|Auburn's]] play-by-play announcer in 1981 and spent 22 seasons calling Auburn football games. His signature "TOUCHDOWN AUBURN" call was beloved by Auburn fans. During his tenure as the voice of the [[Auburn Tigers]], Fyffe shared the Auburn broadcast booth with three former Auburn [[quarterback]]s.  [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]], the 1971 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner was the color commentator from 1981 to 1985. When Sullivan joined the Auburn coaching staff in 1986, he was replaced by Charlie Trotman, the [[Auburn Tigers|Tigers]] quarterback from 1977 to 1979. When Trotman stepped down after the 2000 season, [[Stan White (quarterback)|Stan White]] (the [[Auburn Tigers|Tigers]] quarterback from 1990 to 1993) replaced him and worked with Fyffe during his final two seasons in the broadcast booth.

Fyffe also called [[Auburn Tigers basketball|Auburn basketball]] for 22&amp;nbsp;years. During basketball games, Fyffe was known to say "hello" to an Auburn player's home town following a [[slam dunk]]. According to Fyffe, this tradition started after [[Charles Barkley]] asked him to say hello to all the people in [[Leeds, Alabama]], [[Charles Barkley|Barkley's]] hometown. Fyffe told [[Charles Barkley|Barkley]] that he would have to dunk the ball for him to do that.  [[Charles Barkley|Barkley]] did, and thus began a tradition that Fyffe continued throughout his years behind the Auburn microphone. Fyffe also hosted "Tiger Talk", the Auburn Network's weekly radio call-in show until 1998, when [[Rod Bramblett]] succeeded him.

Fyffe would end every broadcast by saying, "My time's up, I thank you for yours."  He would occasionally alter the phrase to be, "Our time's up, we thank you for yours."

Fyffe was also the play-by-play announcer for the [[United States Football League|USFL's]] [[Birmingham Stallions]], [[Birmingham Steeldogs]] and [[Columbus Wardogs]] of the [[Arena Football League]]. He was also the public address announcer for [[Talladega Superspeedway]] for 20&amp;nbsp;years, and was associated with the [[Blue–Gray Football Classic]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].

Fyffe was a pioneer in sports-talk radio in Alabama, hosting one of the first such shows in Montgomery in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&amp;view=company&amp;srctype=display&amp;back=company&amp;id=332&amp;pos=75,15,248&amp;PHPSESSID=ef5e403804212fc97ca893a5d1cab25b&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death, Fyffe hosted a sports-talk show on [[WGMP|WACV]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].

==Death==
On May 14, 2003, Fyffe attended an Auburn alumni meeting in [[Prattville, Alabama]] where he gave a speech opening for Auburn head football coach [[Tommy Tuberville]]. Shortly after arriving home, he complained of a headache to his wife, Rose, and eventually collapsed. He was rushed by ambulance to Montgomery's Jackson Hospital where he was diagnosed with a [[brain aneurysm]]. Fyffe was removed from life support and pronounced dead at approximately 10:00 AM on May 15, 2003. Following the announcement of his death, many [[sports talk show]]s and [[Alabama]] TV newscasts played some of his most notable calls, and allowed fans and colleagues of Fyffe to share some of their favorite stories and voice grief over the loss. A public memorial service for Fyffe was held in Montgomery at Leak Memory Chapel, followed by a public funeral at First United Methodist Church. Fyffe is buried at [[Greenwood Cemetery (Montgomery, Alabama)|Greenwood Cemetery]] in Montgomery, Alabama.

Fyffe was survived by his wife Rose, five children, five grandchildren and one great grandchild.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocm.auburn.edu/news_releases/fyffe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose Fyffe died on June 5, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Rose-Fyffe&amp;lc=4338&amp;pid=151610720&amp;mid=4698468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Fyffe was named Alabama Sportscaster of the Year nine times during his career, and received numerous honors from the [[Auburn University]] Board of Trustees, the Alabama State Legislature, the Montgomery City Council, and the Auburn Alumni Association.

He was posthumously inducted into the [[Alabama Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&amp;view=company&amp;srctype=display&amp;back=company&amp;id=332&amp;pos=75,15,248&amp;PHPSESSID=ef5e403804212fc97ca893a5d1cab25b&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Rod Bramblett]] succeeded Fyffe in the Auburn broadcast booth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarkecountydemocrat.com/news/2003/0626/Sports/077.html&lt;/ref&gt;  During each football game broadcast, Bramblett remembers Fyffe by using his signature "Touchdown Auburn" call at least once during the course of a broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sponsorship/aub-footbl-radio-ads.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fyffe suffered from [[diabetes]] during his life. Upon his death, the Jim Fyffe Diabetes Research Fund at Auburn University was created in his memory. The fund supports graduate students conducting diabetes research and provides funding for diabetes research projects. The fund was established by [[Auburn University]], the [[Auburn Network]] and Fyffe's widow, Rose Fyffe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vetmed.auburn.edu/index.pl/fyffefund&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorable calls==

===1987:  Auburn at Georgia Tech===
In his autobiography, Fyffe admitted that this call, from the October 17, 1987 game at [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] was probably the call he was most known for, and he considered it the second greatest Auburn win at the time the book was written (1996). This call is on every collection of memorable radio calls released by the Auburn Network, and it was the call that [[Paul Finebaum]] played to open his show on the day of Fyffe's death.

Auburn was heavily favored in the game with [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]], and this game was to be the last yearly meeting between the two rivals. But with 4:01 to play in the game, Auburn trailed 10-7 and needed to go 91-yards to score. The Tigers moved down the field behind the passing of quarterback Jeff Burger and, 16 plays later, were at the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] four-yard-line with only 29&amp;nbsp;seconds to play:

{{cquote|''...they have two tight ends in the game, one setback is Harris, here is motion by Donaldson back to the near side and now reverses his field, goes to the wide side of the field.  Burger sets up to throw...OH MY TOUCHDOWN AUBURN! TOUCHDOWN AUBURN! TOUCHDOWN AUBURN! TILLMAN, TILLMAN, TILLMAN...TILLMAN...AT THE BASELINE OF THE END ZONE!  A BULLET BY BURGER!  AUBURN GOES AHEAD!  UNBELIEVABLE!  UNBELIEVABLE!  TILLMAN FROM BURGER!  TOUCHDOWN AUBURN!  13-10 TIGERS LEAD!''}}

The pass from Jeff Burger to receiver Lawyer Tillman completed a 17 play, 91-yard drive and the PAT gave Auburn a 14-10 lead. The Tigers' [[Aundray Bruce]] completed the scoring by returning a tipped pass for a [[touchdown]] on the last play of the game, and Auburn won 20-10. Fyffe received some criticism from the call...mainly, he said, from [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]] fans. Some in the media criticized him, saying they couldn't tell what was happening. Of the call, Fyffe said, "Frankly, in listening to the replay of the call through the years, I've never thought it was my best.  I probably did go too crazy, but I think the listener could tell what was going on without any problem.  No matter what I think about it, Auburn fans still come up to me and tell me it was the best call they've ever heard.  And that's what matters."

===1993:  Alabama at Auburn===
Under new head coach [[Terry Bowden]], Auburn had reached the season ending game with [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]] undefeated at 10-0. The Crimson Tide was 8-1-1 and were the defending National Champions. Normally, a game of this magnitude would've been played before a national television audience. But Auburn was under [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sanctions and were not allowed to appear on television during 1993. This was Alabama's second trip to [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]] and, due to the magnitude of the game, the two schools set up a closed-circuit television feed to [[Bryant–Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. Fyffe set the scene this way as he opened the broadcast of the game on the Auburn Network:

{{cquote|''At a remote outpost in frozen South Korea an army sergeant tunes his radio to the Armed Forces Network to listen as he pulls guard duty along the DMZ.  A Selma native living in Fairbanks, Alaska is hosting a listening party today with his friends who'll hear the game via telephone all decked out in orange and blue.  A sellout crowd of 85,000 will watch in person, while 44,000 more who scarfed up all the available tickets will view a closed circuit telecast in Tuscaloosa, making this the only game to sell out two stadiums at one time.  It impacts the lives of just about everyone who lives here or ever has.  If your team wins, seashells and balloons, but losing means a whole year of pure agony.  It's the annual meeting between Auburn and Alabama.  Hello everybody!  War Eagle from Jordan–Hare stadium!''}}

Auburn trailed 14-5 at halftime having mustered only a field goal and a sack of Alabama quarterback [[Jay Barker]] for a safety. Midway through the third quarter, the Auburn offense began its best drive of the game, moving from its own 30&amp;nbsp;yard-line to the Alabama 31. But three plays later, senior quarterback [[Stan White (quarterback)|Stan White]] was knocked out of the game with a knee injury. Rather than punt or attempt a long field goal, Bowden elected to send backup quarterback [[Patrick Nix]] into the game with a fourth down play:

{{cquote|''...so it's fourth down and 14 to go.  Nix this time will go for it with 6:22 left in the third period, Auburn trailing 14-5.  Out of the shotgun, Patrick Nix.  Alabama bringing everybody.  Nix is gonna float one for Sanders, Sanders OH HE CAUGHT IT AT THE TWO!  AND HE DIVES IN!  TOUCHDOWN AUBURN!  TOUCHDOWN AUBURN!  OH MY GOODNESS!  SANDERS WENT UP OVER TOMMY JOHNSON OR ANTONIO LANGHAM, HE CAUGHT THE BALL AT THE TWO, HOW HE HELD IT I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE DIVED INTO THE ENDZONE, AND AUBURN'S RIGHT BACK IN THE THICK OF IT, WITH A BACKUP QUARTERBACK, TRAILING 14-11!  A 35-YARD PASS PLAY, PATRICK NIX TO FRANK SANDERS!''}}

Fyffe's voice was noticeably hoarse during the call and, in his autobiography, Fyffe stated that his voice was noticeably weak at the start of the game, a game he considered one of the biggest of his career due to the magnitude of the game, and the fact the game wasn't on television. He continued, however, and watched as Auburn took the lead on a Scott Etheridge field goal, and, with 2:32 left in the game, Fyffe made his second memorable call as James Bostic sealed the victory:

{{cquote|''Two and a half minutes to play, actually 2:32 to go, on a first down play...here up the middle Bostic, five yards, 10 yards, 45 Bostic, 50 Bostic!  Racing to the 45 to the 40, breaking a tackle at the 30, to the 20, to the 10, HE'S GONE!  TOUCHDOWN, AUBURNNNNNNNNNNN!''}}

The Tigers won 22-14 and finished 11-0 for the first time in the school's history.

===1999:  Ole Miss at Auburn (Basketball)===
Though he was most known for his memorable football calls, Fyffe grew up loving college basketball. In his autobiography, Fyffe mentioned the legendary [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] announcer [[Cawood Ledford]] as one of his favorites.

Fyffe's basketball calls are most likely less memorable due to Auburn's struggles in basketball during most of his career. That was not the case during the 1998–99 season as the Tigers dominated the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] en route to a #1 seed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] tournament. On February 10, 1999, Auburn hosted [[Ole Miss Rebels|Ole Miss]] before a sellout crowd at [[Beard-Eaves Memorial Coliseum]] and a national television audience on [[ESPN]]. Fyffe called the game on the Auburn Network along with color analyst Joe Dean, Jr. Auburn started fast and led 18-4 when a missed basket by the Rebels led to an Auburn [[fast break]]. The result of the play provides an example of Fyffe's slam dunk call:

{{cquote|Jim Fyffe:  ''...outlet pass to Robinson.  Auburn threatening to break it open, lead pass...AND A BEHIND THE BACK DUNK, OVER THE SHOULDER, BY BRYANT SMITH, OLE MISS WANTS A TIMEOUT...HELLO HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA!  IT'S 20-4, AUBURN, AND THIS PLACE IS GOING WACKO!''

Joe Dean, Jr.:  ''That was absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!''

Jim Fyffe:  ''All you folks on ESPN, I'll bet you got an eyefull there.''}}

The Tigers would win the game 95-66.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/1999/02/09/auburn_olemiss/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Holdren taught at Harvard for 13 years and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for more than two decades.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; His work has focused on the causes and consequences of global [[environmental change]], population control, energy technologies and [[energy policy|policies]], ways to reduce the dangers from [[nuclear weapons]] and materials, and science and [[technology policy]].&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsrelease"/&gt; He has also taken measures to contextualize the United State's current energy challenge, noting the role that nuclear energy could play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Amy |last=Marcott |title=Science Advisor John Holdren ’65, SM ’66 Contextualizes Energy Challenge |url=http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2010/10/26/science-advisor-john-holdren-%e2%80%9965-sm-%e2%80%9966-contextualizes-energy-challenge/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201095534/http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2010/10/26/johnholdren/ |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |work=Slice of MIT |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdren was involved in the famous [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]] in 1980. He, along with two other scientists helped [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] establish the bet with [[Julian Simon]], in which they bet that the price of five key metals would be higher in 1990. The bet was centered around a disagreement concerning the future scarcity of resources in an increasingly polluted and heavily populated world. Ehrlich and Holdren lost the bet, when the price of metals had decreased by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdren was chair of the Executive Committee of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] from 1987 until 1997 and delivered the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance lecture on behalf of Pugwash Conferences in December 1995. From 1993 until 2003, he was chair of the [[Committee on International Security and Arms Control]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and Co-Chairman of the bipartisan National Committee on Energy Policy from 2002 until 2007. Holdren was elected [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) (2006–2007), and served as board Chairman (2007–2008).&lt;ref name="newsrelease"/&gt; He was the founding chair of the advisory board for ''[[Innovations (journal)|Innovations]]'', a quarterly journal about entrepreneurial solutions to global challenges published by MIT Press, and has written and lectured extensively on the topic of [[global warming]].

Holdren served as one of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s science advisors (PCAST) from 1994 to 2001.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; Eight years later, President Barack Obama nominated Holdren for the position of science advisor and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in December 2008, and he was [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] on March 19, 2009, by a unanimous vote in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Staff and news service reports.

===Writings===
[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] was an early concern and interest. In a 1969 article, Holdren and co-author [[Paul R.

'''Joseph Bramah''' (13 April 1748&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9016192/Joseph-Bramah|title=Bramah, Joseph. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2008 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; –  9 December 1814), born Stainborough Lane Farm, Stainborough, [[Barnsley]] [[Yorkshire]], was an English [[inventor]] and [[locksmith]]. He is best known for having invented the [[hydraulic press]]. Along with [[William George Armstrong]], he can be considered one of the two fathers of hydraulic engineering.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Early life==
He was the second son in the family of Joseph Bramma (note the different spelling of the surname), a farmer, and his wife, Mary Denton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bramah Genealogy|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Bramah_Genealogy|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the local school in [[Silkstone]] and on leaving school he was apprenticed to a local carpenter. On completing his apprenticeship he moved to [[London]], where he started work as a cabinet-maker. In 1783 he married Mary Lawton of [[Mapplewell]], near [[Barnsley]], and the couple set up home in London. They subsequently had a daughter and four sons. The couple lived first at 124 Piccadilly, but later moved to Eaton Street, Pimlico.

==Improved water closet==
In London, Bramah worked for a Mr Allen, installing water closets (toilets) which were designed to a patent obtained by [[Alexander Cumming]] in 1775. He found that the current model being installed in London houses had a tendency to freeze in cold weather. Although it was Allen who improved the design by replacing the usual slide valve with a hinged flap that sealed the bottom of the bowl, 
Bramah obtained the patent for it in 1778,&lt;ref name=skempton70/&gt; and began making toilets at a workshop in Denmark Street, [[St Giles, London|St Giles]]. The design was a success and production continued well into the 19th century.

His original water closets are still working in [[Osborne House]], [[Queen Victoria]]'s home on the [[Isle of Wight]].

==Bramah Locks company==
{{Main article|Bramah lock}}
After attending some lectures on technical aspects of [[Lock (security device)|lock]]s, Bramah designed a lock of his own, receiving a patent for it in 1784. In the same year he started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, which is today based in Fitzrovia, London and Romford, Essex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bramah.co.uk/ accessed 2 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The locks produced by his company were famed for their resistance to [[lock picking]] and tampering, and the company famously had a "[[Challenge Lock]]" displayed in the window of their London shop from 1790 mounted on a board containing the inscription:

''The artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock shall receive 200 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] the moment it is produced.''
[[File:Crystal Palace from the northeast from Dickinson's Comprehensive Pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851. 1854.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Exhibition]] 1851]]
The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, the American locksmith [[Alfred Charles Hobbs]] was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.

The Challenge Lock is in the [[Science Museum of London|Science Museum]] in [[London]]. An examination of the lock shows that it has been rebuilt since Hobbs picked it. Originally it had 18 iron slides and 1 central spring; it now has 13 steel slides, each with its own spring.

Bramah received a second patent for a lock design in 1798.

==Machine tools==
[[File:Lathe.PNG|thumb|left|250px|A metalworking [[lathe]] from 1911 showing component parts]]
Partly due to the precision requirements of his locks, Bramah spent much time developing [[machine tool]]s to assist manufacturing processes. He relied heavily on the expertise of [[Henry Maudslay]] whom he employed in his workshop from the age of 18. Between them they created a number of innovative machines that made the production of Bramah's locks more efficient, and were applicable to other fields of manufacture.

Just before Bramah died, his workshops also employed [[Joseph Clement]] who among other things made several contributions in the field of [[lathe]] design.

==Hydraulic press==
Bramah's most important invention was the [[hydraulic press]]. The hydraulic press depends on [[Pascal's principle]], that pressure throughout a closed system is constant. The press had two cylinders and pistons of different cross-sectional areas. If a force was exerted on the smaller piston, this would be translated into a larger force on the larger piston. The difference in the two forces would be proportional to the difference in area of the two pistons. In effect the cylinders act in a similar way that a lever is used to increase the force exerted. Bramah was granted a patent for his hydraulic press in 1795.

Bramah's hydraulic press had many industrial applications and still does today. At the time Bramah was bringing his concepts to fruition, the field of hydraulic engineering was an almost unknown science.  Bramah and [[William George Armstrong]] were the two pioneers in the field.

The hydraulic press is still known as the Bramah Press after its inventor.

==Other inventions==
Bramah was a very prolific inventor, though not all of his inventions were as important as his hydraulic press. They included: a [[beer engine]] (1797), a planing machine (1802), a paper-making machine (1805), a machine for automatically printing [[banknote|bank notes]] with sequential serial numbers (1806), and a fountain pen (1809). He also patented the first [[extrusion]] process for making lead pipes and also machinery for making gun stocks (Patent No. 2652).&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, H. (1986). "A Dictionary of London Gunmakers" p59&lt;/ref&gt;
His greatest contribution to engineering was his insistence on quality control. He realised that for engines to succeed, they would have to be machined to a much better standard than was the practice. He taught [[Arthur Woolf]] to machine engines to a close tolerance. This enabled Cornish engines to run with high-pressure steam, vastly increasing their output. Woolf became the leading Cornish steam engineer and his designs were adopted by all the engine designers of the day. The 15-HP engines of Watt and others of circa 1800 gave way to 450-HP engines by 1835. Bramah can be viewed as a founding father in industrial quality control.

==Death==
One of Bramah's last inventions was a hydrostatic press capable of uprooting trees. This was put to work at Holt Forest in [[Hampshire]]. While superintending this work Bramah caught a cold, which developed into pneumonia. He died at Holt Forest on 9 December 1814. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, [[Paddington]].

In 2006 a pub in [[Barnsley]] town centre was opened named the Joseph Bramah in his memory.

==Patents==
Bramah was a prolific inventor, and obtained 18 patents for his designs between 1778 and 1812.&lt;ref name=skempton70&gt;Skempton (2002), p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keypad Polling''' is a wireless [[Voting|polling]] technology. It can be used to enable community participation in events and to bring a focus to discussion and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebmtools.org/roadmap/keypad-polling.html Short description of keypad polling]&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of this technology comprises a number of hand held [[keypad]]s (similar to TV [[remote control]]s) which communicate using radio frequencies with a base station. This base station is connected to a laptop computer which in turn is linked to a [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] projector that displays onto a [[projection screen]]. Participants vote anonymously by selecting the number on their keypad that best represents their preference. The result of the group vote is displayed on the projection screen within seconds. The project team also works with clients to prepare suitable questionnaires and produce report documents that analyse voting results.

The '''Mbanderu''' (''Ovambanderu'') are a population inhabiting eastern parts of [[Namibia]] and western parts of [[Botswana]].  They speak [[Herero language|Herero]] (''Otjiherero''), a [[Bantu language]].

==History and Culture==

===Etymology===
While earlier theories of the meaning of the word ''mbanderu'' stated "People of the [[Reed bed|reed]]" (''mbandu'': people and ''oruu'': reed),&lt;ref name=Sundermeier&gt;{{Cite book

===Origins===
Results from investigations about similarities in their music point to [[East Africa]] as the origin of the all [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes that today inhabit Namibia. The [[Ovambo people]] left this area first and settled in the north of today's Namibia, the [[Herero people]] left after that, and the Ovambanderu migrated last.&lt;ref name=Sundermeier/&gt; In the 19th century the Ovambanderu had reached Angola and moved from there into [[Kaokoland]] and [[Ovamboland]] but got into fights with already resident [[Herero people|Herero]] tribes and subsequently settled in the eastern part of [[South-West Africa]].&lt;ref name=Tonchi/&gt; After reaching the area around [[Okakarara]] the Ovambanderu spread out to find suitable pasture for their cattle.&lt;ref name=Sundermeier/&gt;

Around 1904, after a devastating clash with German colonial forces in Namibia, many of the Mbanderu people settled along the [[Boteti River]] around Tsienyane. The area was already settled by other peoples; thus they requested to be allocated their own land where they could practice their own culture without any hindrance. 

===Culture===
Two important cultural notions among all Herero-speaking groups are ''ejanda'' and ''oruzo.'' These are generally synonymous with matrilineage and patrilineage, respectively. The recognition of lineal ancestry through both mothers and through fathers is generally known as [[double descent]]. "''Ejanda''" identity is important in determining who one should marry; two people in exactly the same ''''ejanda'''' should not marry each other. In the past, marriage partners may have been determined at the birth of a girl by her parents. In many cases, the groom was much older than the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Double Descent and Its Correlates among the Herero of Ngamiland1 GD Gibson American Anthropologist 58 (1), 109-139&lt;/ref&gt;"''Oruzo''" is associated with traditional religious practice and with political leadership.  It is symbolized in part by prohibitions about raising and eating particular kinds of animals.

Cattle are central in the economic and spiritual life of Ovambanderu. Not only are cattle a central source of meat, sour milk ''[[omaere]]'', and fat (''ongondivi''), they have also played a symbolic role in the relation of people to their ancestors. In the past, the male head of a residential group conducted rituals at the holy fire (''''okuruwo''''), for instance, tasting the milk, on behalf of those residing there. Choosing a cow to be used during these rituals was at the discretion of the owner of the cattle. The milk from this cow used could not be drunk by uncircumcised Mbanderu or outsiders. 

Using dogs and traps are the traditional methods of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibiana.de/de/at-the-edge-of-the-kalahari-historical-colour-photographs-of-tswana-chiefdoms-and-hereros-in-exile.htmlItemid=58|title=Historical Colour Photographs of Tswana Chiefdoms and Hereros in Exile|accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;Since the 19th century, horses and guns have also been used.

Mbanderu people are active in annual remembrance ceremonies held in Namibia and Botswana at the graves of important cultural leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Gewald, Jan-Bart (1998). "Herero Annual Parades: Commemorating to Create". pp. 131–151.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are particularly associated with the "Green Flag" (''Otjingirine'').

[[File:Zojoji 01.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Jizō]] statues at [[Zōjō-ji]] in [[Tokyo]]]]

{{nihongo||水子供養|'''Mizuko kuyō'''}} or "stillborn [[funeral|memorial service]]", is a [[Japan]]ese ceremony for those who have had a [[miscarriage]], [[stillbirth]], or [[abortion]]. This practice has become particularly visible since the 1970s with the creation of shrines devoted solely to this ritual. Reasons for the performance of these rites can include parental grief, desire to comfort the soul of the [[fetus]], guilt for an abortion, or even fear of retribution from a [[vengeful ghost]].

==Mizuko==
{{nihongo|''Mizuko''|水子}}, literally "water child", is a Japanese term for a stillborn baby or, archaically, a dead baby or infant, while ''kuyō'' refers to a memorial service. Previously read ''suiji'', the Sino-Japanese ''[[on'yomi]]'' reading of the same characters, the term was originally a ''[[kaimyō]]'' (posthumous name) given after death.&lt;ref name =reiwaaruka&gt;{{cite book|author=Anzai Ikuro {{Nihongo2|安斎育郎}}|title=Rei wa aru ka|script-title=ja:霊はあるか|language=ja|publisher=Kodansha|place=Tokyo|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}} The ''mizuko kuyō,'' typically performed by Buddhist priests,&lt;ref name=smith1992&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buddhism and Abortion in Contemporary Japan: Mizuko Kuyo and the Confrontation with Death|last=Smith|first=Bardwell|publisher=SUNY press|year=1992|isbn=0791407586|location=Albany, NY|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}} was used to make [[Offering (Buddhism)|offering]]s to [[Kṣitigarbha|Jizō]], a [[bodhisattva]] who is believed to protect children. In the [[Edo period]], when [[famine]] sometimes led the poverty-stricken to [[infanticide]] and [[abortion]], the practice was adapted to cover these situations as well.

Today, the practice of ''mizuko kuyō'' continues in Japan, although it is unclear whether it is a historically authentic [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] practice. Specifics of the ceremony vary from temple to temple, [[Schools of Buddhism|school]] to school, and individual to individual. It is common for [[List of Buddhist temples|temples]] to offer Jizō statues for a fee, which are then dressed in red bibs and caps, and displayed in the temple yard. Though the practice has been performed since the 1970s, there are still doubts surrounding the ritual.  Some view the memorial service as the temples' way of benefiting from the misfortune of women who have miscarried or had to abort a pregnancy. American religious scholars have criticized the temples for allegedly abusing the Japanese belief that the spirits of the dead retaliate for their mistreatment, but other scholars believe the temples are only answering the needs of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Page Brookes, Anne. (1981). [https://web.archive.org/web/20040503125604/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/135.pdf Mizuko kuyō and Japanese Buddhism.].

The ceremony is attended by both parents or by one, not necessarily the mother.&lt;ref name="smith1992" /&gt;{{rp|73}} The service can vary from a single event to one that repeats monthly or annually.&lt;ref name="smith1992" /&gt;{{rp|74}} Though the service varies, common aspects resemble the ceremony for the recent dead, the ''[[Japanese funeral|senzo kuyō]]''.&lt;ref name="smith1992" /&gt;{{rp|74}} The priest faces the altar and evokes the names of various Buddhas and boddhisattvas. [[Mantra]]s, often the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' and ''[[Kannon]] Sutra'', are performed, as are calls of praise to Jizō.&lt;ref name="smith1992" /&gt;{{rp|74}} Gifts are offered to the Buddha on behalf of the mourned, typically food, drink, incense or flowers.&lt;ref name="smith1992" /&gt;{{rp|74}} A ''kaimyō'' is given to the deceased, and a statue of Jizō is often placed on temple grounds upon completion.&lt;ref name="smith1992" /&gt;{{rp|74}}

'''Modelur''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] parametric [[urban design]] [[software]], implemented as a [[SketchUp]] plugin.

In contrast to common [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications, where the user designs buildings with usual dimensions such as width, depth and height, Modelur offers design of [[built environment]] through key urban parameters such as number of storeys and gross floor area of a building. In addition, urban control values (i.e. [[Floor Space Index]], Built-up Area, etc. ) and requirements (i.e. number of parking lots or green areas) based on [[land use]] normatives are calculated in real-time.

== Purpose==

Anita Meiring, public relations consultant for Wonderbra, described the event: "It is a day for women to realise that their cleavage is something unique and that they should be proud of it."&lt;ref name=IOLWCRO/&gt; "It gives women a chance to be beautiful and glow in the furtive, yet appreciative, glances their [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] evokes from men".&lt;ref name=IOLDCDGC/&gt; She also explained, "It gives men a legitimate reason to stare at boobs."

Samantha Paterson, a brand manager for Wonderbra, said that National Cleavage Day was started as a way to solemnise women's independence and power in all facets of life, from their careers to their relationships to their own destiny.&lt;ref name=IOLDCDGC/&gt; Paterson said the day is intended to be lighthearted amusement and that the revenue will be donated to the Sunflower Fund.&lt;ref name=SABCNEWS&gt;[http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,146339,00.html National cleavage day warms up to the sick] ''SABC News''&lt;/ref&gt; The fund is a [[Non-governmental organisation|non-governmental]] and non-profit organisation based in [[Cape Town]] with a stated aim to help South African citizens diagnosed with [[leukaemia]] and other life-threatening blood diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunflowerfund.org.za/ |title=The Sunflower Fund |publisher=The Sunflower Fund |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations==

National Cleavage Day is celebrated at office premises, restaurants and bars throughout the nation.&lt;ref name=IOLLGRBOYT&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=139&amp;art_id=vn20050407101952636C466186 Ladies, get ready to bust out of your tops!] ''Independent Online''&lt;/ref&gt; Most people polled on the streets during the celebrations in 2002 expressed positive view on this event.&lt;ref name=IOLWCRO/&gt; During the occasion of the National Cleavage Day in 2002, twenty local girls in Johannesburg and another twenty girls in Cape Town were called in for the purpose of distributing stickers and [[G-string]]s to selected female drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=139&amp;art_id=ct20020404220805440C412506  Boobs are back in a big way] ''Independent Online''&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of the NCD in 2006 started early in the morning of 7 April when women showing their cleavages in Edgars, [[Foschini Group]] and [[Truworths]] at La Lucia Mall, Gateway Shopping Centre and the Pavilion handed out ''Cosmopolitan'' magazines free of cost to customers. A competition was organised at the Cafe Vacca Matta called the "Best Cleavage." Thousands of women in the [[Provinces of South Africa|province]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] displayed their cleavages in support of this event.&lt;ref name=IOLDCDGC/&gt; Local manufacturers and retailers of undergarments have joined in support of the celebration of the NCD and it marks some new industry shifts.&lt;ref name=MONEYWEB&gt;[http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page62093?oid=83540&amp;sn=Detail A lift in the market] ''Moneyweb.co.za''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the celebration in 2007, Paterson said,  "We will be donating money for every bra that gets sold in March. We will donate money to the Sunflower fund. We are having big parties, we have special National Cleavage Day cocktails that have been created and for every cocktail bought R2 will be donated to the sunflower fund."&lt;ref name=SABCNEWS/&gt;

In April 2009, references to National Cleavage Day were so popular on Twitter that the term "National Cleavage" was briefly number one on the website's top ten trend list.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

International Cleavage Day is celebrated worldwide yearly on March 31 on social media outlets such as Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Criticism==
Dr. Siqwana-Ndulo, provincial gender commissioner in [[Eastern Cape]], condemned the celebrations, warning women not to be involved in the National Cleavage Day. Siqwana-Ndulo said "This is a pure marketing tool using people's bodies." She added, "The commission is against any person or advertising company, which uses people's bodies for marketing purposes be it advertising a car or anything of that sort."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2004/04/16/Easterncape/bcleav.html Frowns over cleavage day] ''Dispatch Online''&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published by the Gender Links depicted an image of two women showing their cleavages during the occasion of the NCD on 5 April 2003, with a caption "These two bosom buddies were all part of the fun in yesterday’s National Cleavage Day, where a number of stunning beauties, their natural assets enhanced by Wonderbra, brought traffic to a standstill in many parts of [[Johannesburg|Joburg]]." The paper argued [[globalisation]] of the media enforces "globalised norms" of gender and lowest single common denominator in "global" images of gender is "[[Sex in advertising|sex sells]]" which builds and reinforces stereotypes and bias—both male and female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderlinks.org.za/docs/training/picture-our-lives/pic-ch7.pdf Sex sells—or does it?] ''Gender Links''&lt;/ref&gt; Vanessa Raphaely, editor of the ''Cosmopolitan'', argued the NCD is not intended to objectify women, but to celebrate in a funny manner.&lt;ref name=IOLWCRO/&gt;

'''Palestinian Australians''' ({{lang-ar|فلسطينيو أستراليا}}) are [[Australians|Australian]] citizens of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] origin or Palestinian immigrants who live in [[Australia]]. There are an estimated 7,000 Palestinians in Australia.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/Lookup/C41A78D7568811B9CA256E9D0077CA12/$File/20540_2001%20(corrigendum).pdf AUSTRALIANS' ANCESTRIES]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like much of the [[Palestinian diaspora]] worldwide, many Palestinian migrants came from displaced backgrounds as part of a massive exodus of refugees and as a result of decades of war. The majority of Palestinians arrived to Australia holding passports of other [[Arab countries]] in which they had initially settled following their emigration from Palestine; it was not uncommon for different families to hold passports of different countries.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pages/11443/handing-on-the-key_brochure.pdf?epslanguage=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102045850/http://museumvictoria.com.au/pages/11443/handing-on-the-key_brochure.pdf?epslanguage=en |archivedate=2 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[1967 Israeli-Arab war]] led many Palestinians to seek migration beyond the Arab world, propelled by experiences of conflict in the [[Middle East]] as well as discrimination and economic hardship as a stateless people.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Migration waves continued to surge following the [[Lebanese Civil War]] starting in 1975 and the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. The latest major wave came in the aftermath of the 1991 [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

==Demographics==
Most Palestinians speak the [[Arabic language]] and are counted as [[Arab Australians]].

The "'''Philippine Drug War'''", or "'''War on Drugs'''", refers to the [[drug policy]] of the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] under President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], who assumed office on June 30, 2016. According to [[Philippine National Police]] Chief [[Ronald dela Rosa]], the policy is aimed at "the neutralization [ie., killing] of illegal drug personalities nationwide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fast-facts/189132-philippine-government-circulars-duterte-drug-war|title=What do gov't circulars 'operationalizing' Duterte's war on drugs say?|work=Rappler|date=November 21, 2017

Philippine authorities have denied misconduct by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Duterte Vows More Bloodshed in Philippine ‘Drug War’ |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/23/duterte-vows-more-bloodshed-philippine-drug-war |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Special Report: Police describe kill rewards, staged crime scenes in Duterte's drug war |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte-police-specialrep/special-report-police-describe-kill-rewards-staged-crime-scenes-in-dutertes-drug-war-idUSKBN17K1F4 |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |agency=Reuters |date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy has been widely condemned locally and internationally for the number of deaths resulting from police operations and allegations of systematic [[extrajudicial execution]]s.

A presidential spokesperson said that Duterte welcomed a proposed Congressional investigation into extrajudicial killings to be chaired by Senator [[Leila de Lima]], his chief critic in the government.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; On August 17,  Duterte announced that de Lima had been having an affair with a married man, her driver, Ronnie Palisoc Dayan.

In a news conference on August 21, Duterte announced that he had in his possession [[wiretap]]s and [[Cash machine|ATM]] records which confirmed his allegations. He stated: "What is really crucial here is that because of her [romantic] relationship with her driver which I termed 'immoral' because the driver has a family and wife, that connection gave rise to the corruption of what was happening inside the national penitentiary." Dismissing fears for Dayan's safety, he added, "As the President, I got this information … as a privilege. But I am not required to prove it in court. That is somebody else's business. My job is to protect public interest. She's lying through her teeth." He explained that he had acquired the new evidence from an unnamed foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Love affair led to corruption’|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/love-affair-led-to-corruption/281280/|accessdate=22 August 2016|agency=The Manila Times|issue=August 21, 2016|publisher=LLANESCA PANTI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of emergency===
Following the [[2016 Davao City bombing|September 2 bombing in Davao City]] that killed 14 people in the city's central business district, on September 3, 2016, Duterte declared a "state of lawlessness", and on the following day signed a declaration of a "[[2016 state of emergency in the Philippines|state of national emergency]] on account of lawless violence in Mindanao".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4479616/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-obama-davao-blast/ |title=Rodrigo Duterte declares a state of emergency in the Philippines |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author=Solomon, F. |date=September 6, 2016 |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/145290-philippines-duterte-signs-state-national-emergency-lawless-violence-proclamation |title=Duterte signs state of nat'l emergency proclamation |publisher=[[Rappler]] |author=Ranada, P. |date=September 5, 2016 |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the Philippine National Police were ordered to "suppress all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao" and to "prevent lawless violence from spreading and escalating elsewhere". Executive Secretary [[Salvador Medialdea]] said that the declaration "does not specify the imposition of curfews", and would remain in force indefinitely.

On September 19, 2016, the Senate voted 16-4 to remove de Lima from her position heading the Senate committee, in a motion brought by senator and boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/146689-senate-ousts-leila-de-lima-justice-committee|title=Senate ousts De Lima as justice committee chairperson|work=Rappler|date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte's allies in the Senate argued that de Lima had damaged the country's reputation by allowing the testimony of [[Edgar Matobato]].

At the beginning of October, a senior police officer told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that 10 "special ops" official police death squads had been operating, each consisting of 15 police officers. The officer said that he had personally been involved in killing 87 suspects, and described how the corpses had their heads wrapped in masking tape with a cardboard placard labelling them as a drug offender so that the killing would not be investigated, or they were dumped at the roadside ("salvage" victims). The chairman of the Philippines Commission on Human Rights, [[Chito Gascon]], was quoted in the report: "I am not surprised, I have heard of this." The PNP declined to comment. The report stated: "although the ''Guardian'' can verify the policeman's rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines secret death squads: officer claims police teams behind wave of killings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings|accessdate=October 6, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Espinosa was the second public official to be killed in the Drug War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor accused over drugs killed in Philippines jail, say police|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-drugs-war-police-officers-kill-mayor-prison-a7399206.html|accessdate=November 7, 2016|work=The Independent|date=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Espinosa killing ‘incredibly brazen’ - rights lawyer|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/134001/espinosa-killing-incredibly-brazen---rights-lawyer|accessdate=November 7, 2016|work=InterAksyon|date=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the incident, on the same day, Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]] sought to resume the investigation of extrajudicial killings after it was suspended on October 3 by the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lacson to seek resumption of Senate EJK probe after Espinosa’s killing|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/587639/news/nation/lacson-to-seek-resumption-of-senate-ejk-probe-after-espinosa-s-killing|work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate hearings on killings 'suspended until further notice'|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/583653/news/nation/senate-hearings-on-killings-suspended-until-further-notice|work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, Duterte appeared to threaten that human rights workers would be targeted: "The human rights [defenders] say I kill. If I say: 'Okay, I'll stop'. They [drug users] will multiply. When harvest time comes, there will be more of them who will die. Then I will include you among them because you let them multiply." Amnesty International Philippines stated that Duterte was "inciting hate towards anyone who expresses dissent on his war against drugs." The National Alliance against Killings Philippines stated: "His comment - that human rights is part of the drug problem and, as such, human rights advocates should be targeted too - can be interpreted as a declaration of an open season on human rights defenders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte threat to kill rights defenders alarms groups|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/30/16/duterte-threat-to-kill-rights-defenders-alarms-groups|accessdate=December 3, 2016|work=ABSCBN|agency=AFP|date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5 Reuters reported that 97% of drug suspects shot by police died, far more than in other countries with drug-related violence. They also stated that police reports of killings are "remarkably similar", involving a "buy-bust" operation in which the suspect panics and shoots at the officers, who return fire, killing the suspect, and report finding a packet of white powder and a .38 caliber revolver, often with the serial number removed. {{quote|The figures pose a powerful challenge to the official narrative that the Philippines police are only killing drug suspects in self-defense.

On December 8, the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights issued a report stating that there was "no evidence sufficient to prove that a Davao Death Squad exists", and "no proof that there is a state-sponsored policy to commit killings to eradicate illegal drugs in the country." Eleven senators signed the report, while senators Leila De Lima, JV Ejercito, Antonio Trillanes IV and Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto did not sign the report or did not subscribe to its findings.&lt;ref name="gordon1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interaksyon.com/article/135070/gordon-panel-no-proof-of-ejk-dds-in-war-on-drugs-under-duterte |date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=December 8, 2016|title= WATCH &amp;#124; Gordon panel: No proof of EJK, DDS in war on drugs under Duterte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary cessation of police drug operations===
Following criticism of the police over the [[kidnapping and killing of Jee Ick-Joo]], a [[South Korea]]n businessman, Duterte ordered the police to suspend drug-related operations while ordering the military and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to continue drug operations.

===Amnesty International investigation===
On January 31, 2017, [[Amnesty International]] published a report of their investigation of 59 drug-related killings in 20 cities and towns, ''"If you are poor you are killed": Extrajudicial Executions in the Philippines' "War on Drugs"'', which "details how the police have systematically targeted mostly poor and defenceless people across the country while planting 'evidence', recruiting paid killers, stealing from the people they kill and fabricating official incident reports." They stated: "Amnesty International is deeply concerned that the deliberate, widespread and systematic killings of alleged drug offenders, which appear to be planned and organized by the authorities, may constitute crimes against humanity under international law."&lt;ref name=poor&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippines: The police's murderous war on the poor|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/01/philippines-the-police-murderous-war-on-the-poor/|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A police officer with the rank of Senior Police Officer 1, a ten-year veteran of a [[Metro Manila]] anti-illegal drugs unit, told AI that police are paid 8,000 pesos (US $161) to 15,000 pesos (US $302) per "encounter" (the term used for extrajudicial executions disguised as legitimate operations); there is no payment for making arrests. He said that some police also receive a payment from the funeral home they send the corpses to. Hitmen hired by police are paid 5,000 pesos (US $100) for each drug user killed and 10,000 to 15,000 pesos (US $200–300) for each "drug pusher" killed, according to two hitmen interviewed by AI.&lt;ref name=poor/&gt;

{{quote|Family members and witnesses repeatedly contested the police description of how people were killed. Police descriptions bore striking similarities from incident to incident; official police reports in several cases documented by Amnesty International claim the suspect’s gun “malfunctioned” when he tried to fire at police, after which they shot and killed him. In many instances, the police try to cover up unlawful killings or ensure convictions for those arrested during drug-related operations by planting “evidence” at crime scenes and falsifying incident reports—both practices the police officer said were common.|Amnesty International report ''“If you are poor you are killed”: Extrajudicial Executions in the Philippines’ “War on Drugs”''&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;{{cite web|title=PHILIPPINES: "IF YOU ARE POOR, YOU ARE KILLED": EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS IN THE PHILIPPINES' "WAR ON DRUGS"|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa35/5517/2017/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The report makes a series of recommendations to Duterte and government officials and departments. If certain key steps are not swiftly taken, it recommends that the [[International Criminal Court]] "initiate a preliminary examination into unlawful killings in the Philippines’s violent anti-drug campaign and related crimes under the [[Rome Statute]], including the involvement of government officials, irrespective of rank and status."&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;

The Guardian and Reuters stated that the report added to evidence they had published previously about police extrajudicial executions. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella responded to the report, saying that Senate committee investigations proved that there had been no state-sponsored extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines police behave like 'criminal underworld' in drugs war - Amnesty|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs-report-idUSKBN15F208|accessdate=February 8, 2017|agency=Reuters|date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines police paid to kill alleged drug offenders, says Amnesty|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/philippines-police-paid-to-kill-alleged-drug-offenders-says-amnesty-rodrigo-duterte|accessdate=February 13, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on February 4, Duterte told a reporter that Amnesty International was "so naive and so stupid", and "a creation of [George] [[George Soros|Soros]]".

===Arturo Lascañas===
On February 20, [[Arturo Lascañas]], a retired police officer, told reporters at a press conference outside the senate building that as a leader of the Davao Death Squad he had carried out extrajudicial killings on the orders of Duterte. He said death squad members were paid 20,000 to 100,000 pesos ($400 to $2,000) per hit, depending on the importance of the target. He gave details of various killings he had carried out on Duterte's orders, including the previously unsolved murder of a radio show host critical of Duterte, and confessed to his involvement with Matobato in the bombing of a mosque on Duterte's orders.&lt;ref name=l&gt;{{cite news|title=Retired Philippine policeman says Duterte ordered 'death squad' hits|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs/retired-philippine-policeman-says-duterte-ordered-death-squad-hits-idUSKBN15Z0C8|accessdate=October 4, 2017|agency=Reuters|date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retired SPO3 Lascanas: What he said before, what he now says|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/20/17/retired-spo3-lascanas-what-he-said-before-what-he-now-says|accessdate=October 4, 2017|publisher=ABS CBN|date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day the senate voted in a private session to reopen the investigation, reportedly by a margin of ten votes to eight, with five abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate to reopen probe into Davao Death Squad|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/162161-senate-reopen-probe-davao-death-squad|accessdate=October 6, 2017|work=Rappler|date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When Mayor Duterte sat down as mayor for the first time, we started what is called "salvaging" of people, these people are suspects committing crime in Davao.

===Allegations of police using hospitals to hide killings===
In June 2017 Reuters reported that "Police were sending corpses to hospitals to destroy evidence at crime scenes and hide the fact that they were executing drug suspects." Doctors stated that corpses loaded onto trucks were being dumped at hospitals, sometimes after [[rigor mortis]] had already set in, with clearly unsurvivable wounds, having been shot in the chest and head at close range. Reuters examined data from two Manila police districts, and found that the proportion of suspects sent to hospitals, where they are pronounced dead on arrival (DOA), increased from 13% in July 2016 to 85% in January 2017; "The totals grew along with international and domestic condemnation of Duterte's campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippine police use hospitals to hide drug war killings|url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/philippines-duterta-doa/|accessdate=23 September 2017|agency=Reuters|date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) chief prosecutor [[Fatou Bensouda]] expressed concern, over the drug-related killings in the country, on October 13, 2016.&lt;ref name=fb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/10/14/Intl-Criminal-Court-chief-prosecutor-warns-PH-over-drug-killings.html|title=Int'l Criminal Court chief prosecutor warns PH over drug killings|work=CNN Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her statement, Bensouda said that the high officials of the country "seem to condone such killings and further seem to encourage State forces and civilians alike to continue targeting these individuals with lethal force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/149135-international-criminal-court-philippines|title=Int'l criminal court 'closely following' PH war on drugs|work=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also warns that any person in the country who provoke "in acts of mass violence by ordering, requesting, encouraging or contributing, in any other manner, to the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of ICC" will be prosecuted before the court.&lt;ref name=fb2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/146810/international-court-warns-ph-on-killings|title=International court warns PH on killings|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt; About that, Duterte is open for the investigation by the ICC, Malacañang said.&lt;ref name=fb2/&gt;

In February 2018, the ICC announced a “preliminary examination” into killings linked to the Philippine government's “war on drugs”. Prosecutor Bensouda said the court will “analyze crimes allegedly committed in [the Philippines] since at least 1 July 2016.” Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque dismissed the ICC's decision as a “waste of the court’s time and resources”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=180208-otp-stat|title=Statement of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Mrs Fatou Bensouda, on opening Preliminary Examinations into the situations in the Philippines and in Venezuela|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/08/philippines-murderous-drug-war-icc-crosshairs|title=Philippines Murderous ‘Drug War’ in ICC Crosshairs|date=8 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy_Paper_Preliminary_Examinations_2013-ENG.pdf|title=''Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations''|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Duterte announced his intention to withdraw the Philippines from the ICC tribunal, which is a process that takes a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duterte Is Accused of Murder in New Filing at Hague Court |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/world/asia/philippines-duterte-hague.html?module=inline |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

In August 2018, activists and eight families of victims of the Drug War filed a second petition with the ICC, accusing Duterte of murder and crimes against humanity, and calling for his indictment for thousands of extrajudicial killings, which according to the 50-page complaint included "brazen" executions by police acting with impunity. Neri Colmenares, a lawyer acting for the group, said that "Duterte is personally liable for ordering state police to undertake mass killings". Duterte threatened to arrest the ICC prosecutor Bensouda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philippines' Duterte hit by new ICC complaint over deadly drug war |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs/philippines-duterte-hit-by-new-icc-complaint-over-deadly-drug-war-idUSKCN1LD0CS |accessdate=October 19, 2018 |agency=Reuters |date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aljazeera'' reported that John Collins, director of the [[LSE IDEAS|London School of Economics International Drug Policy Project]], said: "Targeting the supply side can have short-term effects. However, these are usually limited to creating market chaos rather than reducing the size of the market. ... What you learn is that you're going to war with a force of economics and the force of economics tends to win out: supply, demand and price tend to find their own way."

The Chairman of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, [[Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr.]], quelled fears that foreign investors might be put off by the increasing rate of killings in the country, explaining at a press conference on September 19, 2016, that investors only care about profit: "They don't care if 50 percent of Filipinos are killing each other so long as they're not affected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/business/2016/09/20/biz-men-speak-up-about-war-on-drugs.html |title='Foreign investors care about money, not drug deaths' — biz leader |work=CNN Philippines |date=September 20, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that foreign investors, who account for half of the activity on the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]], had been "hightailing it out of town", selling $500 million worth of shares over the past month, putting pressure on the [[Philippine peso]] which was close to its weakest point since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/09/20/in-dutertes-philippines-foreigners-flee-stocks/ |title=In Duterte's Philippines, Foreigners Flee Stocks |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 20, 2016 |accessdate=September 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his official state visit to the Philippines in January 2017, Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] said: "On countering illegal drugs, we want to work together with the Philippines through relevant measures of support". He offered financial assistance for Philippine drug rehabilitation centres, and made no mention of deaths resulting from the drug war. He announced a $800 million [[Official Development Assistance (Japan)|Official Development Assistance]] package to "promote economic and infrastructure development".&lt;ref name=cnts&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's 'War on Drugs'|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/07/philippine-president-rodrigo-dutertes-war-drugs|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Song-Huann Lin, the representative of [[Taiwan]] in the Philippines, welcomed Duterte's plan to declare a war against criminality and illegal drugs. He said Taiwan is ready to help the Philippines combat cross-border crimes like human and drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/14/1592910/taiwan-confident-stronger-ties-philippines-under-duterte|title=Taiwan confident of stronger ties with Philippines under Duterte|author=Alexis Romero|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2016, Lingxiao Li, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Manila, announced [[China]]'s support for the Drug War: "China fully understands that the Philippine government under the leadership of H.

On December 24, U.S. Senators [[Marco Rubio]], [[Edward Markey]], and [[Chris Coons|Christopher Coons]] expressed their concerns regarding the alleged extrajudicial killings and human rights violations in Duterte's war on drugs. Through a letter sent to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], they noted that instead of addressing the drug problem, investing in treatment programs or approaching the issue with an emphasis on health, Duterte has "pledged to kill another 20,000 to 30,000 people, many simply because they suffer from a drug use disorder." Rubio, Markey and Coons also questioned U.S. secretary of state [[John Kerry]]'s pledge of $32-million funding for training and other law-enforcement assistance during his visit to Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte's drug war a 'campaign of mass atrocities': US senators|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/24/16/dutertes-drug-war-a-campaign-of-mass-atrocities-us-senators|work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/12/28/1657489/us-senators-want-tracking-funds-philippines-amid-drug-war|title=US senators want tracking of funds in Philippines amid drug war|author1=Patricia Lourdes Viray|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=October 17, 2016|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Senator Rubio, along with Senator [[Ben Cardin]], filed a [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] bill in the U.S. Senate to restrict the exportation of weapons from the U.S. to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcelo|first1=Ver|title=U.S. Senators file bill to block arms export to PH|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/05/us-senators-bill-to-block-arms-export-to-PH.html|accessdate=May 6, 2017|publisher=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US ambassador in Manila announced on December 14, 2016, that the US foreign aid agency, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], would cancel funding to the Philippines due to "significant concerns around rule of law and civil liberties in the Philippines", explaining that aid recipients were required to demonstrate a "commitment to the rule of law, due process and respect for human rights". The MCC had disbursed $434 million to the Philippines from 2011 to 2015. The funding denial was expected to lead to the cancellation of a five-year infrastructure development project previously agreed to in December 2015.&lt;ref name=cnts/&gt;
 
In February 2017, former [[Colombia]]n President [[César Gaviria]] wrote an opinion piece on ''[[The New York Times]]'' to warn Duterte and the administration that the drug war is "unwinnable" and "disastrous", citing his own experiences as the President of Colombia.

In response to Gaviria, Duterte called him an "idiot", and said the issue of extrajudicial killings should be set aside, and that there were four to five million drug addicts in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=[[César Gaviria|Gaviria, César]]|title=President Duterte Is Repeating My Mistakes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/opinion/president-duterte-is-repeating-my-mistakes.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0|accessdate=February 8, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte calls Colombian ex-president 'idiot'|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/02/08/1670271/duterte-calls-colombian-ex-president-idiot|work=Philstar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano delivered a speech at the 72nd United Nations General Assembly, during which he argued that extrajudicial killings were a myth, and that the Drug war, which according to Human Rights Watch has resulted in 13,000 deaths to date, was being waged to "protect (the) human rights of...the most vulnerable (citizens)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.inquirer.net/8246/asean-un-sec-cayetanos-sophistry|title=Asean, the UN and Sec. Cayetano's sophistry|website=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Secretary Cayetano was interviewed by the Qatari news outlet al-Jazeera. He asserted that all 3,900 people who were killed in the drug war fought against the police despite there having been no investigations conducted prior to the drug busts. He also rebuffed all claims that the drug war was against its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2017/10/philippines-defends-duterte-drug-war-171006085311620.html|title=How the Philippines defends Duterte's drug war|website=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===38-nation statement against the drug war===
On June 19, 2018, 38 [[United Nations]] member states released a collective statement through the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), calling on the Republic of the Philippines and Philippine president [[Rodrigo Duterte]] to stop the killings in the country and probe abuses caused by the deadly drug war.

[[Image:Pueblo joven (Lima).JPG|200px|thumb|right|A new limeñaa in the desert at the northern end of Peru's capital Lima, near Ancón.]]
'''''Pueblos jóvenes''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈpweβlos ˈxoβenes}}, "young towns") is the nickname given to the vast [[shanty town]]s that surround [[Lima]] and other cities of [[Peru]]. Many of these towns have developed into significant districts in Lima such as [[Villa El Salvador]] and [[Comas District, Lima|Comas]].

== Population ==
They are populated almost exclusively by [[African Peruvian|Black]], [[Indigenous peoples of Peru|Amerindian]], and [[mestizo]] [[Peasant|campesinos]] who since the 1940s have migrated in great waves from Peru's countryside in search of economic opportunity, turning Lima into the fourth-largest city in the Americas. Like many other rapidly industrializing cities, Lima's job market has largely been unable to keep up with this influx of people, forcing many to accept any housing available.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The 'young Towns' of Lima: Aspects of Urbanization in Peru|last = Lloyd|first = Peter|publisher = CUP Archive|year = 1980|isbn = 0521296889|location = Cambridge|pages = 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the inhabitants of the pueblos jóvenes also came in order to escape terrorism during the 1980s.

== Living conditions ==
The towns are composed of poorly constructed shacks which generally lack running [[water]], and other basic services although electricity is usually available on a pirated DIY basis.  In both appearance and culture, they are similar to the [[favela]]s of [[Brazil]] and other [[Latin America]]n cities.  [[Crime]] is rampant.

Water delivery or services to these parts of Lima costs between 6 and ten times as much as it does in affluent parts of Lima such as [[San Isidro, Peru|San Isidro]] or [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]].

Work to improve life in these areas is carried on by organisations such as the [[NGO]] [[Asociacion SOLAC]] and the theatre group [[Vichama]].

== Politics ==
Many of the dwellings are painted with the colors of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA), the [[Socialist Party of Peru]], or political candidates. Some still bear the logo of now convicted three-term president [[Alberto Fujimori]], sometimes because the resident hasn't had the time or money to repaint their dwelling, sometimes because they still support Fujimori.

President [[Alejandro Toledo]], Fujimori's successor, pushed through various initiatives to encourage peasants to return to the farming and mining communities whence they came, but they have not been effective.

The Peruvian government has permitted these communities to continue largely because it realizes that, were they to eradicate them, the inhabitants would simply move elsewhere in the city's peripheral areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It was typically a fixed fee, a ''divani'' tax; it was paid around the time of marriage, to the timar-holder, or even to a tax-farmer in their stead. The tax-collector might record details of individual marriages, although this was not equivalent to the church marriage-registers in contemporary western [[Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart, Johansen, Singer|title=Law and society in Islam|year=1996|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of the tax records are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews in the realm of the Sultans: Ottoman Jewish society in the seventeenth century|year=2008|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-149523-6|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Resm-i arusane is first recorded in the fifteenth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart, Johansen, Singer|title=Law and society in Islam|year=1996|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was arguably incompatible with the shari'ah law, the resm-i arusane continued to be a small, but significant, source of tax revenue in the Ottoman Empire. For instance, tax records for the village of Sakal Dutan in 1550 show a total 810 [[akçe]]s of tax revenue, of which 30 akçe were from resm-i arusane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Ronald|title=Sakaltutan Four Centuries Ago|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|date=January 1978|volume=9|issue=1|pages=89–98|jstor=162627|doi=10.1017/s0020743800051710}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 16th-century [[fatwa]] specifically stated that the resm-i arusane and the resm-i hinzir (pig tax) were illegal, but these taxes on "forbidden" transactions continued - sometimes under the guise of "gifts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Princeton papers: interdisciplinary journal of Middle Eastern studies|year=2005|volume=13-14|pages=130|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|issn=1084-5666}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various sources suggest that the fee was paid either by the ''bride'' or the ''husband''; rates might vary according to the bride's personal status and religion. One preserved document sets resm-i arusane at double the rate for virgins compared to [[widow]]s; and Muslim rates paid twice as much as unbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shmuelevitz|first=Aryeh|title=The Jews of the Ottoman Empire in the late fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries|year=1984|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-07071-4|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kannunname'' of Rhodos and Cos, in 1650, set resm-i arusane at 30 [[akçe|aspers]] for widows (regardless of their religion), and 60 aspers for virgins.

A [[Christianity|Christian]] couple who wished to marry in a church would also have to pay [[nikâh resmi]] to the metropolitan, and a further fee to the local parish priest; this could be considerably more expensive than the resm-i arusane itself. There would also be a charge for registering the marriage with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in the Ottoman Balkans: gender, culture and history|year=2007|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-505-0|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5471">The '''Revolutionäre Gewerkschafts Opposition''' (Revolutionary Union Opposition) was the Communist union in Germany during the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref name="ldp"&gt;Larry Dean Peterson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZldKGNzSrIC&amp;pg=PA220 ''German Communism, Workers' Protest, and Labor Unions: the Politics of the United Front in Rhineland-Westphalia 1920-1924''] International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam. Kluwer Academic Publishers (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;220. Retrieved August 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It went underground after the [[Nazi Party]] seized control of the government and continued operating until it was crushed by the Nazis in 1935.

== Weimar era ==
The Communist International ([[Comintern]]) and the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) had both wanted to create their own revolutionary unions and had attempted to use the [[Union of Manual and Intellectual Workers]] (UMIW), which had a high proportion of KPD members within its ranks, to that end. The KPD's relationship with the UMIW was strained by the lack of discipline within the Union and eventually, the relationship was ended.&lt;ref name="edw"&gt;Eric D. Weitz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5kkQyWIFCbIC&amp;pg=PA153 "Origins of the RGO"] ''Creating German Communism, 1890-1990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State'', Princeton University Press (1997) pp.&amp;nbsp;152-153. Retrieved August 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, after the 4th World Congress of the [[Profintern]] and the 6th World Congress of the Comintern, Communists took an ultra-left position toward [[social democracy|social democrats]], branding them as "[[social fascism|social fascists]]". Efforts to establish an independent union were renewed,&lt;ref name="edw" /&gt; and the KPD began to systematically set up an opposing faction within the ''[[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]]'' (ADGB).

On March 14, 1929, the central committee of the KPD decided to register as members people who had been expelled as radicals from a trade union. In June 1929, Michael Niederkirchner was expelled from the [[Deutscher Metallarbeiter Verband|German Metal Workers' Federation]] and founded an aid organization for others who had been expelled, which later became the core of the RGO. The KPD founded the RGO in December 1929 with the idea of consolidating the left within the ADGB.&lt;ref name="dhm"&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/innenpolitik/gewerkschaftsopposition/index.html ''"Die Revolutionäre Gewerkschaftsopposition"''] German Historical Museum. Retrieved August 11, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those KPD members still in the ADGB became the principal opposition from within.

As of 1930, the RGO was promoted as a "red [[class struggle|class]] trade union" and several cross-over campaigns were initiated, but never to great success. The RGO had a membership in 1932 of about 250,000 members.&lt;ref name="dhm" /&gt; Large sections of the unionist wing of the KPD left the party and more than half of the RGO was unemployed. To bolster appearances, the RGO counted only admissions, not those who dropped out. Because the Communists lost influence in the trade unions from people leaving, and to a lesser extent, from expulsions, in 1931, they changed their strategy. Communists were to mount opposition within the ADGB and other such groups in order to strengthen "red associations", organizations that would develop into Communist unions. This turned the RGO into a [[Communist front]] organization, but it was unable to convert itself into a Communist union movement. The three largest "red associations" organized were in metalworking, mining, and construction and even those were never more than 1% of the workforce. RGO leaders were never elected at normal union meetings; rather they emerged from the trade union section of the KPD's central committee.

In 1932, the RGO attracted national attention by joining the [[National Socialist Factory Cell Organization|NSBO (the Nazi labor union)]] in support of a [[wildcat strike]] against the [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe|Berlin Transportation Company]] (BVG) which had cut wages.&lt;ref name="dhm" /&gt;

After [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931–1933)|the Nazis seized power]], they crushed the unions. On 2 May 1933, the SS and SA seized all the offices of the ADGB and its member unions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=1890 "Prohibition of Free Trade-Unions: SA Members Seize the Union Office on Engelsufer in Berlin (May 2, 1933)"] German History in Documents and Images. Retrieved August 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The RGO went underground and continued to function until it was crushed in 1935.&lt;ref name="dhm" /&gt;

== Postwar era ==
After [[World War II]], the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]] was established in [[East Germany]] as a unified trade union for Communists and others. In the 1970s, the [[Maoism|Maoist]] Communist Party of Germany (Structural Organization) and the [[Communist Party of Germany/Marxists–Leninists|KPD/Marxist–Leninist]] tried to revive the RGO, but had little success.

The {{nihongo|'''Ryukyuan languages'''|琉球語派|Ryūkyū-goha|also {{nihongo2|琉球諸語}} ''Ryūkyū-shogo'' or {{nihongo2|しまくとぅば}} ''Shima kutuba'', lit. ''Island Speech''}} are the indigenous languages of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], the southernmost part of the [[Japanese archipelago]]. Along with the [[Japanese language]], they make up the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] language family. The languages are not mutually intelligible with each other. It is not known how many speakers of these languages remain, but [[language shift]] towards the use of [[Standard Japanese]] and dialects like [[Okinawan Japanese]] has resulted in these languages becoming [[endangered language|endangered]]; [[UNESCO]] labels four of the languages "definitely endangered", and two others "severely endangered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1975.html|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|date=|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Phonologically, the Ryukyuan languages have some cross-linguistically unusual features. Southern Ryukyuan languages have a number of [[syllabic consonant]]s, including unvoiced syllabic fricatives (e.g. Ōgami [[Miyako language|Miyako]] {{IPA|/kss/}} {{IPA|[ksː]}} 'breast'). [[Glottal consonant|Glottalized consonants]] are common (e.g. Yuwan [[Amami language|Amami]] {{IPA|/ʔma/}} {{IPA|[ˀma]}} "horse"). Some Ryukyuan languages have phonemic central vowels, e.g. Yuwan Amami {{IPA|/kɨɨ/}} "tree". Ikema Miyako has a [[voiceless nasal]] phoneme {{IPA|/n̥/}}. Many Ryukyuan languages, like Standard Japanese and most Japanese dialects, have contrastive [[pitch accent]].

Ryukyuan languages are generally [[subject-object-verb|SOV]], [[dependent-marking]], modifier-head, [[nominative-accusative]] languages, like the Japanese language. Adjectives are generally [[bound morphemes]], occurring either with noun compounding or using verbalization. Many Ryukyuan languages mark both nominatives and genitives with the same marker. This marker has the unusual feature of changing form depending on an [[Animacy|animacy hierarchy]]. The Ryukyuan languages have [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] markers, which may take different forms depending on the sentential context. Ryukyuan also preserves a special verbal inflection for clauses with focus markers—this unusual feature was also found in [[Old Japanese]], but lost in Modern Japanese.

==Classification and varieties==
The Ryukyuan languages belong to the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] language family, related to the [[Japanese language]].&lt;ref name="sp1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lingarch" /&gt; The Ryukyuan languages are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Japanese—in fact, they are not even mutually intelligible with each other—and thus may be considered separate languages.&lt;ref name="sp1" /&gt; However, for socio-political and ideological reasons, they have often classified within Japan as dialects of Japanese.&lt;ref name="sp1" /&gt; Since the beginning of [[World War II]], most mainland Japanese have regarded the Ryukyuan languages as a dialect or group of dialects of Japanese. During World War II, in an effort to build consciousness in people as subjects of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]], not only the Ryukyuan group, but also [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Palauan language|Palauan]] and various other languages were referred to as "dialects" of Japanese.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op8.html|title=JPRI Occasional Paper No. 8|date=1972-05-15|publisher=Jpri.org|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Okinawan language is only 71% lexically similar to, or cognate with, standard Tokyo Japanese. Even the southernmost Japanese dialect ([[Kagoshima dialect]]) is only 72% cognate with the northernmost Ryukyuan language (Amami). The Kagoshima dialect of Japanese, however, is 80% lexically similar to Standard Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;沖縄語辞典 (''Okinawan dictionary''). "前書き" (''Preface''). 国立国語研究所 1998&lt;/ref&gt; There is general agreement among linguistics experts that Ryukyuan varieties can be divided into six languages, conservatively,&lt;ref&gt;言語学大辞典セレクション：日本列島の言語 (''Selection from the Encyclopædia of Linguistics: The Languages of the Japanese Archipelago''). "琉球列島の言語" (''The Languages of the Ryukyu Islands''). 三省堂 1997&lt;/ref&gt; with dialects unique to islands within each group also sometimes considered languages.

A widely accepted hypothesis among linguists categorizes the Ryukyuan languages into two groups, Northern Ryukyuan (Amami–Okinawa) and Southern Ryukyuan (Miyako–Yaeyama).&lt;ref name="sp2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lingarch"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pellard|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many speakers of the Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni languages may also be familiar with Okinawan since Okinawan has the most speakers and once acted as the regional standard. Speakers of Yonaguni are also likely to know the Yaeyama language due to its proximity. Since Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama, and Yonaguni are less urbanised than the Okinawan mainland, their languages are not declining as quickly as that of Okinawa proper, and some children continue to be brought up in these languages. In Okinawa proper, a dialect of standard Japanese known as {{nihongo|[[Okinawan Japanese]]|[[:ja:ウチナーヤマトグチ|ウチナーヤマトゥグチ]]|Uchinaa Yamatuguchi}} has developed.&lt;ref name="s245" /&gt;

Each Ryukyuan language is generally unintelligible to others in the same family. There is a wide diversity between them. For example, Yonaguni has only three vowels, whereas varieties of Amami may have up to seven, excluding length distinctions. The table below illustrates the different phrases used in each language for "thank you" and "welcome", with standard Japanese provided for comparison.

There is no census data for the Ryukyuan languages, and the number of speakers is unknown.&lt;ref name="sp2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, the total population of the Ryukyu region was 1,452,288, but fluent speakers are restricted to the older generation, generally in their 50s or older, and thus the true number of Ryukyuan speakers should be much lower.&lt;ref name="sp2" /&gt;

Starting in the 1890s, the Japanese government began to suppress the Ryukyuan languages as part of their policy of forced assimilation in the islands. 

Today, children still being brought up with the Ryukyuan languages are becoming increasingly rare throughout the islands, and usually only occurs when the children are living with their grandparents. The Ryukyuan languages are still used in traditional cultural activities, such as [[Ryukyuan music|folk music]], [[Kumi Odori|folk dance]], [[Ryuka (poetry)|poem]] and folk plays. There has also been a radio news program in the Naha dialect since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=沖縄映像センター|url=http://www.okinawabbtv.com/news/h_news.htm|title=おきなわBBtv★沖縄の方言ニュース★沖縄の「今」を沖縄の「言葉」で！ラジオ沖縄で好評放送中の「方言ニュース」をブロードバンドでお届けします。|publisher=Okinawabbtv.com|date=|accessdate=2014-01-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192753/http://www.okinawabbtv.com/news/h_news.htm|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], people under the age of 40 have little proficiency in the native [[Okinawan language]].&lt;ref name="s244"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sugita|2007|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[mixed language]], based on Japanese and Okinawan, has developed, known as "[[Okinawan Japanese]]".&lt;ref name="s245"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sugita|2007|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been largely ignored by linguists and language activists, this is the language of choice among the younger generation.&lt;ref name="s245" /&gt;

Similarly, the common language now used in everyday conversations in [[Amami Ōshima]] is not the traditional [[Amami language]], but rather a regional variation of Amami-accented Japanese, locally nicknamed トン普通語 (''Ton Futsūgo'', literally meaning "potato [i.e. rustic] common language") by older speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synapse.ne.jp/hellokids/sinnantoutuusin/sinnantoutuusin_3.htm |title=島口（奄美の方言）入門その１－あなたもシマンチュに |publisher=Synapse.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To try to preserve the language, the Okinawan Prefectural government proclaimed on March 31, 2006, that September 18 would be commemorated as {{nihongo3|"Island Languages Day"|[[:ja:しまくとぅばの日|しまくとぅばの日]]|Shimakutuba no Hi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/reiki/41890101003500000000/41890101003500000000/41890101003500000000.html |title=○しまくとぅばの日に関する条例 |language=ja |publisher=Pref.okinawa.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the day's numerals in ''[[goroawase]]'' spell out ''ku'' (9), ''tu'' (10), ''ba'' (8); ''kutuba'' is one of the few words common throughout the Ryukyuan languages meaning "word" or "language" (a cognate of the Japanese word {{nihongo3|"word"|言葉|kotoba}}). A similar commemoration is held in the Amami region on February 18 beginning in 2007, proclaimed as {{nihongo3|"Dialect Day"|方言の日|Hōgen no Hi}} by [[Ōshima Subprefecture (Kagoshima)|Ōshima Subprefecture]] in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]. Each island has its own name for the event:
*[[Amami Ōshima]]: {{nihongo3||シマユムタの日|Shimayumuta no Hi}} or {{nihongo3||シマクトゥバの日|Shimakutuba no Hi}} (also written {{nihongo2|島口の日}})
*On [[Kikaijima]] it is {{nihongo3||シマユミタの日|Shimayumita no Hi}}
*On [[Tokunoshima]] it is {{nihongo3||シマグチ（島口）の日|Shimaguchi no Hi}} or {{nihongo3||シマユミィタの日|Shimayumiita no Hi}}
*On [[Okinoerabujima]] it is {{nihongo3||島ムニの日|Shimamuni no Hi}}
*On [[Yoronjima]] it is {{nihongo||ユンヌフトゥバの日|Yunnufutuba no Hi}}.
Yoronjima's ''fu'' (2) ''tu'' (10) ''ba'' (8) is the ''goroawase'' source of the February 18 date, much like with Okinawa Prefecture's use of ''kutuba''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.kagoshima.jp/aq01/chiiki/oshima/kyoiku/oosimatikuhougennnohi.html |title=鹿児島県／大島地区「方言の日」 |publisher=Pref.kagoshima.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:flag of Ryukyu.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the Ryukyu Kingdom]]

It is generally accepted that the Ryukyu Islands were populated from Mainland Japan in the first millennium, and since then relative isolation from the mainland allowed the Ryukyuan languages to diverge significantly from [[Old Japanese]]. However, the discoveries of the [[Pinza-Abu Cave Man]], the [[Minatogawa Man]], and the [[Yamashita Cave Man]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248496900251 |title=Early modern human remains from eastern Asia: the Yamashita-cho 1 immature postcrania  |date=1996-04-30 |accessdate=2014-03-16 |doi=10.1006/jhev.1996.0025 |volume=30 |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |pages=299–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave Ruins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/118/3/118_091214/_article |title=Pleistocene human remains from Shiraho-Saonetabaru Cave on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan, and their radiocarbon dating |doi=10.1537/ase.091214 |publisher=Jstage.jst.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest an earlier arrival to the island by modern humans. Some researchers suggest that the Ryukyuan languages are most likely to have evolved from a "pre-Proto-Japonic language" from the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/181931 |title=Handbook of the Ryukyuan Languages |publisher=Degruyter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ryukyuan may have already begun to diverge from early Japanese before this migration, while its speakers still dwelt in [[Mainland Japan|the main islands of Japan]].&lt;ref name="sp2" /&gt; After this initial settlement, there was little contact between the main islands and the Ryukyu Islands for centuries, allowing Ryukyuan to diverge as a separate linguistic entity.&lt;ref name="sp4"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation lasted until the [[Kyushu]]-based [[Satsuma Domain]] conquered the Ryukyu Islands in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="sp4" /&gt;

The [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] retained autonomy until 1879, when it was annexed by Japan.&lt;ref name="t14"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Takara|2007|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government adopted a policy of forced assimilation, appointing mainland Japanese to political posts and suppressing native culture and language.&lt;ref name="t14" /&gt; Students caught speaking Ryukyuan were made to wear a ''[[dialect card]]'' ([[:ja:方言札|方言札]] ''hōgen fuda''), a method of [[public humiliation]].&lt;ref name="t15"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Takara|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This punishment was taken from the 19th [[Language policy in France|French language policy]] of [[Vergonha]], especially by [[Jules Ferry]], where the regional languages such as [[Occitan language|Occitan (Provençal)]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or [[Breton language|Breton]] were suppressed in favor of [[French language|French]]; see also [[Welsh Not]], for a similar system in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The same system was also used in other parts of Japan, such as the [[Tōhoku region]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who regularly wore the card would receive [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref name="t15" /&gt; In 1940, there was a political debate amongst Japanese leaders about whether or not to continue the oppression of the Ryukyuan languages, although the argument for assimilation prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, Patrick. ''Hōgen ronsō: the great Ryukyuan languages debate of 1940.'' Contemporary Japan - Journal of the German Institute for Japanese Studies, Tokyo. Aug2013, Vol. 25 Issue 2, p167-187. 21p. 4 Charts. {{ISSN|1869-2729}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[World War II]] era, speaking Ryukyuan was officially illegal, although in practice the older generation was still monolingual.&lt;ref name="t15" /&gt; This policy of [[Language death|linguicide]] lasted into the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Post-war occupation|post-war occupation]] of the Ryukyu Islands by the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="t15" /&gt; As the American occupation forces generally promoted the reforming of a separate Ryukyuan culture, many Okinawan officials continued to strive for Japanification as a form of defiance.

Nowadays, in favor of [[multiculturalism]], preserving Ryukyuan languages has become the policy of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa Prefectural government]], as well as the government of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]'s [[Ōshima Subprefecture (Kagoshima)|Ōshima Subprefecture]]. However, the situation is not very optimistic, since the vast majority of Okinawan children are now monolingual in Japanese.

==Geographic distribution==
The Ryukyuan languages are spoken on the [[Ryukyu Islands]], which comprise the southernmost part of the [[Japanese archipelago]]&lt;ref name="sp1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four major island groups which make up the Ryukyu Islands: the [[Amami Islands]], the [[Okinawa Islands]], the [[Miyako Islands]], and the [[Yaeyama Islands]].&lt;ref name="sp1" /&gt; The former is in the [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], while the latter three are in the [[Okinawa Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="sp1" /&gt;

==Orthography==
[[File:Letter of Kanamaru.jpg|thumb|A letter from King [[Shō En]] to [[Shimazu clan|Shimazu]] ''[[Glossary of sumo terms#oyakata|oyakata]]'' (1471); an example of written Ryukyuan.]]
{{see also|Okinawan scripts}}
Older Ryukyuan texts are often found on stone inscriptions. ''Tamaudun-no-Hinomon'' ([[:ja:玉陵の碑文|玉陵の碑文]] "Inscription of [[Tamaudun]] tomb") (1501), for example. Within the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], official texts were written in [[kanji]] and [[hiragana]], derived from Japan. However, this was a sharp contrast from Japan at the time, where [[classical Chinese]] writing was mostly used for official texts, only using hiragana for informal ones. Classical Chinese writing was sometimes used in Ryukyu as well, read in ''[[Kanbun|kundoku]]'' (Ryukyuan) or in Chinese. In Ryukyu, [[katakana]] was hardly used.

Historically, official documents in Ryukyuan were primarily written in a form of classical Chinese writing known as [[Kanbun]], while poetry and songs were often written in the Shuri dialect of [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]].

Commoners did not learn kanji. ''[[Omoro Sōshi]]'' (1531–1623), a noted Ryukyuan song collection, was mainly written in hiragana. Other than hiragana, they also used [[Suzhou numerals]] (''suuchuuma'' すうちゅうま in Okinawan), derived from China. In [[Yonaguni]] in particular, there was a different writing system, the [[Kaidā glyphs]] (カイダー字 or カイダーディー).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nilab.info/wiki/KaidaJi.html |title=カイダー字: 与那国島にある象形文字。 (KaidaJi - MemoWiki) |publisher=Nilab.info |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecco.m78.com/download/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718081109/http://ecco.m78.com/download/ |archivedate=2006-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Japanese influence, all of those numerals became obsolete.

Nowadays, perceived as "dialects", Ryukyuan languages are not often written. When they are, [[Japanese writing system|Japanese characters]] are used in an ''ad hoc'' manner. There are no standard orthographies for the modern languages. Sounds not distinguished in the Japanese writing system, such as [[glottal stop]]s, are not properly written.

Sometimes local [[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|''kun'yomi'']] are given to kanji, such as ''agari'' (あがり "east") for [[:Wiktionary:東|東]], ''iri'' (いり "west") for [[:Wiktionary:西|西]], thus 西表 is [[Iriomote-jima|Iriomote]].

==Phonology==
Ryukyuan languages often share many phonological features with Japanese, including a voicing opposition for [[obstruent]]s, CV(C) syllable structure, [[Mora (linguistics)|moraic rhythm]], and [[pitch accent]].&lt;ref name="sp4" /&gt; However, many individual Ryukyuan languages diverge significantly from this pan-Japonic base.&lt;ref name="sp4" /&gt; For instance, Ōgami does not have phonemic voicing in obstruents, allows CCVC syllables, and has unusual syllabic consonants such as {{IPA|/kff/}} {{IPA|[kf̩ː]}} "make".&lt;ref name="sp4" /&gt;

===Consonants===
The Northern Ryukyuan (Amami-Okinawa) languages are notable for having [[glottalic consonant]]s.&lt;ref name="sp5"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemically these are analyzed of consisting of a cluster {{IPA|/ʔ/}} + C, where the consonant {{IPA|/ʔ/}} consists of its own mora.&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt; For instance, in the Amami dialect Yuwan the word {{IPA|/ʔma/}} {{IPA|[ˀma]}} "horse" is bimoraic.&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt; Tsuken (Central Okinawan) restricts glottalization to glides and the vowels {{IPA|/a i/}}.&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt; Southern Ryukyuan mostly has little to no glottalization, with some exceptions (e.g. Yonaguni).&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt; For instance, the Irabu dialect of the Miyako language only allows glottalization with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/c/}}: {{IPA|/ttjaa/}} {{IPA|[ˀtʲaː]}} "then", {{IPA|/ccir/}} {{IPA|[ˀtɕiɭ]}} "pipe".&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt;

Southern Ryukyuan stands out in having a number of syllabic consonants.&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt; These consonants are contextually nucleic, becoming syllabic when not adjacent to a vowel.&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt; Examples:

Irabu Miyako:
* {{IPA|/nam/}} {{IPA|[nam]}} "wave"
* {{IPA|/mna/}} {{IPA|[mna]}} "shell"
* {{IPA|/mm/}} {{IPA|[mː]}} "potato"
* {{IPA|/pžtu/}} {{IPA|[ps̩tu]}} "man"
* {{IPA|/prrma/}} {{IPA|[pɭːma]}} "daytime"
Ōgami Miyako
* {{IPA|/us/}} {{IPA|[us]}} "cow"
* {{IPA|/ss/}} {{IPA|[sː]}} "dust"
* {{IPA|/kss/}} {{IPA|[ksː]}} "breast"

Ōgami even shows a three-way length distinction in fricatives, though across a syllable boundary:&lt;ref name="sp118"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/fɑɑ/}} {{IPA|[fɑː]}} "child"
* {{IPA|/f.fɑ/}} {{IPA|[fːɑ]}} "grass"
* {{IPA|/ff.fɑ/}} {{IPA|[fːːɑ]}} "comb", "top"

Ikema (a Miyako dialect) has a voiceless moraic nasal phoneme {{IPA|/n̥/}}, which always precedes another nasal onset and assimilates its place of articulation to the following nasal.&lt;ref name="sp170"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
Amami has high and mid central vowels.&lt;ref name="sp5" /&gt; Yonaguni only has three contrasting vowels, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}.

===Suprasegmentals===
The Ryukyuan languages operate based on the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]].&lt;ref name="sp6"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Ryukyuan languages require words to be at least bimoraic, thus for example in Hateruma the underlying noun root {{IPA|/si/}} "hand" becomes {{IPA|/siː/}} when it is an independent noun, though it remains as {{IPA|/si/}} when attached to a clitic, e.g. {{IPA|/si&amp;#x3D;nu/}}.&lt;ref name="sp6" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In fact, in Irabu Miyako lengthening occurs even before a clitic, thus underlying {{IPA|/ti/}} "hand" becomes {{IPA|/tiː/}} independently and {{IPA|/tiː&amp;#x3D;nu/}} with attached clitic. {{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[syllable]] may still sometimes be relevant—for instance, the Ōgami topic marker takes a different form after open syllables with short vowels:&lt;ref name="sp119"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "staff" {{IPA|/pɑu + &amp;#x3D;ɑ/}} → {{IPA|/pɑu&amp;#x3D;iɑ/}}
* "vegetable" {{IPA|/suu + &amp;#x3D;ɑ/}} → {{IPA|/suu&amp;#x3D;iɑ/}}
* "person" {{IPA|/pstu + &amp;#x3D;ɑ/}} → {{IPA|/pstɑ&amp;#x3D;ɑ/}}

Ryukyuan languages typically have a [[pitch accent]] system where some mora in a word bears the pitch accent.&lt;ref name="sp7"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They commonly either have two or three distinctive types of pitch accent which may be applied.&lt;ref name="sp7" /&gt; The category of [[foot (prosody)|foot]] also has relevance to the accentual systems of some Ryukyuan languages, and some Miyako varieties have a cross-linguistically rare system of tonal foot.&lt;ref name="sp7" /&gt; However, Irabu Miyakoan does not have lexical accent.&lt;ref name="sp7" /&gt;

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

The Ryukyuan languages consistently distinguish between the [[word class]]es of nouns and verbs, distinguished by the fact that verbs take [[inflectional morphology]].&lt;ref name="sp9" /&gt; Property-concept (adjectival) words are generally [[bound morphemes]].&lt;ref name="sp10"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One strategy they use is compounding with a free-standing noun:&lt;ref name="sp10" /&gt;

Ikema:&lt;ref name="sp10" /&gt;
{{block indent|''imi-'' "small" + ''ffa'' "child" → ''imi-ffa'' "small child"}}
Yuwan:&lt;ref name="sp10" /&gt;
{{block indent|''kjura-'' "beautiful" + ''ʔkin'' "kimono" → ''kjura-gin'' "beautiful kimono"}}

Compounding is found in both Northern and Southern Ryukyuan, but is mostly absent from Hateruma (Yaeyama).&lt;ref name="sp10" /&gt;

Another way property stems are used is by verbalization:&lt;ref name="sp10" /&gt;

Yuwan Amami:&lt;ref name="sp52"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| style="margin-left:3em !important"
| ''an''
| ''kɨɨ=ja''
| ''taa-sar-oo''
|-
| that
| tree={{smallcaps|top}}
| tall-{{smallcaps|vlz-supp}}
|-
| colspan="3" | "That tree is supposed to be tall."
|}

Miyako is unique in having stand-alone adjectives.&lt;ref name="sp10" /&gt; These may be formed by reduplication of the root, e.g. Irabu Miyako ''imi-'' "small" → ''imii-imi'' "small (adj.)".&lt;ref name="sp11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be compounded with a grammaticalized noun ''munu'' "thing", e.g. Irabu ''imi-munu'' 'small (thing)'.&lt;ref name="sp10" /&gt;

===Syntax===
Ryukyuan languages are generally [[subject-object-verb|SOV]], [[dependent-marking]], modifier-head, [[nominative-accusative]] languages.&lt;ref name="sp8"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also [[pro-drop]] languages.&lt;ref name="sp8" /&gt; All of these features are shared with the Japanese language.&lt;ref name="sp8" /&gt;

In many Ryukyuan languages, the nominative and genitive are marked identically, a system also found, for example, in [[Austronesian languages]].&lt;ref name="sp8" /&gt; However, Ryukyuan has the unusual feature that these markers vary based on an [[animacy hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="sp9"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically there are two markers of the form ''=ga'' and ''=nu'', which are distinguished based on animacy and definiteness.&lt;ref name="sp9" /&gt; In Yuwan Amami, for instance, the nominative is marked with ''=ga''/''=nu'' and the genitive by ''=ga''/''=nu''/''=Ø'' based on the following hierarchy:&lt;ref name="sp9" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ Yuwan Amami nominative marker
! human pronouns !! demonstratives !! elder kinship terms !! other nouns
|-
| colspan="3" | ''=ga''
| ''=nu''
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ Yuwan Amami genitive marker
! human pronouns, adnominal !! demonstratives !! human names !! elder kinship terms !! other nouns
|-
| colspan="2" | ''=ga''
| colspan="2" | ''=Ø''
| ''=nu''
|}

In the Miyako varieties, the object in a dependent clause of clause-chaining constructions has a special marker, homophonous to a topic marker.&lt;ref name="sp9" /&gt; This might even be interpreted as another function of the topic marker.&lt;ref name="sp9" /&gt;

Hateruma Yaeyama stands out in that it is a [[zero-marking language]], where word order rather than case marking is important:&lt;ref name="sp8" /&gt;
{| style="margin-left:3em !important"
| ''pïtu=Ø'' || ''budur-ja-ta-n''
|-
| style="padding-right:0.5em" | person={{smallcaps|core}} || dance-{{smallcaps|prf-past-rls}}
|-
| colspan="2" | "People danced."
|}
{| style="margin-left:3em !important; width:auto"
| ''aboa=Ø'' || ''ija=Ø'' || ''mir-i'' || ''bir-ja-ta-n''
|-
| style="padding-right:0.5em" | mother={{smallcaps|ore}} || style="padding-right:0.5em" | father={{smallcaps|core}} || style="padding-right:0.5em" | look={{smallcaps|med}} || {{smallcaps|prog-prf-past-rls}}
|-
| colspan="4" | "(My) mother was looking at (my) father."
|}

The Ryukyuan languages mark both [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] grammatically.&lt;ref name="sp11" /&gt; The typical form of the topic marker is ''=(j)a'', or in Southern Ryukyuan ''=ba''; the typical focus marker is ''=du''.&lt;ref name="sp11" /&gt; In some Ryukyuan languages there are many focus markers with different functions; for instance, Irabu has ''=du'' in declarative clauses, ''=ru'' in yes-no interrogative clauses, and ''=ga'' in wh-interrogative clauses.&lt;ref name="sp11" /&gt; The focus markers trigger a special verbal inflection—this typologically unusual focus construction, known as ''kakari-musubi'', was also found in [[Old Japanese]], but has been lost in Modern Japanese.&lt;ref name="sp11" /&gt;

Examples from Yuwan Amami:&lt;ref name="sp75"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| style="margin-left:3em !important"
| ''kurɨ=ba=du'' || ''jum-ju-i''
|-
| style="padding-right:0.5em" | this={{smallcaps|acc-foc}} || style="padding-right:0.5em" | read={{smallcaps|ipfv-npst}}
|-
| colspan="2" | "(I) read this."
|}
{| style="margin-left:3em !important"
| style="padding-right:0.5em" | ''uroo'' || style="padding-right:0.5em" | ''kun'' || style="padding-right:0.5em" | ''hon=ba=du'' || ''jum-jur-ui?''
|-

|-
| colspan="4" | "Will you read this book?" (yes-no question)
|}
{| style="margin-left:3em !important"
| ''uroo'' || ''nuu=ba=ga'' || ''jum-jur-u?''
|-

|-
| colspan="3" | "What will you read?" (wh-question)
|}

While in many Japonic languages this special inflection is often identical to the verbal inflection in relative clauses, in Yuwan Amami is different (the relative inflection is ''-n/-tan'').&lt;ref name="sp75" /&gt; There is some variation among the Ryukyuan languages as to the form of kakari-musubi—for example, in Irabu Miyako a focus marker blocks a specific verb form, rather than triggering a special inflection.&lt;ref name="sp12"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shimoji|Pellard|2010|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liuktoi_Hakka.svg|right|thumb|200px|Liudui in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, the area where Southern Sixian is spoken]]
The '''Sixian dialect''', also known as the '''Sixian accent''' ({{zh|t=四縣腔|s=四县腔|first=t}}; Sixian [[Hakka Romanization System]]: xi ien kiongˊ / xi ian kiongˊ;&lt;ref name="縣的南北差"&gt;{{lang|zh|縣}} is pronounced as ien (PFS: yen) in Northern Sixian and as ian (PFS: yan) in Southern Sixian.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]]: Si-yen-khiông / Si-yan-khiông&lt;ref name="縣的南北差"/&gt;), is a dialect of Hakka used by [[Taiwan]]ese [[Hakkas]], and it is the most spoken dialect of [[Hakka dialects in Taiwan|Taiwanese Hakka]], being used in Hakka broadcasting in many public occasions. The Sixian dialect is generally spoken in northern and southern Taiwan, with main representative regions being [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]] and [[Miaoli]] in the north, as well as the Liudui Region in [[Kaohsiung]] and [[Pingtung County|Pingtung]] in the south.

Taiwanese Hakka is often called ''Si Hai Yong Le Da Ping An'' ({{zh|t=四海永樂大平安|s=四海永乐大平安|p=Sì Hǎi Yǒng Lè Dà Píng Ān|labels=no|first=t}}), referring to the Sixian ({{zh|t=四縣|s=四县|labels=no|first=t}}), [[Hailu dialect|Hailu]] ({{zh|t=海陸|s=海陆|labels=no|first=t}}), [[Yongding dialect|Yongding]] ({{zh|c=永定|labels=no}}), [[Changle dialect (Hakka)|Changle]] ({{zh|t=長樂|s=长乐|labels=no|first=t}}), [[Dabu dialect|Dabu]] ({{zh|c=大埔|labels=no}}), [[Raoping dialect|Raoping]] ({{zh|t=饒平|s=饶平|labels=no|first=t}}) and Zhao'an ({{zh|t=詔安|s=诏安|labels=no|first=t}}) dialects. Among these, the Sixian and Changle dialects originate in Jiaying Prefecture, Guangdong, established in 1733 during the Qing Dynasty under the rule of Yongzheng Emperor. Historically, the Jiaying Prefecture governed five counties. The Sixian dialect comes from the four counties of Chengxiang (now [[Meixian District|Meixian]]), Zhengping (now [[Jiaoling County|Jiaoling]]), [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]] and [[Pingyuan County, Guangdong|Pingyuan]], giving it the name Sixian (four counties); the Changle dialect originates in its [[eponym]], the county of Changle (now [[Wuhua County|Wuhua]]). Currently, speakers of the Yongding and Changle dialects have basically left their own families, so only the Sixian, Hailu, Dabu, Raoping and Zhao'an dialects remain in use in Taiwan. In Taiwan, the only widely used Hakka dialects are Sixian and Hailu.

The Sixian dialect of Taiwan is slightly different from the [[Meixian dialect]] of mainland China since the majority of immigrants from Jiaying Prefecture are from Zhenping County, which is present-day Jiaoling County, so the Sixian dialect is closer to the Jiaoling dialect of mainland China. There are also differences in vocabulary and phonology between the Sixian dialect spoken in northern Taiwan (called Northern Sixian or Miaoli dialect) and in Liudui of southern Taiwan (called Southern Sixian).&lt;ref&gt;For vocabulary differences, see {{Cite web|url=http://hakkatextbook.moe.edu.tw/xiien/no2/teacher_02_1L.pdf|title=部編版客家語分級教材　第二冊教師手冊（四縣腔）|date=December 2011|publisher=Ministry of Education, ROC|isbn=9789860286601|pages=6, 16, 22, 31, etc.|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite web|url=http://ws.moe.edu.tw/Download.ashx?u=C099358C81D4876C9D87E4835F9287C8E804826AA0BBAC116FDDD09213D47224C65D7C4B9E7E96854E511221BDA745F75EC872EF3E39AD9E&amp;n=7943FD1CFE79AA2AA97DB40E60641199FD1A8116E2843D28&amp;icon=..pdf|title=客家語拼音方案使用手冊|date=November 2012|publisher=Ministry of Education, ROC|pages=3, 5–6|accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the differences between the two varieties of Sixian, the recitation contests in the National Language Competition separate the contest into the two accents of (Northern) Sixian and Southern Sixian. Alternatively, Sixian may include Xingning and Changle, but because these two counties were formerly a part of Huizhou ''[[Fu (country subdivision)|fu]]'', they may be closer to the Hailu dialect.

=== Rhymes ===
According to the ''Handbook for Using the Hakka Romanization System'' ({{zh|t=《客家語拼音方案使用手冊》|s=《客家语拼音方案使用手册》|labels=no|first=t}}) published by the Taiwanese Ministry of Education, the rhymes can be split into three categories: yin rhymes ({{zh|t=陰聲韻|s=阴声韵|labels=no|first=t}}), yang rhymes ({{zh|t=陽聲韻|s=阳声韵|labels=no|first=t}}), and checked rhymes ({{zh|t=入聲韻|s=入声韵|labels=no|first=t}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ws.moe.edu.tw/Download.ashx?u=C099358C81D4876C9D87E4835F9287C8E804826AA0BBAC116FDDD09213D47224C65D7C4B9E7E96854E511221BDA745F75EC872EF3E39AD9E&amp;n=7943FD1CFE79AA2AA97DB40E60641199FD1A8116E2843D28&amp;icon=..pdf|title=客家語拼音方案使用手冊|date=November 2012|publisher=教育部|accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tone sandhi ====
In compounds, if a dark-level tone is followed by a dark-level, light-entering or departing tone, the dark-level tone (24) changes to the light-level tone (11).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3w.naer.edu.tw/education/linkpage/doc/B6.pdf|title=部編版客家語分級教材　第六冊學生用書（南四縣腔）|date=December 2012|publisher=Ministry of Education, ROC|pages=III|accessdate=2013-09-15}}; {{Cite web|url=http://hakkatextbook.moe.edu.tw/xiien/no2/teacher_02_1L.pdf|title=部編版客家語分級教材　第二冊教師手冊（四縣腔）|date=December 2011|publisher=Ministry of Education, ROC|isbn=9789860286601|pages=VI|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Southern Sixian, if a light-level tone (11) is not in the end of a compound, it is changed to the dark-level tone (33 in Meinong).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=臺灣客家語音導論|date=January 2004|isbn=9571134759|pages=123–124|author=鍾榮富}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dalukuan and Guangfu Village accents, there are seven tone sandhi rules: the "low" dark-level and light-level tones mostly become a mid tone (33) or a high rising tone (35); thus, the tones of these two areas sound higher than the other areas in Liudui.

== Related Hakka dialects ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
In China, the [[Dabu County|Dabu]] and [[Fengshun]] Counties originally belonging to the Chaozhou ''fu'' have been combined with the former Jiaying Prefecture, establishing [[Meizhou]]. Historically, other than the Sixian and Changle dialects, the Dabu and Fengshun dialects were also brought to Taiwan from areas presently governed by Meizhou in China. The Fengshun dialect mainly originates in [[Fengshun]] and [[Jieyang]] Counties. However, in Taiwan, speakers of the Dabu and Fengshun dialects are still traditionally considered to be Chaozhou Hakkas. Other than the Dabu and Fengshun dialects, the Raoping dialect is also from Chaozhou, specifically the [[Raoping County|Raoping]] and [[Huilai County|Huilai]] Counties.

In Taiwan, the Sixian dialect is the most spoken dialect spoken by the Hakkas, and following is the Hailu dialect (Sixian Hakka Romanization System: hoiˋ liug kiongˊ). The Hailu dialect originates in Huizhou ''fu'' (present-day [[Huizhou]] and [[Shanwei]]) in mainland China, so it is also sometimes called the Huizhou dialect. Since there are many Hakka dialects in Taiwan, when Taiwanese Hakkas interact with each other, there may be influences from other dialects, forming a dialect between the Sixian and Hailu dialects called the Si-Hai dialect (or Hai-Si dialect). The Sihai dialect is not a particular accent, but is just formed because of the interaction between different Hakka groups. Taiwanese Hakka can generally be classified under the Yue-Tai dialects, which are also called the Si-Hai dialects.

The Sixian, Hailu, Changle, Dabu and Raoping dialects all come from Guangdong, China, so Taiwanese Hakkas trace back their origins to Guangdong. Even Hakkas from [[Tingzhou fu|Tingzhou ''fu'']], Fujian, consider themselves to be from Yuedong (Guangdong). Therefore, there is a parallel between "Yuedong Hakkas" and "Minnan Hoklos". Taiwanese Hakka dialects from Fujian include the Yongding, Zhao'an and Tingzhou dialects. The Yongding dialect originates in the [[Yongding District, Longyan|Yongding,]] [[Shanghang County|Shanghang]] and [[Wuping County|Wuping]] Counties of Tingzhou ''fu''. Its phonology is close to Yuedong dialects (e.g. Sixian and Dabu dialects). The Tingzhou dialect originates in the [[Changting County|Changting]], [[Ninghua County|Ninghua]], [[Qingliu County|Qingliu]], [[Guihua County|Guihua]] and [[Liancheng County|Liancheng]] Counties of Tingzhou ''fu''. The Zhao'an dialect originates in the [[Zhao'an County|Zhao'an]], [[Pinghe County|Pinghe]], [[Nanjing County|Nanjing]] and [[Hua'an County|Hua'an]] Counties of [[Zhangzhou]] ''fu''. The Zhao'an and Tingzhou dialects are quite different from the Yue-Tai (Si-Hai) dialects, making them unique in Taiwan.

'''Stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility''' is the degree to which a person's [[perception]] of the world is compatible with the required action. S–R compatibility has been described as the "naturalness" of the association between a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] and its response, such as a left-oriented stimulus requiring a response from the left side of the body. A high level of S–R compatibility is typically associated with a shorter [[reaction time]], whereas a low level of S-R compatibility tends to result in a longer reaction time, a phenomenon known as the [[Simon effect]].

The term "stimulus-response compatibility" was first coined by Arnold Small in a presentation in 1951.&lt;ref name = "Schmidt"&gt;Schmidt, R. A. &amp; T. D. Lee. (2011). Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis (5th edition). Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics. (Ch. 3: pp. 57–95) {{ISBN|073604258X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determinants of reaction time ==

=== Visual location ===
S–R compatibility can be seen in the variation in the amount of time taken to respond to a [[visual]] stimulus, given the similarity of the event that prompts the action, and the action itself. For example, a visual stimulus in the left of a person's field of vision is more compatible with a response involving the left hand than with a response involving the right hand.&lt;ref name = "Schmidt" /&gt;

==== Evidence ====
In 1953, [[Paul Fitts]] and C. M. Seeger ran the first experiment conclusively demonstrating that certain responses are more compatible with certain stimuli, during which subjects were alternatively instructed to press buttons on their left and right in response to lights which could appear in either the left or right corner of their field of vision. The study found that subjects took longer when the stimulus and response were incompatible. This was not in and of itself evidence for a relationship between S–R compatibility and reaction time; an alternate hypothesis posited that the delay was simply the result of the sensory information taking longer to reach neural processing centers when hemispheres are crossed. This alternate hypothesis was disproven by a follow-up trial in which Fitts and Seeger had subjects cross their arms, so that the left hand would press the right button and vice versa; the difference between reaction times of subjects in the standard and crossed-arms trials was [[statistical significance|statistically insignificant]], even though the neural signal traveled a greater distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitts | first1 = Paul M. | last2 = Seeger | first2 = Charles | year = 1953 | title = S-R compatibility: Spatial characteristics of stimulus and response codes | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 199–210 | doi=10.1037/h0062827| pmid = 13084867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Refinements and improvements ====
The reverse scenario was tested in a 1954 experiment by Richard L. Deninger and Paul Fitts, in which it was demonstrated that subjects responded more quickly when the stimulus and response were compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deininger | first1 = Richard L. | last2 = Fitts | first2 = Paul M. | year = 1954 | title = S-R Compatibility: Correspondence Among Paired Elements Within Stimulus And Response Codes | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 6| pages = 483–492 | doi = 10.1037/h0054967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid evidence that S-R compatibility impacted the response planning phase was not found until 1995, when Bernhard Hommel demonstrated that modifying stimuli in ways unrelated to S-R compatibility, such as the size of the objects on the computer screen, did not increase reaction time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hommel, Bernhard|title=Stimulus-Response Compatibility And The Simon Effect: Toward An Empirical Clarification|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance |date=1995|pages=764–775|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=80fa73f4-877d-4bdc-9d13-24a6950043da%40sessionmgr14&amp;hid=28&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=1995-42581-001|accessdate=2015-02-25|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.4.764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditory location ===
This phenomenon also applies to [[auditory system|auditory]] stimuli. For example, hearing a tone in one ear prepares that side of the body to respond, and the reaction time will be longer if one is required to perform an action with the opposite side of the body as the side where the tone was heard, or vice versa.&lt;ref name = "Roswarski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roswarski | first1 = T. E. | last2 = Proctor | first2 = Robert | year = 2000 | title = Auditory stimulus-response compatibility: is there a contribution of stimulus-hand correspondence? | url = | journal = Psychol. Res. | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 148–58 | pmid = 10946588 | doi=10.1007/pl00008173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evidence ====
In 2000, T. E. Roswarski and Robert Proctor conducted a variation of the original Fitts and Seeger experiment involving auditory tones in each ear instead of lights. The experiment showed that the reaction time for auditory signals is also influenced by S-R compatibility.&lt;ref name = "Roswarski" /&gt;

=== Motion ===
Another determinant of S-R compatibility is the destination of a moving stimulus. For example, an object moving towards the right hand is more compatible with a right-hand response than an object moving towards the left hand, even if the object is closer to the left hand when the stimulus is perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, R. W. &amp; Kim-Phuong L. Vu. "Stimulus-Response Compatibility Principles: Data, Theory, and Application." 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evidence ====
An experiment by Claire Michaels in 1988 demonstrated the role of motion in determining S–R compatibility. In this experiment, subjects were presented with a computer display with their hands extended, and a square on the screen would appear at some random location and move towards either the right or left hand. Choice reaction time was faster when subjects responded with the same hand the square was moving towards. This experiment showed that reaction time was affected more by the destination of the square than by its current location relative to the hand by showing that reaction time was even shorter when the square started in the middle of the screen than when it was close to the destination hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michaels | first1 = Claire F | year = 1988 | title = S-R compatibility between response position and destination of apparent motion: Evidence of the detection of affordances | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 231–240 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.14.2.231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affordance ===
Also important to S–R compatibility is the type of stimulus; familiar objects tend to invite specific responses. As one example, if an object is perceived as more easily (or more typically) manipulable with one hand than the other, any response requiring use of the other hand will tend to have a long reaction time.&lt;ref name = "Tucker"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tucker, Mike|author2=Rob Ellis|date=1998|title=On the Relations Between Seen Objects and Components of Potential Actions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|pages=830–846|url=http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/research/mtucker/tuckerellis1998.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-02-25|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.24.3.830|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evidence ====
In 1998, Mike Tucker and Rob Ellis conducted an experiment at the [[University of Plymouth]] which expanded the concept of S–R compatibility to higher-order cognition. In their experiment, subjects were given two buttons, one on their left and one on their right, and shown a series of pictures of familiar objects like frying pans and teacups. For each image, they were asked to press the left button if the object in the image was upright and the right button if the object was inverted. However, the objects also varied in their rotation, such that the handles faced either left or right. The experiment revealed that seeing the handle pointing in one direction primed subjects to reach with the corresponding hand, which caused discrepancies in S-R compatibility that affected reaction time; for example, a subject seeing an inverted teapot with a handle pointing left took longer to press the button on the right than a subject who saw the same teapot pointing right.&lt;ref name = "Tucker" /&gt;

=== Expectations ===
Prior knowledge and stereotyping plays a role in S–R compatibility. If a required response is inconsistent with a person's stereotyped knowledge of a stimulus and its "typical" reactions, even if the person is aware of the necessary response in the new situation, compatibility will be low. For example, light switches in the United Kingdom are "on" when toggled down, but light switches in the United States are "on" when toggled up; a native of one country visiting the other will demonstrate low S-R compatibility when turning the lights on or off. As another example, red lights are universally associated with "stop" and green with "go", and a reversed configuration will result in a longer reaction time.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, R. W. &amp; T. G. Reeve. "Stimulus-Response Compatibility: An Integrated Perspective." 1990, Ch. 1, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
S–R compatibility is an important consideration in the field of [[human-computer interaction]], and in [[software engineering]]. Programs are easier and more intuitive to use when the input of the user and the output of the program are S–R-compatible. This would also be an important consideration in the physical design of objects...for instance, an electrical appliance with an on/off switch will be most intuitive if it is designed to conform to cultural expectations.

Additionally, principles of S–R compatibility are important considerations for [[psychology]] researchers; experiments may need to be controlled for the phenomenon. For example, [[behavioral neuroscience]] researchers should make sure that a task does not inadvertently vary along dimensions of S–R compatibility.

This article covers the mechanism by which the French throne passed from the establishment of the Frankish Kingdom in 486 to the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870.

==Merovingian dynasty==
[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|300px|Austrasia, homeland of the Franks (darkest green), and subsequent conquests (other shades of green).]]
The [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] were a [[Salian Franks|Salian Frankish]] dynasty that came to rule the [[Franks]] in a region (known as Francia in Latin) largely corresponding to ancient [[Gaul]] from the middle of the 5th century.

[[Clovis I]] was the first Germanic ruler to convert to [[Roman Catholicism]]. The Franks began to adopt [[Christianity]] following the baptism of Clovis, an event that inaugurated the alliance between the Frankish kingdom and the Roman Catholic Church. Even so, the Merovingian kings were largely beyond the control of the [[Pope]]. Because they were able to worship with their Catholic neighbors, the newly-Christianized Franks found much easier acceptance from the local Gallo-Roman population than did the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Visigoths]], [[Vandals]] or [[Burgundians]]. The Merovingians thus built what eventually proved the most stable of the successor-kingdoms in the west.

Following Frankish custom, the kingdom was partitioned among Clovis' four sons, and over the next century this tradition of partition continued. Even when several Merovingian kings simultaneously ruled their own realms, the kingdom — not unlike the late [[Roman Empire]] — was conceived of as a single entity. Externally, the kingdom, even when divided under different kings, maintained unity and conquered Burgundy in 534. After the fall of the [[Ostrogoths]], the Franks also conquered [[Provence]]. Internally, the kingdom was divided among Clovis' sons and later among his grandsons which frequently saw war between the different kings, who allied among themselves and against one another. The death of one king created conflict between the surviving brothers and the deceased's sons, with differing outcomes. Due to frequent warfare, the kingdom was occasionally united under one king. Although this prevented the kingdom from being fragmented into numerous parts, this practice weakened royal power, for they had to make concessions to the nobility to procure their support in war.

In each Frankish kingdom the [[Mayor of the Palace]] served as the chief officer of state. From about the turn of the eighth century, the [[Austrasia]]n Mayors tended to wield the real power in the kingdom, laying the foundation for a new dynasty.

==Carolingian dynasty==
The Carolingians consolidated their power in the late seventh century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and ''dux et princeps Francorum'' hereditary and becoming the ''de facto'' rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne.

To legalize the power already being exercised by the mayors of the palace, Pepin requested and received from the pope a decision that whoever exercised the actual power in the kingdom should be the legal ruler. After this decision the throne was declared vacant. Childeric III was deposed and confined to a monastery.

According to ancient custom, Pepin was then elected King of the Franks by an assembly of Frankish nobles, with a large portion of his army on hand (in case the nobility inclined not to honor the Papal bull). Although such elections happened infrequently, a general rule in Germanic law stated that the king relied on the support of his leading men. These men reserved the right to choose a new leader if they felt that the old one could not lead them in profitable battle. While in later France the kingdom became hereditary, the kings of the later Holy Roman Empire proved unable to abolish the elective tradition and continued as elected rulers until the Empire's formal end in 1806. In 754 the pope reaffirmed the election of Pepin by crossing the Alps and personally anointing the new king in the Old Testament manner, as the Chosen of the Lord.

Behind the pope's action lay his need for a powerful protector. In 751 the Lombards had conquered the Exarchate of Ravenna, the center of Byzantine government in Italy, were demanding tribute from the pope, and threatened to besiege Rome. Following Pepin's coronation, the pope secured the new ruler's promise of armed intervention in Italy and his pledge to give the papacy the Exarchate of Ravenna, once it was conquered. In 756 a Frankish army forced the Lombard king to relinquish his conquests, and Pepin officially gave Ravenna to the pope. Known as the "Donation of Pepin," the gift made the pope a temporal ruler over the Papal States, a strip of territory that extended diagonally
across northern Italy.

The greatest Carolingian monarch was Charlemagne, who was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III at Rome in 800. His empire, ostensibly a continuation of the Roman Empire, is referred to historiographically as the Carolingian Empire.

The Carolingians followed the Frankish custom of dividing inheritances among the surviving sons, though the concept of the indivisibility of the Empire was also accepted. The Carolingians had the practice of making their sons (sub-)kings in the various regions (regna) of the Empire, which they would inherit on the death of their father. Though the Carolingian Empire may have several kings, the imperial dignity was accorded only to the oldest son.

Charlemagne had three legitimate sons who survived infancy: [[Charles the Younger, son of Charlemagne|Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]], and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], [[King of Aquitaine]]. In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], [[Provence]], and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. But Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died – Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 – and Louis alone remained to be crowned co-emperor with Charlemagne in 813. Pepin, King of Italy, left behind a son, [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]]. On the death of Charlemagne in 814, Louis inherited the entire Frankish kingdom and all its possessions (the concept of successional representation was not yet well-established). But Bernard was allowed to retain control of Italy, the sub-kingdom of his father.

Following the death of [[Louis the Pious]], the surviving adult Carolingians fought a three-year civil war ending only in the [[Treaty of Verdun]], which divided the empire into three regna while imperial status and a nominal lordship was accorded to Lothair I.

The Carolingians differed markedly from the Merovingians in that they disallowed inheritance to illegitimate offspring, possibly in an effort to prevent infighting among heirs and assure a limit to the division of the realm. In the late ninth century, however, the lack of suitable adults among the Carolingians necessitated the rise of [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], a bastard child of a legitimate Carolingian king.

The Carolingians were displaced in most of the regna of the Empire in 888. They ruled on in [[East Francia]] until 911 and they held the throne of [[West Francia]] intermittently until 987. Though they asserted their prerogative to rule, their hereditary, God-given right, and their usual alliance with the Church, they were unable to stem the principle of electoral monarchy and their propagandism failed them in the long run. Carolingian cadet branches continued to rule in Vermandois and Lower Lorraine after the last king died in 987, but they never sought thrones of principalities and made peace with the new ruling families.

==Capetian dynasty==

===The election of Hugh Capet===
From 977 to 986, [[Hugh Capet]], son of [[Hugh the Great]], Duke of the Franks, allied himself with the German emperors Otto II and Otto III and with Archbishop [[Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims|Adalberon of Reims]] to dominate the Carolingian king, Lothair. By 986, he was king in all but name. After Lothair's son [[Louis V of France|Louis V]] died in May 987, Adalberon and Gerbert of Aurillac convened an assembly of nobles to elect Hugh Capet as their king.

Immediately after his coronation, Hugh began to push for the coronation of his son [[Robert II of France|Robert]]. Hugh's own claimed reason was that he was planning an expedition against the Moorish armies harassing [[Borrel II of Barcelona]], an invasion which never occurred, and that the stability of the country necessitated two kings should he die while on expedition. Ralph Glaber, however, attributes Hugh's request to his old age and inability to control the nobility. Modern scholarship has largely imputed to Hugh the motive of establishing a dynasty against the claims of electoral power on the part of the aristocracy, but this is not the typical view of his contemporaries and even some modern scholars have been less skeptical of Hugh's "plan" to campaign in Spain. Robert was eventually crowned on 25 December 987. A measure of Hugh's success is that when he died in 996, Robert continued to reign without anyone disputing his rights, but during his long reign actual royal power dissipated into the hands of the great territorial magnates.

Thus, the early Capetians made their position ''de facto'' hereditary by associating their eldest sons to the kingship while they still live. By the death of [[Philip I of France|Philip I]], this hereditary feature had become established in custom. Even though Philip refused to have his son crowned during his lifetime, Louis succeeded with little trouble. Yet the association of the eldest son to the kingship continued for two more generations, with [[Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus]] being the last king so crowned.

===The succession in 1031===
Henry I became sole ruler on his father's death in 1031. The succession, however, was hotly contested by his younger brother [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy|Robert]]. [[Constance of Arles]], Henry’s mother, preferred to place her younger son, Robert, on the throne. She allied herself with one of the more powerful counts of the time, [[Odo II, Count of Blois]].

This alliance was particularly worrisome for Henry I. Odo II of Blois was a very powerful lord and had warred against Henry’s father throughout his reign; he had enlarged his possessions to the point of encircling the royal demesne. With his alliance, the queen mother and her son Robert managed to expel King Henry from his own demesne lands, forcing him to seek refuge at the court of the duke of Normandy, [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy|Robert]].

King Henry formed an alliance with the powerful duke of Normandy, Robert, by granting him the French Vexin, or the lands between the rivers Epte and Oise. Although this has been debated by modern scholarship, the fact remains that Robert fought alongside the king. Henry also managed to gain the alliance of another powerful count, [[Baldwin IV of Flanders]].

Finally, Henry added [[Emperor Henry II]] to his camp. The emperor had personal issues with Odo II. He wished nothing more than to rid himself of a powerful foe and troublesome neighbour. Odo had invaded Henry’s lands in Burgundy and took many castles and places. Henry and his allies recovered the royal lands that had been lost to the usurpers. The conflict didn’t end there; there was still a chance for Robert to win the throne. Henry, to guarantee his brother’s submission, granted him the vast duchy of Burgundy, which had been added to the royal demesne by Robert II.

Odo found himself in Imperial Burgundy against Henry II. At the battle of Bar-le-Duc, Odo was killed in battle in the year 1037. His lands and properties were divided amongst his sons, ending a threat against the Capetian monarchy.

Henry I had managed to maintain his royal title and dignity, but the price was great. The greatest problem to have arisen from the crisis was the growth in independence of the lords and castellans in the lands of the royal demesne. This had the effect of weakening royal authority even further. Secondly, Henry I lost a great deal of territory and land in suppressing the revolt. The French Vexin was granted away to the duke of Normandy, the duchy of Burgundy, a substantial part of the royal demesne, was given away to Robert, the king’s younger brother.

====The appanage system====
An [[appanage]] is a fief conceded to a younger son or a younger brother of the king. In France, the origin of the appanage can be found either in the old Frankish custom of dividing the inheritance between the sons (a custom which feudalism replaced with the ''partage noble'' in which the eldest son received most of the estates); or in the fact that, at its origins, the Capetian monarchy was relatively weak, and the principle of succession by the eldest son was not secure until the late 12th century.

The first such appanage in the history of the Capetian monarchy was the duchy of Burgundy, which Henry I ceded to his younger brother Robert. Later, Louis VII gave Dreux to his son Robert, in 1137, Philip Augustus gave Domfront and Mortain to his younger son Philip Hurepel (who had also become count of Boulogne by marriage). The last two cases were not under the same kind of duress, but probably reflect the same desire to ward off quarrels.

The original appanages, just like other feudal fiefs, could pass through the female line. As the monarchy became more powerful, they began to restrict the transmission of appanages in the male line, although this did not become standard for some time. The greatest example is the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], which may have been illegally confiscated by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] after the death of the last male duke. After Burgundy, the restriction to male heirs became standard (it is mentioned in an ordinance of Charles V in 1374), but was not formalized until the Edict of Moulins in 1566.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=François Velde |url= http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/apanage.htm |title=Apanages in the French Monarchy |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capetians also conceded fiefs to daughters or sisters in the form of [[dowry]], although this practice became less and less common over time.

===The end of the "[[Capetian Miracle|Capetian miracle]]"===
The [[Salic Law]] (Lex Salica) is a code of law written around the time of [[Clovis I]] for the [[Salian Franks]], in Latin mixed with Germanic words. It deals mainly with monetary compensations (wehrgeld) and also with civil law with respect to men and land. Clause 6 in title 59, which deals with inheritance rules for allodial lands (i.e. family lands not held in benefice) specifies that in "concerning salic lands (terra Salica) no portion or inheritance is for a woman but all the land belongs to members of the male sex who are brothers." A capitulary of Chilperic, ca. 575, expands this by admitting inheritance by a daughter in the absence of sons: "if a man had neighbors but after his death sons and daughters remained, as long as there were sons they should have the land just as the Salic Law provides. And if the sons are already dead then a daughter may receive the land just as the sons would have done had they lived." The monarchy is nowhere mentioned. The Salic Law was reformulated under Charlemagne and still applied in the 9th century, but it slowly disappeared as it became incorporated into local common laws. By the 14th century it was completely forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=François Velde|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/salic.htm |title=The Salic Law |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2005-01-13 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 987 to 1316, every king of France was fortunate to have a son to succeed him. This state of affairs lasted over three hundred years, spanning 13 generations. The Capetians did not even have to deal with the question of successional representation; Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip, eldest son of Louis VI, did not leave behind children of their own when they predeceased their respective fathers. Thus, for such a long time, the succession to the throne was undisputed, so that there was no reason for the peers of the realm to elect a new king. Since 987, the Capetians had always passed the crown to their eldest surviving son, and this birthright became itself a source of unquestionable legitimacy. Louis VIII was the last king acclaimed before the sacred unction (last remnant of the original election). From St. Louis, in 1226, King was acclaimed after the anointing. The voice of the barons was no longer necessary in determining the king.

[[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] was not concerned about the lack of male heirs. He had three sons, well married, and a daughter, [[Isabella of France]], Queen of England by her marriage to Edward II of England. The eldest son, [[Louis X of France|Louis the Quarrelsome]], was King of Navarre and Count of Champagne since the death of his mother. He would, at the death of his father, become King of France and Navarre. His wife, [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] had given him a daughter, but she was young and he could expect her to give him a son later. As for his two other sons, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]] and [[Charles IV of France|Charles, Count of La Marche]], they had married the two daughters of [[Otto IV, Count of Burgundy]] and [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois]], [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]] and [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]]. The king could believe his succession was assured.

Everything collapsed in the spring of 1314, when the affairs of the daughters-in-law of the king were discovered (also known as the [[Tour de Nesle Affair]]). Somewhat neglected by their husbands, the princesses entertained themselves without them. The lover of Margaret of Burgundy was a young knight named Gauthier d'Aunay. Gautier's brother, Philippe d'Aunay, was meanwhile Blanche's lover. Without participating in the adventures of her sister and her sister-in-law, Joan knew everything and kept silent. Royal reaction was brutal. The Aunay brothers were tried and executed summarily; Margaret of Burgundy died of cold in the tower of Chateau Gaillard; Blanche of Burgundy was imprisoned for ten years before ending her days in Maubuisson Abbey, near Pontoise.

The dynastic succession was jeopardized. Margaret's death would allow Louis to remarry. But for the summer of 1314, the future king of France had no wife and no son. He only had a daughter, Joan, who could not be denied the inheritance of Navarre (which allowed female inheritance). This girl was suspected of illegitimacy, because of her mother's adultery with Gauthier d'Aunay, which could be dangerous for the crown of France, given the risk of particularly serious political crises because of suspicions of illegitimacy. Any rebellious vassal, to legitimize his rebellion, could accuse the future queen of bastardy.

Louis X died on June 5, 1316, having just had time to marry again, after a reign of eighteen months, leaving his new wife [[Clementia of Hungary]] pregnant. Philip of Poitiers was at Lyon at the day of the death of his brother. The prince took the regency of both France and Navarre. Joan's claim was supported by her maternal grandmother, [[Agnes of France (1260-1327)|Agnes of France]], and her uncle, [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]]. The arguments they invoked in favor of Joan were in full conformity with feudal law which has always authorized a daughter to succeed to the fief in the absence of sons. Indeed, female succession was a reality in France. Aquitaine had been ruled by a duchess, Eleanor, and countesses had ruled Toulouse and Champagne, as well as in Flanders and Artois. Mahaut, Countess of Artois, belonged to the Court of Peers since 1302. Outside the realm, women have played a role in the devolution of the English crown as well as the crown of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. And [[Joan I of Navarre]] had brought her kingdom of Navarre to her husband Philip the Fair. The idea that a woman would become queen of France was in itself nothing shocking to the barons. Indeed, at the death of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], the kingdom was governed by a woman — [[Blanche of Castile]] — regent in the name of her young son [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]].

The regent made a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy. It was agreed that if Queen Clementia of Hungary gave birth to a son, Philip will maintain the regency until his nephew's majority. In the event that the queen gave birth to a daughter, Philip undertook to renounce Navarre and Champagne in favor of the princesses, if they renounced the crown of France at the age of consent. If not, their claim was to remain, and "right was to be done to them therein"; but Philip would no longer renounce Navarre and Champagne.

On November 15, 1316, Queen Clementia gave birth to a son, [[John I the Posthumous|John the Posthumous]]. Unfortunately, the child lived only five days, and the kingdom remained without a direct heir. By his treaty with the Duke of Burgundy, Philip would only rule the two kingdoms as regent or governor, until Joan reached the age of consent. But Philip had himself crowned at Rheims, on January 9, 1317. Opposed by the Duke of Burgundy, and his own brother, Charles, Count of La Marche, it was thought prudent to shut the gates of the town during the ceremony. Back at Paris, an assembly of prelates, barons and burgesses acknowledged Philip as their sovereign, and asserted that "women do not succeed to the French throne."

The Duke of Burgundy championed his niece's rights. Philip won him over by giving him his daughter, [[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of France]], with the promise of the counties of Artois and Burgundy. The princess Joan, daughter of Louis X, was given an annuity of 15,000 pounds. In return, Joan of Navarre must, at her twelfth year, ratify the treaty which disinherited her, not only of her claim to France, but also of her unquestionable right to Navarre and Champagne.

In 1322, Philip V the Tall died after a reign of six years. He left only daughters. Thus, his younger brother, Charles of La Marche, would become king under the name of Charles IV the Fair. Despite two successive marriages with [[Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France|Marie of Luxembourg]] and [[Jeanne d'Évreux|Joan of Évreux]], Charles the Fair, as his brother Philip the Tall, left only daughters when he died in 1328. Thus, in less than fourteen years, the three sons of Philip the Fair, Louis X the Quarrelsome, Philip V the Tall and Charles IV the Fair, had died.

However, like his brother Louis X, Charles IV the Fair left his wife pregnant. Before dying, the youngest son of Philip the Fair designated as regent his cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]]. He was the eldest son of Charles of Valois, brother of Philip the Fair. A few months later, Queen Joan of Évreux gave birth to a daughter, [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orléans|Blanche]]. Philip of Valois, a grown man and prominent lord, had no trouble being proclaimed king by another assembly of lords and prelates in Vincennes and crowned on May 29, 1328.

===The succession in 1328===

King Charles IV is no longer. He has no male descendants. He is the youngest son of Philip the Fair. The situation in 1328 is unlike that of 1316. In 1316, a king's son was competing with a brother and a younger child. In 1328, Philip of Valois is not the closest in the line, or the more direct, because the last Capetians girls left now have husbands. But the Count of Valois was the closest male relative in the male line, and he is 35 years old. He is the eldest male of the family.

====The contenders for the throne====

* [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]], nephew of Philip IV, cousin of the last three kings, regent of the kingdom by the wish of Charles the Fair. He is in a strong position: he is popular with the nobility and supported by influential figures such as [[Robert III of Artois|Robert of Artois]]. In the male line, he is closest to the scepter.
* [[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of Évreux]], also a nephew of Philip the Fair, (he is the son of Louis of Évreux, younger half-brother of Philip IV and Charles of Valois). Philip of Évreux is also first cousin of the last three kings. Moreover, he had improved his position by marrying the daughter of Louis X, Joan of France.

While the peers of France deliberate which of these two powerful lords will ascend the throne, a letter arrived from across the Channel. In this letter, Isabella claimed the crown of France for her young son Edward III, King of England, and he would be regarded as the third contender:

* [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], King of England and Duke of Guyenne: grandson of Philip IV by his mother, Isabella, sister to Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV. He is the nephew of the last three kings of France. In 1328, he was only 16 years and is still under the tutelage of his mother.

The peers and the lawyers are studying this question: can Isabella of France transmit a right she does not have? Can her son Edward claim the crown of the Capetians?

Isabella of France had a horrible reputation. Nicknamed the "She-Wolf of France", she joined the English nobles against her husband, King Edward II, who was defeated and captured. After putting her husband to death, she displayed herself in public with her lover, the regicide Roger Mortimer. All of this was well known in France. Also, her son Edward III belonged to the [[House of Plantagenet]], a dynasty that had long been in conflict with the French crown.

But Isabella's reasoning was flawed by a detail as it were negligible: if, as a woman, Isabella could transfer that right to the crown although she cannot have it for herself, then by primogeniture the true heir would have been [[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]], a grandson of Philip V of France. Isabella of France may have simply forgotten that her brothers had left daughters of their own.

However, no one thought of nominating one of the daughters of three kings; to do so would recognize the right of women to the throne, and would be de facto considering the reigns of Philip V the Tall and Charles IV the Fair as nothing but a theft at the expense of Joan of France, daughter Louis X the Stubborn. Nor did they nominate the young Philip of Burgundy, the senior living male heir of Philip IV.

The peers did not want to risk giving the throne to a bastard. And, instead of proposing a daughter of Philip V or Charles IV, they decided that women should be excluded from succession to avoid endless squabbles of law.

The famous Salic law will be rediscovered in 1358, to be used in a propaganda fight to defend the rights of Valois against the claims of the English king. Thus, whatever the legal twist, the rights of Edward III were very questionable.

====The king found====
The day after the funeral of Charles IV of France, the great nobles convened. Valois has already taken the title of regent, and used it already, while his cousin was dying. The assembly can only bow to the facts. Having postponed for a moment the question of the legitimacy of excluding women from succession, the will to rule out the English king was stronger. Edward III was thus ousted from the competition, but there remained two claimants to the throne, Philip of Valois and Philip of Évreux.

An agreement was reached to satisfy everyone. Philip of Évreux and his wife Joan received the kingdom of Navarre and other territorial compensation in exchange for which they would recognize Philip of Valois as King of France.

The kingdom of Navarre belonged to the King of France since the marriage of Philip IV and Joan I of Navarre, Countess of Champagne and Brie. Louis X had inherited Navarre from his mother and in 1328 his daughter Joan was finally recognized as Queen of Navarre, despite the suspicions of illegitimacy (the late return was not in the least prevented Philip the Tall and Charles the Fair, who officially called themselves Kings of France and Navarre). In addition, Philip of Valois, not being himself a descendant and heir of the kings of Navarre as were his predecessors, could restore the kingdom of Navarre without regret to Joan, the rightful heir, in exchange for her giving up the crown of France. The kingdom of Navarre will not return to the kings of France until much later, when Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV, accedes to the throne of France, thus establishing the Bourbon dynasty. Thereafter, the French kings will again bear the title "King of France and Navarre."

Soon after, Philip of Valois was proclaimed King of France under the name of Philip VI of France by the peers of the realm. The Valois took power following the direct Capetians.

===The Hundred Years War===

The last royal election dates back to Louis VIII the Lion in 1223. The royal power was weakened and so was the legitimacy of the Count of Valois, for it was not as unassailable as that of his predecessors on the throne. They were expecting their generous gifts, great concessions from the new king. Edward III came to pay tribute to French king, hoping also for some territorial compensation. Philip VI did not understand the danger that threatened him and did nothing to protect himself.

The succession to Charles IV the Fair, decided in favor of Philip VI, was used as a pretext by Edward III to transform what would have been a feudal struggle between himself as Duke of Guyenne against the King of France, to a dynastic struggle between the [[House of Plantagenet]] and the [[House of Valois]] for control of the French throne.

The conflict, known as the [[Hundred Years War]], dragged on for decades. England won several famous military victories, but was unable to fully overcome French resistance. Yet in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Agincourt]], [[Henry V of England]], great-grandson of Edward III, became the heir to the French throne in accordance to the [[Treaty of Troyes]]. He would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], daughter of King [[Charles VI of France]], while Charles' son, the Dauphin [[Charles VII of France|Charles]] was declared illegitimate and disinherited.

Yet Henry V would predecease Charles VI, and it was his infant son who would become "King of France". The Dauphin still had his supporters, and became Charles VII. Eventually, the tide would turn in favor of the French, and the English were driven out. The Treaty of Troyes, which had been ratified by the Estates-General of France, was never repudiated, but the military victory of Charles VII rendered its provisions moot. The Kings of England would thereby continue to call themselves "Kings of England and France", dropping the nominal claim to France only in 1800.

Thus emerged the principle of the unavailability of the crown — no person or body could divert the succession from the lawful heir. The throne would pass by the sheer force of custom, not by the testament of the king, or by any edict, decree, or treaty, or by the generosity of any person. By this principle, the French do not consider Henry VI of England as a legitimate king of France.

===The succession in 1589===
{{main|Henry  IV of France's succession|French Wars of Religion}}

The House of Valois had secured the principle of agnatic succession following their victory in the Hundred Years War. When the senior line of the Valois became extinct, they were followed by the Valois-Orléans line descended from [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]], younger brother of Charles VI, and then, by the Valois-Angoulême line descended from a younger son of Louis I.

[[Henry II of France]] was succeeded by his sons, none of whom would succeed in producing a male heir. The sons of Henry II would be the last heirs male of Philip III of France. Right after them ranked the Bourbons, descended from a younger brother of Philip III.

Thus, with the death of [[François, Duke of Anjou]], younger brother of King [[Henry III of France]], the heir presumptive became the Head of the House of Bourbon, [[Henry IV of France|Henry III, King of Navarre]]. Since Henry was a Protestant, most of Catholic France found him unacceptable. By the [[Treaty of Nemours]], the Catholic League attempted to disinherit the King of Navarre by recognizing [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon]], Navarre's uncle, as heir. Navarre had been excommunicated by [[Pope Sixtus V]].

On his deathbed, Henry III called for Henry of Navarre, and begged him, in the name of Statecraft, to become a Catholic, citing the brutal warfare that would ensue if he refused. In keeping with Salic law, he named Navarre as his heir.

On Henry III's death in 1589, the League proclaimed the Cardinal de Bourbon king, while he was still a prisoner of Henry III in the castle of Chinon. He was recognized as Charles X by the Parliament of Paris on 21 November 1589. With Henry III's death, custody of the Cardinal fell to Navarre (now Henry IV of France), the Cardinal's nephew. When the old Cardinal died in 1590, the League could not agree on a new candidate. The Catholic League had great hopes for [[Charles, Duke of Guise]], whom they considered to elect as king. However, the Duke of Guise declared his support for Henry IV of France in 1594, for which Henry paid him four million livres and made him Governor of Provence. Some supported [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]], the daughter of [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth of France]], eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]]. The prominence of her candidacy hurt the League, which became suspect as agents of the Spanish.

For a time, Henry IV attempted to take his kingdom by conquest. For this, he had to capture Paris, which was defended by the Catholic League and the Spanish. Despite the campaigns between 1590 and 1592, Henry IV was "no closer to capturing Paris". Realizing that Henry III had been right and that there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in resolutely Catholic Paris, Henry agreed to convert, reputedly stating "Paris vaut bien une messe" ("Paris is well worth a Mass"). He was formally received into the Catholic Church in 1593, and was crowned at Chartres  in 1594 as League members maintained control of the Cathedral of Rheims, and, skeptical of Henry's sincerity, continued to oppose him. He was finally received into Paris in March 1594, and 120 League members in the city who refused to submit were banished from the capital. Paris' capitulation encouraged the same of many other towns, while others returned to support the crown after [[Pope Clement VIII]] absolved Henry, revoking his excommunication in return for the publishing of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Decrees]], the restoration of Catholicism in Béarn, and appointing only Catholics to high office.

With the success of Henry IV, the principles of the French succession were kept inviolable. The kingship of Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, as Charles X, was delegitimized, having been contrary to these principles. A new requirement to the French succession was recognized: the King of France must be Catholic. Yet since religion could be changed, it could not be the basis for permanent exclusion from the throne.

===The Bourbons in Spain===
[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], grandson of Henry IV, was the longest-reigning king in European history. Louis XIV had only one son to survive to adulthood, the Dauphin [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Louis]]. The Dauphin, in turn, had three sons: [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]], [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duke of Anjou]], and [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]].

In 1700, [[Charles II of Spain]] died. His heir, in accordance to cognatic primogeniture followed in Spain, would have been the Dauphin Louis. However, since the Dauphin was the heir to the French throne, and the Duke of Burgundy was in turn the Dauphin's heir, Charles II settled his succession on the Duke of Anjou in order to prevent the union of France and Spain.

Most European rulers accepted Philip as King of Spain, though some only reluctantly. Louis XIV confirmed that Philip V retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position. Admittedly, he may only have been hypothesizing a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco-Spanish union. However, Louis also sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands, evicting Dutch garrisons and securing Dutch recognition of Philip V. In 1701, he transferred the [[asiento]] to France, alienating English traders. He also acknowledged [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], James II's son, as king on the latter's death. These actions enraged Britain and the United Provinces. Consequently, with the Emperor and the petty German states, they formed another Grand Alliance, declaring war on France in 1702. French diplomacy, however, secured Bavaria, Portugal and Savoy as Franco-Spanish allies.

Thus, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began. The war, over a decade long, was concluded by the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Utrecht]] (1713) and [[First Congress of Rastatt|Rastatt]] (1714). The allies were bent on removing Philip V from the succession to the French throne; he only agreed to this after the semi-Salic law was successfully enacted in Spain.

However, the fact remained that the Treaty of Utrecht had disregarded the French principles of succession. Indeed, taking advantage of the power vacuum caused by Louis XIV's death in 1715, Philip announced he would claim the French crown if the infant Louis XV died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=François Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/sixteBP-docs.htm#LXV |title=Sixte de Bourbon-Parme: Documents |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2004-12-31 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of the renunciations were not debated in public until the [[French Revolution]], when the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] first addressed this issue in a three-day session beginning on 15 September 1789. After many debates, the Assembly voted on a final text of a statement defining the succession to the Crown. This read: "The crown is hereditary from male to male, by order of primogeniture, with the absolute exclusion of women and their descendants, without prejudging the effect of renunciations". The Spanish Ambassador, the Count of Fernan Nuñez wrote to the Spanish Prime Minister, the Count of Floridablanca, that same date: "All the clergy and the major part of the nobility and also of the Third Estate has pronounced for the resolution favorable to the House of Spain… by 698 votes to 265 the majority had concluded the question in a sense again most advantageous for us...."

In 1791 the French National Assembly drew up a new, written Constitution to which the King gave his assent, and which governed France for the last year of the 18th century monarchy. For the first time it was necessary to define formally, as a matter of statutory constitutional law, the system of succession, and the titles, privileges and prerogatives of the Crown. In debating the succession to the Crown the contemporary understanding of the law of succession was publicly clarified. It rebutted the assertion by some that the claim by the Spanish line is a late construct, made to satisfy the ambitions of princes deprived of other claims. Indeed, it is evident that the issue of the rights of the Spanish line to the French crown remained an important constitutional issue.

When the issue of the rights of the Spanish line arose, the Assembly voted to include a phrase in the article on the succession that implicitly protected their rights. That this was the purpose of the clause seems certain: hence the phrase in Title III, Chapter II, article I: 
:"The Kingship is indivisible, and delegated hereditarily to the reigning dynasty from male to male, by order of primogeniture, with the permanent exclusion of women and their descendants. (Nothing is prejudged on the effect of renunciations in the dynasty actually reigning)."

===The end of a dynasty===
Louis XV had ten legitimate children, but there were only two sons, only one of whom survived to adulthood, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]]. This did not help dispel the concerns about the future of the dynasty; should his male line fail, the succession would be disputed by a possible war of succession between the descendants of Philip V and the [[House of Orléans]] descended from the younger brother of Louis XIV.

The Dauphin Louis predeceased his father but left behind three sons, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis Auguste, Duke of Berry]], [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles Philippe, Count of Artois]]. The Duke of Berry succeeded his grandfather as King Louis XVI.

Louis XVI would be the only French king to be executed, during the [[French Revolution]]. For the first time, the Capetian monarchy had been overthrown. The monarchy would be restored under his younger brother, the Count of Provence, who took the name Louis XVIII in consideration of the dynastic seniority of his nephew, [[Louis XVII of France|Louis]], from 1793-1795 (the child never actually reigned). Louis XVIII died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the Count of Artois, as Charles X.

Compelled by what he felt to be a growing, manipulative radicalism in the elected government, Charles felt that his primary duty was the guarantee of order and happiness in France and its people; not in political bipartisanship and the self-interpreted rights of implacable political enemies. He issued the [[July Ordinances|Four Ordinances of Saint-Cloud]], which was intended to quell the people of France. However, the ordinances had the opposite effect of angering the French citizens. In Paris, a committee of the liberal opposition had drawn up and signed a petition in which, they asked for the ordonnances to be withdrawn; more surprising was their criticism "not of the King, but his ministers" – thereby disproving Charles X's conviction that his liberal opponents were enemies of his dynasty. Charles X considered the ordonnances vital to the safety and dignity of the French throne. Thus, he did not withdraw the ordonnances. This resulted in the [[July Revolution]].

Charles X abdicated in favor of his 10-year-old grandson, [[Henry, Count of Chambord|Henri, Duke of Bordeaux]], (forcing his son [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Louis Antoine]] to renounce his rights along the way) and naming [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe III, Duke of Orléans]] Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, charging him to announce to the popularly elected Chamber of Deputies his desire to have his grandson succeed him. Louis Philippe did not do this, in order to increase his own chances of succession. As a consequence, because the chamber was aware of Louis Philippe's liberal policies and of his popularity with the masses, they proclaimed Louis Philippe, who for eleven days had been acting as the regent for his small cousin, as the new French king, displacing the senior branch of the House of Bourbon.

===The House of Orléans===
The House of Orléans took the throne in defiance of the principles of the Capetian monarchy, and could be viewed as a separate institution altogether.

Upon his accession to the throne, Louis Philippe assumed the title of King of the French – a title already adopted by Louis XVI in the short-lived Constitution of 1791. Linking the monarchy to a people instead of a territory (as the previous designation King of France and of Navarre) was aimed at undercutting the [[legitimist]] claims of Charles X and his family.

By an ordinance he signed on 13 August 1830, the new king defined the manner in which his children, as well as his sister, would continue to bear the surname "d'Orléans" and the arms of Orléans, declared that his eldest son, as Prince Royal (not Dauphin), would bear the title Duke of Orléans, that the younger sons would continue to have their previous titles, and that his sister and daughters would only be styled Princesses of Orléans, not of France.

The government of Louis Philippe grew increasingly conservative over the years. After ruling for 18 years, the 1848 wave of revolutions reached France and overthrew Louis Philippe. The king abdicated in favor of his nine-year-old grandson, [[Philippe, comte de Paris|Philippe, Count of Paris]]. The National Assembly initially planned to accept young Philippe as king, but the strong current of public opinion rejected that. On 26 February, the Second Republic was proclaimed.

==House of Bonaparte==
{{main|Line of succession to the French throne (Bonapartist)}}

===First French Empire===
[[Napoléon Bonaparte]] (1769-1821) came to power by a military coup on Nov 10, 1799. The regime he put in place was headed by three Consuls, and he was the First Consul. He became Consul for Life in 1802, and then transformed the regime into a hereditary monarchy in 1804. The rules of succession as set down in the constitution are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=François Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/nap_succ.htm |title=Napoleonic Succession Laws |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2000-09-15 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The legitimate heir to the imperial throne should pass firstly to Napoleon I's own legitimate male descendants through the male line, excluding women and their issue. Napoléon could adopt a son or grandson (aged 18 or more) of one of his brothers, if he had no children of his own. No other adoptions were allowed.
*In default of Napoléon's line (of the body or adoptive), the succession calls [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and his line, followed by [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]] and his line. His other brothers, [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], and their descendants, were omitted from the succession, even though Lucien was older than Louis, because they had either politically opposed the emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. 
*Princes were forbidden from marrying without prior consent, on pain of losing their succession rights and excluding their issue; but if the marriage ended without children, the prince would recover his rights. 
* Upon extinction of the legitimate natural and adopted males, [[patrilineality|agnatic]] descendants of Napoleon I, and those of two of his brothers, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]], the Grand Dignitaries of the Empire (non-dynastic princely and ducal houses) would submit a proposal to the Senate, to be approved by referendum, choosing a new emperor.

At the time the law of succession was decreed Napoleon I had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine of Beauharnais]]. His eventual response was an unacceptable one, in the eyes of Catholic France, of engineering a dubious annulment, without papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine and undertaking a second marriage to the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Mary Louise of Austria]], with whom he had one son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon, King of Rome]], also as Napoleon II and the Duke of Reichstadt. He was not married and had no children, thus leaving no further direct descendants of Napoleon I.

The law was proclaimed on May 20, 1804. No contradiction was seen between France being a Republic and it being governed by an Emperor. Indeed, until 1809, French coins bore "République Française" on one side and "Napoléon Empereur" on the other, pursuant to a decree of June 26, 1804; the legend on the reverse was replaced by "Empire français" by decree of October 22, 1808). This was a return to the Roman use of the word Emperor (Augustus was officially only the First Citizen, rather than monarch, of the Roman Republic).

===Second French Empire===
In 1852, [[Napoleon III]], having restored the Bonapartes to power in France, enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim first went to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line.

If his own direct line died out, the new decree allowed the claim to pass to [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's youngest brother who had previously been excluded, and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of Württemberg]] in the male line. His descendants by his original marriage to the American [[commoner]] [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved, were excluded.

The only remaining Bonapartist claimants since 1879, and today, have been descendants of Jérôme Bonaparte and Catherina of Württemberg in the male line.

==France Post-Monarchy==

===Failure of the Restoration===
In 1870, royalists became the majority in the National Assembly. There were two claimants to the French royal legacy: [[Henri, Count of Chambord|Henri d'Artois, Count of Chambord]], and [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Philippe d'Orléans, Count of Paris]]. The former were supported by the Legitimists, supporters of the elder line of the Bourbons, and the Orléanists, liberal constitutional monarchists that had supported [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] and his line. Since the Count of Chambord was childless, and was expected to remain so, the Orléans line agreed to support the Count of Chambord.

Raised however, by his grandfather [[Charles X of France]], as if the Revolution never happened, the Count of Chambord insisted that he would only take the crown if France would abandon the tricolour flag in favor of the white fleur de lys flag. He refused to compromise this point, which upset the restoration of the monarchy. The Orléans did not oppose him, and did not make an immediate claim to the throne while the Count of Chambord lived. The Count of Chambord lived, however, longer than expected. At the time of his death, the impetus behind the monarchical restoration had been lost.

Thus, after the death of the Count of Chambord, the Orléans line had two distinct claims to the throne of France{{According to whom|date=October 2015}}: the right derived from Orléanist theory, as heirs of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]]; and the right derived from Legitimist theory, as heirs of Hugh Capet.

===Legitimists and Orléanists===
{{Main|French dynastic disputes}}

The death of the Count of Chambord split the Legitimists in two camps{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Most acknowledged the House of Orléans as the new royal house{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Yet a party, with a hatred for that house, recognized the Carlists of Spain, then the eldest descendants of [[Philip V of Spain]]. The Orléanist party derisively called them the [[Blancs d'Espagne]] (Spanish Whites), for having supported a Spanish prince over a French prince. In later times the Orléanist and Legitimist claims of the House of Orléans was merged into the name of Orléanist, as the pro-Spanish party assumed the name of Legitimists.

The unacceptability of the House of Orléans to the Blancs d'Espagne stems from the actions of two ancestors of that house — [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], also known as Philippe Egalite, and his son [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], later King of the French. According to Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century, treason is one case wherein a person of the royal blood could be deprived of his succession to the throne.&lt;ref name = "giesey"&gt;Ralph E. Giesey. The Juristic Basis of Dynastic Right to the French Throne.&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Egalite had voted for the abolition of the monarchy, the guilt of [[Louis XVI of France]], and the death sentence for that unhappy monarch. His son, [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], restored in royal favor following the Bourbon Restoration, appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom during the final days of the reign of [[Charles X of France]], overthrew the senior line by accepting kingship for himself.&lt;ref name="velde"&gt;{{cite web|author=François Velde |url= http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/succession.htm |title= The Succession to the French throne |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=2005-03-03 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legitimist stand is that the succession to the throne is based on customs and precedents thereafter unalterable. The heir to the throne, according to those customs, is the heir of Louis XIV, who cannot be excluded. The Orléanist stand is that the laws of succession could be altered, and that among those customs and precedents is the requirement that the heir must be French. The heir to the throne, according to them, is the Orléans line, since not one of Philip V's descendants was French when the succession opened in 1883.&lt;ref name="velde" /&gt;

In the Treaty of Utrecht, Philip V of Spain renounced his right of succession to the French throne on the condition that the semi-Salic law of succession should be instituted in Spain. For Legitimists the treaty is void ab initio, since the succession law cannot be altered in this way. Further, assuming arguendo that the treaty is valid, the repeal of semi-Salic law in Spain had broken the condition of the renunciation; the purpose of the treaty — the separation of the crowns of France and Spain — has been served, since the King of Spain is not the heir to France.&lt;ref name="sainty"&gt;{{cite web|author=Guy Stair Sainty|url= http://www.chivalricorders.org/bourbon/france/success/sucprt1.htm |title= The French Succession: The Renunciations of 1712, the Treaties of Utrecht and their Aftermath in International Affairs |publisher=chivalricorders.org |date= |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Orléanists the treaty is a valid alteration to the French law of succession. Further, Louis Philippe was the last official ''First Prince of the Blood'', who were, by tradition, immediate heir to the throne after the royal family itself.

The second point of contention between the Legitimists and the Orléanists is the nationality requirement. For Orléanists, foreign-born heirs forfeit their right of succession to estates in France by the law of aubain. Foreigners include, apart from the usual definition, those Frenchmen who left ''without intent of returning.'' They also cite the opinion of Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Common sense requires that princes of the blood who have become foreigners be excluded from the throne just as the male descendants of princesses. The exclusion of both is in the spirit of the fundamental custom, which overlooks the royal blood in princesses only to prevent the scepter from falling in foreign hands.&lt;ref name="velde2"&gt;{{cite web|author=François Velde |url= http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/nationality.htm |title= The Nationality Requirement in the French succession laws |publisher=Heraldica.org |date=1999-07-22 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For this reason, Orléanists also exclude the [[House of Orléans-Braganza|Orléans-Braganza]] (Brazilians) and [[Duke of Galliera#Orléans dukes|Orléans-Galliera]] (Spanish), junior descendants of Louis Philippe, King of the French, from the succession to the French throne.

Legitimists and Orléanists cite numerous examples and counter-examples of foreigners included and excluded in the French line of succession.&lt;ref name="velde2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guy Stair Sainty|url= http://www.chivalricorders.org/bourbon/france/frenlegt.htm |title= The French Legitimist Case |publisher=chivalricorders.org |date= |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no clear precedent on whether foreigners ought to be included or excluded. But in 1573, the Duke of Anjou, the future [[Henry III of France]], who was elected King of Poland, had been assured by letters patent that his rights to the French throne would not lapse, nor those of any children he may have, even though they were to be born outside France. Similar letters patent were issued for [[Philip V of Spain]], but later withdrawn. In these instances, the French court had shown themselves ready to recognize that the Capetian blood right overcame the law of aubain.&lt;ref name="giesey" /&gt; For Orléanists, the function of the letters patent was to preserve the French nationality of Philip V and his descendants, and with those letters patent withdrawn, they ceased to be French.&lt;ref name="velde2" /&gt;

The '''Talpur dynasty''' ({{lang-ur|'''سلسله تالپور'''}}) ({{lang-sd|'''ٽالپردور'''}}) was a dynasty of the [[Talpur]] tribe that conquered and ruled [[Sindh]], and other parts of present-day [[Pakistan]], from 1783 to 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = After Independence in 1947 Development in the History and Archiology of  Sindh.htm|url = http://www.panhwar.com/Article162.htm|website = www.panhwar.com|accessdate = 2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talpur army defeated the [[Kalhora Dynasty]] in the [[Battle of Halani]] in 1783 to become rulers of [[Sindh]]. The Talpur dynasty was defeated by the British invaders in 1843 at the [[Battle of Miani]].

'''''The Contender''''' is the [[debut novel]] by [[United States|American]] author and sports journalist [[Robert Lipsyte]]. It was published in 1967.

The book's plot centers on a black seventeen-year-old man named Alfred Brooks, a high school dropout living with Aunt Pearl and her three daughters in Harlem, New York City. He begins training at a boxing club as an alternative to drugs and gang membership. The novel follows Alfred as his friend James is arrested after robbing the grocery store where Alfred works, and his confrontations with Major, the leader of the local gang, who is responsible for James' drug addiction. Alfred, through a series of related events, learns that life is about more than fighting and winning; it is about being a contender.

==Plot synopsis==
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}

==Characters==
* Alfred Brooks is a 17-year-old African American male and the protagonist of the novel. He recently dropped out of high school and appears to be indecisive about the direction of his life. Orphaned at a young age, he lives in Harlem with his Aunt Pearl and his three cousins. In the first few chapters, Alfred appears shy and uncertain about his future. After learning that his best friend James has chosen a destructive path, Alfred decides to join Donatelli's Gym and train as an amateur boxer. Throughout the course of the novel, readers see a timid adolescent transcend into a confident, strong character who appears to have found a purpose in life. By the end of the novel, after having won his first two matches, and putting up a good show in his third match, Mr. Donatelli suggests that Alfred retire from boxing because he lacks the “killer instinct”  needed to be a prize-winning fighter, but suggests that Alfred take his newfound strength and determination and apply it to a new endeavor.  Alfred does retire after one final match which he loses, but in which he earns everyone's respect, including that of his opponent. Before the novel closes, Alfred has evolved into a mature, selfless adolescent who seems destined to apply what he learned from being a disciplined boxer to having a bright future all the while trying to save his best friend from continuing to be self-destructive.
* Aunt Pearl takes in her nephew Alfred after he is orphaned at an early age. She is a devoted, hard working, and loving woman as evidenced by the many sacrifices she makes not only for her own three children, but for Alfred as well. She too has experienced difficulties in life, some of which she divulges to Alfred. Although there are times that her questions seem obtrusive to Alfred, he realizes that she truly has an invested interest in her nephew, and thatalpalpalpy does care about his well-being.
* Major is the antagonist of the novel. He is described as a “devil in disguise”. Major is responsible for leading Alfred’s best friend James down a path of crime, drugs, and alcohol. He lives a life of crime and orchestrated a robbery at the Epsteins' grocery store, Alfred's place of employment. He is the leader of a group that has some other characters in it by the names of Hollis and Sonny. These three team up against Alfred and beat him up in the first chapter.
* James is Alfred's best friend and also a high school dropout. While James only appears minimally, we learn a great deal about him from Alfred's thoughts and what others say about him. He is a weak character, as compared to Alfred. After James robs the grocery store Alfred works at, Epstein's, Alfred finds him hiding from the police in their childhood hiding spot in the park. Alfred convinces James that he needs to take responsibility for his recent criminal behavior by entering rehab and accepting his impending future jail sentence. Alfred tells him that no matter what, he will stay by the side of his “old” friend.
* Mr. Donatelli, affectionately called Donatelli by most of the novel’s characters, is owner and manager of Donatelli’s Gym. He becomes Alfred's savior by hinting at Alfred's potential to become a respected boxer while encouraging his new protégé to make decisions wisely and to act decisively. Although he comes across as harsh, he is a tender, well respected man who has gained respect as a disciplined trainer who cares about the well being of his students both mentally and physically, in and out of the ring.

He won two medals at the [[European Indoor Championships in Athletics|European Indoor Championships]] as well as the bronze medal in the 100 metres at the [[1971 European Championships in Athletics]].

==Biography==
Papageorgopoulos' personal best in 100 metres was 10.22 seconds, achieved in August 1972 in [[Izmir]]. This ranks him twelfth among Greek 100 metre sprinters.&lt;ref name="athletix"&gt;[http://athletix.org/?p=1894 All time best Balkan athletes, men] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115034611/http://athletix.org/?p=1894 |date=2014-01-15 }} - The Athletics Site&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied medicine.

Papageorgopoulos first got involved in politics in 1978 when he was elected City councilor of Thessaloniki. He practiced dentistry until 1981, when he was elected as a member of the [[Greek Parliament]], representing Thessaloniki, for the Conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Papageorgopoulos has been, from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2010, the [[mayor]] of [[List of mayors of Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki]].

==Corruption charges==
In April 2011, he was among 25 people contacted by an investigating magistrate with a probe into alleged embezzlement of 51.4 million euros at the municipality. He was also accused by his successor [[Yiannis Boutaris]] of providing inaccurate financial figures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathimerini]]: ''[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_28/04/2011_388922 Ex-Thessaloniki mayor to face embezzlement probe].'' April 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment for embezzling of 17.9 million euro at the Municipality of Thessaloniki while he was mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=el:Καταδικάστηκε σε ΙΣΟΒΙΑ Ο ΠΑΠΑΓΕΩΡΓΟΠΟΥΛΟΣ για το σκάνδαλο υπεξαίρεσης στον Δήμο Θεσσαλονίκης|url=http://news247.gr/eidiseis/politiki/enoxos_o_papagewrgopoylos_-_anamenetai_h_epivolh_poinhs.2145542.html|publisher=news247.gr|accessdate=2 May 2014|language=el|date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, the sentence was reduced to a maximum of 20 years after an appeals court in Thessaloniki ruled that Papageorgopoulos's crimes amouned to acting as "accessory to the stealing of municipal funds while in office.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thessaloniki Ex-Mayor had his Life Sentence Reduced |url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/07/14/thessaloniki-ex-mayor-had-his-life-sentence-reduced/|accessdate=14 July 2014|agency=Greek Reporter|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vision Ovni''', founded in 1991, is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] national [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] research organisation.

During mid-1991 Vision Ovni started its operations at [[Victoria, Entre Rios]] city. The Argentine press started reporting sightings of strange lights coming from Laguna del Pescado lake. Many people saw this phenomenon, and national TV recorded the phenomena which have not yet been studied in detail by universities or UFO researchers. Press coverage of UFO sightings was high during the 1990s to nowadays.

Small groups existed in several of Argentina's cities but no one resided in Victoria until Vision Ovni was formed. During the 1970s, Argentine army scanned Laguna del Pescado bottom lake in search of strange phenomena. Most were convinced that strange lights resided there.

In 2009 Vision Ovni and many others [[UFO]] researchers formed [[Cefora]], an Argentine organization to study the UFO Phenomena in detail. Silvia Simondini and many others started collecting signs to obtain Argentine UFO declassification archives.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of Vision Ovni are:
#Research and identify reports of UFO phenomena through gathering and investigating sighting accounts, as well as inform the public through Vision Ovni radio.
#Collect, process and study all available information on UFOs in Argentina.
#Strive for the use of scientific principles and methods in its investigation.
#Be open to any and all hypotheses and theories which may represent possible solutions to the UFO enigma, and will not attribute unidentified reports to any particular theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3697">{{for|the Megadeth album|Warchest}}
A '''war chest''' is a metaphor for any collection of [[tool]]s or [[money]] intended to be used in a challenging or dangerous situation.  Historically, it referred to the chest located in the homes or barracks of [[soldier]]s, in which the soldier kept [[Armaments|arms]] and [[armor]].  In the modern era, it more often refers to a collection of [[funding|funds]] (or less occasionally special tools or equipment) intended to allow a person or organization to get through a situation that requires much more readiness or money than usual.

==Etymology==

In arms and armor, a '''war chest''' is a [[Chest (furniture)|container]] for the [[personal weapon]]s and [[Personal armor|protective gear]] of a [[Militia|citizen-soldier]], kept in the household, and is the origin of the term. The term's modern meaning originates with the [[medieval]] practice of having a [[chest (furniture)|chest]], literally, filled with money to open in time of [[war]].

==In politics==
In [[politics]], a war chest is funding obtained from donors well in advance of a campaign, usually accumulated by an incumbent for either re-election or to contest a more advanced office, or provided by a wealthy candidate to their own campaign. The possession of such excess funds may discourage otherwise viable candidates from a primary or general election challenge.

==In business==
In [[business]] a war chest, or '''cash mountain''' is a stash of money set aside to deal with unexpected changes in the business environment, or to use when expansion possibilities arise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ici-eyes-buyups-with-1631bn-war-chest-435693.html ICI eyes buy-ups with £1bn war chest] ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', 9 February 2007, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Today companies can use accumulated cash or rely on quickly raised [[debt]] which costs less to carry when you don't need it. This is not always a reasonable substitute, as the credit available to a company typically drops as a result of the same actions that require the war chest to be opened.

Companies can redistribute their war chests to [[shareholder]]s by issuing larger or special [[dividend]]s, or more commonly through share [[Share repurchase|buyback]] operations.  Companies do this because if actually held in cash, the companies will be earning a low rate of return in the [[money market]]s, whereas they could be using the funds to invest in more profitable projects.  If they continue not to invest the funds, shareholders may sell the company's shares and make it vulnerable to a takeover.  This would place the current management's jobs at risk.

==In professional sports==
In [[Association football]] it refers to the amount of money a manager has been given by a club's chairman, owner or investors to acquire new players, as in the newspaper headline, "[[Jermain Defoe|Defoe]] and [[Wes Brown|Brown]] top [[Kevin Keegan|Keegan]] wishlist as [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Ashley]] grants £25m war chest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-508769/Defoe-Brown-Keegan-wishlist-Ashley-grants-25m-war-chest.html Defoe and Brown top Keegan wishlist as Ashley grants £25m war chest] ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 17 January 2008, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
Similar terms are also referred to as surplus cash, cash reserves, emergency reserves, acquisition funds, [[rainy day fund]]s, or undistributed earnings within different contexts.

'''''Wawasan 2020''''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: واوسن ٢٠٢٠) or '''Vision 2020''' is a [[Malaysia]]n [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] introduced by the current [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Mahathir Mohamad]] during the tabling of the [[Sixth Malaysia Plan]] in 1991. The vision calls for the nation to achieve a self-sufficient industrialised nation by the year 2020, encompasses all aspects of life, from economic prosperity, social well-being, educational worldclass, political stability, as well as psychological balance. To achieve Vision 2020, Mahathir lamented that the nation required an annual growth of 7% (in real terms) over the thirty-year period 1990–2020, so that the economy would be eightfold stronger than its 1990 [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of RM115 billion. This would translate to a GDP of RM920 billion (in 1990 [[Malaysian Ringgit|Ringgit]] terms) in 2020.&lt;ref name="Mahathir's Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&amp;page=1904|title=The Way Forward|author=[[Mahathir Mohamad]]|publisher=Prime Minister’s Office|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=14 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203071129/http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&amp;page=1904|archivedate=3 December 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ibrahim, 2007"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @ Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi.

== Song ==
Wawasan 2020 is also a patriotic song on the same idea sung in [[Malay language|Malay]].

== Revisions to the vision ==
In view of changing global conditions amid the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], Ex Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] had in August 2009, said that there was now a need to redefine and recalibrate the vision in terms of how to achieve it, as well as its timeline. Najib, who said that it was necessary for Malaysia to undertake bold [[economic reform]]s, had tasked the National Economic Advisory Council (NEAC) to carry out a review of the vision. The NEAC is expected to publish its report by end 2009, with a second report on implementation 6 months after that. Najib also said that in order for Malaysia to achieve a developed nation status by 2020, the country has to grow at an annual rate of 8% over the next 10 years. He cited that a lower hypothetical growth of 6% per annum would delay Malaysia's vision to become a [[developed country]] by 10 years to 2030. Malaysia’s GDP growth rate averaged 7.2% per annum in the 1990s, and slowed to 5.4% per annum in the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/plussy2-2/Article/|title=8pc yearly growth vital to achieve developed nation status: Najib|author=Adeline Paul Raj|publisher=Business Times|date=29 August 2009|accessdate=14 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829172714/http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/plussy2-2/Article/|archivedate=29 August 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&amp;sid=aAvHYIgq46lg&amp;FORM=ZZNR8|title=Malaysia Must Expand Faster to Be Developed Nation, Najib Says|author1=Ranjeetha Pakiam|author2=Shamim Adam|publisher=Bloomberg|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=14 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119020236/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aAvHYIgq46lg&amp;FORM=ZZNR8|archivedate=19 November 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/news_lite.php?id=436342|title=Malaysia Must Grow 8 Percent Annually To Achieve Developed Nation Status, Says PM|publisher=Bernama|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=14 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604031958/http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/news_lite.php?id=436342|archivedate=4 June 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/36250-pm-grow-by-8pc-or-malaysia-will-not-achieve-vision-2020|title=PM: Grow by 8pc or Malaysia will not achieve Vision 2020|author=Adip Zalkapli|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=14 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829215304/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/36250-pm-grow-by-8pc-or-malaysia-will-not-achieve-vision-2020|archivedate=29 August 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
